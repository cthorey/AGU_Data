A geospatial data platform called Physical Analytics Information and Services (PAIRS) is developed on top of open source hardware and software stack to manage Terabyte of data. A new data interpolation and re gridding is implemented where any geospatial data layers can be associated with a set of global grid where the grid resolutions is doubling for consecutive layers. Each pixel on the PAIRS grid have an index that is a combination of locations and time stamp. The indexing allow quick access to data sets that are part of a global data layers and allowing to retrieve only the data of interest. PAIRS takes advantages of parallel processing framework (Hadoop) in a cloud environment to digest, curate, and analyze the data sets while being very robust and stable. The data is stored on a distributed no-SQL database (Hbase) across multiple server, data upload and retrieval is parallelized where the original analytics task is broken up is smaller areas/volume, analyzed independently, and then reassembled for the original geographical area.\nThe differentiating aspect of PAIRS is the ability to accelerate model development across large geographical regions and spatial resolution ranging from 0.1 m up to hundreds of kilometer. System performance is benchmarked on real time automated data ingestion and retrieval of Modis and Landsat data layers. The data layers are curated for sensor error, verified for correctness, and analyzed statistically to detect local anomalies. Multi-layer query enable PAIRS to filter different data layers based on specific conditions (e.g analyze flooding risk of a property based on topography, soil ability to hold water, and forecasted precipitation) or retrieve information about locations that share similar weather and vegetation patterns during extreme weather events like heat wave.",

            "abstract": "The EarthCube Test Enterprise Governance Project completed its initial two-year long process to engage the community and test a demonstration governing organization with the goal of facilitating a community-led process on designing and developing a geoscience cyberinfrastructure.\nConclusions are that EarthCube is viable, has engaged a broad spectrum of end-users and contributors, and has begun to foster a sense of urgency around the importance of open and shared data. Levels of trust among participants are growing. At the same time, the active participants in EarthCube represent a very small sub-set of the larger population of geoscientists. Results from Stage I of this project have impacted NSF decisions on the direction of the EarthCube program.\nThe overall tone of EarthCube events has had a constructive, problem-solving orientation. The technical and organizational elements of EarthCube are poised to support a functional infrastructure for the geosciences community. The process for establishing shared technological standards has notable progress but there is a continuing need to expand technological and cultural alignment. Increasing emphasis is being given to the interdependencies among EarthCube funded projects. The newly developed EarthCube Technology Plan highlights important progress in this area by five working groups focusing on: 1. Use cases; 2. Funded project gap analysis; 3. Testbed development; 4. Standards; and 5. Architecture.\nThere is ample justification to continue running a community-led governance framework that facilitates agreement on a system architecture, guides EarthCube activities, and plays an increasing role in making the EarthCube vision of cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences operational. There is widespread community expectation for support of a multiyear EarthCube governing effort to put into practice the science, technical, and organizational plans that have and are continuing to emerge.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - CryoFrac poster_AGU_2015.pdf\nTypical hydraulic fracturing operations involve the use of a large quantity of water, which can be problematic for several reasons including possible formation (permeability) damage, disposal of waste water, and the use of precious local water resource. An alternate reservoir permeability enhancing technology not requiring water is cryogenic fracturing. This method induces controlled fracturing of rock formations by thermal shock and has potentially important applications in the geothermal and hydrocarbon industries. In this process, cryogenic fluid—such as liquid nitrogen—is injected into the subsurface, causing fracturing due to thermal gradients. These fractures may improve the formation permeability relative to that achievable by hydraulic fracturing alone.\nWe conducted combined laboratory visualization and numerical simulations studies of thermal-shock-induced fracture initiation and propagation resulting from liquid nitrogen injection in rock and analog materials. The experiment used transparent soda-lime glass cubes to facilitate real-time visualization of fracture growth and the fracture network geometry. In this contribution, we report the effect of overall temperature difference between cryogenic fluid and solid material on the produced fracture network, by pre-heating the glass cubes to several temperatures and injecting liquid nitrogen. Temperatures are monitored at several points by thermocouple and the fracture evolution is captured visually by camera. The experiment was modeled using a customized, thermoelastic, fracture-capable numerical simulation code based on peridynamics. The performance of the numerical code was validated by the results of the laboratory experiments, and then the code was used to study the different factors affecting a cryogenic fracturing operation, including the evolution of residual stresses and constitutive relationships for material failure.\nIn complex rock such as shale, understanding the process of cryogenic fracturing in the field is difficult, and the involved cost can be very high. The laboratory experiments and the numerical modeling can provide valuable information for understanding the fundamental processes involved with the fracturing operation.",

The influence of rotation on the fluid layers in these bodies plays an important and diverse role, affecting many processes including oceanic and atmospheric circulation at the surface and magnetic field generation occurring in the interior. To better understand these large-scale processes, record players and containers of water are used as analog models to demonstrate the basic interplay between rotation and fluid motions. To contrast between rotating and non-rotating fluid motions, coffee creamer and food coloring are used as fluid tracers to provide a hands-on method of understanding the influence of rotation on the shapes of the planets, weather patterns, and the alignment of magnetic fields with rotational axes. Such simple demonstrations have been successfully employed for children in public outreach events and for adults in graduate level fluid dynamics courses.",

            "abstract": "California is currently in its fourth year of a drought that has caused record-breaking rates of ground-water extraction, fallowed agricultural fields, changes to water-use policy, dangrously low lake levels, and ecological disturbances such as large wildfires and bark-beetle outbreaks. A common and important question is: to what degree can the severity of this drought in California, or of any drought globally, be blamed on human-caused global warming? Here we present the most comprehensive accounting of the natural and anthropogenic contributions to drought variability to date, and we provide an in-depth evaluation of the recent extreme drought in California.\nA suite of climate datasets and multiple representations of atmospheric moisture demand are used to calculate many estimates of the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index, a proxy for near-surface soil moisture, across California from 1901–2014 at high spatial resolution. Based on the ensemble of calculations, California drought conditions were record-breaking in 2014, but probably not record-breaking in 2012–2014, contrary to prior findings. Regionally, the 2012–2014 drought was record-breaking in the agriculturally important southern Central Valley and highly populated coastal areas. Contributions of individual climate variables to recent drought are also examined, including the temperature component associated with anthropogenic warming. Precipitation is the primary driver of drought variability but anthropogenic warming is estimated to have accounted for 8–27% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012–2014 and 5–18% in 2014. Analyses will be updated through 2015 for this presentation. Although natural climate variability has often masked the background effects of warming on drought, the background effect is becoming increasingly detectable and important, particularly by increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts. The dramatic effects of the current drought in California, combined with knowledge that the background warming-driven drought trend will continue to intensify amidst a high degree of natural climate variability, highlight the critical need for a long-term outlook on drought resilience even though wet conditions are likely to soon mitigate the current drought event.",

            "abstract": "Using airborne Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) reflectance measurements of smoke, an empirical relationship between reflectances measured at different sun-satellite geometry is established, in this study. It is observed that reflectance of smoke aerosol at any viewing zenith angle can be computed using a linear combination of reflectance at two viewing zenith angles. One of them should be less than 30° and other must be greater than 60°. We found that the parameters of the linear combination computation follow a third order polynomial function of the viewing geometry.\nSimilar relationships were also established for different relative azimuth angles. Reflectance at any azimuth angle can be written as a linear combination of measurements at two different azimuth angles. One must be in the forward scattering direction and the other in backward scattering, with both close to the principal plane. These relationships allowed us to create an Angular Distribution Model (ADM) for smoke, which can estimate reflectances in any direction based on measurements taken in four view directions.\nThe model was tested by calculating the ADM parameters using CAR data from the SCAR-B campaign, and applying these parameters to different smoke cases at three spectral channels (340nm, 380nm and 470nm). We also tested our modelled smoke ADM formulas with Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) directly computed from the CAR data, based on 340nm and 380nm, which is probably the first study to analyze the complete multi-angular distribution of AAI for smoke aerosols. The RMSE (and mean error) of predicted reflectance for SCAR-B and ARCTAS smoke ADMs were found to be 0.002 (1.5%) and 0.047 (6%), respectively. The accuracy of the ADM formulation is also tested through radiative transfer simulations for a wide variety of situations (varying smoke loading, underlying surface types, etc.).",

            "abstract": "One of the most puzzling glaciological features of the past ice age is the episodic discharge of large volumes of icebergs from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, known as Heinrich events. It has been suggested that Heinrich events are caused by internal instabilities in the ice sheet (e.g. the binge-purge oscillation). A purely ice dynamic cycle, however, is at odds with the fact that every Heinrich event occurs during the cold phase of a DO cycle, implying some regional climate connection. Recent work has pointed to subsurface water warming as a trigger for Heinrich events through increased basal melting of an ice shelf extending across the Hudson Strait and connecting with the Greenland Ice Sheet. Such a large ice shelf, spanning the deepest part of the Labrador Sea, has no modern analog and limited proxy evidence. Here we use a width averaged “flowline” model of the Hudson Strait ice stream to show that Heinrich events can be triggered by ocean forcing of a grounded terminus without the need for an ice shelf. At maximum ice extent, bed topography is depressed and the terminus is more sensitive to a subsurface thermal forcing. Once triggered, the retreat is rapid, and continues until isostatic rebound of the bed causes local sea level to drop sufficiently to arrest retreat. Topography slowly rebounds, decreasing the sensitivity to ocean forcing and the ice stream re-advances at a rate that is an order of magnitude slower than collapse. This simple feedback cycle between a short-lived ocean trigger and slower isostatic adjustment can reproduce the periodicity and timing of observed Heinrich events under a range of glaciological and solid earth parameters. Our results suggest that not only does the solid Earth play an important role in regulating ice sheet stability, but that grounded marine terminating portions of ice sheets may be more sensitive to ocean forcing than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "Soils and sediments account for the largest reservoir of actively-cycling organic carbon. Small changes in the flux of the soil carbon reservoir may affect the concentration of greenhouse gases. A natural mechanism for the protection of organic carbon from decomposition in soil is the formation of organo-mineral associations. We investigated the sorption dynamics between soil humic and fulvic acid and hematite at a five temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C). Our research objectives were to determine the effects of sorption temperature on 1) sorption extent, 2) selectivity in the type of bound organics, and 3) the thermal stability of organo-mineral associations formed at different temperatures. The extent of adsorption of humic acid (determined by batch sorption experiments) was greater than that of fulvic acid for all five temperatures at low initial organic carbon concentrations. We also found the extent of humic acid adsorption to be significantly less with warming for two sets of temperatures (15°C-25°C, 15°C-30°C) at lower initial concentrations. The extent of fulvic acid adsorption was significantly less for three sets of temperatures (15°C-20°C, 15°C-30°C, 25°C-30°C) at higher initial concentrations. An elemental and isotopic analysis was conducted to characterize the bound organics and suggests there may be fractionation of organic components at higher temperatures. The C/N ratios may suggest enhanced sorption of amine-rich components at higher temperatures. We also conducted a thermogravimetric analysis to determine the temperatures at which organic matter decomposes as well as the energy associated with the decomposition process. Our preliminary results suggest organo-mineral associations formed at higher temperatures may possess higher thermal stability. The results of this study are not only important for understanding the response of carbon cycling in soil to climate changes but also for sustainable agriculture practices as organic matter is vital for soil fertility.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen availability is considered to be high in tropical forest, especially in relation to temperate forests. However, there is among tropical forest a significant variability in nutrient concentrations and stocks either in soils as well as in the vegetation. Here we review the nitrogen distribution and availability in more than 60 forest sites encompassing different soil types and precipitation regimes of the two main tropical forests biomes of Brazil: the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. We aimed to determine factors that control nitrogen availability in these forests, using as a proxy of such availability parameters like: foliar and soil nitrogen concentrations, nitrogen stable isotopic composition, and foliar nitrogen:phosphorus ratio. Our main hypothesis is that nitrogen availability will be higher in forest where dry-season precipitation is low and/or weathered old soils prevailed. On the contrary, tropical forests over young soils and/or precipitation is high over the year will have a lower nitrogen availability and will be more phosphorus than nitrogen limited.",

            "abstract": "Accelerated soil erosion is an important element of the global carbon (C) cycle. Attempts to quantify the impact of erosion on C budgets are limited by the inability to systematically represent feedbacks between hydrological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical processes. For this purpose we use tRIBS-ECO (Triangulated Irregular Network-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator-Erosion and Carbon Oxidation), a spatially-explicit model of SOC dynamics built within a coupled physically-based hydro-geomorphic model. This approach accounts for feedbacks between the watershed’s topography, hydrology, and soil erosion and deposition. Lateral removal of topsoil leads to redistribution of SOC across the landscape, and to alteration of depth-dependent biogeochemical properties within diverse soil profiles. In the proposed framework management practices can have a moderating effect on the oxidation and accretion of SOC at altered soil profiles. Eroded SOC can be oxidized upon transport or stored at depositional sites, in effect mitigating oxidation. We apply tRIBS-ECO to the Holcombe’s Branch watershed in the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory, a forest that is recovering from some of the most serious agricultural erosion in North America. We simulate the reforestation of the area from prior to the mid-20th century to present. We use measurements of soil moisture and of biogeochemical characteristics at multiple soil horizons. We find that the episodic representation of soil erosion has an important effect on the dynamics of SOC. Our approach demonstrates the extent to which erosion and sedimentation of terrestrial organic C can act either as a sink or as a source of atmospheric C at watershed scale, and emphasizes how the replacement of eroded C by C sequestration depends on topography, which should be explicitly accounted for in regional and global C budgets.",

            "abstract": "To better understand carbon storage in coastal salt marshes, samples were collected from Piermont Marsh, NY (40 ̊00’ N, 73 ̊55’W) located within the Hudson River Estuary. Porewater from three different vegetation sites was analyzed to compare the quality of the dissolved organic carbon. Sites contained either native or invasive vegetation with variations in live plant root depth. Porewater was taken from 0–3m in 50cm intervals, and sites were dominated either by invasive Phragmites australis, native Eleocharis , or native mixed vegetation (Spartina patens, Scirpus, and Typha angustifolia). Sites dominated by invasive Phragmites australis were found to have lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, lower cDOM absorption values, and more labile organic carbon compounds. The molecular composition of the DOC was determined with Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Labile DOC components were defined as proteins, carbohydrates, and amino sugars while recalcitrant DOC components were defined as lipids, unsaturated hydrocarbons, lignins, tannins, and condensed hydrocarbons. For the Phragmites, Eleocharis, and mixed vegetation sites, average DOC concentrations with depth were found to be 1.71 ± 1.06, 4.64 ± 1.73, and 4.62 ± 3.5 (mM), respectively and cDOM absorption values with depth were found to be 13.22 ± 4.81, 49.42 ± 10.8, and 35.74 ± 17.49 (m-1). Additionally, DOC concentrations increased with depth in the mixed vegetation and Eleocharis sites, but remained relatively constant in the Phragmites site. The percent of labile compounds in the surface samples were found to be 19.02, 14.64, and 14.07% for the Phragmites, Eleocharis, and mixed vegetation sites, respectively. These findings suggest that sites dominated by Phragmites may have more reactive DOC substrates than sites dominated by native vegetation. These results indicate that the carbon storage in marshes invaded by Phragmites would be expected to decrease over time.",

The overall objective has been to obtain field and satellite measurements to examine carbon stocks and track changes in forests across this vast area. In this presentation, we discuss some of the finding from this 25+ year collaboration' i.e., observed climate-driven changes within larch communities in northern Siberia. Field measurements and satellite data, including Terra/MODIS, Landsat, GRACE and QuickBird were used for analysis of forest conditions. The following results will be discussed.\n(1). At the northern limit of larch (Larix gmelinii) range (i.e.,~72°N) tree mortality was observed during the cooling period from the 16th century to the beginning of the 19th century. Post- Little Ice Age (LIA) trees re-establishment followed warming temperatures by the middle of the19th century. The current tree line has recovered to the pre-LIA line location although tree heights and stand densities are comparatively lower. The mean rate of upward migration was found to be 0.35 m yr–1 (with a range of 0.21–0.58).\n(2) The migration of the “dark needle conifers” (DNC: Abies sibirica, Pinus sibirica, Picea obovata) into the southern margin zone of larch dominated forest was documented. Meanwhile, within the traditional DNC range decline and mortality of both Siberian pine and fir were observed and attributed, primarily, due to an increased drought.\n(3) Within Central Siberia larch growth is limited by early summer temperatures and available water from thawing permafrost. Larch tree ring width (TRW) correlated with early summer temperatures and water vapor pressure (r = 0.73 and r = 0.69, respectively), drought (SPEI; r = 0.68–0.82), snow accumulation (r = 0.61), previous year precipitation (r = 0.63) and soil water anomalies (r = 0.79). Larch TRW growth and Gross Primary Productivity increased during recent decades.\n(4) A study along the meridian of ~100° E between (64°… 71°+N) shows mean fire return intervals increased from about 80 years at 64°N, to ~200 years near the Arctic Circle, and ~300 years near the northern range limit of larch stands. Post LIA warming caused approximately a doubling of fire events.",

We present an overview of the eighteen lake carbonate-δ18O records located in the North American Rocky Mountains with a new compilation of modern lake water isotope measurements to characterize their sensitivity to variations in precipitation-δ18O and fractionation effects by evaporation. Comparative analysis of the carbonate-δ18O records that reflect precipitation isotope (δ18O) values (i.e., precipitation “isometers”) indicates a sequence of time-varying in-phase and antiphase patterns between northern and southern regions during the Holocene that provide evidence for a highly non-stationary influence of Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes on the hydroclimate of western North America. We identify a prominent precipitation-δ18O dipole, which was sustained for ~2000 years between ~3.5 and 1.5 ka. The dipole contrasts with divergent earlier Holocene patterns and appears to indicate the onset of linkages between northern and tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics as we know them today. These observations are informed by previous research on North Pacific precipitation-δ18O. Further investigation of short (observational) and long (Holocene) time scale patterns are needed to improve our understanding of the processes that 1) drive regional precipitation-δ18O responses to Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability, and 2) cause varying internal ocean-atmosphere responses to external climate forcing.",

We analyzed interannual and decadal changes in terrestrial CO2 fluxes in the regions using multiple data sets, such as empirically estimated carbon fluxes based on multiple eddy-covariance sites (empirical upscaling; Support Vector Regression with AsiaFlux data), satellite-based vegetation index data, multiple terrestrial carbon cycle models from Asia-MIP (e.g. BEAMS, Biome-BGC, SEIB-DGVM, and VISIT), and atmospheric inverse models (e.g. ACTM, JMA, NICAM-TM) for the past 3 decades (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s).\nFirst, we checked the consistency in interannual variation of net carbon exchange between empirical upscaling and Asia-MIP model for 2001-2011 period, and found these two estimations show overall consistent interannual variation. Second, we analyzed net carbon exchange form Asia-MIP models and atmospheric inversions for the past three decades, and found persistent increases in terrestrial CO2 sink from two estimates. Magnitudes of estimated terrestrial CO2 sinks are also consistent (e.g. Asia-MIP: 0.2 PgC yr-1 in 1980s and 0.3 PgC yr-1 in 2000s and Inversions: 0.2 PgC yr-1 in 1980s and 0.5 PgC/yr in 2000s). We further analyzed the cause of persistent increases in CO2 uptake in the region using Asia-MIP model outputs, and climate changes (both warming and increases in water availability) and CO2 fertilization plays almost equivalent roles in sink increases. In addition, both gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) were increased, but increase in GPP was larger than that in RE.",

There is limited understanding of the factors controlling the delivery and accumulation of E. coli in this reservoir. Understanding the buildup of E. coli, and related microbes, in the foreshore reservoir is important as it can act as a non-point source to surface waters and contribute a significant health risk to beach goers. Possible sources that contribute to high levels of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir include infiltration of lake water through wave runup, direct deposition of fecal sources (e.g. bird droppings), and shallow groundwater flow from inland sources (e.g. septic systems). The accumulation of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir is complex due to the dynamic interactions between the foreshore sand and porewater, and shallow waters. The objective of this study was to quantify the temporal variability of E. coli concentrations in the foreshore sand and porewater at freshwater beaches and to identify the environmental factors (e.g. temperature, rainfall, wind and wave conditions) controlling this variability.\nThe temporal variability in E. coli concentrations in the foreshore reservoir was characterized by collecting samples (surface water, porewater, saturated and unsaturated foreshore sand) approximately once a week at three beaches along on the Great Lakes from May-October 2014 and 2015. These beaches had different sand types ranging from fine to coarse. More frequent sampling was also conducted in July-August 2015 with samples collected daily over a 40 day period at one beach. The data was analyzed to determine the relationships between the E. coli concentrations and environmental variables as well as changes in sand level profiles and groundwater level fluctuations. Insight into how and why E. coli accumulates in the foreshore reservoir is essential to develop effective strategies to reduce E. coli levels at beaches and to enable better prediction of beach water quality.",

            "abstract": "El Niño patterns have been shifting from conventional Eastern Pacific scenarios to Central Pacific. With more cases of warmer ocean water recorded at Niño 3, 3.4 and 4 regions and similar pattern expected in impending warmer climate, we investigate the changes in dimethyl sulfide (DMS) flux as a result of these changing El Niño patterns. For example, our estimates show a drop of about 10 - 30% in DMS flux at regions 1+2 and 3 during 1997-1998 El Niño event and a respective reduction of 50% at region 4 for 1994-1995 Central Pacific El Niño period in comparison to the climatology. While regions just outside of these areas can experience greater DMS flux. Changes in DMS flux may serve as a proxy for flux of sea spray which is also wind driven. Less DMS flux over the equatorial region and increased DMS flux to the north and south could modify heat flux and Hadley cell circulation.\nAtmospheric aerosols are contributors of absorption and reflection of incoming solar radiation. Hence, they are important in regulating the global radiation budget which ultimately determines global temperature. DMS is the source of nearly all of thesulfate aerosol in the remote marine atmosphere.The equatorial Pacific Ocean is an ideal region to illustrate the relationship between surface ocean concentrations, atmospheric abundance andclimate feedbacks of this molecule. The region remains biologically productive throughout the seasons. However, the alterations in sea surface temperatures and wind speed during El Niño events is crucial in determining sea-air flux of DMS. Our results suggest that Central Pacific El Nino might have more influence on sea-air flux of DMS compared to conventional Eastern Pacific El Nino. This may imply changing reflectivity and cloud albedo in a warming climate.",

In this work, we use the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to explore the relationship between gas-phase production of organic nitrates and their subsequent aerosol-phase partitioning for the Southern Oxidants and Aerosol Study (SOAS) 2013 time period.\nCurrent chemical transport models may underestimate the role of particulate organic nitrates (pON), and aerosol parameterizations are generally not connected to later generation gas-phase species. Explicit predictions of pON from gas-phase intermediates is challenging as gas-phase mechanisms need verification. We highlight areas where further information is needed. During the morning and evening transition hours, reactions of monoterpenes with ozone, OH, and nitrate radicals are predicted to contribute to organic nitrate formation. During the night, organic nitrate formation is primarily due to nitrate radicals and RO2+HO2 reactions with high yields of organic nitrates, above what has been observed in many chamber experiments. We find that the CMAQ model overestimates total gas-phase alkyl nitrates, particularly at night, and that uptake to the particle followed by hydrolysis can improve model predictions of both the gas and aerosol phase components.",

We observe (and these areas may be experiencing) unusually high ozone concentrations. We also comment on the historically high ozone areas such as China, Northern India, western Europe, and the western and southern United States and how known phenomena compare to our observations. Many observations confirm known mechanisms of ozone formation and transport, such as the effect of the yearly monsoon cycle in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Others, such as the surprisingly high monthly average concentrations on the Arabian Peninsula and Southern Sahara, deserve more thorough investigation.

Yet, the composition of conversion in the Congo basin remains a major uncertainty, particularly with regards to the scale of drivers of change. Owing to rapid expansion of production globally and longstanding historical production locally in the Congo basin, oil palm offers a lens through which to evaluate local land use decisions across a spectrum of small- to large-scales of production as well as interactions with regional and global supply chains. We examined the effect of global commodity crop expansion on land use change in Southwest Cameroon using a mixed-methods approach to integrate remote sensing, field surveys and socioeconomic data. Southwest Cameroon (2.5 Mha) has a long history of large- and small-scale agriculture, ranging from mixed crop subsistence agriculture to large monocrop plantations of oil palm, cocoa, and rubber. Trends and spatial patterns of forest conversion and agricultural transitions were analyzed from 2000-2015 using satellite imagery. We used economic, demographic and field survey datasets to assess how regional and global market factors and local commodity crop decisions affect land use patterns. Our results show that oil palm is a major commodity crop expanding in this region, and that conversion is occurring primarily through expansion by medium-scale producers and local elites. Results also indicate that global and regional supply chain dynamics influence local land use decision making. This research contributes new information on land use patterns and dynamics in the Congo basin, an understudied region. More specifically, results from this research contribute information on recent trends of oil palm expansion in Cameroon that will be used in national land use planning strategies.",

            "abstract": "Outstanding questions regarding late Cenozoic Colorado Plateau landscape evolution include: (1) the relative roles of isostatic rebound as result Colorado River incision versus longer-term geodynamic processes in driving overall rock uplift of the plateau; and (2) whether incision was triggered by river integration or by a change in deep-seated mantle lithosphere dynamics. A key to answering these questions is to date more precisely the onset of incision to refine previous estimates of between 6 and 10 Ma. We present new low-temperature thermochronologic results from bedrock and deep borehole samples in the northeastern Colorado Plateau to show that rapid river incision began here at 6 Ma (5.93±0.66 Ma) with incision rates increasing from 15-50 m/Myr to 160-200 m/Myr. The onset time is constrained independently by both inverse time-temperature modeling and by the break-in-slope in fission track age-elevation relationships. This new time constraint has several important implications. First, the coincidence in time with 5.97-5.3 Ma integration of the lower Colorado River through the Grand Canyon to the Gulf of California strongly favors downstream river integration triggering carving of the canyonlands of the upper Colorado River system. Second, it implies integration of the entire Colorado River system in less than 2 million years. Third, rock uplift of the plateau driven by the flexural isostatic response to river incision is restricted to just the last 6 Ma, as is associated increased sediment budget. Fourth, incision starting at 6 Ma means that previous estimates of upper Colorado River incision rates based on 10-12 Ma basalt datum levels are too low. This also changes the dependency of measured time interval on incision rate from a non-steady-state negative power-law dependence (exponent of -0.24) to a near steady-state dependence (exponent of 0.07) meaning that long-term upper Colorado river incision rates can provide a reliable proxy for rock uplift rates.",

The software is a physically based model developed by the centre for hydrology, University of Saskatchewan.

These factors have been considered in the parameterization of the model, showing considerable variation in storage time, redistributions by blowing snow, melting intervals, infiltration rates and drainage basin.

            "abstract": "The assumption that the rock record contains details on past climatic and tectonic conditions relies on the fact that these forcings are evident in the sediment flux that feeds a deposit. We use the CHILD landscape evolution model to explore whether step changes in rock uplift rate are recorded in the topography of and sediment flux delivered from a small (64 km2) erosional watershed. We model only the fluvial network using the detachment-limited stream-power equation. We find that the watershed immediately responds to either a change in rock uplift rate, however the signal of the change takes time to propagate through the network. All rock uplift perturbations, regardless of their duration or magnitude, are evident in the morphology of the channels for a period of time. If rock uplift rates continue to change, evidence of past perturbations may be erased from the topography; the time it takes for the landscape to erase previous signals is a function of the response time of the landscape. In contrast, the sediment flux at the outlet of the watershed does not always record every uplift perturbation, and only when rock uplift rates are steady for periods longer than the response time of the watershed does the sediment flux reflect the current rock uplift rate. As a result, the sediment flux at the watershed outlet rarely reflects the current forcing. The response time scales with the size of the source area, so the sediment flux delivered from larger watersheds is even less likely to reflect the current forcing. Our results are generated using the simplest possible fluvial incision model that does not allow for deposition. As such, we illustrate the case that is most likely to directly transmit rock uplift signals into sediment flux signals. This suggests that even if all of the sediment eroded from a small watershed is directly deposited in an adjacent basin, the entire uplift history of the landscape will not be recorded in the rocks.",

The recent measurements (march 2015; NASA) tells us that the present rise of sea level is 64.4 mm. Most recent satellite measurements and tide gauge readings (NASA) tell us that present rate sea level rise is 3.20 mm per year. A recent study says we can expect the oceans to rise between 2.5 and 6.5 feet (0.8 and 2 meters) by 2100. The two main causes of rising seas are thermal expansion and glacier melting which further corresponds to the root cause of sea level rise: Green House effect. For every degree Celsius that global average temperature rises, we can expect 2.3 meters of sea-level rise sometime over the ensuing 2,000 years. The main consequence of Sea level rise is increase in oceanic acidity as it releases the entrapped carbon dioxide in between the glaciers. The problem goes from bad to worse when we take into consideration that one third of the world population lives in a 60 km range from the coast. In the event of a flood, this massive population would have to move away from the coasts. The main objective of research is to find all the most vulnerable areas, to make people aware about the consequences and to take proper measurements to fight with such natural calamities. The rise in sea level would inevitably cause massive migration like never seen before. Over 25% of the world population could disappear if sea levels continues to rise with same or faster rate as present. The oceans, sea life and life of people at coastal areas will get extremely effected unless there are considerable cuts in the carbon dioxide emissions. What we need to do is just to apply all the methods and measurements in our daily life that can help reduce the green house gases emissions. Also we need to plan that how to prevent all these cities in case of such natural hazards.",

Projected impacts of climate change include increases in the magnitude and the frequency of flash floods all around the world. Therefore, it is important to understand the physical processes of flash flooding to enhance our capacity for prediction, prevention, risk management, and recovery. However, understanding these processes is ambitious because of small spatial scale and sudden nature of flash floods, interactions with complex topography and land use, difficulty in defining initial soil moisture conditions, non-linearity of catchment response, and high space-time variability of storm characteristics. Thus, detailed regional case studies are needed, especially with respect to the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. One such flash flood event occurred recently in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado during September 9-15, 2013 causing 10 fatalities and $3B cost in damages. An unexpected persistent and moist weather pattern located over the mountains and produced seven-day extreme rainfall fed by moisture input from the Gulf of Mexico. We used a coupled WRF-WRF-Hydro modeling system to simulate this event for better understanding of the physical process and of the sensitivity of the hydrologic response to storm characteristics, initial soil moisture conditions, and watershed characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The Japan trench fast drilling expedition (JFAST) demonstrated that the fault zone of the Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake at the drill site near the trench was weak during slip. Four different lines of evidence led to this conclusion: (1) the low temperature anomaly on the fault zone, (2) the stability of the borehole indicating low deviatoric stress, (3) the high fraction of scaly clay in the narrow fault zone in the core, and (4) laboratory experiments on recovered fault material showing low friction under undrained conditions. Recent measurements of low temperature from the Wenchuan Fault Zone scientific drilling project suggest that friction may have been low at that site as well. The evidence for low deviatoric stresses during slip favors an asperity model where failure is determined by locally strong spots in a pervasively weak fault. During the 9-month JFAST observatory deployment, a rich array of behavior after the earthquake was revealed including evidence for fluid pulsing through the fault zone in response to local aftershocks. Capturing the healing and relocking of a fault zone is still an open challenge to fault zone drilling.",

Developed as part of the InTeGrate NSF STEP Center the peer-reviewed, publically available materials (\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/104296\n) have been used at several institutions in diverse classroom settings including small laboratory sections, large lecture courses, medium-sized upper division courses and professional development programs for middle and high school teachers. Pre- and post-instruction surveys measured content knowledge and geoscience literacy, self-efficacy in using geologic data to assess hazards and risk, and attitudes towards the value of monitoring plate margins. The activities have overall positive effects on knowledge of geohazard concepts. Views about the value of scientific practice also became more positive: 74% of students indicated they \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that monitoring geologic activity has value to them personally (even if they don’t live on an active plate margin) and 94% indicated that such monitoring is valuable to society. Most became more confident in evaluating geologic hazard and risk (>60% of students self-described increased confidence by one or more Likert levels). Student knowledge of both the types and limits of data in forecasting geological hazards and their effects also improved. However, attitudes toward sustainability and geoscience careers did not change. Learning and attitudinal improvements are true for all classroom types, but the degree of change varies with class size and the amount of time spent on activities. Learning data and instructor feedback suggest that interactive classroom activities that use real-world data to address societally relevant issues increase student learning and enhance students' ability to synthesize scientific information.",

The upscaling of systems exhibiting physical and chemical heterogeneity at the pore-scale poses challenges as classical upscaling approaches, e.g. homogenization, rely on idealized porous media with one single characteristic grain size: this treatment allows one to define a relatively small REV on which averaging is performed and a closure problem numerically solved. In presence of a distribution of grain size, one alternative is to increase the REV size and to perform a one-step upscaling. However, this comes to the detriment of numerical efficiency. To contain computational burden, we instead advocate a two-step sequential upscaling. In particular, we consider a porous medium where larger grains are embedded within a micro-porous matrix. By means of two-level homogenization, we determine the macroscale Advection-Reaction-Dispersion equation (ADRE) and identify the applicability regimes of the final upscaled model for reactive transport through  two-dimensional bi-disperse chemically heterogeneous porous media with reactive grains. The final applicability diagram depends on the P\\'{e}clet number, two Damk\\\"{o}hler numbers and the ratio of spatial scales. Finally, we show the computational saving of the proposed approach relative to classical single-step homogenization and perform extensive numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.",

The roughness both records previous events and poses the boundary conditions for future rupture. Digital, high precision roughness data is now available at the field scale (10’s of centimeters to 10’s of meters) for at least 22 faults and at the lab scale (millimeters to 10’s of centimeters) for a subset of these. We quantify the slip surface roughness by measuring the aspect ratio, which is the average asperity height divided by the profile length. Higher aspect ratios indicate rougher surfaces. From the field studies two major trends have emerged: (1) fault surfaces roughness falls in a restricted range with aspect ratios in the slip parallel direction of 0.07-0.5% for profiles of 1 m length, and (2) faults surfaces are rougher at small scales than large ones. These features can both be interpreted as fingerprints of scale-dependent strength, which sets a limit to the aspect ratio of the surface. The measurements imply that shear strength scales with the observation scale L as L-0.4. The new understanding of the physical controls on roughness allows generalization of the extant measurements to a wide array of faults.",

Understanding how regolith production and transport respond to perturbations in climate and/or tectonic forcing remains a first-order question. At the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO), high resolution LiDAR-derived topographic data and depths to hand auger refusal reveal a systematic asymmetry in hillslope gradient and mobile regolith thickness; both are greater on north-facing hillslopes. Hydrologic and geochemical studies at the SSHO also suggest asymmetric sediment transport, fluid flow, and mineral weathering with respect to hillslope aspect. Here, we combine shallow seismic surveys completed along 4 hillslope transects (2 north-facing and 2-south facing), 2 ridgetops transects, and subsurface observations in boreholes to investigate the role of climate in inducing fracturing and priming the development of the observed asymmetry. Comparisons of shallow p-wave velocities with borehole and pit observations lead us to hypothesize the presence of three distinct layers at SSHO: 1) a deep, high velocity layer that is consistent with unweathered shale bedrock; 2) an intermediate velocity layer that is consistent with fractured and chemically altered bedrock which overlies unaltered bedrock, and 3) a shallow, slow velocity layer that is consistent with mobile material or shallow soil. Shallow p-wave velocity profiles suggest differences in thickness for both the mobile and immobile regolith material with respect to aspect. Patterns of p-wave velocities with depth are consistent with patterns of fracture densities observed in boreholes and with predictive cracking intensity models related to frost action. The models and data are consistent with climate as a primary driver for the development of asymmetry in the subsurface architecture at SSHO.",

A weak-constraint variational data assimilation (WC-VDA) scheme is developed to estimate water and heat fluxes by assimilating sequences of land surface temperature (LST) observations. The commonly used strong-constraint VDA systems adversely affect the accuracy of water and heat flux estimates as they assume the model is perfect. The WC-VDA approach accounts for structural and model errors and generates more accurate results via adding a model error term into the surface energy balance equation. The two key unknown parameters of the WC-VDA system (i.e., CHN, the bulk heat transfer coefficient and EF, evaporative fraction) and the model error term are optimized by minimizing the cost function. The WC-VDA model was tested at two sites with contrasting hydrological and vegetative conditions: the Daman site (a wet site located in an oasis area and covered by seeded corn) and the Huazhaizi site (a dry site located in a desert area and covered by sparse grass) in middle stream of Heihe river basin, northwest China. Compared to the strong-constraint VDA system, the WC-VDA method generates more accurate estimates of water and energy fluxes over the desert and oasis sites with dry and wet conditions.",

Charactering the scattering and attenuation properties and the power spectrum of crustal heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for informing strong ground motion estimates at high frequencies, where scattering and attenuation effects are critical. Determining the relative amount of attenuation caused by scattering and intrinsic absorption has been a long-standing interest of seismologists.\nThe wavetrain following the direct body-wave phases is called the coda and is caused by scattered energy. Many studies have analyzed local-event coda to infer crustal and upper-mantle scattering strength and intrinsic attenuation. Here we describe a comprehensive study of coda behavior in Southern California to resolve scattering and intrinsic attenuation structure. First, we apply an envelope-function stacking method to 287,410 seismograms from 6928 geographically dispersed events of M ≥ 1.8 from 1981–2005. The results are presented as spatial averages as a function of distance, source depth, and frequency. Second, we use a Monte Carlo seismic phonon algorithm to simulate the effects of depth-dependent scattering and intrinsic attenuation, which computes scattering probabilities and scattering angles based on theoretical results for random heterogeneity models. This method has the advantage of including both P- and S-wave scattering and is energy conserving even for multiple scattering models. The input 1-D velocity model can be layered to incorporate reflected phases, such as PmP and SmS, to better fit the observations.\nWe will summarize our results for the average scattering and attenuation properties of the southern California crust and the implications for strong ground motion predictions.",

The Uintah and the Upper Green River Basins, for example, have been identified as regions with severe air pollution resulting from emissions associated with energy development. In the troposphere, ozone is produced photochemically from NOx (NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the ozone production efficiency is controlled by both the absolute levels of these species and their relative abundances. NO, NO2, NOy and O3 were measured in conjunction with a full suite of atmospheric VOCs, methane, CO, and peroxy acyl nitrates from an instrumented aircraft in March and April of 2015 during the NOAA Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) campaign, which targeted emissions and photochemistry within the major shale plays in the Western United States. Here, we examine the reactive nitrogen budgets and NOy partitioning in the studied shale plays with particular emphasis on comparing those basins in close proximity to urban centers (e.g., Denver Julesburg, Barnett) to the more rural sites. The impacts of urban outflow intermixed with adjacent oil and gas emissions will be discussed in terms of ozone production and air quality.",

In arctic tundra, environmental factors and plant traits of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum cause the formation of mounds that are dense amalgamations of belowground C called tussocks. Tussocks have important implications for arctic ecosystem biogeochemistry and C stocks, but the environmental and biological factors controlling their size and distribution across the landscape are poorly understood. In order to better understand how landscape variation in tussock size and density impact ecosystem C stocks, we formed the Carbon in Arctic Tussock Tundra (CATT) network and recruited an international team to sample locations across the arctic. The CATT network provided a latitudinal and longitudinal gradient along which to improve our understanding of tussocks’ influence on ecosystem structure and function. CATT data revealed important insights into tussock formation across the arctic. Tussock density generally declined with latitude, and tussock size exhibited substantial variation across sites. The relationship between height and diameter was similar across CATT sites indicating that both biological and environmental factors control tussock formation. At some sites, C in tussocks comprised a substantial percentage of ecosystem C stocks that may be vulnerable to climate change. It is concluded that the loss of this growth form would offset C gains from projected plant functional shifts from graminoid to shrub tundra. This work highlights the role of plant growth forms on the magnitude and retention of ecosystem C stocks.",

An understanding of the mechanisms controlling precipitation in this region is lacking despite its disproportionate importance in the mass balance of Greenland and the consequent contributions to sea level rise. We use weather station data from the Danish Meteorological Institute to reveal the governing influences on precipitation in SE Greenland during the winter and fall. We find that precipitation in the fall is significantly correlated to the longitude of the Icelandic Low and the NAO. Winter precipitation is correlated with the strength and longitude of the Icelandic Low, as well as the NAO. We show that in years of extreme high precipitation, onshore winds dominate, thereby advecting more moisture inland. In low precipitation years, winds are more westerly, approaching the stations from land. Understanding the controls of SE Greenland precipitation will help us predict how future precipitation in this key region may change in a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Road salting in urban areas of the northeastern United States increases chloride concentrations in urban streams. Groundwater storage of saline road runoff results in increased surface water chloride concentrations through time, even in non-winter months. Stream-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions promote buffering of large seasonal swings in stream chloride concentrations, resulting in lower surface water chloride in winter and higher concentrations in summer, relative to streams hydrologically disconnected from riparian floodplains. However, the hydrogeologic processes controlling salt storage and transport in urban floodplain aquifers have not been fully investigated. We developed a 3D numerical groundwater flow and solute transport model of an urban floodplain in Syracuse, New York, using MODFLOW and MT3DMS. We ran the model for 1 year, calibrating to three conditions: water table elevations along a riparian transect, measurements of net groundwater flux to the stream along the 500-m reach, and chloride concentrations in groundwater through time in riparian wells. Chloride enters the riparian aquifer via three pathways: hillslope groundwater discharge, hyporheic exchange, and groundwater recharge during overbank flooding events. Winter overbank flooding events are the primary source of chloride to floodplain sediments. While hillslope groundwater discharge results in relatively uniform chloride through time in high conductivity units, surficial floodplain sediments with lower conductivity have high chloride concentrations from winter overbank flood events. When compared to road salt application rates (up to 20 tons of salt per lane kilometer per year), the 0.013 km2 floodplain holds only a tiny fraction of chloride applied in a watershed (>100 km of road in the watershed). To promote riparian aquifer storage of road salt and buffering of stream chloride concentrations, urban planners should design urban floodplains for frequent winter flooding events, and allow ample floodplain surface area to accommodate typical road salt application rates.",

            "abstract": "The risk of flooding of settlements located downstream of a dam is high due to the large number of people living on natural waterways. Risk assessment of flooding could help in projecting containment and protection in case of a dam-break. For projecting containment and protection works, the assessment should take into account velocities, densities and impact pressure of the water on the villages in risk. Therefore, it is appealing to conduct a series of numerical simulations of downstream flooding including velocity and pressure fields, and their temporal and spatial fluctuations. The present work focuses on the real case of “La Esperanza” dam, located in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico). The dam was built 70 years ago and currently two thirds of its capacity is covered with silt, which implies a very high horizontal thrust. The simulation of the flood due to failure of the dam was carried on using the DualSPHysics code, a new implementation of the mesh-free Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method. For the boundary conditions, a Digital Elevation Model of the potentially affected area was built using satellite images, the actual bathymetry of the dam and cross sections of the channel. In order to evaluate the hazard posed to the villages located downstream of the dam, different collapse scenarios were simulated, with particular focus on the consequences of the temporal variation of rainfall. Preliminary results show acceleration and dynamic pressure values of water in especially selected areas that are subjected to high risk for the elevated number of inhabitant.",

            "abstract": "Crustal anisotropy in the overriding North American plate along the Cascadia subduction zone is poorly constrained, mainly due to low levels of seismicity in the subducting Juan de Fuca slab that limit shear wave splitting analysis. Therefore, to investigate along-strike variations in crustal anisotropy in the Cascadia subduction zone, we compute P-to-S receiver functions at 12 broadband seismic stations using the multiple-taper correlation receiver function estimator. We observe P-to-SV converted energy on radial component receiver functions that is consistent with conversions originating at the Moho of the overriding plate and the top of the subducting slab. At stations above the mantle wedge corner we see evidence of an “inverted Moho,” supporting previous studies that suggest a highly serpentinized, low velocity mantle wedge in this region. We also observe P-to-SH conversions on transverse component receiver functions that are consistent with the presence of dipping and/or anisotropic structure in the crust and uppermost mantle. To further constrain the orientation of crustal anisotropy, we compute synthetic receiver functions using both (1) a trial-and-error forward modeling scheme and (2) a neighborhood algorithm inversion. Our results suggest that lower crustal anisotropy is highly complex and variable along-strike, but with orientations reflective of E-W oriented subduction. This work also serves as a comparison for studies that attempt to use shear wave splitting of non-volcanic tremor to constrain crustal anisotropy in Cascadia. Preliminary results for the orientation of crustal anisotropy beneath seismic station GNW on the Kitsap Peninsula, Washington show general agreement with shear wave splitting results.",

In particular, the VIS-IR spectrometer VIR (2) acquired data during approach to Ceres and the first two mapping orbits and it will continue its measurements during the last two mapping orbits(3).\nCeres’ average spectrum is characterized by a prominent absorption band at 2.7 micron and weaker bands in the 3.0-4.0 micron region while the visible and near-IR ranges lack prominent bands. This spectrum is well represented by a mixture of ammoniated phyllosilicates and other clays, Mg-carbonates, and dark material, like magnetite(4).\nVIR is observing spectral variability all across the surface of Ceres particularly evident in changes of the shape of the spectra in the range from 0.5 to 4.0 micron. The spectral diversity was already evident in the 11Km/px spectral images from the approach phase(5). The spectral slope in the visual spectral range in addition to the center and depth of the detected absorption bands in the IR range have been computed and mapped. The maps presented here are based on data from Survey orbit acquired in June 2015 with 1.1Km/px of nominal resolution and are the most spatially resolved global view of the surface by VIR. They have been used to study the distribution of the spectral heterogeneities on the surface. The parameters mapped so far, in particular the spectral slope in the VIS range, has a distribution which appears to be associated with impact craters and local events on the surface rather than global processes. The analysis of higher spatial resolution spectra that will be acquired in later phases of the Dawn encounter is needed to confirm this correlation and to provide an interpretation on its role on the evolution of Ceres’ surface.\n1)Russell,C.T. et al.

            "abstract": "Littoral sediment transport on barrier island coasts can cause tidal inlets to migrate alongshore up to hundreds of meters per year and pose significant hazards and challenges to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Surprisingly little is known about either the mechanisms or the expected rates of tidal inlet migration. Here we propose and test a simple framework of inlet migration that allows us to investigate the movement of sediment around tidal inlets and predict the corresponding migration rates. We test this framework using a combination of observed migration rates and idealized inlet simulations from the coupled hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model Delft3D-SWAN. In the Delft3D experiments, the tidal inlets quickly reach a dynamic state where the inlet cross-sectional area, the tidal prism and the migration rate, all of which are emergent characteristics of the experiment, remain constant through time.\nTracking the sources of sediments deposited around the tidal inlet, we find that the eroded downdrift barrier is a significant source of sediment to both the flood tidal delta and the newly constructed barrier updrift of the inlet. The alongshore sediment bypassing volumes and pathways affecting inlet migration depend strongly on wave and tidal conditions. Furthermore, we find that migrating flood tidal deltas can act as a net sink of up to 80% of the littoral sediment flux. This sink reduces alongshore sediment bypassing of tidal inlets and thins the barrier downdrift. These modeled tidal inlets can therefore act as a migrating “buzzsaw” across barrier coasts that leave a zone of flood tidal delta deposits in their wake, an efficacious sediment mover that contributes significantly to the long-term landward migration of barrier islands with or without sea level rise.",

Here, we discuss how interplanetary shocks which are overtaking a previous coronal mass ejection (CME) may cause especially severe geomagnetic effects at Earth, even for weak shocks. We show two examples, one from solar cycle 23 (6 August 1998) with good coverage in the magnetosheath and one from the recent solar cycle with RBSP measurements (30 September 2012). For these events, the simultaneous dynamic pressure enhancement and increase in the southward component of the magnetic field resulted in a large earthward retreat of Earth's magnetopause, causing large electron dropout in the outer radiation belt due to magnetopause shadowing.\nWe also present for comparison a more typical event for which an interplanetary shock is followed by a low-density magnetic ejecta in January 2013. Combining interplanetary, magnetosheath, outer magnetosphere and radiation belt measurements by more than ten satellites, including RBSP, THEMIS and Cluster, we show how a period of extremely low Mach number during the passage of the magnetic cloud resulted in dramatic losses in the radiation belt and a large-scale reorganization of the entire day-side magnetosphere.",

Lyman Lake is fed by meltwater from Lyman Glacier, a small (0.20 km2) alpine glacier. Analyses (visual stratigraphy, magnetic susceptibility - MS, loss on ignition - LOI) of the sediments highlight three patterns of activity; background sedimentation, peak glacial sedimentation, and regional volcanism. The top ~50cm of the core sequence records Latest Holocene (<2000 cal yrs BP) glacial activity, characterized by medium MS, varying LOI and clay/silt-sized sediments. Below this interval, volcanic episodes dominate the core stratigraphy. Multiple pulses of coarse-grained tephra with extremely high MS characterize three episodes of volcanic deposition from nearby Glacier Peak (unnamed, Dusty Creek, Layer D). In contrast, interspersed volcanic deposits from Mount St. Helens (Py, Yn) are characterized by single episodes of airfall tephra. The core sequence bottoms out in fine-grained slopewash and airfall from Mount Mazama’s climactic eruption.\nThe sediment cores have been dated via radiocarbon (14C), tephrochronology and near-surface 210Pb. The near-surface sediments accumulate at a rate of 7 cm / 100 yrs, in contrast to rates of 1 - 5 cm / 100 yrs deeper in the core. The heightened rate of sedimentation may be caused by the rapid retreat of the Lyman Glacier over the 20th century. Age-depth modeling for the remainder of the core is hampered by an apparent reservoir effect observed in bulk carbon samples. Ongoing analyses of Glacier Peak tephras, bulk carbon samples and near-surface 210Pb will improve the age-depth model, and grain size analysis of the sediment cores will aid in reconstructing glacial activity. We intend to create a record of the Lyman Glacier’s fluctuations and use this activity as a Holocene paleoclimate proxy for the North Cascades.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_MeiyappanEtAl.pdf\nIn the latest projections of future greenhouse gas emissions for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), few Earth System Models included the effect of nitrogen limitation, a key process limiting forest regrowth. We estimate the impacts of nitrogen limitation on the CO2 emissions from land use and land-use change (LULUC), including wood harvest, for the period 1900-2100. We use a land-surface model that includes a fully coupled carbon and nitrogen cycle, and accounts for forest regrowth processes following agricultural abandonment and wood harvest. Future projections are based on the four Representation Concentration Pathways used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and we account for uncertainty in future climate for each scenario based on ensembles of climate model outputs. Results show that excluding nitrogen limitation will underestimate global LULUC emissions by 34-52 PgC (20-30%) during the 20th century (range across three different historical LULUC reconstructions) and by 128-187 PgC (90-150%) during the 21st century (range across the four IPCC scenarios). The full range for estimated LULUC emissions during the 21st century including climate model uncertainty is 91 to 227 PgC (with nitrogen limitation included). The underestimation increases with time because: (1) Projected annual wood harvest rates from forests summed over the 21st century are 380-1080% higher compared to those of the 20th century, resulting in more regrowing secondary forests, (2) Nitrogen limitation reduces the CO2 fertilization effect on net primary production of regrowing secondary forests following wood harvest and agricultural abandonment, and (3) Nitrogen limitation effect is aggravated by the gradual loss of soil nitrogen from LULUC disturbance. Our study implies that: (1) Nitrogen limitation of CO2 uptake is substantial and sensitive to nitrogen inputs, (2) If LULUC emissions are larger than previously estimated in studies without nitrogen limitation, then meeting the same climate mitigation target would require an equivalent additional reduction of fossil fuel emissions, and (3) The effectiveness of land-based mitigation strategies will critically depend on the interactions between nutrient limitations and secondary forests resulting from LULUC.",

Gravity, magnetotelluric (MT), and seismic data have been collected throughout the region, although we are concentrating on gravity and MT data collected during SAGE 2014 and 2015.\nThe study area is located in the center of the Santo Domingo basin, an extensional, Miocene age, rift basin, in an area that was minimally involved in the preceding local Laramide orogenic activity. Rift sediments (~3.5 km thick) are underlain by Eocene age sediments that were shed from adjacent uplifts. Up to 3 km of Mesozoic and Paleozoic sediments are preserved above the Precambrian basement. Geologic outcrop, borehole and seismic reflection data, and known density values were used in the construction of a ~100 km-long, generalized geologic cross section from which a gravity response was calculated. The modeled gravity response makes fairly definitive predictions about the geometry of the basin as well as the stratigraphy and faulting within and bounding the basin.\nMT data was collected at ten stations within the basin. The MT sounding curves exhibit one-dimensional behavior at short periods (<10 s), not surprisingly considering the relatively flat local structure in the area. Layered-earth MT models, without geologic constraints, show a conductive (<10 ohm-m) layer at ~1.5 km above a more resistive layer (>1000 ohm-m) at ~ 3.5-4 km. Conductivities of the major stratigraphic units have been determined from well logs and previous MT modeling. Forward and inverse MT models constrained by the gravity-modeled geologic cross section are used to develop a conductivity model consistent with the geology, and are a step towards a better unified treatment of MT, seismic and gravity data.",

            "abstract": "The stability of a grounding line on reverse-sloping bedrock has been the subject of much attention and debate. In the absence of ice shelf buttressing or lateral flow variations, such a marine ice sheet configuration has been shown to be unconditionally unstable. Numerous studies have speculated that recent grounding line retreat in West Antarctica indicates that a runaway instability is already underway for this portion of the ice sheet. However, modeling studies have shown that a grounding line can be stabilized on a reverse-sloping bed in the case of strong lateral flow convergence. One factor that has not been addressed in modeling studies of the marine ice sheet stability is fracturing and weakening of ice stream and ice shelf shear margins, processes that are known to be operating in many places. It has been speculated that marginal weakening should reduce the stress carried across shear margins, leading to reduced buttressing and thus allowing accelerated flow and grounding line retreat. Here, we test this hypothesis using an ice sheet model and a previously-used, idealized marine ice sheet configuration with strong lateral flow convergence. We first confirm earlier modeling studies that a stable grounding line position can be found on reverse-sloping bedrock. We then explore perturbations of this stable position caused by allowing the shear margins to damage according to a new, generalized constitutive framework for ice deformation and weakening. Constitutive parameters for marginal weakening are taken from assimilated velocity observations for several different ice shelves. We demonstrate that marginal weakening is at least as important as basal lubrication or ice shelf thinning for perturbing the grounding line. Model projections of marine ice sheet evolution that do not account for marginal weakening are therefore likely to underestimate both the rate of grounding line retreat and ice flux.",

            "abstract": "The San Gorgonio Pass (SGP) region of southern California is a locus of extensive Quaternary deformation surrounding a complex section of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) zone. The geomorphology of the SGP region reflects the complicated history of geologic events in the formation of this structural ‘knot’. Critical questions remain in assessing earthquake hazard for this region: What is the likelihood that rupture will propagate through the SGP? If rupture is able to propagate, what pathway will connect the various fault strands? To address these questions, we focus on the geology and geomorphology of the SGP region. We have identified fault-bounded blocks, and focus on three that are developed within crystalline bedrock: the Yucaipa Ridge block (YRB) block, the Kitching Peak block (KPB), and the Pisgah Peak block (PPB). The latter two blocks are positioned south of the YRB, and partially separated from each other by the San Bernardino strand; this strand cannot be mapped at the surface as an active connection between fault strands. Both KPB and PPB are bounded to the south by the San Gorgonio Pass Fault Zone. Morphometric analyses consistently demonstrate distinctions between KPB and PPB, though the bedrock lithologies are the same. Geologic mapping of the region highlights the differences in Quaternary units within the blocks. These geomorphic and geologic distinctions lead to our interpretation that KPB and PPB have experienced markedly different uplift histories that constrain the history of dextral slip on the SAF through SGP. Specifically, although the latest Quaternary geologic setting of SGP raises questions about modern slip transfer through the Pass, the contrasting uplift histories of KPB and PPB strongly suggest that earlier in Quaternary time SGP was not a barrier to slip transfer between the Coachella Valley to the SE and the San Bernardino Basin to the NW.",

One of the key issues stakeholders face in adopting climate change information into their decision processes is how uncertainty is addressed and communicated. In this study, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with managers and scientists working on stream habitat restoration of cold-water fisheries in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin that were focused on how they interpret and manage uncertainty and what types of information they need to make better decisions. One of the important lessons we learned from the interviews is that if researchers are going to provide useful climate change information to stakeholders, they need to understand where and how decisions are made and what adaptation measures are actually available in a given decision arena. This method of incorporating social science methods into climate science production can provide a framework for researchers from the Climate Science Centers and others who are interested in pursuing stakeholder-based science. By indentifying a specific ecological system and conducting interviews with actors who work on that system, researchers will be able to gain a better understanding of how their climate change science can fit into existing or shape new decision processes. We also interpreted lessons learned from our interviews via existing literature in areas such as stakeholder-based modeling and the decision sciences to provide guidance specific to the stakeholder-based science process.",

The horizontal extension of this shallow conductive zone, related to the hydrothermal system of Lastarria, suggests that it has been draining one of the lagoons in the area (Laguna Azufrera), forming a sulfur rich area which can be observed at the southern side of this lagoon.\nJoint modeling of the hydrothermal system using magnetotellurics and seismic data is part of the current work.",

The Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) Reanalysis, a combined meteorology and composition dataset for the period 2003-2012 (Innes et al., 2013), is used to investigate the composition of the troposphere and lower stratosphere in relation to the location of the storm track as well as other meteorological parameters over the North Atlantic associated with the different NAO phases. Cyclone tracks in the MACC Reanalysis compare well to the cyclone tracks in the widely-used ERA-Interim Reanalysis for the same 10-year period (cyclone tracking performed using the tracking algorithm of Hodges (1995, 1999)), as both are based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS).\nA seasonal analysis is performed whereby the MACC reanalysis meteorological fields, O3 and CO mixing ratios are weighted by the monthly NAO index values. The location of the main storm track, which tilts towards high latitudes (toward the Arctic) during positive NAO phases to a more zonal location in the mid-latitudes (toward Europe) during negative NAO phases, impacts the location of both horizontal and vertical transport across the North Atlantic and into the Arctic. During positive NAO seasons, the persistence of cyclones over the North Atlantic coupled with a stronger Azores High promotes strong horizontal transport across the North Atlantic throughout the troposphere. In all seasons, significantly more intense cyclones occur at higher latitudes (north of ~50°C) during the positive phase of the NAO and in the southern mid-latitudes during the negative NAO phase. This impacts the location of stratospheric intrusions within the descending dry airstream behind the associated cold front of the extratropical cyclone and the venting of low-level pollution up into the free troposphere within the warm conveyor belt airstream which rises ahead of the cold front.",

            "abstract": "The Pamir is the most prominent mountainous region within Central Asia, forming the northwestern tail of the Tibetan plateau. Although many large-scale tectonic features are thought to be understood, the details of uplift and orogenic growth are still too poorly constrained to evaluate first order geodynamic models. To assess the impact of tectonic uplift on the geomorphic evolution of the plateau, we performed several standard morphometric analyses. We have also begun Apatite (AHe), Zircon U-Th-Sm/He (ZHe) and apatite fission track dating to obtain the timing of upper crustal cooling related to rock uplift. Here we focus on the western and northwestern unglaciated margin of the Pamir, Darvaz and Peter the 1st Range. Drainage pattern and DEM analysis indicate that the Panj River forms the base level that controls the river network draining the entire central and western margin of the Pamir. Fluvial network constraints indicate that it has been established in the geologic past, has facilitated deep valley incision when crossing Darvaz Range, but not been uplifted significantly. Within the Darvaz Range, bounded by the Darvaz fault zone in the northwest and Badakhshan fault zone in the southeast, we discovered extensive low-relief landscapes with gentle, concave longitudinal upstream river profiles. These are interrupted by major knick points and steep downstream segments, draining towards the deeply incised Panj River. Prior to uplift, this landscape was eroded to a low relief and was partly covered by upper Neogene sediments. Preliminary ZHe and AHe ages indicate that uplift of the Darvaz Range was underway by 15 Ma and may have accelerated since then. We suggest that the western flank of the Pamir has had 1 to 2 km of surface uplifted starting during the middle Miocene. Focused precipitation in the internal portion of the western Pamir facilitated deep valley incision during late Cenozoic. The base level of the major Panj drainage has remained at its low elevation.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have shown the importance of choosing the domain size adequately for dynamical downscaling with nested regional climate models. It is well known that domain should not be too large to avoid large departure from the driving data, and not be too small to provide sufficient distance from the lateral inflow to allow a full development of the small-scale features resolved by the increase resolution. Although practitioners of dynamical downscaling are well aware that the jump of resolution between the driving data and the nested regional climate model impacts the simulated climate, the issue has never been properly study. Larger is the jump of resolution, larger is the distance from the lateral inflow to fully develop the small-scale features permitted by the increase resolution.\nOur investigation compares direct nesting to achieve a grid mesh of 0.15o from driving data at 3.6°, 1.8o, 0.45° and 0.15° using the perfect-prognostic approach of the Big-Brother protocol. The results show that the small-scale transient-eddy component struggles to be fully developed with reduced resolution of the driving data. Overall, this study suggests that domain location (i.e. domain of interest or subsequent nested domains) must be chosen carefully according to the jump of resolution to allow the optimal development of small-scale features allowed by the increase resolution of the nested model.",

            "abstract": "Corn and soybean production in the Upper Mississippi River Basin can be limited by either excess or shortage of water, often in the same year within the same watershed. Most producers indemnify themselves against these hazards through the Federal crop insurance program, which is heavily subsidized, thus discouraging expenditures on other forms of risk mitigation. The cost is not trivial, amounting to more than 60 billion USD over the past 15 years. Examination of long-term precipitation and streamflow records at the 8-digit scale suggests that inter-annual hydrologic variability in the region is increasing, particularly in an area stretching from NW IL through much of IA and southern MN. Analysis of crop insurance statistics shows that these same watersheds exhibit the highest frequency of coincident claims for yield losses to both excess water and drought within the same year. An emphasis on development of water management strategies to increase landscape storage and subsequent reuse through supplemental irrigation in this region could reduce the cost of the crop insurance program and stabilize yield. However, we also note that analysis of yield data from USDA-NASS shows that interannual yield variability at the watershed scale is much more muted than the indemnity data suggest, indicating that adverse selection is probably a factor in the crop insurance marketplace. Consequently, we propose that hydrologic mitigation practices may be most cost-effective if they are carefully targeted, using topographic, soil, and meteorological data, in combination with more site-specificity in crop insurance data.",

According to some reports the impacts of climate change in the region may be catastrophic so, there is an urgent need for better understanding the impact of climate change on this region, especially on agricultural production, which is the primary livelihood of the population. However, the region is known for its unique landscape and complicated biophysical and socioeconomic systems. This complexity is a source of difficulty for obtaining both reliable observations and realistic predictions of future climate in the region. The ultimate aim of our inter-disciplinary research project is to couple disparate climate and agro-ecosystem models to understand how future changes in precipitation may impact agriculture in the Himalayas. The project is divided into two parts:\nQuantify the response of precipitation to climate change in state-of-the-art climate model simulations,\nEvaluate the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on agricultural production with an agro-ecosystem model.\nFor the first part of the project we evaluated the ability of climate models to represent the present climate of this region. Climate model output was compared against precipitation observations from ground stations, satellites, and atmospheric reanalyses to document the biases of the models and evaluate objectively the future changes in precipitation. After evaluating the biases of our models, climate model predictions of precipitation changes over the Himalayas were quantified. The models clearly show a significant increase in precipitation over a large part of the region, especially during the monsoon season and the season preceding the monsoon.\nThe second component of the study seeks to introduce these precipitation changes into an agro-ecosystem model. This model, that contains multiple dynamic variables with regulate-able stochasticity and will allow us to visualize probable impacts of variable precipitation on selected crops.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface water flow within the Biscayne aquifer is controlled by the heterogeneous distribution of porosity and permeability in the karst Miami Limestone and the presence of numerous dissolution and mega-porous features. The dissolution features and other high porosity areas can create preferential flow paths and direct recharge to the aquifer, which may not be accurately conceptualized in groundwater flow models. As hydrologic conditions are undergoing restoration in the Everglades, understanding the distribution of these high porosity areas within the subsurface would create a better understanding of subsurface flow. This research utilizes ground penetrating radar to estimate the spatial variability of porosity and dielectric permittivity of the Miami Limestone at centimeter scale resolution at the laboratory scale. High frequency GPR antennas were used to measure changes in electromagnetic wave velocity through limestone samples under varying volumetric water contents. The Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM) was then applied in order to estimate porosity and dielectric permittivity of the solid phase of the limestone. Porosity estimates ranged from 45.2-66.0% from the CRIM model and correspond well with estimates of porosity from analytical and digital image techniques. Dielectric permittivity values of the limestone solid phase ranged from 7.0 and 13.0, which are similar to values in the literature. This research demonstrates the ability of GPR to identify the cm scale spatial variability of aquifer properties that influence subsurface water flow which could have implications for groundwater flow models in the Biscayne and potentially other shallow karst aquifers.",

Fluid flow across the sand surface within this zone is important to the biogeochemistry of coastal aquifers and the mobilization and transport of sediments and potentially contaminants along the coastline. Despite the importance of groundwater-surface water interactions in the swash zone, coupling between surface and subsurface flow is not well understood and spatial and temporal patterns of vertical flow direction and magnitude across the beachface remain unclear. Simultaneous high-frequency measurements of the position of the swash edge, the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated beachface, sediment saturation, and water table elevation were collected on a moderate-energy sandy beach. The measurements provide a unique dataset linking swash zone forcing to groundwater flow. Swash infiltration across the unsaturated beachface leads to an accumulation of water in the unsaturated zone and forms a stable lens of partially saturated sediment that serves as a source of water to the water table. The positions of infiltration, recharge, and discharge zones on the beachface were temporally and spatially variable and were distinguishable only through combined use of surface and subsurface measurements. The zone of infiltration was controlled primarily by swash processes while the width and location of the groundwater discharge zone on the beach surface was controlled by the tide. Saturation dynamics, time scales of flow, and the position and extent of infiltration, recharge, and discharge zones may be important considerations when estimating fluid, solute, and sediment fluxes to, from, and within the intertidal zone.",

Activities included soil analysis, measuring stream flow and water quality parameters, dendrochronology, and aquatic microbe metabolism. In the non-majors class, we make use of our urban location to contrast water quality in parks and highly channelized urban streams.

            "abstract": "A growing number of stream-groundwater interface observations reveal the paradox of anaerobic respiration occurring in seemingly oxic-saturated sediments. Here we demonstrate a physical residence time-based explanation for this paradox. Specifically, we show how microzones favorable to anaerobic respiration processes (e.g., denitrification, metal reduction, and methanogenesis) can develop in the less mobile porosity of bulk-oxic hyporheic zones. These anoxic microzones develop when the transport time from the streambed to the pore centers, referred to as the pore scale residence time, exceeds a characteristic uptake time of oxygen. We used a two-dimensional pore-network model to quantify how anoxic microzones develop across a range of hyporheic flow and oxygen uptake conditions. Ultimately, two types of anaerobic microzones develop: flow invariant and flow dependent. The flow invariant microzones are stable across variable hydrologic conditions, whereas the formation and extent of the flow dependent microzones are sensitive to flow rates and orientation. Therefore, pore-scale residence time heterogeneity offers a simple physical explanation for the paradox of anaerobic signals occurring in oxic pore waters without the prerequisite of heterogeneity in reaction substrate availability. Fortunately, electrical geophysical methods are sensitive to ionic tracers within less mobile pore spaces, and thus can help quantify pore scale residence time heterogeneity in situ. These emerging methods present an opportunity to estimate the role of microzones at larger scales.",

Both modern observations and modeling simulations suggest that subsurface temperatures between 300-600 m across the Tropical North Atlantic warm when AMOC weakens, providing a possible fingerprint for reconstructing past AMOC variability (Schmidt et al., 2012). Furthermore, this AMOC-induced subsurface warming has the potential to impact the West African Monsoon, possibly providing an important high-latitude / tropical climate teleconnection (Chang et al., 2008). Here, we present a new high-resolution Mg/Ca record of subsurface (~300 m water depth) temperature variability across the last deglacial from sediment core Fan 17 (4.81oN, 4.41oE, 1178 m depth) recovered from the Niger Delta based on the deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globorotalia crassaformis. Our G. crassaformis Mg/Ca record suggests an increase in subsurface temperatures up to 4oC from 17.2 to 14.8 kyr, consistent with previously published proxy data suggesting AMOC was in a reduced state during Heinrich Event 1 and the subsequent Mystery Interval (McManus et al., 2004). The G. crassaformis Mg/Ca record then shows a cooling associated with the onset of the Bølling Allerød interstadial, followed by a second warming at the start of the Younger Dryas. These millennial-scale warming events are nearly synchronous with a similar record of subsurface temperature change from the Bonaire Basin in the Southern Caribbean (Schmidt et al., 2012) and may provide important evidence for the rapid adjustment of tropical Atlantic subsurface temperatures in response to a weakened AMOC state.",

Despite the fact that GDGTs are produced throughout the entire water column, global core-top calibrations show a robust correlation between mean annual SST and TEX86 of underlying sediments. Published Holocene TEX86 data from the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) have been interpreted as summer-weighted, since calibrated TEX86-SSTs are systematically offset 2º C warmer than foraminiferal Mg/Ca-based SST estimates. We measure GDGT flux and TEX86 in a weekly-to-monthly resolution 4-year sediment trap time series (2010-2014) as well as in core-top sediments in the northern GoM to investigate the seasonality of the TEX86 signal in GoM sediments. Overall, the flux of isoprenoid GDGTs is closely tied to mass flux. There is no distinct seasonal cycle in GDGT flux, but peaks occur almost exclusively in winter during our 2010-2014 sampling interval, precluding the interpretation of TEX86 as a summer-weighted SST proxy in the GoM. We use BAYSPAR, a Bayesian spatially-varying regression model, to calibrate sediment trap TEX86 to SST, and find a flux-weighted mean TEX86-SST (24.9 ºC) matches the GoM core-top TEX86-SST, and is consistent with the observed mean annual SST at the site. The sediment trap TEX86-SST varies between 19 ºC and 27 ºC over the 4-year sampling interval, similar to the observed 19 ºC to 31 ºC SST range, however TEX86 maxima and minima are not tied to contemporaneous SST seasonal maxima and minima, suggesting a delay between production and export from the mixed layer. This study supports the conclusion that the TEX86 signal in GoM sediments reflects production in the overlying water column (not terrestrially derived or laterally advected material) and can reasonably be interpreted as a mean annual SST proxy in the GoM.",

However, the generally smooth shape of many sandy shorelines provides a rather clear demonstration that alongshore sediment transport, through gradients in this flux, exerts a first-order control on coastal shape. Fisher (1968) has also previously observed that the mid-to-northern USA coast, spanning the Cape Cod, Long Island, New Jersey, and Delmarva shores, share many basic traits, as they are comprised of a series of erosional headlands flanked by accretionary spits and, towards their southern/western extension, increasingly disjointed barrier island chains. Here, using ~30-year hindcast wave data and modern shoreline orientations, we test the first-order prediction that alongshore sediment transport drives the long-term evolution of the shorelines of these systems. We find that, in many cases, predictions of erosion and accretion from shoreline orientation and wave climate alone match historical trends in shoreline change. These first-order predictions, however, do not explain all of the historical shoreline changes, and our analysis can highlight the regions where other processes must be invoked to understand long-term shoreline change. However, we find that changes to the shoreline orientation are sufficient to explain many well-documented locations of rapid shoreline change, further suggesting that in these locations geologic and cross-shore controls may be playing secondary roles in shoreline change.",

            "abstract": "This work investigates hydrologic and geochemical interactions in the Critical Zone (CZ) using high-resolution reactive transport modeling. Reactive transport models can be used to predict the response of geochemical weathering and solute fluxes in the CZ to changes in a dynamic environment, such as those pertaining to human activities and climate change in recent years. The scales of hydrology and geochemistry in the CZ range from days to eons in time and centimeters to kilometers in space. Here, we present results of a multi-dimensional, multi-scale hydro-geochemical model to investigate the role of subsurface heterogeneity on the formation of mineral weathering fronts in the CZ, which requires consideration of many of these spatio-temporal scales. The model is implemented using the reactive transport code PFLOTRAN, an open source subsurface flow and reactive transport code that utilizes parallelization over multiple processing nodes and provides a strong framework for simulating weathering in the CZ. The model is set up to simulate weathering dynamics in the mountainous catchments representative of the Colorado Front Range. Model parameters were constrained based on hydrologic, geochemical, and geophysical observations from the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (BcCZO). Simulations were performed in fractured rock systems and compared with systems of heterogeneous and homogeneous permeability fields. Tracer simulations revealed that the mean residence time of solutes was drastically accelerated as fracture density increased. In simulations that include mineral reactions, distinct signatures of transport limitations on weathering arose when discrete flow paths were included. This transport limitation was related to both advective and diffusive processes in the highly heterogeneous systems (i.e. fractured media and correlated random permeability fields with σlnk > 3). The well-known time-dependence of mineral weathering rates was found to be the most pronounced in the fractured systems, with a departure from the maximum system-averaged dissolution rate occurring after ~100 kyr followed by a gradual decrease in the reaction rate with time that persists beyond 104 kyr.",

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra contain large C stocks and may be an important source of CO2 and CH4 over the next century due to a rapidly changing climate, degrading permafrost, and redistribution of water across high latitude landscapes. This presentation synthesizes geochemical and isotopic data and examines vertical and lateral factors and processes critical to predicting the C, N, and water balance of tundra ecosystems. Stable water isotope analyses (delta 2H and delta 18O) indicate that summer rain is the dominant source for active layer groundwater, with melting seasonal ice contributing to deeper pore waters in late summer. Microtopography and water table effects on geochemistry were apparent from a comprehensive spatial examination of active layer biogeochemistry, showing a number of significant differences in the concentrations of cations and anions for high- vs. low-centered polygons, microtopographic features (polygonal centers vs. troughs), and with depth. Results have implications for future nutrient availability with projected permafrost degradation and landscape evolution, suggesting greater availability of limiting nutrients (sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate) where polygons undergo a shift from low- to high-centered. Nitrate isotopes (delta 15N and delta 18O) indicated a predominantly microbial source for nitrate in high centered polygons active layers. However, atmospheric nitrate was preserved in permafrost, and may serve as a potential indicator of permafrost degradation. Additionally, results suggest that older, deeper C sources may be promoting a shift in methanogenic pathway, from predominantly acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic. This mechanistic shift is attributed to the source and quality of available organic substrate. Overall, results showed substantial lateral and vertical variability in biogeochemical, biogeophysical, and hydrological processes across microtopographic- to landscape scales that needs to be accounted for in fine and intermediate scale models.",

            "abstract": "Gulf Coast salt domes, specifically their calcite cap rocks, have been widely recognized for their association with significant reserves of crude oil and natural gas. However, the specific microbial reactions that facilitate the precipitation of these cap rocks are still largely unknown. Insight into the mineralization mechanism(s) can be obtained from the specific geochemical signatures recorded in these structures. Gulf Coast cap rocks contain carbonate and sulfur minerals that exhibit variable carbon (d13C) and sulfur isotope (δ34S) signatures. Calcite d13C values are isotopically depleted and show a large range of values from –1 to –52‰, reflecting a mixture of various carbon sources including a substantial methane component. These depleted carbon isotope compositions combined with the presence of abundant sulfide minerals in cap rocks have led to interpretations that invoke microbial sulfate reduction as an important carbonate mineral-yielding process in salt dome environments. Sulfur isotope data from carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS: trace sulfate incorporated within the carbonate mineral crystal lattice) provide a more direct proxy for aqueous sulfate in salt dome systems and may provide a means to directly fingerprint ancient sulfate reduction. We find CAS sulfur isotope compositions (δ34SCAS) significantly greater than those of the precursor Jurassic sulfate-salt deposits (which exhibit δ34S values of ~ +15‰). This implies that cap rock carbonate generation occurred via microbial sulfate reduction under closed-system conditions. The co-occurrence of depleted carbonate d13C values (< ~30‰) and the enriched δ34SCAS values are evidence for sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). AOM, which has been shown to yield extensive seafloor carbonate authigenesis, is also potentially partly responsible for the carbonate minerals of the Gulf Coast calcite cap rocks through concomitant production of alkalinity. Collectively, these data shed new light on a potential hotspot of microbial activity in the deep biosphere.",

Interestingly, these extremes are happening against the backdrop of warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific, which has historically reduced the strength of summer monsoon over South Asia. Given the occurrence of the contrasting anomalies at large and regional scales, in this study, we analyze 2015 extremes over South Asia within the historical perspective. We study the anomalies in the land, atmospheric and oceanic processes that potentially led to the regional heat waves and wet extremes throughout the summer and their connection to the large-scale anomalies in the monsoon dynamic. Additionally, we analyze historical simulations of the CMIP5 GCMs to investigate the likelihood of these anomalies with respect to the pre-industrial time period. Our analysis suggests evolving changes in the monsoon dynamics over South Asia where the lesser-known regional and local drivers have influence on the historical tele-connections.",

Sediment, elevation, and geophysical data were collected during the April 2015 field campaign, approximately two and a half years after the storm. Sediment deposit data included trenches, stratigraphic descriptions, bulk sediment samples, push cores, Russian cores, and photos. Computed tomography (CT) scanning was conducted on push cores in order to acquire high resolution imaging of density, grain size, and sedimentary structure. Profiles of washover elevation were measured using Differential GPS with Real Time Kinematic processing. Ground Penetrating Radar data was collected to image the depth of the deposit and identify sedimentary structures. These data sets are compared to pre- and post -Sandy lidar surveys in order to determine post-Sandy modification in the two and a half years following the hurricane.

The two experiments provide technical development and risk-reduction for future DoD space weather sensors suitable for ionospheric specification, space situational awareness, and data products for global ionosphere assimilative models. In addition, the combined instrument complement of these two experiments offers a unique opportunity to study structures of the nighttime ionosphere. GROUP-C includes an advanced GPS receiver providing ionospheric electron density profiles and scintillation measurements and a high-sensitivity far-ultraviolet photometer measuring horizontal ionospheric gradients. LITES is an imaging spectrograph that spans 60–140 nm and will obtain high-cadence limb profiles of the ionosphere and thermosphere from 150-350 km altitude.\nIn the nighttime ionosphere, recombination of O+ and electrons produces optically thin emissions at 91.1 and 135.6 nm that can be used to tomographically reconstruct the two-dimensional plasma distribution in the orbital plane below ISS altitudes. Ionospheric irregularities, such as plasma bubbles and blobs, are transient features of the low and middle latitude ionosphere with important implications for operational systems. Irregularity structures have been studied primarily using ground-based systems, though some spaced-based remote and in-situ sensing has been performed. An ionospheric observatory aboard the ISS would provide new capability to study low- and mid-latitude ionospheric structures on a global scale. By combining for the first time high-sensitivity in-track photometry, vertical ionospheric airglow spectrographic imagery, and recent advancements in UV tomography, high-fidelity tomographic reconstruction of nighttime structures can be performed from the ISS. We discuss the tomographic approach, simulated reconstructions, and value added by including complementary ground-based observations.

            "abstract": "The effects of climate change in polar regions and their incorporation in global climate models has recently become an area of great interest. Permafrost holds entrapped greenhouse gases, e.g. CO2 and CH4, which are released to the atmosphere upon thawing, creating a positive feedback mechanism. Knowledge of seasonal changes in active layer thickness as well as long term degradation of permafrost is critical to the management of high latitude infrastructures, hazard mitigation, and increasing the accuracy of climate predictions. Methods for effectively imaging the spatial extent, depth, thickness, and discontinuous nature of permafrost over large areas are needed. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of permafrost over annual time scales would provide valuable insight into permafrost degradation. Seismic interferometry using ambient seismic noise has proven effective for recording velocity changes within the subsurface for a variety of applications, but has yet to be applied to permafrost studies. To this end, we deployed 7 Nanometrics Trillium posthole broadband seismometers within Poker Flat Research Range, located 30 miles north of Fairbanks, Alaska in a zone of discontinuous permafrost. Approximately 2 years worth of nearly continuous ambient noise data was collected. Using the python package MSNoise, relative changes in velocity were calculated. Results show high amounts of variability throughout the study period. General trends of negative relative velocity shifts can be seen between August and October followed by a positive relative velocity shift between November and February. Differences in relative velocity changes with both frequency and spatial location are also observed, suggesting this technique is sensitive to permafrost variation with depth and extent. Overall, short and long term changes in shallow subsurface velocity can be recovered using this method proposing seismic interferometry is a promising new technique for permafrost monitoring.

They tend to modulate the across-shore transport of heat and tracers. In the California Current System they have been observed using different field techniques. Using shipboard measurements, an anticyclonic subsurface eddy was observed in October 2009 off the northern Baja California coast. The genesis, evolution, and turbulent heat transport of the anticyclonic eddy are addressed in this study using a realistic regional model. The oceanic response to the synoptic wind variations acts as finite amplitude perturbation. The hydrodynamic stability of the California Undercurrent is compromised, through baroclinic instability, this lead to the formation of subthermocline eddy that detach from the coast and move out toward the open ocean. The potential vorticity associated to the eddy is eroded by the irregularities of the bottom topography and it is dissipated in the northern Baja California offshore. Once the anticyclonic eddy is weakened, the eddy heat anomaly is reincorporated into the transitional zone by the mean flow. This study shows evidence of reinstatement of the thermal anomalies toward the transitional zone of the southern region of the California Current, helping to keep its water mass relatively warmer than the adjacent sea.",

            "abstract": "The active Newport-Inglewood Fault (NIF) zone is a series of right-lateral, left-stepping en echelon segments and associated anticlines that produced the 1933 Long Beach Mw 6.4 earthquake. Seismic hazard estimates, dynamic earthquake rupture models, and earthquake simulations for Southern California rely on information on the stress field obtained from the Community Stress Model (CSM), though the latter still lacks observational constraints. This study provides much needed observational constraints on in-situ stress, which are useful for validating the CSM. Our results highlight the possibility of variations in stress directions near active faults at length-scales less than 1 km. We determined the orientation of stress-induced compressive failures or borehole breakouts, which are reliable indicators of the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress (SH) in over 40 wellbores in the Los Angeles basin near the NIF. The compressional jogs along the fault have long been drilled for oil in this major metropolitan area, and so provide the dataset of oriented caliper logs. This allowed us to investigate the variation of SH direction in three oil fields. In the Inglewood oil field, a dense dataset of 24 wells in ~2 km2, SH varies from N9°E to N32°E over a depth range of 1-3 km and within 400 m of the fault in the western fault block, with more variability occurring in wells father away. At depths below 2 km, SH takes on a more northerly orientation. In contrast, SH is oriented E-W in the eastern fault block, based on constraints from two wells. In the Wilmington oil field located between the Thums-Huntington Beach Fault and the NIF, data from 11 deviated wells yields a pattern of elongation directions, which differs from the more complex pattern obtained for the Huntington Beach wells located ~12 km to the southeast. The short-length-scale variations in SH direction are attributed to the proximity to faults or fault segmentation, and indicate the likely complexity that may be found in stress fields near other active faults.",

Previous studies using the same model in idealized experiments suggested upscale effects from the enhanced diabatic heating due to the resolution sensitivity of moist parameterizations and from the local enhancement of baroclinic eddies by the locally refined resolution. In this study, upscale effects are evaluated in an Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type setting. Three variable-resolution simulations are contrasted to global quasi-uniform simulations. In the former, the global, quasi-uniform 120 km spacing mesh is locally refined to 30 km mesh inside a circular domain with 30° radius that are centered over North America (the Great Plains), South America (Amazon), and Asia (Tibetan Plateau), respectively. Compared to idealized experiments, the upscale effects in the AMIP simulations exhibit more complex spatial patterns and extend further away from the high-resolution regions. Notably the mid-latitude jet in the Southern Hemisphere is influenced in all the variable-resolution simulations, including the cases in which the grid refinement is confined in the Northern Hemisphere. The stationary waves emanating from the refined region to the Southern Hemisphere jet are further examined. Sensitivity of the upscale effects to the topography refinement is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "The upper convex portions of hillslope profiles in soil-mantled landscapes have traditionally been interpreted as fundamentally different in origin from planar or concave hillslopes and have elicited different suggestions concerning their formation. In sub-humid landscapes, with sparse vegetation cover and little evidence for intense bioturbation, the upper convexity has usually been interpreted as the result of rainsplash. For the purpose of this study, we use a rainsplash transport equation developed from field and laboratory experiments and a model of ballistic trajectories to develop a method of predicting annual rainsplash transport rates under a range of environmental conditions, particularly related to climate reflected in mean annual rainfall, rainfall-intensity regime, and ground cover density. We derive diffusivity values of the kind frequently used in hillslope evolution models, and then examine the types of hillslope profiles that can be produced by this transport process. Under steady-state or decelerating uplift rates in post-orogenic environments in Africa, rainsplash transport is insufficient to create the observed convexities and lengths where erosion rates can be estimated. Additionally, the observed non-linear relationship between hillslope gradient and hillslope distance suggests additional erosive forces being in play, most likely that of sheetwash, despite this process usually being associated with concave hillslope profiles.",

This lends insight into our understanding and quantification of the influence of exogenous and endogenous global climate variability. In this study, we do so via a set of global temperature reconstructions based on the latest incarnation of the PAGES 2k global multi-proxy database (http://www.pages-igbp.org/ini/wg/2k-network/data/phase-2-data-status). Two climate field reconstruction (CFR) methods are employed: Gaussian graphical models embedded within the regularized EM algorithm (GraphEM, Guillot et al., 2015) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA, Smerdon et al., 2010).\nWe find a globally warm Medieval period, which was colder than the late twentieth-century by 0.5 C. With a probability of 87%, the 1961 – 1990 period was the warmest 40-year period in the past 2000 years in most regions, especially in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We show that surface temperature has a robust large-scale cooling pattern shortly after a volcanic eruption; in particular, over the North Atlantic Ocean, the cooling can persist up to 3 years after an eruption. An El Niño-like response (~0.2 C) is also found in 2 and 3 years after an eruption. Solar irradiance forcing is found to be an important modulator of multidecadal climate variability, with the strongest solar response (0.25 C) in high latitude North America. These key features are echoed in multiple GCM simulations of the last millennium, though we find notable differences, in particular regarding the timing of the post-volcanic ENSO response, and the magnitude of the temperature response to solar irradiance forcing.\nThe results suggest that there is no fundamental discrepancy between simulated and reconstructed climates of the last millennium, and thus lend credibility to both.",

We have established a revised stratigraphy for this eruption that now identifies a sequence of Toya 1A, 1B, 2, 3A, 3B, 4, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B in ascending order, where 1A to 4 are mainly ash flow, 5B and 6B are pumice flow, and 5A and 6A are lag breccia. Most of the pumice is white, homogeneous, nearly aphyric high-silica rhyolite, whereas gray heterogeneous pumice is dominant in unit 6B.\nWe analyzed phenocrysts from juvenile clasts from unit 6B using electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS, and divided them into three types: type-A with sodic plagioclase (An10-13), ferrous opx (Mg# 25-28), quartz, and low-Mg magnetite (Mg/Mn=0.23-0.26); type-B with calcic plagioclase (An>76), magnesian opx (Mg#>60 and MnO<1wt%), cpx, and high-Mg magnetite (Mg/Mn>5.5); and type-C with intermediate plagioclase and opx, hornblende, intermediate magnetite, and ilmenite. Type-A phenocrysts are dominant, and have homogeneous compositions. They show no reverse zoning even in magnetite, indicating no magmatic disturbance until just prior to the eruption. Type-B opx shows high Ti, Ni and low Zn compositions, indicating more primitive melt. Type-C phenocrysts show intermediate characters, and variation in composition. White pumice contains virtually only type-A phenocrysts, whereas gray pumice contains all types.\nWe propose the following pre-eruptive magma dynamics: A main reservoir with homogeneous rhyolitic magma containing type-A phenocrysts was underlain by a more mafic magma with type-C phenocrysts and a hybridized magma interface between them. This stratified reservoir was intruded by a more primitive mafic magma with type-B phenocrysts just prior to the eruption. Rhyolitic magma was ejected during all phases of the eruption, whereas other magmas partly mixed during phase 6B, a short time after the beginning of caldera collapse (phase 5A).",

            "abstract": "Detailed elasticity data on liquid Fe and candidate molten core alloys should offer new constraints on the under-constrained problem of Earth's core composition. Density, sound speed, and the gradient in sound speed with pressure are each potentially distinct experimental constraints and are each well-known for Earth. The gradient in sound speed, though, has not been used because sound speed depends on both T and P, such that data must be collected or reconstructed along the correct, nearly adiabatic, thermal profile. Reconstruction requires the Grüneisen γ, which is composition-dependent, and data over a large P-T space to allow extrapolation. Both static and dynamic compression methods could be used, but the conditions (140 - 330 GPa and 4000 - 6000 K) are very challenging for static methods and standard shock compression only samples the outer core P-T profile at a single P. Instead we are applying quasi-isentropic dynamic ramp compression, using pre-heating of the target and impedance of the leading edge of a graded-density impactor (GDI) to select a probable outer core isentrope. The target material is melted and raised to a point on the outer core isentrope by the initial shock, then quasi-isentropically ramped to a maximum P by increasing shock impedance of trailing GDI layers. Particle velocity is monitored by photonic doppler velocimetry (PDV) at two step thicknesses at the interface of Fe or Fe-alloy target and MgO windows. The difference in arrival time of each particle velocity at the two steps directly gives the Lagrangian sound speed vs. particle velocity, which is integrated to obtain Pand density.\nAt the writing of this abstract, we have completed one shot of this type. We successfully heated a two-step Fe target in a Mo capsule with MgO windows to 1350 °C, maintaining sufficient alignment and reflectivity to collect PDV signal returns. We characterized the velocity correction factor for PDV observation through MgO windows, and have confirmed that MgO remains sufficiently transparent on this loading path to act as a window. Our shot used a Mg-Ta graded density impactor launched at 5.6 km/s by the Caltech two-stage light gas gun, providing continuous sampling of the sound speed of liquid Fe from 70 GPa and ~2800 K up the isentrope to 243 GPa.

            "abstract": "Although the availability of satellite and ground based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data is increasing, application of AOD data in dust modeling is hindered because the AOD contains a non-dust signal as well. In this work, we extract the dust signal from AOD data using a novel approach by associating AOD with the surface wind. We then develop an empirical multiple regression model for predicting dust optical depth (DOD). For this purpose, we utilize long-term (2003-2012) MODIS satellite and GLDAS reanalysis gridded data. MODIS deep blue AOD was used as a dependent variable in the regression model whereas ERA-Interim surface wind and divergence, GLDAS soil moisture and soil temperature, and MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used as independent variables. Results show that wind and divergence are positively correlated with the DOD, whereas soil moisture, soil temperature, and NDVI are negatively correlated. The developed multiple regression model has an overall R-squared of 0.73 and root mean squared error of 0.39. Our model is useful in testing the performance of more physically based dust models and can be implemented in Earth System Models.",

            "abstract": "Most tsunami fatalities occur in near-field communities of earthquakes at offshore faults. Tsunami early warning is key for reducing the number of fatalities. Unfortunately, an earthquake’s magnitude often does not gauge the resulting tsunami power. Here we show that real-time GPS stations along coastlines are able to detect seafloor motions due to big earthquakes, and that the detected seafloor displacements are able to determine tsunami energy and scales instantaneously for early warnings. Our method focuses on estimating tsunami energy directly from seafloor motions because a tsunami’s potential or scale, no matter how it is defined, has to be proportional to the tsunami energy. Since seafloor motions are the only source of a tsunami, their estimation directly relates to the mechanism that generates tsunamis; therefore, it is a proper way of identifying earthquakes that are capable of triggering tsunamis, while being able to discriminate those particular earthquakes from false alarms. Examples of detecting the tsunami energy scales for the 2004 Sumatra M9.1 earthquake, the 2005 Nias M8.7 earthquake, the 2010 M8.8 Chilean earthquake, and the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake will be presented. The development of the Indo-Pacific GPS-Aided Tsunami Early Detection (GATED) system will be reported.",

            "abstract": "Except for a few localities, seismicity along faults in southern California is generally confined to depths shallower than 15 km. Among faults hosting deep seismicity, the Newport-Inglewood Fault (NIF), which traverses the Los-Angeles basin, has an exceptionally mild surface expression and low deformation rates. Moreover, the NIF structure is not as well resolved as other, less well instrumented faults because of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Here we use data from three temporary dense seismic arrays, which were deployed for exploration purposes and contain up to several thousands of vertical geophones, to investigate the properties of deep seismicity beneath Long-Beach (LB), Compton and Santa-Fe Springs (SFS). The latter is located 15 km northeast of the NIF, presumably above a major detachment fault underthrusting the basin.\nEvent detection is carried out using a new approach for microseismic multi-channel picking, in which downward-continued data are back-projected onto the volume beneath the arrays, and locations are derived from statistical analysis of back-projection images. Our technique reveals numerous, previously undetected events along the NIF, and confirms the presence of an active shallow structure gently dipping to the north beneath SFS. Seismicity characteristics vary along the NIF strike and dip. While LB seismicity is uncorrelated with the mapped trace of the NIF, Compton seismicity illuminates a sub-vertical fault that extends down to about 20 km. This result, along with the reported high flux of mantle Helium along the NIF (Boles et al., 2015), suggests that the NIF is deeply rooted and acts as a major conduit for mantle fluids. We find that the LB size distribution obeys the typical power-law at shallow depths, but falls off exponentially for events occurring below 20 km. Because deep seismicity occurs uniformly beneath LB, this transition is attributed to a reduction in seismic asperity density with increasing depth, consistent with a transition to a diffuse deformation regime.",

In 6.5 hours the D1974 flow was emplaced over the Keanakāko`i ash member as a rapidly emplaced sheet flow. This flow has previously been used as a location for radar roughness studies due to the exposure of abrupt changes in surface texture ranging between smooth pāhoehoe, rubbly and slabby lavas and ʻaʻā lava. When viewed in visible remote sensing images, this flow field displays dark and light toned areas that reveal sinuous patterns, streamlined islands, and rafted lava slabs and plates. The flow is an ideal location to study lava textures, textural relationships and the formation of non-traditional channels and associated features as analogs to characterizing the formation of channel networks on the flanks of martian volcanoes or rilles in the lunar mare.\nThe D1974 flow is also positioned downwind from Kīlauea Caldera along the volcano’s SW rift zone. D1974 lavas flowed across older, active fumaroles and have since been exposed to acid fog, rain, and other plume related processes. In 2008 the Kīlauea Caldera experienced an explosive event along the wall of Halemaʻumaʻu and has since displayed an active lava lake, thereby elevating the flow’s exposure to processes related to volcanic gasses. Alteration products have therefore formed both in and around the older fumaroles (at the solfatara site) as well as being deposited as thin coatings over the entire length of the flow. These products are reminiscent of sulfate-rich materials that have been identified on Mars by several groups. Though these martian deposits have been identified and analyzed, their formation mechanism remains somewhat ambiguous. The D1974 flow represents an ideal analog with which to test various formation scenarios using a variety of field portable technologies, designed to analyze the alteration products in situ (thereby preserving their initial structures and textures).",

Although most climate models predict a decreasing low cloud cover under long-term global warming, the ensemble of atmospheric models suggests that low cloud cover has increased during 1980-2008. Idealized experiments suggest that this difference is caused by the difference of SST warming pattern on the two timescales. The low cloud cover trend during the last three decades is likely to contribute to the recent global warming hiatus.

            "abstract": "The already fragile agriculture production system in West Africa faces further challenges in meeting food security in the coming decades, primarily due to a fast increasing population and risks of climate change. Successful adaptation of agriculture should not only benefit in the current climate but should also reduce negative (or enhance positive) impacts for climate change. Assessment of various possible adaptation options and their uncertainties provides key information for prioritizing adaptation investments. Here, based on the several robust aspects of climate projections in this region (i.e. temperature increases and rainfall pattern shifts), we use two well-validated crop models (i.e. APSIM and SARRA-H) and an ensemble of downscaled climate forcing to assess five possible and realistic adaptation options (late sowing, intensification, thermal time increase, water harvesting and increased resilience to heat stress) in West Africa for the staple crop production of sorghum. We adopt a new assessment framework to account for both the impacts of adaptation options in current climate and their ability to reduce impacts of future climate change, and also consider changes in both mean yield and its variability. Our results reveal that most proposed “adaptation options” are not more beneficial in the future than in the current climate, i.e. not really reduce the climate change impacts. Increased temperature resilience during grain number formation period is the main adaptation that emerges. We also find that changing from the traditional to modern cultivar, and later sowing in West Sahel appear to be robust adaptations.",

            "abstract": "Explaining the spatial distribution of intra-plate volcanism is an important geologic problem. The Walvis Ridge is a uniquely-shaped hotspot trail in the South Atlantic that is not fully explained by the prevailing mantle plume paradigm. About halfway through its 130 Myr history, Walvis shows a morphological shift from a continuous ridge to a diffuse region of guyots arranged in two volcanic tracks. Recent volcanism at both Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island suggests these tracks are produced by two hotspots sourced from a single plume. However, the islands are located more than 400 km apart, which does not conform to our understanding of plumes as narrow, semi-stationary upwellings. It remains unclear which of the two islands better represents the current plume position. New ages from previously unstudied seamounts show that Tristan is younger than surrounding volcanism, whereas Gough appears to fit the local age progression (Schnur et al. 2014). Modern radiometric ages suggest the main island of Tristan may have been active for up to 1.3 ± 0.2 Myr (O’Connor and le Roex 1992). However, the seemingly older Inaccessible, Nightingale and Middle islands have yet to be reliably dated and could be up to 18 ± 4 Ma based on K-Ar ages (Miller in Baker et al. 1964). In order to confidently delineate the duration of volcanism at Tristan, we present the results of 29 new 40Ar/39Ar step-heating experiments on biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and groundmass separates from rocks collected on Inaccessible, Nightingale and Middle islands. Our results show that volcanism on all three islands is young, in most cases < 600 ka. Previous ages from Nightingale and Middle islands are therefore too old and should be ignored in interpretations of plume dynamics. These results also show that magma was being supplied simultaneously to both Tristan and Gough over recent geologic time. Two possible explanations for this are that (1) there is a broad plume underlying the area, with focus points at Tristan and Gough or (2) hotspot magma is being focused at Tristan due to the nearby fracture zone, explaining a lack of other volcanoes within a 150 km radius of the island group. A major limitation is that available samples may represent post-erosional volcanism. Dredging of the deep flanks of the islands is necessary to determine the full duration of volcanism at Tristan.",

            "abstract": "Single-channel algorithms for satellite thermal-infrared- (TIR-) derived land and sea surface skin temperature (LST and SST) are advantageous in that they can be easily applied to a variety of satellite sensors. They can also accommodate decade-spanning instrument series, particularly for periods when split-window capabilities are not available. However, the benefit of one unified retrieval methodology for all sensors comes at the cost of critical sensitivity to surface emissivity (εs) and atmospheric transmittance estimation. It has been demonstrated that as little as 0.01 variance in εs can amount to more than a 0.5-K adjustment in retrieved LST values. Atmospheric transmittance requires calculations that employ vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Selection of a given NWP model can significantly affect LST and SST agreement relative to their respective validation sources. Thus, it is necessary to understand the accuracies of the retrievals for various NWP models to ensure the best LST/SST retrievals. The sensitivities of the single-channel retrievals to surface emittance and NWP profiles are investigated using NASA Langley historic land and ocean clear-sky skin temperature (Ts) values derived from high-resolution 11-μm TIR brightness temperature measured from geostationary satellites (GEOSat) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR). It is shown that mean GEOSat-derived, anisotropy-corrected LST can vary by up to ±0.8 K depending on whether CERES or MODIS εs sources are used. Furthermore, the use of either NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) or NASA Goddard Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) for the radiative transfer model initial atmospheric state can account for more than 0.5-K variation in mean Ts. The results are compared to measurements from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD), an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program ground station, and NOAA ESRL high-resolution Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST). Precise understanding of the influence these auxiliary inputs have on final satellite-based Ts retrievals may help guide refinement in εs characterization and NWP development, e.g., future Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System versions.",

            "abstract": "Animals make decisions about the suitability of habitat and their reaction to other organisms based on the sensory information that they first obtain. This information is transmitted, masked and filtered by fluvial processes, such as turbulent flow. Despite governing how animals interact with the environment, limited attention has been paid to the controls on the propagation of sensory signals through rivers.\nSome animals interpret hydraulic events and use the characteristics of wakes to sense the presence of other organisms. This implies that at least some animals can differentiate turbulent flow generated by the presence of living organisms from ambient environmental turbulence. We investigate whether there are specific flow characteristics, distinct from the ambient environment, that potentially flag the presence of organisms to other animals.\nADV and PIV measurements in a series of laboratory flume experiments quantified the flow around living Signal Crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and two inanimate objects of equivalent shape and size. Experiments were repeated across a gradient of turbulence intensities generated over nine combinations of flow velocity and relative submergence.\nFlows downstream of living crayfish were distinct from inanimate objects, with greater turbulent intensities, higher energy in low- to intermediate frequencies, and flow structures that were less coherent in comparison to those measured downstream of inanimate objects. However, the hydrodynamic signature of crayfish became masked as the intensity of ambient turbulence exceeded that generated by living crayfish.\nThese results demonstrate the importance of the fluvial processes in the transmission of sensory information and suggest that the ability of animals to perceive hydraulic signatures is likely to be limited in many situations in rivers. Thus, animals may need to rely on other senses, such as sight or hearing, especially where depth is shallow relative to grain size.",

            "abstract": "Rocky hillslopes that exhibit large blocks of rock and thin, non-uniform cover of mobile regolith are common in both steep landscapes and arid environments, as well as on other planets. While the evolution of homogeneous, soil-mantled, convex hillslopes can be well modeled, the influence of lithology and geologic structure on hillslope form and evolution has yet to be properly addressed. As a first case, we study hillslopes developed during exhumation of a near-vertical several-meter wide mid-Tertiary basalt dike intruded into Cretaceous shale at Shiprock, New Mexico. The dike stands several to several tens of meters above the tops of adjacent hundred-meter long slopes that grade onto flats. Profiles of the hillslopes reveal steep 30° slopes adjacent to the dike, with a narrow (~5-10 m) convexity, beyond which the slopes become broadly concave. Field observations suggest that the dike deteriorates in two distinct ways: hard cm-scale flakes from both the dike and the adjacent rapidly heated shale peel off the wall, while meter-scale basalt blocks tumble onto the hillslope in rare events. Both of these products differ dramatically from the weak, fine-grained shale chips derived from weathering of the subjacent shale. The size and percent cover of both flakes and blocks decreases downslope away from the dike. We hypothesize that coverage of the surface by basalt clasts modulates both the velocity of the mobile regolith cover and the rate of weathering of the underlying shale. We employ a numerical model to explore the conditions required to capture the essence of the observed slopes. A continuum model tracks regolith production, regolith flux, and areal concentration of small surface clasts. Treated as discrete elements, large blocks are allowed to change size to mimic weathering decay, and their presence alters the flow of regolith. This acknowledgement of the roles of lithology and structure on hillslope evolution takes us one step toward models of other features such as hogbacks, cuestas, flatirons and escarpments.\n ",

            "abstract": "Modeling floods events across large floodplains is challenging because flows respond to dynamic hydraulic controls from several water sources, complex geomorphology, and vegetation. In the Amazon basin, the recently liberated SRTM Global 1 arc-second (SRTMGL1) remains the best topographic information in view of hydrodynamic modeling purposes. Its accuracy is however hindered by errors partly due to vegetation leading to erroneous simulations. Previous efforts to remove the vegetation signal do not account for its spatial variability or relied on upon single assumed percentage of penetration of the SRTM signal.\nIn this study, we propose to a systematic approach, over an Amazonian floodplain (Fig. 1), to remove the vegetation signal, which consider its heterogeneity combining estimates of vegetation height and land cover map. We improve this approach by interpolating first results with drainage network, field and altimetry data to obtain a hydrological conditioned DEM.\nAveraged interferometric and vegetation bias over the forest zone were found to be -2.0 m and 7.4 m, respectively (Fig. 2). Comparing original DEM and corrected one, vertical validation against Ground Control Points shows a RMSE diminution of 64%. Floodplain inundation was simulated using the 3D model IPH-ECO model. Flood extent accuracy, controlled against ALOS-PALSAR and JERS-1 images, stresses improvements at low and high waters (Fig. 3). This study also highlights that a ground truth drainage network as unique input during the interpolation permits reaching reasonable in terms of flood extent and hydrological characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Sediment transport in steep landscapes may be facilitated by both water-dominated flows and debris-flow processes. Given the differences in erosion potential and mobility possessed by runoff and debris flows, knowledge of the conditions that determine the runoff-to-debris-flow transition has important implications for hazard assessment as well as our understanding of the long-term evolution of steep bedrock channels. Debris flows in alpine areas and burned steeplands are frequently triggered by runoff following high-intensity rainfall, but the mechanics by which runoff generates a debris flow are not well understood. To examine the connections between runoff and debris flow initiation, we developed a numerical model that couples overland flow with sediment transport and debris-flow processes. We applied the model to study erosion and debris-flow initiation that occurred during a rainfall event that produced numerous debris flows within a burned drainage basin in the San Gabriel Mountains, CA, USA. Input data for the numerical model was constrained by rain gauges, stage measurements at the basin outlet, soil-moisture sensors, and high-resolution topographic data obtained using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Numerical model predictions, which compare well with TLS-derived measurements of topographic change, indicate that hillslope erosion at our study site was primarily the result of raindrop-induced sediment transport. Further, results indicate that the majority of sediment eroded from the hillslopes was deposited within the channel system during the storm with only minor amounts being transported out of the basin in suspension. Based on model results, we hypothesize that numerous debris flows were generated from the mass failure of sediment dams that built up within the channel system throughout the storm. This study adds to our understanding of sediment transport in steep landscapes and provides insight into the topographic and hydrologic factors that transform runoff into debris flow.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 348 set a new record for sampling depth by scientific ocean drilling. Cores were recovered from the Nankai accretionary prism (Site C0002) at depths of 2163-2218 mbsf; cuttings were recovered continuously to 3058 mbsf. Shallower strata near the top of the accretionary prism are as young as 5.6 Ma, but the deeper interval has an apparent depositional age of 9.56-10.73 Ma. The structural context is within the hanging wall of a megasplay fault. Quantitative analyses of the clay mineral assemblages (using X-ray diffraction) show that the most abundant clay mineral is smectite, followed by illite, chlorite, and kaolinite. The mudstones at Site C0002 contain significantly lower percentages of smectite (~40% of clay-size fraction) as compared to coeval Miocene strata at Sites C0011 and C0012 in the nearby subduction inputs of Shikoku Basin (>50% of clay-size fraction). One likely reason for the difference is an overprint of detrital assemblages by smectite-to-illite diagenesis, which results in a steady down-hole increase in illite within the I/S mixed-layer phase. Another possible reason, however, is a spatial shift in depositional environments and detrital provenance. The mud-dominant facies of the accretionary prism is enigmatic (when compared to the frontal prism), and its original depositional setting remains uncertain. The accreted mudstones might have been deposited in a trench during a period in which supplies of sandy sediment were restricted. Northwestward migration of a triple junction that joins the Japan, Izu-Bonin, and Nankai plate boundaries also might have played a role, either by reducing the rate of plate convergence at ~7-12 Ma or by shifting pre-accretion depositional settings from the NE side of the triple junction (subducting Pacific plate) to the SW side (Shikoku Basin, subducting Philippine Sea plate). Regardless of the exact paleogeography, we predict that lower initial percentages of detrital smectite and gradual diagenetic loss of smectite with depth combine to progressively reduce the volumetric contribution of pore fluid from I/S dehydration toward the base of the hanging wall, in contrast to fluids sourced from smectite-rich sediments below the megasplay at potentially seismogenic depths.",

The Toklat River in Denali National Park and Preserve, a 135-km-long braided tributary of the Kantishna River draining the north-facing slopes of the Alaska Range, exemplifies these challenges. Eight decades of localized channel confinement due to installation of a causeway in the 1930’s and over three decades of gravel extraction since the 1980’s have occurred on the Toklat River where it crosses the Denali Park Road. Research associated with these disturbances has developed a unique multi-scalar and temporally diverse dataset that records the responses of the river over a 10-km reach. We have evaluated trends in short-term sediment storage through lidar differencing and analyzed long-term planform change through morphologic metrics such as braiding index, active braidplain width, and percentage of occupied floodplain derived from aerial photographs. Two reference reaches along comparable adjacent braided rivers, with varying levels of confinement and no gravel extraction, illuminate the relative influence of confinement and gravel extraction on sediment flux and planform changes. Preliminary comparisons of lidar-derived DEMs show volumetric decrease in sediment within the active braidplain within the gravel extraction area and downstream of the causeway, suggesting enhanced degradation due to both extraction and confinement. Areas of braidplain degradation also show increasing variance in surface elevations and decreasing braidplain width and braiding index with time. These data support the usage of morphologic metrics to identify long-term degradation trends in large, braided systems where detailed elevation data are unavailable. Despite the pronounced local expression of sediment discontinuity, watershed topography and zones of long-term sediment storage in this system appear to spatially constrain morphologic responses triggered by human disturbances. These findings suggest a spectrum of river resilience relevant to Park management of the Toklat River in particular, and valuable to improving contextual assessments of disturbed braided river systems in general.",

Designing observation networks that capture land surface spatial heterogeneity is a critical scientific challenge. Here, we present a geospatial approach to capture the existing spatial heterogeneity of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks across Alaska, USA. We used the standard deviation of 556 georeferenced SOC profiles previously compiled in Mishra and Riley (2015, Biogeosciences, 12:3993-4004) to calculate the number of observations that would be needed to reliably estimate Alaskan SOC stocks. This analysis indicated that 906 randomly distributed observation sites would be needed to quantify the mean value of SOC stocks across Alaska at a confidence interval of ± 5 kg m-2. We then used soil-forming factors (climate, topography, land cover types, surficial geology) to identify the locations of appropriately distributed observation sites by using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling approach. Spatial correlation and variogram analyses demonstrated that the spatial structures of soil-forming factors were adequately represented by these 906 sites. Using the spatial correlation length of existing SOC observations, we identified 484 new observation sites would be needed to provide the best estimate of the present status of SOC stocks in Alaska. We then used average decadal projections (2020–2099) of precipitation, temperature, and length of growing season for three representative concentration pathway (RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to investigate whether the location of identified observation sites will shift/change under future climate. Our results showed 12-41 additional observation sites (depending on emission scenarios) will be required to capture the impact of projected climatic conditions by 2100 on the spatial heterogeneity of Alaskan SOC stocks. Our results represent an ideal distribution of observation sites across Alaska that captures the land surface spatial heterogeneity and can be used in efforts to quantify SOC stocks, monitor greenhouse gas emissions, and benchmark Earth System Model results.",

The observational data comes from over 30 watersheds varying in cover from undeveloped to highly urban and in spatial scale from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. The modelling study includes a conservation (~35% urban), megalopolitan (~34% urban) and business as usual scenario (~38% urban) for land use change due to regional population growth. All land use change scenarios result in significant increases in watershed streamflow. Depending upon pattern of urbanization, streamflow increased as much 88% in some watershed locations; demonstrating the potential to partially meet water resources demands in the region with water produced by the urbanization process. This water could be used regionally or locally, and significant efforts at implementing water harvesting in the region have been pursued. However, the ability to scale such implementation and overcome the physical, and social barriers to implementation are currently unquantified.",

            "abstract": "Patterns of high-reflectance loops and ribbons known as swirls are not uncommon on the Moon, but are apparently unique to this body. We mapped their distribution and extent using ultraviolet–visible images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. We find swirls are much more extensive than previously known within the South Pole–Aitken Basin, and constitute a single grouping larger than the previously mapped swirls that extend from Mare Marginis to King crater. We also identify a host of smaller features including swirls near craters Abel, Crozier, Dewar, and Dufay X. All mapped swirls have magnetic field strengths shifted to higher values than their background, though there is not a 1:1 correspondence between the locations of swirls and all magnetic anomalies. Swirls are found in regions with iron abundances shifted to higher-than-background values; their formation may be inhibited by low iron content. The most distinguishing characteristic of swirls is a low 321/415 nm ratio coupled with moderate to high reflectance, and swirls generally have higher optical maturity (OMAT) parameter values, stronger 1-µm bands, and shallower normalized continuum slopes than their surroundings, consistent with materials that have experienced less space weathering. However, some swirls cannot be discerned in OMAT or band-depth images, and have only moderate reflectance. Areas with low 321/415 nm ratios but non-distinct visible–near-infrared properties could be related to the presence of a glassy component with limited embedded submicroscopic iron. Swirl color properties vary with distance from Copernican and some Eratosthenian craters; they have lower UV ratios, higher reflectance, and higher OMAT values close to these craters. The association with Eratosthenian craters may suggest swirls preserve fresh material exposed by impact craters longer than in non-swirl regions; the difference between swirls and Copernican craters implies that the majority of swirls have reached some degree of maturity or have some other property that results in spectral characteristics that are distinct from those of fresh craters.",

We call the approach the Permafrost Carbon Network Incubation–Panarctic Thermal scaling approach (PInc–PanTher). The approach assumes that C stocks do not decompose at all when frozen, but once thawed follow set decomposition trajectories as a function of soil temperature. The trajectories are determined according to a 3-pool decomposition model fitted to incubation data using parameters specific to soil horizon types. We calculate litterfall C inputs required to maintain steady-state C balance for the current climate, and hold those inputs constant. Soil temperatures are taken from the soil thermal modules of ecosystem model simulations forced by a common set of future climate change anomalies under two warming scenarios over the period 2010 to 2100.",

We are taking steps to remove these barriers by developing a GPS data analysis system capable of processing all openly available data from over 13,500 continuously operating stations from around the globe. This rigorous and automated system will provide processing free of charge and will greatly ease access to GPS position time series that can be used for rapid modeling and analysis of natural hazards from earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, hydrologic changes, and other applications. It is envisioned that availability of this unique resource will encourage open sharing of data and products and enable building scientific capacity in areas that are currently sparsely sampled with GPS such as Africa.\nWe provide daily and 5-minute position time series and quality control products, with latency between 2 hours and 1 day. The users submit data to the UNAVCO archive where the Data Center services provide data ingestion, access, formatting and cataloging of accurate metadata including proper source attribution. UNR picks up hourly and/or daily data files from the UNAVCO archive and processes the data using products provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), including ultra-rapid GPS orbits and clock parameters, and JPL’s GIPSY OASIS II software. The processed time series are presented in global (IGS08) and North America (NA12) reference frames, together with post-processed station quality control data, are cataloged in a Geodetic Seamless Archive Centers (GSAC) database that is searchable and accessible via web browsers or via newly developed simple RESTful web services. In addition, station velocities are estimated and updated automatically every week. To ensure utility of the products, AfricaArray, USGS, and JPL collaborators are included in the testing and evaluation and short courses will provide training on how to provide data to the system and utilize products.",

Regional climate models (RCMs) resolve this record over the last few decades across the entire ice sheet and can be evaluated at ice cores, but the latter are sparse. Hence, a significant gap exists in our knowledge of the recent spatial pattern of Greenland Ice Sheet accumulation rates, particularly at centennial scales. To address this gap, we comprehensively traced the shallow (< ~500 m) radiostratigraphy detected during four years (2011–2014) of airborne UHF “accumulation radar” data collection by the Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, as part of Operation IceBridge. These traced reflectors are typically ~20–1,050 years old and hence suitable for inferring benchmark centennial-scale accumulation-rate patterns across the Greenland Ice Sheet. We compared these patterns with those from a similar analysis of an existing deeper radiostratigraphy of the ice sheet and with outputs from multiple RCMs. This analysis reveals regions of the ice sheet where accumulation rates vary significantly over time, presumably due to the influence of synoptic-scale climatic variability. These results can also improve modeling efforts for regions where RCM-estimated modern accumulation rates are biased compared to long-term patterns.",

In this presentation it will be shown analytically that RMSE at times misrepresents model performance. A decomposition technique is proposed to describe more precisely RMSE distributions. Conventional RMSE can be decomposed into Error of Mean Difference (Em) and Error of Patter Variation (Ep). Ep is unbiased and can be used as an objective measure of model performance only if the anomalous pattern correlation (R) between forecast and analysis approaches to one. If R is small, Ep is biased and favors smoother forecasts that have smaller variances. Ep normalized by analysis variance is still biased and favors forecasts with smaller variance if anomalous pattern correlation is not perfect. A comprehensive evaluation of model errors should include Anomalous Pattern Correlation, Ratio of Forecast Variance to Analysis Variance, Error of Mean Difference, and Error of Pattern Variation. NCEP Global Forecast Systems with different configurations will be used to demonstrate the decomposition technique, which will be applied to both scalar variables and vector winds. At the end, the advantage and limitation of using data assimilation analysis increments to diagnose model biases will be discussed.",

Radar returns from altimeters are impacted by the morphology of snow and ice features on the surface as well as the characteristics of radar pulse penetration through the snow pack. Together these contribute to uncertainty in the procedures for deriving sea ice freeboard from radar altimeter data. We make use of dense lidar grids and airborne snow radar measurements, collected on the sea ice pack north of Barrow, Alaska by the Naval Research Laboratory in 2014 and 2015, to investigate the effect of ice surface morphology on radar altimeter measurements. We quantify the effect of surface morphology using a nested approach that includes forward modeling, snow radar data and a comprehensive set of in situ measurements. Our results allow us to better constrain the altimetric uncertainty resulting from ice surface morphology, with respect to ice type. This will lead to an enhanced understanding of sources of uncertainty in altimeter-derived sea ice thickness products.",

We present here our experience based on the open source development of an Earth System Model focusing on the propagation of water flow waves in large river networks: the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID). Since inception of RAPID ten years ago in January 2006, the community of its users has grown slowly but steadily, and now includes researchers in industry, academia, and government organizations. This growth of the RAPID users community can be explained – at least in part – by its open availability. However, despite an increasing support for open science (software and data), the mechanics of sharing still remain mysterious to many geoscientists… as they were for the authors. The purpose of this presentation is therefore to shed light on the steps involved in opening software and data based on a decade of experience related to the development and release of an Earth System Model. Three distinct steps of open sourcing are highlighted here: opening, exposing, and automatic testing. Each one of these steps is presented as an independent and tractable increment at various stages of development that is justified based on the size of the users community. Topics covered include software and data licenses, code and data repositories, unit testing, and continuous integration.",

This study applied a state-space model to 22 years (1993-2014) of publicly available hourly load data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection. Prior to our analysis, we removed long-term trends which are usually considered to be related to socio-economic and demographic factors, in the various sub-regions of the PJM interconnection to focus on the response to weather. The state-space models were comprised of weekly cycle, autoregressive-moving average components, and regressions on temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed variables. A separate model was fitted for each hour of the day. We found that the best relationship between temperature and electricity load may occur with a lag depending on the time of the day. The base temperature giving optimal mean squared residual magnitude was found to be lower than the 65 oF (18.3 oC) value traditionally used for cooling- and heating-degree days calculations. Relative humidity, wind speed, and sometimes a past temperature-variability term also increased the predicative power of the model.

            "abstract": "Convective storms on the evening of July 21, 2015 generated a number of debris flows on the SE flank of Mount Shasta Volcano, Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Widespread rilling, gullying and sheet erosion occurred throughout the affected area. These storms damaged roads by scouring drainage ditches, blocking culverts, eroding road prisms, and depositing debris where streams emerged from their incised channels and flowed over their alluvial fans. Effects were limited geographically to a narrow band about 6 miles wide trending in a northeasterly direction. Debris flows were identified at Pilgrim Creek and nearby channels, and Mud Creek appears to have experienced sediment laden flows rather than debris flows. Doppler radar data reveal that the storm cells remained nearly stationary for two hours before moving in a northeasterly direction.\n  Debris flows triggered by convective storms occur often at Mount Shasta, with a similar event recorded in 2003 and a larger one in 1935, which also involved glacial melt. The 1935 debris flow at Whitney Creek buried Highway 97 north of Weed, CA, and took out the railroad above the highway. In September, 2014, a large debris flow occurred in Mud Creek, but it was associated solely with glacial melt and was not accompanied by rain. The 2014 event at Mud Creek filled the channel and parts of the floodplain with debris. This debris was in turn reworked and eroded by sediment laden flows on July 21, 2015.\n  This study was initiated in August, 2015, and began with field inventories to identify storm effects. Lidar data will be used to identify possible avulsion points that could result in unexpected flash flooding outside of the main Mud Creek channel and on adjacent streams. The results of this study will provide critical information that can be used to assess flash flood risk and better understand how to manage those risks. Finally, some conclusions may be drawn on the kinds of warning systems that may be appropriate for possible flash flood events and possible effective road designs for stream crossings and road surface drainage.",

            "abstract": "To make a prediction for the propagation of seismic pulses, one needs to specify physical properties and subsurface ground structure of the site. This information is frequently unknown or estimated with significant uncertainty. We developed a methodology for the ensemble prediction of the propagation of weak seismic pulses for short ranges. The ranges of interest are 10-100 of meters, and the pulse bandwidth is up to 200 Hz. Instead of specifying specific values for viscoelastic site properties, the methodology operates with probability distribution functions of the inputs. This yields ensemble realizations of the pulse at specified locations, where mean, median, and maximum likelihood predictions can be made, and confidence intervals are estimated. Starting with the site’s Vs30, the methodology creates an ensemble of plausible vertically stratified Vs profiles for the site. The number and thickness of the layers are modeled using inhomogeneous Poisson process, and the Vs values in the layers are modeled by Gaussian correlated process. The Poisson expectation rate and Vs correlation between adjacent layers take into account layers depth and thickness, and are specific for a site class, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). High-fidelity three-dimension thin layer method (TLM) is used to yield an ensemble of frequency response functions. Comparison with experiments revealed that measured signals are not always within the predicted ensemble. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis has shown that the most significant parameter in the TLM for the prediction of the pulse energy is the shear quality factor, Qs. Some strategies how to account for significant uncertainty in this parameter and to improve accuracy of the ensemble predictions for a specific site are investigated and discussed.",

Sediment recovery includes coarse silt to fine sand turbidite deposits spanning the late Miocene with a mineralogical composition indicating provenance predominantly from the Indus River catchment. We analyzed the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C values) of plant waxes and found a +9‰ shift in δ13C values of C28, C30 and C32 n-alkanoic acids. We infer that this carbon isotopic shift is the regional, offshore expression of the C4 expansion previously reported from the Siwalik Formation at the foreland of the Himalaya. Fortuitously the C4 expansion occurs at a time with frequent magnetic reversals into and out of Chrons C3B to C3A. Based on the shipboard age model for U1457, the isotopic shift occurs in C3Ar, an interval of 0.4 Myr with a sediment accumulation rate of 50 m/Myr. This allows us to securely date the Indus Fan transition to within 7-6 Ma on the geomagnetic polarity timescale. Independent of absolute age uncertainties, magnetostratigraphy allows us to report that the shifts were coincident in the Siwaliks and the broader region sampled by the Indus Fan. Based on the δ13C values of plant waxes at and after 6Ma (ca. -21‰) in the Indus Fan, the lowland Indus catchment must have been dominated by C4 grasslands.",

The near surface geology of Muscat varies from hard rocks in the eastern, southern and western parts to dense and lose sediments in the middle and northern parts. Liquefaction occurs in saturated cohesionless soils when its shear strength decreased to zero due to the increase of pore pressure. More than 500 boreholes in Muscat area were examined for their liquefaction susceptibility based on the soil characteristics data. Only soils susceptible to liquefaction are further considered for liquefaction hazard assessment. Liquefaction occurs if the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) caused by the earthquake is higher than the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) of the soil. CSR values were evaluated using PGA values at the surface obtained from previously conducted seismic hazard and microzonation studies. CRR for Muscat region is conducted using N values of SPT tests from numerous borehole data and the shear wave velocity results from 99 MASW surveys over the entire region. All the required corrections are conducted to get standardized (N1) 60 values, to correct shear-wave velocity, and scale the results for Mw 6.0 instead of the proposed 7.5 (magnitude scaling factor). Liquefaction hazard maps are generated using the minimum factor of safety (FS) at each site as a representative of the FS against liquefaction at that location. Results indicate that under the current level of seismic hazard, liquefaction potential is possible at few sites along the northern coast where alluvial soils and shallow ground water table are present. The expected soft soil settlement is also evaluated at each liquefiable site.",

            "abstract": "Despite their incredible diversity and importance to terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are not included in a standard high school science curriculum. This past summer, however, my work for the Stanford EARTH High School Internship program introduced me to fungal ecology through experiments involving culturing, genomics and root dissections. The two fungal experiments I worked on had very different foci, both searching for answers to broad ecological questions of fungal function and physiology. The first, a symbiosis experiment, sought to determine if the partners of the nutrient exchange between pine trees and their fungal symbionts could choose one another. The second experiment, a dung fungal succession project, compared the genetic sequencing results of fungal extractions from dung versus fungal cultures from dung. My part in the symbiosis experiment involved dissection, weighing and encapsulation of root tissue samples characterized based on the root thickness and presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The dung fungi succession project required that I not only learn how to culture various genera of dung fungi but also learn how to extract DNA and RNA for sequencing from the fungal tissue. Although I primarily worked with dung fungi cultures and thereby learned about their unique physiologies, I also learned about the different types of genetic sequencing since the project compared sequences of cultured fungi versus Next Generation sequencing of all fungi present within a dung pellet. Through working on distinct fungal projects that reassess how information about fungi is known within the field of fungal ecology, I learned not only about the two experiments I worked on but also many past related experiments and inquiries through reading scientific papers. Thanks to my foray into fungal research, I now know not only the broader significance of fungi in ecological research but also how to design and conduct ecological experiments.",

            "abstract": "Raman and synchrotron-based single crystal x-ray diffraction data have been collected on shortite (Na2Ca2(CO3)3) up to 10 GPa at 300 K. Shortite is of geological importance due to its presence in the ground-mass of kimberlites, and the alkaline-/carbon-rich character of kimberlitic eruptions. This investigation focuses on shortite's high pressure behavior and is relevant to the behavior of alkali-carbonate systems within Earth's upper mantle. X-ray data demonstrate that shortite's symmetry remains stable at high pressures—retaining orthorhombic C crystal system (Amm2) up to 10 GPa; diffraction data show a 12% volume decrease from room pressure, and a bulk modulus of 71.0(3) GPa. These also demonstrate that the c-axis is twice as compressible as the a- and b-axes. This anisotropic compression is likely due to the orientation of the relatively stiff carbonate groups, a third of which are oriented close to the plane of the a- and b-axes, c axis compression primarily involves the compaction of the 9-fold coordinate sodium and calcium polyhedral. The two distinct carbonate sites within the unit cell give rise to two Raman symmetric stretching modes of the symmetric stretch; the carbonate group stretching vibration which is close to in plane with the a- and b-axes shifts at 3.75 cm-1/GPa as opposed to the carbonate groups which is closer to in plane with the b- and c-axes which shift at 4.25 cm-1/GPa. This furthers evidence for anisotropic compression observed using x-ray diffraction--as the carbonate in plane with the a- and b-axes is compressed, the strength of oxygen bonds along the c-axis with the cations increases, thus decreasing the pressure shift of the mode. The out of plane bending vibration shifts at -0.48 cm-1/GPa, indicating an enhanced interaction of the oxygens with the cations. The multiple in plane bending modes all shift positively, as do at the low frequency lattice modes, indicating that major changes in bonding do not occur up to 10 GPa. The data collected indicates that this phase is stable at 300 K to 10 GPa. The anisotropic compaction of this alkali-rich carbonate appears to be governed by the orientation of the sodium sites, thus the behavior of alkali-rich carbonates within the kimberlitic systems is likely dependent on the bonding and local geometry of alkali cations.",

            "abstract": "One reason why coupled climate model simulations generally do not reproduce the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent may be that their internally generated climate variability does not sync with the observed phases of phenomena like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and ENSO. For example, it is unlikely for a free-running coupled model simulation to capture the shift of the PDO from its positive to negative phase during 1998, and the subsequent ~15 year duration of the negative PDO phase. In previously presented work based on atmospheric models forced by observed tropical SSTs and stratospheric ozone, we demonstrated that tropical variability is key to explaining the wind trends over the Southern Ocean during the past ~35 years, particularly in the Ross, Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, the regions of the largest trends in sea ice extent and ice season duration. Here, we extend this idea to coupled model simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which the evolution of SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific is constrained to match the observations. This ensemble of 10 “tropical pacemaker” simulations shows a more realistic evolution of Antarctic sea ice anomalies than does its unconstrained counterpart, the CESM Large Ensemble (both sets of runs include stratospheric ozone depletion and other time-dependent radiative forcings). In particular, the pacemaker runs show that increased sea ice in the eastern Ross Sea is associated with a deeper Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and stronger westerlies over the south Pacific. These circulation patterns in turn are linked with the negative phase of the PDO, characterized by negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific. The timing of tropical decadal variability with respect to ozone depletion further suggests a strong role for tropical variability in the recent acceleration of the Antarctic sea ice trend, as ozone depletion stabilized by late 1990s, prior to the most recent major shift in tropical climate. In the pacemaker runs, the positive sea ice trend in the eastern Ross Sea is stronger during the most recent period (~2000-2014) than it is during period of rapid ozone depletion (~1980-1996).",

In spite of their tremendous episodic impacts on the health, economy and mood of the region, climate-scale behavior of SAW is poorly understood. In the present work, we identify SAWs in mesoscale dynamical downscaling of a global reanalysis product and construct an hourly SAW catalogue spanning 65 years. We describe the long-term SAW climatology at relevant time-space resolutions, i.e, we developed local and regional SAW indices and analyse their variability on hourly, daily, annual, and multi-decadal timescales. Local and regional SAW indices are validated with available anemometer observations. Characteristic behaviors are revealed, e.g. the SAW intensity-duration relationship. At interdecadal time scales, we find that seasonal SAW activity is sensitive to prominent large-scale low-frequency modes of climate variability rooted in the tropical and north Pacific ocean-atmosphere system that are also known to affect the hydroclimate of this region. Lastly, we do not find any long-term trend in SAW frequency and intensity as previously reported. Instead, we identify a significant long-term trend in SAW behavior whereby contribution of extreme SAW events to total seasonal SAW activity has been increasing at the expense of moderate events. These findings motivate further investigation on SAW evolution in future climate and its impact on wildfires.",

The inherent duty cycle, dynamic range, mass accuracy, and resolving power of these instruments provide transformative capabilities for deriving new insights into atmospheric composition. We present examples of these capabilities from the deployments of the University of Washington HRToF-CIMS aboard research aircraft, an eddy flux tower in a boreal forest, and to measure organic aerosol composition upon temperature-programmed thermal desorption in field and chamber experiments. Specific examples include measurements of reactive halogens with all relevant isotopes simultaneously resolved from potential interferences, the opportunity for discovery, after the fact, of previously unmeasured or unexpected compounds with acquisition of the full mass spectrum, and providing a broad survey of the 100s of organic compounds that desorb from complex isoprene and monoterpene derived secondary organic aerosol matrices. While there are unique opportunities, there are also significant technical challenges to realizing the full analytical potential these instruments can provide. Many of these challenges are common to any analytical technique, but perhaps seemingly more demanding for HRToF-CIMS, such as the presumed need to calibrate 100s of molecular ion signals routinely detected in each spectrum. We detail some of the more pressing challenges and our approach towards addressing them.",

In order to identify potential solutions to increase food security in the face of these changes, tools that can rapidly and accurately assess farm productivity are needed. With this aim, we have developed generalizable methods to map crop yields at the field scale using a combination of satellite imagery and crop models, and implement this approach within Google Earth Engine. We use these methods to examine wheat yield trends in Northern India, which provides over 15% of the global wheat supply and where over 80% of farmers rely on wheat as a staple food source. In addition, we identify the extent to which farmers are shifting sow date in response to heat stress, and how well shifting sow date reduces the negative impacts of heat stress on yield. To identify local-level decision-making, we map wheat sow date and yield at a high spatial resolution (30 m) using Landsat satellite imagery from 1980 to the present. This unique dataset allows us to examine sow date decisions at the field scale over 30 years, and by relating these decisions to weather experienced over the same time period, we can identify how farmers learn and adapt cropping decisions based on weather through time.",

            "abstract": "Jakobshavn Isbræ (JKS) is one of the largest marine terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland, feeding a fjord about 800 m deep in the west coast. JKS sped up more than twofold since 2002 and contributed nearly 1 mm of global sea level rise during the period from 2000 to 2011. Holland et al. (2008) posit that these changes coincided with a change in ocean conditions beneath the former ice tongue, yet little is known about the depth of the glacier at its grounding line and upstream of the grounding line and the sea floor depth of the fjord is not well known either. Here, we present a new approach to infer the glacier bed topography, ice thickness and sea floor bathymetry near the grounding line of JKS using high-resolution airborne gravity data from AirGRAV. AirGRAV data were collected in August 2012 from a helicopter platform. The data combined with radio echo sounding data, discrete point soundings in the fjord and the mass conservation approach on land ice. AirGRAV acquired a 500m spacing grid of free-air gravity data at 50 knots with sub-milligal accuracy, i.e. much higher than NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB)'s 5.2km resolution at 290 knots. We use a 3D inversion of the gravity data combining our observations and a forward modeling of the surrounding gravity field, and constrained at the boundary by radar echo soundings and point bathymetry. We reconstruct seamless bed topography at the grounding line that matches interior data and the sea floor bathymetry. The results reveal the true depth at the elbow of the terminal valley and the bed reversal in the proximity of the current grounding line. The analysis provides guidelines for future gravity survey of narrow fjords in terms of spatial resolution and gravity precision. The results also demonstrate the practicality of using high resolution gravity survey to resolve bed topography near glacier snouts, in places where radar sounding has been significantly challenged in the past. The inversion results are critical to re-interpret the recent evolution of JKS and reduce uncertainties in projecting its future contribution to sea level. This work was conducted at UCI and at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with the Gordon and Betty More Foundation and with NASA's Cryospheric Science Program.",

            "abstract": "Mapping the global cropland extent is of paramount importance for food security. Indeed, accurate and reliable information on cropland and the location of major crop types is required to make future policy, investment, and logistical decisions, as well as production monitoring. Timely cropland information directly feed early warning systems such as GIEWS and, FEWS NET. In Africa, and particularly in the arid and semi-arid region, food security is center of debate (at least 10% of the population remains undernourished) and accurate cropland estimation is a challenge. Space borne Earth Observation provides opportunities for global cropland monitoring in a spatially explicit, economic, efficient, and objective fashion. In the both agriculture monitoring and climate modelling, cropland maps serve as mask to isolate agricultural land for (i) time-series analysis for crop condition monitoring and (ii) to investigate how the cropland is respond to climatic evolution. A large diversity of mapping strategies ranging from the local to the global scale and associated with various degrees of accuracy can be found in the literature. At the global scale, despite efforts, cropland is generally one of classes with the poorest accuracy which make difficult the use for agricultural. This research aims at improving the cropland delineation from the local scale to the regional and global scales as well as allowing near real time updates. To that aim, five temporal features were designed to target the key- characteristics of crop spectral-temporal behavior. To ensure a high degree of automation, training data is extracted from available baseline land cover maps. The method delivers cropland maps with a high accuracy over contrasted agro-systems in Ukraine, Argentina, China and Belgium. The accuracy reached are comparable to those obtained with classifiers trained with in-situ data. Besides, it was found that the cropland class is associated with a low uncertainty. The temporal features also offer a high potential for generalization. As a result, the classifier might be used on an annual or monthly basis without retraining. Using PROBA-V 100m and 300m, the method is currently being applied to the Sahel and the entire African continent thanks to a dedicated agro-ecological stratification.",

            "abstract": "The current drought in California has been one of the driest on record. Using atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs), recent studies have demonstrated that the low precipitation anomalies observed during the first three winters of the current drought are mostly attributable to changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice forcing. Here we show through AGCM simulations that the fourth and latest winter of the current drought is not attributable to SST and sea ice forcing, but instead a consequence of higher internal variability. Using the Global Spectral Model (GSM) we demonstrate how the surface forcing reproduces dry conditions over California for the first three winters of the current drought, similar to what other models produced. However, when forced with the SST and sea ice conditions for the winter of 2014-2015, GSM robustly simulates high precipitation conditions over California. This significantly differs with observed precipitation anomalies, which suggests a model deficiency or large influence of internal variability within the climate system during the winter of 2014-2015. Ensemble simulations with 234 realizations reveal that the surface forcing created a broader range of precipitation possibilities over California. Thus, the surface forcing caused a greater degree of internal variations, which was driven by a reduced latitudinal temperature gradient and amplified planetary waves over the Pacific. Similar amplified waves are also seen in 21st century climate projections of upper-level geopotential heights, suggesting that 21st century precipitation over California will become more variable and increasingly difficult to predict on seasonal timescales. When an El Nino pattern is applied to the surface forcing the precipitation further increases and the variance amongst model realizations is reduced, which indicates a strong likelihood of an anomalously wet 2015-2016 winter season.",

Located in northwest Iowa, West Lake Okoboji is considered one of Iowa’s premier tourist destinations but is threatened by eutrophication. A network of 21 observation wells was installed in the watershed to evaluate groundwater recharge and quality under representative land cover types in a range of landscape positions. Our objective was to develop typical groundwater responses from various land cover-landscape associations for scaling up to unmonitored areas in the watershed. Results indicated substantial variation in groundwater recharge and quality in the 3847 ha watershed. Recharge was similar among land covers under vegetation but was much lower under urban pavement. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations were highest under cropped fields and lowest under perennial grassland and golf courses, whereas dissolved phosphorus was highest under residential and urban areas, including an engineered bioswale. A groundwater load allocation model indicated 91% of the nitrate load was from cropped areas and 7% from residential areas. In contrast, P loads were more equally divided among cropped fields (43%), perennial grass (36%) and residential (19%) areas. Based on the mass of nitrate and P in the lake, groundwater accounts for 71% and 18% of the nutrient inputs, respectively.",

            "abstract": "In marine sediments, total organic carbon (OC) content correlates strongly with mineral surface area as well as the abundance of specific mineral classes such as clays and metal oxides. Adsorption to mineral surfaces and the formation of mineral-organic matter aggregates are thought to provide protection against remineralization, yet the extent and mechanism(s) of this protection are unknown. Accordingly, the goal of this research is to elucidate the role of minerals in preserving carbon and the potential for this reservoir of mineral-hosted carbon to support heterotrophic metabolisms in the otherwise carbon-poor subseafloor. Here, we characterize the composition of OC in oxic and suboxic sediments collected during R/V Knorr expedition 223 to the subtropical western North Atlantic in November 2014. We find that OC concentrations decrease linearly over ~25 meters burial depth, from ~0.15 to 0.075 mol OC/kg solid. Organic C/N varies but is consistently less than Redfield values of ~6. Relative contributions of functional groups quantified using bulk-scale Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy change with depth and site lithology/geochemistry. We further observe microscale heterogeneity, including discrete carbonate particles amid disperse aromatic and amide/carboxylic-rich organic carbon, using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled to NEXAFS. In the suboxic sediments, there is a transition from Mn(III/IV) phases toward more reduced phases shown by X-ray absorption spectroscopy between ~3-11 meters below core top, approximately between the interstitial water nitrate and nitrite maxima. Conversely, Fe(III)-bearing minerals are present throughout the core and may contribute to stabilization of OC. By further coupling micro- and macro-scale analysis, the role of minerals in OC sequestration in the marine subsurface will come to light.",

REX recorded these uplink signals and determined precise measurement of the surface pressure, the temperature structure of the lower atmosphere, and the surface radius of Pluto. The ingress portion of one polarization was played back from the spacecraft in July and processed to obtain the pressure and temperature structure of Pluto’s atmosphere. Second, REX measured the thermal emission from Pluto at 4.2- cm wavelength during two linear scans across the disk at close range when both the dayside and the night side are visible. Both scans extend from limb to limb with a resolution of one-tenth Pluto’s disk and temperature resolution of 0.1 K. Occultation and radiometric temperature results presented here will encompass additional data scheduled for playback in September. ",

We present the first results of a white-light flare catalog based on SDO/HMI 6173A Intensity observations and the RHESSI flare catalog. We selected flares during 2011 and 2013 with GOES classification above M1.0 that were fully or partially observed by RHESSI as reported in the RHESSI flare catalog. We found that at least one third of the flares present white-light enhancement in the 6173A line and at least one fifth of the events show above the limb white-light sources. We will also discuss the results of a comparative analysis between the Hard X-ray and white-light positions. This analysis show the statistical average-height variation using the analysis technique described by Matsushita et al. 1992.",

            "abstract": "Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) is a five-year Earth Ventures Suborbital Mission funded by NASA to investigate the role of the oceans in ice loss around the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which includes measurements of seafloor bathymetry from multibeam surveys and airborne gravity, glacier surface elevation from high-frequency radar interferometry, and temperature/salinity/depth from vessels and airborne-dropped probes. Here, we describe the results of the 2016 bathymetry survey of northwest Greenland that took place in the summer of 2015: july 22-August 19 and Sept 2-Sept 16 spanning from Ilulissat to Thule AFB in north Greenland, and to be complemented by a survey of southeast Greenland in 2016. We deployed a multibeam Reson 7160 with 512 beams installed on the hull of the Cape Race vessel, with enhanced capabilities for fjord wall and ice face mapping. The survey tracks were optimized based on the IBCAO3 database, recent cruises, airborne gravity data collected by NASA Operation IceBridge which indicated the presence of troughs, bed topography mapped inland using a mass conservation approach, the spatial distribution of ice discharge to locate the largest outlets and maximizing the number of major fjords sampled during the survey, with the goal to identify all troughs that are major pathways for subsurface ocean heat, and constrain as many glacier ice front thickness as permitted by time and the practicality of navigating the ice-choked fjords. The data reveal many deep, U-shaped, submarine valleys connected to the glaciers, intercut with sills and over deepened in narrower passages where former glaciers and ice streams merged into larger units; as well as fjords ending in shallow plateaus with glaciers in retreated positions. The presence of warm, salty water of Atlantic origin (AW) in the fjords is documented using CTD. Some glaciers sit on shallow plateaus in cold, fresh polar waters (PW) at the end of deep fjords, while others are deeper and standing in AW. We compare the results to the recent history of deglaciation of this sector of Greenland using satellite imagery from 1962 to 2015, complemented by results from aerial surveys for earlier periods to illustrate how the evolution of the glaciers under ocean thermal forcing has been modulated by the presence and/or absence of natural pathways for AW.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects is necessary to assess fluid flow during production and determine bitumen recoverability, and can be constrained by measuring gravity and gravity gradient signatures. There is currently a void in monitoring fluid migration during SAGD operations, which is limited to expensive 3D seismic surveys, and sparse borehole surveys. The GWR iGrav portable superconducting instrument, with sub-microGal sensitivity, has the ability to measure time-lapse gravity and gravity gradient with high spatial focus.\nThe objective of this study is two-fold. The first part of the study is to develop geological models for a SAGD project, and forward model specific gravity signatures (gz, gzz, gzx, gzy) related to fluid migration during production. The sedimentary structures and background density models will be integrated with time-lapse gravity and gravity gradient measurements, to isolate fluid migration patterns. As the steam chamber expands in those forward models, it alters the density distribution of the sedimentary layers, and the gravity responses are calculated/measured. Inversions will be performed on the gravity observations to assess density changes incorporating knowledge of sedimentary features. The second part of the study is to execute sensitivity studies to evaluate if a single or two relative gravimeters can achieve the required sub-microgal resolution considering the noise conditions at the site, and to develop an optimal survey strategy for a pair or superconducting gravimeters.\nThe feasibility of applying the proposed technique to SAGD reservoirs was hindered by the lack of the required sensitivity, and high noise levels. These limitations can be overcome using a pair of superconducting gravimeters in time-lapse gravity gradient surveys. The ultimate goal is to monitor spatial and temporal fluid migration at all stages of reservoir development, to improve recovery of bitumen and detect any out of zone migration.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost soils in northern high latitudes store large quantities of organic carbon that have remained frozen for thousands of years. As global temperatures increase, permafrost deposits have begun to thaw, releasing previously stored ancient carbon to streams and rivers in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Newly mobilized DOC is then subjected to processing by photooxidation and microbial metabolism. Permafrost-derived DOC is highly bioavailable directly upon release relative to modern DOC derived from plants and surface active layer soils. Our objectives were to assess the interaction of photodegradation and microbial processing, and to quantify any light priming effect on the microbial consumption of both ancient and modern sourced DOC pools. We exposed sterilized mixtures of ancient and modern DOC to ambient sunlight for six days, and then inoculated mixtures (0, 1, 10, 25, 50 & 100% ancient DOC) with microbes from both modern and ancient water sources. After inoculation, samples were incubated in the dark for five days. We measured biological oxygen demand, changes in absorbance, and DOC concentrations to quantify microbial consumption of DOC and identify shifts in DOC composition and biolability. We found evidence of photobleaching during irradiation (decreasing S275-295, increasing slope ratio, and decreasing SUVA254). Once inoculated, mixtures with more ancient DOC showed initially increased microbial respiration compared to mixtures with primarily modern DOC. During the first 24 hours, the light-exposed mixture with 50% ancient DOC showed 47.6% more oxygen consumption than did the dark 50% mixture, while the purely modern DOC showed 11.5% greater oxygen consumption after light exposure. After 5 days, the modern light priming was comparable to the 50% mixture (31.2% compared to 20.5%, respectively). Our results indicate that natural photoexposure of both modern and newly released DOC increases microbial processing rates over non photo-exposed DOC.",

            "abstract": "Impact basins excavate material from below the lunar surface and expose it on their peak rings. Peak rings can thus be used as probes to study the composition of the lunar crust with depth, which can in turn be compared to models of the formation of the lunar crust. Global surveys conducted to find exposures of nearly pure minerals have found rare lithologies such as norites, troctolites, and anorthosites associated with many basins rings [Yamamoto et al., 2010; 2012, Nakamura et al., 2012], but the abundance of these lithologies relative to the rings as a whole was not determined. Taking a comprehensive approach, Cheek et al. [2013] found that every immature exposure in the inner rook ring of the Orientale basin consists of anorthosite, suggesting that a massive layer of anorthosite is present at the Orientale target site. In this study, we take the approach of Cheek et al. [2013] and examine all the immature exposures in the rings of 14 impact basins. We use Multiband Imager (415-1550 nm) data and radiative transfer modeling to quantify the abundance of the four major lunar minerals in the inner ring of these basins, and determine the dominant lithologies exposed by the rings. We identify the inner ring of these basins using GRAIL crustal thickness data, and derived the mineralogy at a spatial resolution of 80 meters per pixel. Our preliminary results indicate that the dominant lithology in the inner ring of 12 of the 14 basins is anorthosite, with modal plagioclase content ranging between 92-94 wt%, suggesting that a massive layer of anorthosite is widespread under the lunar surface. The dominant lithologies in the other two basins are noritic and gabbroic anorthosites. The other lithologies present in the 14 basins will be investigated next, and the depth of excavation of each of these basin rings as well as the crustal thickness at these sites will be used to determine the composition of the crust with depth.",

            "abstract": "Tropical rainforests play a significant role in the global carbon (C) cycle. The Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO) in Puerto Rico is characterized by intense erosion and landslide occurrence, which have been historically influenced by human activity and land use change, and drive the redistribution and burial of soil organic C (SOC) across the landscape. Estimates of regional C budgets do not systematically account for linkages between hydrological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical processes, which control the fate of eroded SOC. We quantify the impacts of erosion and rainfall-triggered landslides on SOC oxidation and accumulation at the Mameyes and Icacos watersheds. We developed and calibrated a spatially-explicit model of SOC dynamics, i.e. tRIBS-ECO (Triangulated Irregular Network-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator-Erosion and Carbon Oxidation), based on a coupled physically-based hydro-geomorphic model. The model inputs we used include measurements of SOC content at different horizons, and SOC oxidation and production rates derived from SOC turnover characteristics. We demonstrate the extent to which depth-dependent SOC oxidation and production are altered at eroding hillslopes and at landslide locations, and how this is being moderated by management practices. We estimated the SOC deposition rates at the floodplains of Mameyes and Icacos rivers, part of which is fluvially transported out of the system. The contrasting lithology of the two watersheds leads to different hydro-geomorphological behavior which controls the redistribution and storage of SOC. Results showed that topography and heterogeneity of tropical vegetation lead to significant spatial variability of the erosion-induced soil CO2 flux to the atmosphere. We highlight the importance of the representation of SOC redistribution driven by local variation in lithological and geomorphological characteristics and hydroclimatic conditions in attempts to quantify watershed-scale soil C dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance and Landed Investigation (MERLIN) is a NASA Discovery mission proposal to explore the moons of Mars. Previous Mars-focused spacecraft have raised fundamental questions about Mars' moons: What are their origins and compositions? Why do the moons resemble primitive outer solar system D-type objects? How do geologic processes modify their surfaces? MERLIN answers these questions through a combination of orbital and landed measurements, beginning with reconnaissance of Deimos and investigation of the hypothesized Martian dust belts. Orbital reconnaissance of Phobos occurs, followed by low flyovers to characterize a landing site. MERLIN lands on Phobos, conducting a 90-day investigation. Radiation measurements are acquired throughout all mission phases. Phobos' size and mass provide a low-risk landing environment: controlled descent is so slow that the landing is rehearsed, but gravity is high enough that surface operations do not require anchoring. Existing imaging of Phobos reveals low regional slope regions suitable for landing, and provides knowledge for planning orbital and landed investigations. The payload leverages past NASA investments. Orbital imaging is accomplished by a dual multispectral/high-resolution imager rebuilt from MESSENGER/MDIS. Mars' dust environment is measured by the refurbished engineering model of LADEE/LDEX, and the radiation environment by the flight spare of LRO/CRaTER. The landed workspace is characterized by a color stereo imager updated from MER/HazCam. MERLIN’s arm deploys landed instrumentation using proven designs from MER, Phoenix, and MSL. Elemental measurements are acquired by a modified version of Rosetta/APXS, and an uncooled gamma-ray spectrometer. Mineralogical measurements are acquired by a microscopic imaging spectrometer developed under MatISSE. MERLIN delivers seminal science traceable to NASA’s Strategic Goals and Objectives, Science Plan, and the Decadal Survey. MERLIN’s science-driven investigations also provide insight into Mars' particulate and radiation environment, Phobos’ composition and regolith properties, and Phobos’ inventory of in situ resources, filling strategic knowledge gaps to pioneer the way for future human exploration of the Mars system.",

The method includes using the vast global networks of international organizations representing the application areas as well as the field of Earth observations. An example from a cooperation between the Group of Earth Observations and the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands will be used to illustrate the method. Within the global Earth observation community there is a great potential for efficient capacity building, targeting both experts, decision-makers and the general public. The method presented is demonstrating one way of tapping into that potential.",

            "abstract": "Unsaturated flow in the vadose zone often manifests as preferential flow resulting in transport of water and solutes through the soil much faster than would occur for uniform matrix flow. Time-lapse ground-penetrating radar (GPR) monitoring shows significant potential for identifying the presence of non-uniform flow and quantitative monitoring of the hydrologic response of a soil system. We investigate non-uniform flow in the vadose zone for an infiltration experiment performed in a 60 cm deep sand-filled tank that is continuously monitored with 1000 MHz reflection GPR. During the experiment, 100 constant offset and 300 common mid-point (CMP) time-lapse radar profiles were collected using an automated gantry system to rapidly position the antennas, allowing for a set of 1 constant offset and 3 CMP profiles to be collected every 13 seconds. The constant offset profiles were interpreted to evaluate spatial and temporal changes of reflected arrivals over the course of the experiment, whereas the CMPs were used to estimate the initial EM wave velocity in the tanks using a normal moveout analysis. Changes in traveltime to a static reflector were used to estimate spatial changes in velocity and to create two-dimensional velocity models. The GPR data were then migrated using the estimated 2D velocity model to improve GPR reflection images, which could then be interpreted to identify evidence of non-uniform flow phenomena. To verify the approach, the methodology was also applied to GPR data simulated using transient water contents generated by the unsaturated flow simulator HYDRUS2D given lab-measured hydraulic properties for the soil. For both the empirical and simulated data, we found that the 2D velocity analysis was effective in monitoring changes in the wetting front and that migration of the reflection profiles was able to improve the interpretation of non-uniform flow.",

            "abstract": "Educational outreach programs led by scientists or scientific organizations can introduce participants to science content, increase their interest in science, and help them understand the nature of science (NOS). Much of atmospheric science (AS) educational outreach to date has concentrated on teacher professional development programs, but there is still a need to study how students react to classroom programs led by scientists. The purpose of this research project is to examine student engagement with AS and NOS content when presented by a university atmospheric scientist or an Earth system science teacher. The guiding research question was: how do students interact with science experts in their classrooms compared to their teachers when learning about Earth science and NOS? The outreach program was developed by an AS faculty member and was implemented in a local 10th grade Earth Science class. The presenter used historical stories of discoveries to introduce concepts about the middle atmosphere and climate circulations, reinforcing the NOS in his interactive presentations. On a separate day the teacher implemented a lesson on plate tectonics grounded in NOS. A case study analysis is being conducted using videotaped presentations on Earth science and NOS by the teacher and the scientist, pre- and post- questionnaires, and teacher and scientist interviews in order to determine patterns in student-presenter discourse, the levels of presenters’ inquiry-based questioning, and the depth of student responses around Earth science content and NOS. Preliminary results from video analysis indicate that the scientist used higher inquiry-based questioning strategies compared to the teacher; however the teacher was able to go into more depth on a topic with the lesson. Scientists must consider whether the trade-offs warrant focusing their outreach efforts on content professional development for teachers or content outreach for K-12 students.",

            "abstract": "Maintaining regional biogeographic distributions – the presence of species or assemblages within defined geographic areas – may be the only realistic conservation strategy given the magnitude of projected warming. In California, consistent projections of altered phenology driven by warmer temperatures and landscape aridification driven by increased climatic water deficit (CWD) will play out over complex mesoclimatic and topoclimatic gradients. Topoclimatic refugia provide for “last stands” of species within large landscapes. Range contractions during warming/drying periods eventually end in small mesic pockets determined by fine-scale topography and hydrology. Topoclimatic refugia can be mapped using models of insolation, cold-air pooling, flow accumulation, and soil depth. Arrays of temperature sensors can quantify lengths and correlations of intersecting topoclimatic gradients. Species respond along these gradients according to their life-history. Bay checkerspot butterfly populations persist through phenological extremes when late hostplant senescence on steep north-facing slopes allows springtime larval survival. The following winter growing larvae can crawl tens of meters upslope onto warmer slopes, advance their emergence by weeks, and provide a buffer against early hostplant senescence. The refugia consist of steep north-facing slopes within tens of meters of warmer upslope areas. Pockets of low CWD on low insolation slopes with deeper soils that accumulate upslope water provide mesic refugia; currently, these sites often support outlying stands of mesic vegetation. CWD tolerance of existing vegetation near arid limits will be exceeded as temperatures rise, but stands currently well away from the limits may persist longer. If CWD limits are exceeded, short range shifts (< 1 km) may allow persistence in adjacent areas. Importantly, species may already be present but rare in or near potential refugia in complex topography.",

            "abstract": "Although we can anticipate continued improvements in our understanding of future climate impacts, the central challenge of climate change is not scientific, but rather political and economic. In particular, international climate negotiations center on how to share the burden of uncertain mitigation and adaptation costs. We expose the relative economic interests of different countries by assessing and comparing their vulnerability to climate impacts and the economic benefits they derive from the fossil fuel-based energy system. Vulnerability refers to the propensity of humans and their assets to suffer when impacted by hazards, and we draw upon the results from a number of prior studies that have quantified vulnerability using multivariate indices. As a proxy for benefit, we average CO2 related to each country’s extraction of fossil fuels, production of CO2 emissions, and consumption of goods and services (Davis et al., 2011), which should reflect benefits accrued in proportion to national economic dependence on fossil fuels. We define a nondimensional vulnerability-benefit ratio for each nation and find a large range across countries. In general, we confirm that developed and emerging economies such as the U.S., Western Europe, and China rely heavily on fossil fuels and have substantial resources to respond to the impacts of climate change, while smaller, less-developed economies such as Sierra Leone and Vanuatu benefit little from current CO2 emissions and are much more vulnerable to adverse climate impacts. In addition, we identify some countries with a high vulnerability and benefit, such as Iraq and Nigeria; conversely, some nations exhibit both a low vulnerability and benefit, such as New Zealand. In most cases, the ratios reflect the nature of energy-climate policies in each country, although certain nations – such as the United Kingdom and France – assume a level of responsibility incongruous with their ratio and commit to mitigation policy despite relatively low vulnerability and moderately high benefit. Examining current national policies in the context of the vulnerability-benefit ratios suggests that international cooperation to address climate change may require demonstrating the interdependencies of countries whose short-term economic interests seem otherwise divergent.",

            "abstract": "Spacecraft observations show that near a magnetotail X-line, the concentration of oxygen (O+) ions varies greatly between storm-time and non-storm substorms. While O+ is a minor ion species during the non-storm substorms, it can become a major ion species during some storm-time substorms. It is important to understand how such a significant amount of O+ influences the onset of reconnection, the reconnection rate and the subsequent energy transfer at propagating dipolarization fronts (or reconnection jet fronts). In this work, we have studied the effects of O+ on the reconnection rate and DFs during magnetotail reconnection. We used a 2.5D implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation in a 2D Harris current sheet in the presence of H+ and O+ ions. We carried out a simulation with equal number densities of O+ and H+ (O+ Run) and compared the results with a simulation run using only H+ ions (H+ Run). We found that the reconnection rate in the O+ Run is much less than that in the H+ Run and identified two factors that contribute to this difference: (1) the O+ drag on the convective magnetic flux via an ambipolar electric field in O+ diffusion region; (2) the current sheet O+ inertia, which reduces the DF speed and delays the fast reconnection phase in the O+ Run. For factor (2) the O+ ions provide the main force contributions at the DFs and thereby determine the thickness of DFs provided the concentration of O+ is large enough. The velocity distribution functions of O+ have several peaks that result from ion reflection and acceleration near the DFs. These results illustrate some of the differences between the storm-time and non-storm substorms due to a significant concentration of heavy ions. They also are directly related to the expected observations by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.",

            "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the thunderstorms and the parent lightning discharge morphologies of five confirmed negative sprites taking place in two different thunderstorms. These two thunderstorms took place in east-central and south Florida on 12 September 2014. We utilized several lightning location networks, remote magnetic field measurements, dual polarization radar, and balloon borne soundings in our analysis. Each parent discharge was immediately preceded by intra-cloud (IC) discharges between the mid-level negative and upper positive charge regions. This either allowed a second upward negative leader to escape the upper positive charge region, or encouraged a downward negative leader to be initiated and connect with ground. The discharges found in this study support the findings of Lu et al., 2012 [JGR,117, D04212, 2012] that negative sprite-parent lightning consists primarily of hybrid intra-cloud negative cloud-to-ground (IC-NCG) and bolt-from-the-blue (BFB) lightning.\nOur work finds these unique discharges form in thunderstorms that have an excess of mid-level negative charge and weakened upper positive charge. Due to this charge structure, these unusual discharges transfer more charge to the ground than typical negative cloud-to-ground discharges. Our study suggests that the key difference separating bolt-from-the-blue and gigantic jet discharges is an asymmetric charge structure. This acts to bring the negative leader exiting the thundercloud closer to the lateral positive screening layer, encouraging the negative leader to turn towards ground. This investigation reveals IC discharges that involve multiple convective cells and come to ground as a negative CG discharge, a breed of hybrid IC-NCG discharges, also transfer more negative charge to ground than typical negative CG discharges and are able to initiate negative sprites.\nFrom this work, the charge structures mentioned above resulted from tall, intense convective cells with low CG flash rates with high wind shear in the mid to upper regions of the cloud. This acted to create a large reservoir of mid-level negative charge and create a general asymmetry to the charge structure. The wind shear in the upper regions also acted to weaken the upper positive charge by turbulent mixing with the upper negative screening charge layer.",

The Turunç Unit, which is now preserved within a tectonic slice of the Lycian Nappes, includes among others the Neotethys-derived basalt blocks with pelagic intra-pillow carbonate infillings of middle Carnian age (early Late Triassic). Here, we focus on the geochemistry of the Turunç basalts to shed light into their petrogenetic evolution within the Neotethyan framework.\nImmobile trace element systematics indicate that the Turunç lavas are sub-alkaline basalts, with geochemical signatures resembling to those generated above subduction zones. Detailed examination of the Turunç volcanics reveals two chemical groups. Both groups are variably enriched in Th and La relative to Nb, and exhibit depleted Zr and Hf contents relative to N-MORB. Of the two groups, however, Group 2 is more enriched in Th, but with a similar Nb content, which results in higher Th/Nb ratios (0.21-0.27) compared to those of Group 1 (0.08-0.11). Both groups reflect similar REE systematics; they display marked enrichment in LREE relative to HREE ([La/Yb]N = 4.8-8.9).\nTrace element characteristics of the Turunç basalts indicate that their mantle source has been modified by slab-derived component(s). Taking into account that the Turunc Unit includes no continent-derived detritus, we suggest that the Turunç lavas represent fragments of a Late Triassic island arc formed on the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere. This may further imply that the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere had already been formed by the early Late Triassic, thus suggesting a pre-early Late Triassic oceanization of the northern branch of Neotethys.",

            "abstract": "Subduction initiation is a critical link in the plate tectonic cycle. Intra-oceanic subduction zones can form along transform faults and fracture zones, but how subduction nucleates parallel to mid-ocean ridges, as in e.g. the Neotethys Ocean during the Jurassic, remains a matter of debate. In recent years, extensional detachment faults have been widely documented adjacent to slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges where they cut across the oceanic lithosphere. These structures are extremely weak due to widespread occurrence of serpentine and talc resulting from hydrothermal alteration, and can therefore effectively localize deformation. Here, we show geochemical, tectonic, and paleomagnetic evidence from the Jurassic ophiolites of Albania and Greece for a subduction zone formed in the western Neotethys parallel to a spreading ridge along an oceanic detachment fault. With 2-D numerical modeling exploring the evolution of a detachment-ridge system experiencing compression, we show that serpentinized detachments are always weaker than spreading ridges. We conclude that, owing to their extreme weakness, oceanic detachments can effectively localize deformation under perpendicular far-field forcing, providing ideal conditions to nucleate new subduction zones parallel and close to (or at) spreading ridges. Direct implication of this, is that resumed magmatic activity in the forearc during subduction initiation can yield widespread accretion of supra-subduction zone ophiolites at or close to the paleoridge. Our new model casts the enigmatic origin of regionally extensive ophiolite belts in a novel geodynamic context, and calls for future research on three-dimensional modeling of subduction initiation and how upper plate extension is associated with that.",

Analysing the problem further, this uncertainty results from an uncertainty about the total amount of C that is stored in frozen soils, combined with an uncertainty about the areas where soils might thaw under a particular climate change scenario, as well as an uncertainty about the decomposition product since some of the decomposed C might result the release of CH4 as well as CO2.\nWe use the land surface model JSBACH, part of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model MPI-ESM, to quantify the release of soil carbon from thawing permafrost soils. We have extended the soil carbon model YASSO by introducing carbon storages in frozen soils, with increasing fractions of C being available to decomposition as permafrost thaws. In order to quantify the amount of carbon released as CH4, as opposed to CO2, we have also implemented a TOPMODEL-based wetland scheme, as well as anaerobic C decomposition and methane transport.\nWe initialise the soil C pools for the preindustrial climate state from the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database to insure initial C pool sizes close to measurements. We then determine changes in soil C storage in transient model experiments following historical and future climate changes under RCP 8.5. Based on these experiments, we quantify the greenhouse gas release from permafrost C decomposition, determining both CH4 and CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the various seamount chains in the central Pacific is often difficult to reconstruct due to the number of potential volcanic sources and the criss-crossing patterns associated with plate motion history. One particularly difficult seamount chain to reconstruct is the Line Islands Ridge and the possibly-related Mid-Pacific Mountains and Tuamotu Chain. While the general geographic and age-progressive trends of these features resemble the predicted pattern for Pacific plate motion over the past 120 to 130 My, the relative ages of volcanism along the Line Islands Ridge are not consistent with a conventional hotspot model. To explore potential models of the origin of the Line Islands Ridge, we use GPlates software in conjunction with published seamount dates and known hotspot locations to constrain tectonic reconstructions. Our primary results suggest the Line Islands Ridge was formed by at least two different volcanic sources. The initial source formed the southern section of the Line Island Ridge (4˚N to 1˚S) around 95 to 83 Ma and corresponds to the present-day Crough hotspot. The hotspot also likely generated the linear Boudeuse Ridge (a.k.a. Southern Line Islands) volcanic chain (5˚S to 13˚S) from about 70 to 50 Ma. The second volcanic source, which we call the Larson Hotspot in memory of Roger Larson, formed the northern section of the Line Islands Ridge (7˚N to 4˚N) around 77 to 64 Ma and corresponds to a new “hotspot” region centered on 17˚S and 125˚W near the eastern extension of the Pukapuka Ridge. This source may also account for the formation of the Mid-Pacific Mountains (130 to 105 Ma), the Necker Ridge (105 to 90 Ma), and the later volcanism on the southern section of the Line Island Ridge (65 to 55 Ma). This volcanic source also roughly coincides with the Pukapuka Ridge and more recent volcanism along the same trend, but closer to the East Pacific Rise.",

A brief, but intense foreshock sequence, which included five earthquakes between MJ 2.0 and 2.8, began 4 days before the mainshock. The foreshocks concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the mainshock hypocenter. In this study we model the initiation process of the mainshock using seismograms recorded on the nearby stations of NIED Hi-net at frequencies up to 10 Hz. The initial rupture process is inferred by solving a linear system defined by the representation theorem for seismic sources. Instead of imposing a rupture velocity, the allowable slipping area on the fault is confined to lie within the radius 0.95*VS*t. Once a node has been activated, it remains part of the solution at all later times. Thus, activated nodes may start, stop, restart, or never slip as required by the data. The system is regularized using a centered Laplacian operator to spatially smooth the model; there is no temporal smoothing. The system is solved using non-negative least-squares. We compare results obtained using synthetic seismograms for the Green’s functions (SGF) to ones using empirical Green’s functions derived from the foreshocks (MJ 2.7 - 2.8) (EGF). Even for the initial rupture which can be explained by simple models, it is found that solutions that use EGFs are more stable than those that use SGFs because some stations have strong path or site effects that are not captured by the synthetics at high frequency. The rupture initiates with a MW 3 sub-event in the first 0.15 s, and then propagates away from the foreshock zone as a MW 4 sub-event at 0.4 s. Our results show that the nucleation process was cascade-like.",

            "abstract": "The response of bedrock landscapes to localized perturbations that uplift the land surface remains an important and unsolved problem in geomorphology. Laccoliths, shallow plutonic structures relatively common in magmatic environments that dome overlying crustal rocks, represent a simple and near-axisymmetric perturbation on the landscape. The structures are commonly smaller than typical drainage basins, allowing their erosional response to be used as a proxy for relative uplift rates and position in pre-existing drainage networks. Using a landscape evolution model, we analyze the coupling between pre-intrusion drainage conditions and laccolith uplift. We study the effects of laccolith uplift rate, geometry, and basin position on drainage development on both the laccolith and surrounding landscape. We use a Monte Carlo scheme to sample the large parameter space and develop a series of metrics based on channel network and landform geometries to characterize the results. In particular, we develop two dimensionless numbers to quantify the importance of uplift versus erosion, and initial condition (position of laccolith in pre-existing landscape).\nWe then apply our results to Oligocene-age laccoliths on the Colorado Plateau, USA. The age of the Plateau’s present drainage network is debated, with some arguing for a long-lived drainage network active since 60-70 Ma, and others arguing for a much younger pulse of incision at <6 Ma to integrate the modern drainage system. The laccoliths (i.e. the Henry, La Sal, and Ute Mountains, and Navajo Mountain), emplaced at 25-28 Ma, are potentially well suited to inform this debate. Laccolith erosion patterns on the Colorado Plateau are highly asymmetric, with long-axis orientations paralleling present directions of the Colorado River and its tributaries. Thus, the current drainage pattern is strongly imprinted on the laccoliths, suggesting we can characterize controls on laccolith erosion to invert for timing and rates of erosion.",

Fundamentally, Navier-Stokes (NS) Equations is used to describe flow in fractures. However, due to the complexity of Navier-Stokes Equations, it is rarely applied to solve fracture flow problems. Thus, based on some simplifications, Stokes equations, Reynolds equations and Cubic Law (CL) are derived to describe fracture flow. The validity of the three simplified equations were extensively studies. Among the three simplified equations of NS, CL is the simplest and used to describe flow in open, smooth and paralleled fractures. In the previous work, most researchers focused on the open fractures. But it’s the closed fractures exist widely in the field not the open fractures. The objective of this paper aims to check the validity of CL in closed fractures with different apertures and widths of fracture.\nAfter comparing the experimental results and simulations results from the COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM), this software was applied to solve the 3D or 2D NS equations in the closed fractures. The results obtained from NS simulation results and calculation results from CL were compared to indicate the degree of the validity of CL in application. A critical velocity was proposed to illustrate the validity of CL in closed fractures. Furthermore, the impacts of aperture size, width of fracture size, and velocity magnitude on both the hydraulic conductivity and velocity profile were also analyzed. The results showed the CL was capable of describing flow in closed fractures when the velocity was less than the critical velocity varying from 0.02 to 30.08cm/s. The ratio of NS results and CL results was between 0.9 and 2, with velocity varying from 0 to 40cm/s. The discrepancy between NS equation and CL increased with Reynolds number, increased with aperture size and decreased with width of fracture.",

Its hanging wall is also breaking up, as suggested by the 2009 earthquake sequence in Karonga. This hanging wall block is underlain in part by the NW- and N-striking Mughese Shear Zone. The superposition of new faults on the pre-existing structures makes this area an ideal location to study the effect of the orientation of pre-existing structures on the accommodation of strain in the hanging wall in the western flank of the northern Malawi Rift. We used gravity and aeromagnetic data and remote sensing to map the Precambrian macro-scale structural fabric of the greater Karonga region. Moreover, we mapped mesostructures within the Precambrian and younger rocks. In the northern portion of the Karonga fault, a single east-dipping fault zone with a mean strike of 32° and a 59° dip cuts the Precambrian foliation that has a mean strike of 301° and 79° dip, accommodating the majority of strain in this region. South of the city of Karonga, the Precambrian foliation assumes a NNW average strike that is steeply dipping. Here the Karonga fault disperses from a single fault with a 2 km damage zone to several distinct east- and west-dipping faults over 6 km that strike in the same overall direction as the foliation planes from the Mughese Shear Zone. Karoo rift structures (horsts and grabens) and their associated rock formations could also be reactivated in this area. These relationships suggest that within the Malawi Rift, strain can be accommodated differently based on the nature and orientation of pre-existing structures. The structural fabric surrounding the southern portion of the Karonga fault seems to favor reactivation and strain distribution, whereas strain is localized in the northern portion of the fault zone.",

Typically these gases are examined individually in environments in which each is expected to be dominant; however their co-occurrence and potential interactions may be important. Spatial and temporal variability of CH4 and N2O concentrations were measured in 2 nitrate-rich (40-1200 µM) streams draining >90% agricultural land use in the Midwestern USA and that differed ~12-fold in flow. Long-term (biweekly), short-term (hourly), and transport-oriented (Lagrangian) sampling approaches were compared. Dissolved gas concentrations exceeded atmospheric equilibrium values up to 700x and 16x, for CH4 and N2O, respectively. Mean concentrations were higher in the larger stream than in the smaller stream. In both streams, CH4 was negatively correlated with flow and nitrate while N2O was positively correlated. N2O was generally constant with transport (21 km) in the small stream, with variation in localized reaches, and increased somewhat in May/June in the larger stream (38 km), but not during September base flow. Base flow transport trends for CH4 were similar to N2O in both streams. In the small stream, substantial diel fluctuations were evident in CH4 concentrations and N2O δ18O values, with more subtle fluctuations in CH4 isotopes (δ2H & δ13C), N2O concentrations, and N2O δ15N values. Seasonal mean total (CH4 + N2O) areal emission rates, expressed as CO2 warming potential equivalents, were similar for the two streams, but the total reach-scale emission rate for the larger stream was about 2x that of the smaller stream (15.4 vs 8.3 kg CO2 km-1 day-1, respectively). The CH4 contribution to this flux was 12-30%, despite the relatively high nitrate and oxygen concentrations in the streams, indicating contributions from groundwater or subsurface sediment reactions.",

In recent decades the quickening pace of sea level rise and infrequent but large coastal storms have exposed these ecosystems to additional pressures associated with the intrusion of brackish and salty water. Infrastructure, including roadbeds, levees, and other water management structures add additional complexity to this system by acting as either exacerbating or mitigating factors depending on time and location. This study investigates the dynamics of surface water and salinity in a critically stressed, freshwater swamp forest at Goose Creek State Park in coastal North Carolina. We evaluate temporal patterns of surface water elevation and salinity following a major inundation event (Hurricane Irene, 2011) at locations both upstream and downstream of an earthen roadbed that bisects the wetland. Results suggest that climatic conditions together with poor drainage through the roadbed caused harmful salinity levels to persist in the wetland for nearly a year following the hurricane, yet the potential also exists for the roadbed to protect the wetland from less extreme exposures to saltwater. This case study illustrates one facet of a complex, coupled natural-human system that is currently being reshaped by climate change. The work has implications for larger efforts to understand and assess the vulnerability of low-lying coastal regions to sea level rise and the preceding salinization.",

            "abstract": "Frontal air-sea interaction is typically cast in terms of the thermal impact of ocean fronts on the atmosphere. The effect of ocean current drag on the lower troposphere is assumed to be small, but of interest as it isolates the modulation of the surface stress independent of the thermally induced modulation of the boundary layer stability and hydrostatic pressure. Here, we use a regional atmospheric model to investigate the impact of drag induced by the Kuroshio Current in the winter East China Sea on the overlying atmosphere. The ocean current enhances the wind stress curl compared to the impacts of the associated sea surface temperature (SST) front alone. In addition, the stress across the current direction, generating the stress divergence, is also enhanced weakly via the atmospheric adjustment to the oceanic curl. These modifications change the linear relationships between the wind stress curl (divergence) onto SST Laplacian or onto crosswind (downwind) SST gradient, known as coupling coefficients. The influence of the current induced drag beyond the sea surface is affected by advection and weaker than expected from Ekman pumping alone, but some clear signatures are found: sea surface pressure decreases just over the current axis, and precipitation increases over the southeast side of the current corresponding to the induced wind convergence. A linear reduced gravity model is used to explain the dynamics of the response in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Transfer function, a kind of a coupling coefficient which is expanded in wave-number space, indicates the strength of the response as a function of the ocean current speed depending on the spatial scale.",

Hydrogeochemical investigations in three different tectono-geomorphic settings of the basin i.e. the northwestern and northern part (located along foothills of the Eastern Himalayas) and southern part (in vicinity of Naga-thrust belt) demonstrate regional variability of groundwater chemistry and redox conditions with geology. Shallow alluvial aquifers of southern part, which are mainly composed of black/dark grey clay and fine sands are affected by high arsenic concentration whereas groundwater from sandy aquifer in the northwestern and northern part have comparatively lower As concentrations. Stable isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) in groundwater indicate suggest that some evaporation may have taken place through recharging water in the study areas. The major-ion composition shows that groundwater of northwestern and northern part are dominated by Ca2+-HCO3−, Ca2+-Na+-HCO3 while southern part is dominated by Na+-Ca2+-HCO3− hydrochemical facies. Molar ratios suggested that most groundwater solutes of northwestern and northern parts were derived from both silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution and have not been affected by cation exchange, while silicate weathering process dominates in aquifers of southern where cation exchange probably has little influence on water chemistry. Thermodynamic calculations show that most of samples fall along the equilibrium line between kaolinite and smectite. While, positive correlations of As with Fe, Mn and HCO3 were observed in northwestern and northern parts aquifers, no consistent correlation of As with any parameter was observed in the aquifers of southern part. Therefore, the results of the study clearly indicate geological control (i.e. change in lithofacies, tectonic set-up) on groundwater chemistry and distribution of redox-sensitive solutes such as As.",

In the subalpine zone of the Rocky Mountains, this warming is also predicted to increase the frequency and severity of spruce beetle outbreaks. Climate change itself may affect this vegetation, potentially leading to shifts in species compositions. These forests are a crucial part of the US’s carbon budget, thus it is important to analyze how climate change and bark beetles in conjunction will affect the biomass and species composition of vegetation in subalpine zone. UVAFME is an individual-based gap model that simulates biomass and species composition of a forest. This model has been quantitatively tested at various Rocky Mountain sites in the Front Range, and has been shown to accurately simulate the vegetation dynamics in the region. UVAFME has been updated with a spruce beetle subroutine that calculates the probability for beetle infestation of each tree on a plot. This probability is based on site, climate, and individual tree characteristics, such as temperature; stand structure; and tree stress level, size, and age. These governing characteristics are based on data from the US Forest Service, and other studies on spruce susceptibility and spruce beetle phenology. UVAFME is then run with multiple climate change and beetle scenarios to determine the net effect of both variables on subalpine vegetation. These results are compared among the different scenarios and to current forest inventory data. We project that increasing temperatures due to climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of spruce beetle outbreaks, leading to a decrease in the biomass and dominance of Engelmann spruce. These results are an important step in understanding the possible futures for the vegetation of subalpine zone in the Rocky Mountains.",

            "abstract": "While bedload transport hysteresis is common in steep mountain streams, very few transport models predict hysteresis and its causes remain uncertain. A key variable in transport models is the nondimensional shear stress at which bedload movement becomes significant (τ*ri). Many factors influence τ*ri including clast size, the grain size distribution of the surrounding bed, turbulent intensity, clast protrusion, packing and clustering. Rather than attempt to isolate the myriad competing influences, we present a new model in which τ*ri evolves through time as a generalized function of upstream discharge and sediment supply. Discharge serves competing purposes: cumulative flow stabilizes beds by packing and interlocking grains (increasing τ*ri), while relatively higher discharge tends to destabilize beds (decreasing τ*ri). Sediment supply also influences transport rates at a given discharge. The model term that describes how τ*ri varies with supply is similar to the Exner equation. If more sediment enters a reach than leaves, then τ*ri decreases. Conceptually this occurs because deposition preferentially fills topographic lows, smooths the bed and increases near-bed velocities. Conversely, when more sediment exits a reach than enters, then τ*ri increases because erosion tends to increase bed roughness and move grains from less stable to more stable positions. We compare the new τ*ri equation to flume experiments and to field data. The model can predict both clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis that have been observed in coarse mountain rivers. Finally, we suggest that τ*ri should be thought of as a state variable, which influences the evolution of a reach towards the equilibrium condition of transport rate just balancing supply rate.",

            "abstract": "Synchronization is a key concept in nonlinear dynamics. Owing to the paucity and uncertainty of paleoseismic data, we can’t say much about the synchronization of large earthquakes in complex fault systems such as the San Andreas, but we know that substantial elastic strain has accumulated in the southern part of this system since its last major earthquake in 1857. One question is whether the distribution of long open intervals is consistent with the recently published Third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3, Field et al., 2015), which assumes that time-dependent event probabilities can be modeled by Reid renewal processes correlated across faults only by co-rupture. In a UCERF3 world, the probability of observing an open-interval distribution as extreme as the present day would be low, less than 1% according to one estimate (Jackson, 2015). An alternate hypothesis is that we are in a period of low overall energy release; i.e., near the minimum of a “seismic supercycle.” UCERF3 does not explicitly model supercycles, but they emerge from long runs of physics-based rupture simulators, such as the RSQSim model of Dieterich & Richards-Dinger (2010) and the ALLCAL model of Ward (2008). In these models, the synchronization of large events on different fault sections leads to variations in seismic energy release of ± 50% on time scales of about 200 years. Spectral analysis of a million-year RSQSim catalog shows synchronization harmonics with a fundamental period of 200 years and a corresponding depletion at longer event periods. This synchronization signature is absent in UCERF3 and randomized versions of the RSQSim catalog. We further investigate synchronization and its time dependence using two-dimensional “recurrence plots” (Eckmann et al., 1987) to map the temporal recurrence of proximate RSQSim states. We use the results to speculate on the hazard implications of the supercycle hypothesis.",

We demonstrate that the quasi periodic propagating intensity variations captured by our synthesized AIA 131, 94~\\AA~emission images match the previous observations well.

With the synthesized Doppler shift velocity and intensity maps in SUMER Fe XIX line emission, we confirm that these reflected slow mode waves are propagating waves. ",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions threaten not only the lives and property of local populations, but also aviation worldwide. Volcanic gas release is a key driving force in eruptive activity, and monitoring gas emissions is critical to assessing volcanic hazards, yet most volcanoes are not monitored for volcanic gas emission. Measuring volcanic gas emissions with manned aircraft has been standard practice for many years during eruptive crises, but such measurements are quite costly. As a result, measurements are typically only made every week or two at most during periods of unrest or eruption, whereas eruption dynamics change much more rapidly. Furthermore, very few measurements are made between eruptions to establish baseline emissions. Unmanned aerial system (UAS) measurements of volcanic plumes hold great promise for both improving temporal resolution of measurements during volcanic unrest, and for reducing the exposure of personnel to potentially hazardous conditions. Here we present the results of a new collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey and NASA Ames Research Center to develop a UAS specific for volcano gas monitoring using miniaturized gas sensing systems and a custom airframe. Two miniaturized sensing systems are being built and tested: a microDOAS system to quantify SO2 emission rates, and a miniature MultiGAS system for measuring in-situ concentrations of CO2, SO2, and H2S. The instruments are being built into pods that will be flown on a custom airframe built from surplus Raven RQ-11. The Raven is one of the smallest UAS (a SUAS), and has the potential to support global rapid response when eruptions occur because they require less crew for operations. A test mission is planned for fall 2015 or spring 2016 at the Crows Landing Airfield in central California. Future measurement locations might include Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, or Pagan Volcano in the Marianas.",

            "abstract": "Remote spectroscopic investigations of aquatic ecosystems typically measure radiance at high spectral resolution and then correct these data for atmospheric effects to estimate Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs) at the surface. These reflectance spectra reveal phytoplankton absorption and scattering features, enabling accurate retrieval of traditional remote sensing parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, and new retrievals of additional parameters, such as phytoplankton functional type. Future missions will significantly expand coverage of these datasets with airborne campaigns (CORAL, ORCAS, and the HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign) and orbital instruments (EnMAP, HyspIRI).\nRemote characterization of phytoplankton can be influenced by errors in atmospheric correction due to uncertain atmospheric constituents such as aerosols. The “empirical line method” is an expedient solution that estimates a linear relationship between observed radiances and in-situ reflectance measurements. While this approach is common for terrestrial data, there are few examples involving aquatic scenes. Aquatic scenes are challenging due to the difficulty of acquiring in situ measurements from open water; with only a handful of reference spectra, the resulting corrections may not be stable.\nHere we present a brief overview of methods for atmospheric correction, and describe ongoing experiments on empirical line adjustment with AVIRIS overflights of Monterey Bay from the 2013-2014 HyspIRI preparatory campaign. We present new methods, based on generalized Tikhonov regularization, to improve stability and performance when few reference spectra are available.\nCopyright 2015 California Institute of Technology.

            "abstract": "Ongoing uplift of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State represents unknown contributions from Cascadia subduction zone processes, including earthquakes, interseismic deformation, aseismic slow slip events, and north-south shortening of the North American plate focused on upper plate faults. The relationship between upper plate faults and Cascadia subduction is poorly understood, as is the seismic hazard posed by these structures to the greater Puget Sound region. The Wynoochee River is a south-flowing drainage in the southern Olympic Mountains bisected by a previously uncharacterized section of the Canyon River reverse fault. In this study we utilize high-resolution aerial lidar and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of offset fluvial terraces to determine the kinematics and slip rate of the Canyon River fault over the late Quaternary. In combination with surficial geologic mapping and differential GPS surveys of terrace straths observed in the field, we also determine incision rates along the Wynoochee River from OSL dates. Our mapping reveals eight generations of fluvial and glaciofluvial terraces, with twenty-one pending ages from OSL sampling of fluvial sands intercalated with outwash and river gravels. Additionally, we compare our slip rate results with a boundary element model, estimating the stress on the Canyon River fault over the recent decades, as constrained by GPS data from the Cascadia subduction zone. Preliminary results indicate that the Canyon River fault is a long-lived feature with south-side-up and left-lateral displacement. Taken together, our results enable comparison of deformation rates constrained by short-term, geodetic data with those acting over longer-term geologic time scales.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of low permeability reservoirs can induce microseismic events during fracture development. For this reason, microseismic monitoring using sensors on surface or in borehole have been widely used to delineate fracture spatial distribution and to understand fracturing mechanisms. It is often the case that the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) is determined solely based on microseismic locations. However, it is known that for some fracture development stage, long period long duration events, instead of microseismic events may be associated. In addition, because microseismic events are essentially weak and there exist different sources of noise during monitoring, some microseismic events could not be detected and thus located. Therefore the estimation of the SRV is biased if it is solely determined by microseismic locations.\nWith the existence of fluids and fractures, the seismic velocity of reservoir layers will be decreased. Based on this fact, we have developed a near real time seismic velocity tomography method to characterize velocity changes associated with fracturing process. The method is based on double-difference seismic tomography algorithm to image the fracturing zone where microseismic events occur by using differential arrival times from microseismic event pairs. To take into account varying data distribution for different fracking stages, the method solves the velocity model in the wavelet domain so that different scales of model features can be obtained according to different data distribution.\nWe have applied this real time tomography method to both acoustic emission data from lab experiment and microseismic data from a downhole microseismic monitoring project for shale gas hydraulic fracturing treatment. The tomography results from lab data clearly show the velocity changes associated with different rock fracturing stages. For the field data application, it shows that microseismic events are located in low velocity anomalies. By combining low velocity anomalies with microseismic events, we should better estimate the SRV.",

This project is aimed at the development of a National System for prevention and mitigation of the earthquakes damages, through the definition of a model that achieves the mitigation of the building collapsing risk and the consequent reduction of casualties. Such a model is based on two main issues a) a correct evaluation of risk, defined as a reliable assessment of the hazard expected at a given site and of the vulnerability of civil and industrial buildings, b) setting up of novel strategies for the safety of buildings.\nThe hazard assessment is pursued through the application of innovative multidisciplinary geophysical methodologies and the application of a physically based earthquake simulator. The structural vulnerability of buildings is estimated by means of simplified techniques based on few representative parameters (such as different structural typologies, dynamic soil-structure interaction, etc.) and, for detailed studies, standard protocols for model updating techniques. We analyze, through numerical and experimental approaches, new solutions for the use of innovative materials, and new techniques for the reduction of seismic vulnerability of structural, non-structural and accessorial elements, including low cost type.\nThe project activities are initially implemented on a study area in Southern Italy (Calabria) selected because of its tectonic complexity. The results are expected to be applicable for other hazardous seismic areas of Italy.",

            "abstract": "High latitude peatlands represent a major terrestrial carbon store sensitive to climate change, as well as a globally significant methane source. While elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and warming temperatures may increase peat respiration and C losses to the atmosphere, reductions in peatland water tables associated with increased growing season evapotranspiration may alter the nature of trace gas emission and increase peat C losses as CO2 relative to methane (CH4). As CH4 is a greenhouse gas with twenty times the warming potential of CO2, it is critical to understand how surface fluxes of CO2 and CH4 will be influenced by factors associated with global climate change. We used automated soil respiration chambers to assess the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 and whole ecosystem warming on peatland CH4 and CO2 fluxes at the SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change) Experiment in northern Minnesota. Belowground warming treatments were initiated in July 2014 and whole ecosystem warming and elevated CO2 treatments began in August 2015. Here we report soil iCO2 and iCH4 flux responses to the first year of belowground warming and the first two months of whole ecosystem manipulation. We also leverage the spatial and temporal density of measurements across the twenty autochambers to assess how physical (i.e., plant species composition, microtopography) and environmental (i.e., peat temperature, water table position, oxygen availability) factors influence observed rates of CH4 and CO2 loss. We find that methane fluxes increased significantly across warming treatments following the first year of belowground warming, while belowground warming alone had little influence on soil CO2 fluxes. Peat microtopography strongly influenced trace gas emission rates, with higher CH4 fluxes in hollow locations and higher CO2 fluxes in hummock locations. While there was no difference in the isotopic composition of the methane fluxes between hollow and hummock locations, δ13CH4 was more depleted in the early and late growing season, indicating a transition from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic methanogenesis during periods of high photosynthetic input.",

            "abstract": "A significant portion of the in-cloud lightning development is observed as a series of initial breakdown pulses (IBPs) that are characterized by an abrupt change in the electric field at a remote sensor. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have attributed this process to the stepwise elongation of an initial lightning leader inside the thunderstorm [da Silva and Pasko, JGR, 120, 4989–5009, 2015, and references therein]. Attempts to visually observe these events are hampered due to the fact that clouds are opaque to optical radiation. Due to this reason, throughout the last decade, a number of researchers have used the so-called transmission line models (also commonly referred to as engineering models), widely employed for return stroke simulations, to simulate the waveshapes of IBPs, and also of narrow bipolar events. The transmission line (TL) model approach is to prescribe the source current dynamics in a certain manner to match the measured E-field change waveform, with the purpose of retrieving key information about the source, such as its height, peak current, size, speed of charge motion, etc. Although the TL matching method is not necessarily physics-driven, the estimated source characteristics can give insights on the dominant length- and time-scales, as well as, on the energetics of the source. This contributes to better understanding of the environment where the onset and early stages of lightning development takes place.\nIn the present work, we use numerical modeling to constrain the number of source parameters that can be confidently inferred from the observed far-field IBP waveforms. We compare different modified TL models (i.e., with different attenuation behaviors) to show that they tend to produce similar waveforms in conditions where the channel is short. We also demonstrate that it is impossible to simultaneously retrieve the speed of source current propagation and channel length from an observed IBP waveform, in contrast to what has been previously done in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the simulated field-to-current conversion factor in IBP sources can vary by more than one order of magnitude, making peak current estimates for intracloud lightning processes a challenging task.",

Making progress on this front necessarily requires detailed understanding of the various acceleration mechanisms that lead to escape. With this in mind, we note that one open question which cannot be answered by in situ measurements of escaping ions is the altitude from which these escaping ions originate. A 3-D kinetic model, the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS), is used to track oxygen ions from their source. AMPS takes collisions into account, allowing for the examination of the entire upper atmosphere, from beneath the ionospheric peak, through the transition region in which collisions become rare, all the way out to several Mars radii, making AMPS an effective tool for studying the source regions associated with the escape of O+ from the atmosphere of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Despite climate projections, there is uncertainty in how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to warming temperatures and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Earth system models are used to determine how ecosystems will respond in the future, but there is considerable variation in how plant traits are represented within these models. A potential approach to reducing uncertainty is the establishment of spectra-trait linkages among plant species. These relationships allow the accurate estimation of biochemical characteristics of plants from their shortwave spectral profiles. Remote sensing approaches can then be implemented to acquire spectral data and estimate plant traits over large spatial and temporal scales. This paper describes a greenhouse experiment conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory in which spectra-trait relationships were investigated for 8 different plant species. This research was designed to generate a broad gradient in plant traits, using a range of species grown in different sized pots with different soil type. Fertilizer was also applied in different amounts to generate variation in plant C and N status that will be reflected in the traits measured, as well as the spectra observed. Leaves were sampled at different developmental stages to increase variation. Spectra and plant traits were then measured and a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach was used to establish spectra-trait relationships. Despite the variability in growing conditions and plant species, our PLSR models could be used to accurately estimate plant traits from spectral signatures, yielding model calibration R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values, respectively, of 0.85 and 0.30 for percent nitrogen by mass (Nmass%), R2 0.78 and 0.75 for carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, 0.87 and 2.39 for leaf mass area (LMA), and 0.76 R2 and 15.16 for water (H2O) content. This research forms the basis for establishing new and more comprehensive spectra-trait relationships that could be used to reduce uncertainty in the parameterization of models representing the structure of functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In the future, remote sensing from unmanned aerial systems and satellites could provide greater temporal and spatial scaling to take spectral signatures on global vegetation.",

The survey found that 87% of the respondents supported scientists taking an active role in public policy debates about science and technology (S&T), but most believed that regulations related to areas like land use and clean air and water are not guided by the best science. Despite the demand for actionable scientific information by policy makers, these survey results underscore the gap that exists between the scientific and the public policy communities.\nThere are fundamental differences that exist between the perspectives of these two groups, even within Federal S&T agencies that are required to balance the perspectives of the science and policy communities in order to fulfill their agency mission. In support of an ongoing agency effort to strengthen communication and interaction among staff, we led a Federal S&T agency office through an examination and comparison of goals, processes, external drivers, decision making, and timelines within their organization. This workshop activity provided an opportunity to identify the interdependence of science and policy, as well as the challenges to developing effective science-based policy solutions.\nThe workshop featured strategies for achieving balanced science policy outcomes using examples from a range of Federal S&T agencies. The examples presented during the workshop illustrated best practices for more effective communication and interaction to resolve complex science policy issues. The workshop culminated with a group activity designed to give participants the opportunity to identify the challenges and apply best practices to real world science policy problems.

            "abstract": "Topoclimatic diversity is considered an important trait of climatic refugia as it should allow for short distance dispersal of organisms to ameliorate climatic shifts. Nevertheless, topoclimatic diversity can be a challenge to quantify in the absence of distributed sensors or extensive instrumentation. In practice, topographic complexity is used as a proxy for topoclimatic diversity with the assumption that complex terrain will necessarily lead to diverse climates. However, this ignores spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture, snow cover, land cover, and vegetation which mediates the influence terrain has on climate. To better quantify topoclimatic diversity, we examine ten year climatological means for each month for daytime and nighttime MODIS Aqua satellite land surface temperature (LST) observations over the pacific northwest of the U.S. LST is well suited for this application because it is sensitive to variability in regional climate, hydrology, and land cover all of which can dramatically alter the energy balance and temperature of a site. We decompose the spatio-temporal variability in LST into its drivers including geographic position (x,y,z), biophysical factors (e.g. snow cover, vegetation cover, land surface type), and topoclimatic factors (e.g. cold air drainage, aspect). We find that nighttime LST data can be readily used to identify topoclimatic diversity driven by cold air pooling and thermal stratification of minimum temperatures whereas daytime LST data primarily characterizes the influence of vegetation cover on maximum temperatures. For both daytime and nighttime LST, the relative influence of topoclimatic drivers varies seasonally and is also sensitive to maritime influences or continentality of the site. Our approach allows for the decomposition of thermal variability into spatial and temporal components and allows for directly mapping regions of high topoclimatic diversity, an initial step for identifying potential climate refugia.",

            "abstract": "Depth distribution of soil carbon storage determines the sensitivity of soil carbon to environmental change. We present different approaches that have been used to represent the vertical heterogeneity of soil carbon both in mapping and modeling studies. In digital soil mapping, many studies applied exponential decay functions in soils where carbon concentration has been observed to decline with depth. Recent studies used various forms of spline functions to better represent the vertical distribution of soil carbon along with soil horizons. These studies fitted mathematical functions that described the observations and then interpolated the model coefficients using soil-forming factors and used maps of model coefficients with depth to predict the SOC storage at desired depth intervals. In general, the prediction accuracy decreased with depth and the challenge remains to find appropriate soil-forming factors that determine/explain subsurface soil variation. Models such as Century, RothC, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model use the exponential depth distribution functions of soil carbon in their model structures. In CLM 4.5 the soil profile is partitioned into 10 layers down to 3.8 m depth and the carbon input from plant roots is assumed to decrease following an exponential function. Not accounting for soil horizons in representing biogeochemistry and the assumption of globally uniform soil depth remain major sources of uncertainty in these models. In this presentation, we will discuss the merits and demerits of using various profile depth distribution functions to represent the vertical heterogeneity of soil carbon storage.",

The model uses spherical coordinates, accounts for a non-dipole magnetic field, vertical structure of the ionosphere, and an air gap below the ionosphere. A realistic density model is used. Below the exobase altitude (2000 km) the densities and the temperatures of electrons, ions, and neutrals are obtained from the IRI and MSIS models. Above the exobase, ballistic (originating from the ionosphere and returning to ionosphere) and trapped (bouncing between two reflection points above the ionosphere) electron populations are considered similar to [Pierrard and Stegen (2008), JGR, v.113, A10209]. Plasma parameters at the exobase provided by the IRI are the boundary conditions for the ballistic electrons while the [Carpenter and Anderson (1992), JGR, v.97, p.1097] model of equatorial electron density defines parameters of the trapped electron population. In the simulations that are presented, Alfven waves with frequencies from 1 Hz to 0.01 Hz and finite azimuthal wavenumbers are excited in the magnetosphere and compared with Van Allen Probes data and ground-based observations from the CARISMA array of ground magnetometers. When short perpendicular scale waves reflect form the ionosphere, compressional Alfven waves are observed to propagate across the geomagnetic field in the ionospheric waveguide [e.g., Lysak (1999), JGR, v.104, p.10017]. Signals produced by the waves on the ground are discussed. The wave model is also applied to interpret recent Van Allen Probes observations of kinetic scale ULF waves that are associated with radiation belt electron dynamics and energetic particle injections.",

            "abstract": "The temporal evolution of erosion over million-year timescales is key to understanding the evolution of mountain ranges and adjacent fold-and-thrust belts. While models of orogenic wedge evolution predict an instantaneous response of erosion to pulses of rock uplift, stream-power based landscape evolution models predict catchment-wide erosion maxima that lag behind a rock uplift pulse. Here, we explore the relationships between rock uplift, erosion, and sediment deposition in the Argentine Precordillera fold-and-thrust belt at 30°S where extensive previous work documents deformation, climate and sediment accumulation histories. Sandstone samples spanning 8.8 to 1.8 Ma were collected from the previously dated wedge-top (Iglesia) and foredeep basins (Bermejo) for quartz purification and 10Be extraction. 10Be concentrations due to burial and exhumation were estimated and subtracted from the measured concentrations and yielded the inherited 10Be concentrations, which were then corrected for sample magnetostratigraphic age. The inherited concentrations were then used to calculate paleoerosion rates. We modeled various pre-burial and post-burial exposure scenarios in order to assess potential sources of uncertainty in the recovered paleoerosion rates. The modeling results reveal that pre-burial and post-burial exposure periods only marginally affect our results. By combining the 10Be-derived paleoerosion rates and geomorphic observations with detrital zircon provenance, we document the isolation of the wedge-top basin, which was later reconnected by an upstream migrating pulse of erosion in a process that was directly controlled by thrust activity and base level. The data further indicate that the attainment of maximum upland erosion rates lags maximum rates of deformation and subsidence over million-year timescales. The magnitudes and causes of the erosional delays shed new light on the catchment erosional response to tectonic deformation and rock uplift in orogenic wedges.",

            "abstract": "Detailed measurements of individual sand grains moving on a streambed allow us to obtain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of incipient motion and evaluate spatial and temporal trends in particle entrainment. We use bed load particle motions measured from high-speed imaging (250 Hz) of uniform, coarse grained sand from two flume experiments, which have different mean fluid velocities near the bed. Particle tracking reveals more than 6,000 entrainment events in 5 seconds (Run 1) and over 5,000 events in 2 seconds (Run 2). We manually track particles, at sub-pixel resolution, from entrainment to either disentrainment or until the particle leaves the frame. Within these experiments we find that over 90% of all initial motions contain a cross-stream component of motion where approximately a third of the motions may be cross-stream dominated, and furthermore, up to 7% of the motions may be negative (i.e. move backwards). We propose that the variability in the direction of initial motion is, in part, a product of the bed topography, where we find that with increasing mean fluid velocity, the initial motion of the sand particles are less sensitive to bed topography, and are more likely to be dominated by the fluid. The high resolution of this data set, containing positions of particles measured start-to-stop, allows us to calculate the characteristic timescale required for a particle to become streamwise, or fluid, dominated in these systems. We also evaluate these data to further show whether the nature of entrainment is a memoryless, uncorrelated process, a correlated process related to the number of particles already in motion (i.e., possibly reflecting collective entrainment), or some combination of the two. This work suggests that the probability of entrainment depends on physical factors such as bed microtopography and the magnitude of the fluid velocity, in addition to varying with space and time scales.",

A Monte Carlo code has been developed to track a population of protons in an atmosphere and account for energy loss to collisional processes including heating, ionization, excitation, and charge transfer. The model framework is open to multiple planetary-specific inputs (e.g. three-dimensional neutral densities, electric and magnetic fields) and uses an adaptive trace algorithm to accurately model collisions in dense and sparse atmospheric regions. Applying 3-D models of electric and magnetic fields from the Michigan Mars MHD code and 1-D neutral densities from the Mars Global Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (M-GITM), we use this model to calculate volume rates of relevant proton-mediated energy loss processes in the Martian upper atmosphere. The model will be improved to generate ionization and heating rates in areas of strong and weak crustal magnetic fields for solar energetic particle events observed by the SEP instrument on MAVEN. Ultimately this will form part of a comprehensive model of solar wind interactions with Mars.",

            "abstract": "Proteomics has the potential to elucidate the metabolic pathways and taxa responsible for in situ biogeochemical transformations. However, low rates of protein identification from high resolution mass spectra have been a barrier to the development of proteomics in complex environmental samples. Much of the difficulty lies in the computational challenge of linking mass spectra to their corresponding proteins. Traditional database search methods for matching peptide sequences to mass spectra are often inadequate due to the complexity of environmental proteomes and the large database search space, as we demonstrate with soil and sediment proteomes generated via a range of extraction methods.\nOne alternative to traditional database searching is de novo sequencing, which identifies peptide sequences without the need for a database. BLAST can then be used to match de novo sequences to similar genetic sequences. Assigning confidence to putative identifications has been one hurdle for the implementation of de novo sequencing. We found that accurate de novo sequences can be screened by quality score and length. Screening criteria are verified by comparing the results of de novo sequencing and traditional database searching for well-characterized proteomes from simple biological systems. The BLAST hits of screened sequences are interrogated for taxonomic and functional information.\nWe applied de novo sequencing to organic topsoil and marine sediment proteomes. Peak-rich proteomes, which can result from various extraction techniques, yield thousands of high-confidence protein identifications, an improvement over previous proteomic studies of soil and sediment. User-friendly software tools for de novo metaproteomics analysis have been developed. This “De Novo Analysis” Pipeline is also a faster method of data analysis than constructing a tailored sequence database for traditional database searching.",

In particular, sediment Fe-Mn oxide coatings have the advantage of providing high resolution records, but application of this proxy is weakened by uncertainty in both signal extraction methodology and, more importantly yet underappreciated, how authigenic signals relate to bottom water. Here, we present data from the extraction of authigenic εNd signals from sediments in the Gulf of Alaska and explore systematically the influence of volcanic material on leaching, which has been argued to bias leachates to more radiogenic values. We tested how reagent type, concentration and leaching duration affect the resultant εNd and then applied one method to a set of coretop samples, monitoring major and trace element concentrations and strontium isotope ratios to identify the source of leachate Nd. Leachates are enriched in elements characterizing Fe-Mn crust (Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn) and depleted in elements typically associated with volcanic materials (Cr, Sc, Nb and Ta). Such evidence supports the authigenic source of leachate Nd: however, extracted εNd values are still consistently ~1.5 units higher than bottom water below 500 m. We conclude that the authigenic phases record pore water, not bottom water, εNd. Authigenic phases likely reflect bottom water in locations where pore water and bottom water are similar: however, in places where they are considerably different, e.g., because of volcanic particle diagenesis, interpreting εNd records demands care. Further study of the diagenetic cycle of Nd will improve our ability to explain authigenic εNd records, but presently we suggest the best paleoceanographic practice is to consider εNd gradients instead of absolute values.",

            "abstract": "Central Anatolia (Central Turkey) possesses all the characteristics of a plateau. It experienced a period of rapid and substantial uplift (late Miocene, ∼8 Ma) while significant crustal shortening did not occur. Similar to other plateaus, the presence of volcanic ash and tuff within the sediments suggest that uplift was preceded by widespread volcanism (∼14-9Ma). The lithospheric context of these events is, however, unknown. For the Eastern Anatolian plateau, similar events have been attributed to southward retread followed by slab break-off of the northern Neotethys slab. Recent tomographic results indicate that this northern Neotethys slab extended beneath both the Eastern and Central Anatolian plateau prior to late Miocene delamination and possibly even beneath western Anatolia prior to the Eocene (?). We propose a new lithospheric scenario for the regional evolution for the Aegean-Anatolia-Near East region that combines a recent compilation of surface geology data with the structure of the upper mantle imaged with tomography.\nIn our new scenario for the evolution of the Aegean-Anatolia-Near East region, a single continuous subduction zone south of the Pontides (Izmir – Ankara – Erzincan crustal suture zone) accommodated the Africa – Eurasia convergence until the end of the late Cretaceous. In the Late Cretaceous - Eocene the northern Neotethys Ocean closed followed by Anatolide – Taurides (south) and Pontides (north) continental collision along the Izmir – Ankara – Erzincan crustal suture zone. While the trench jumped to the south of Anatolide – Taurides terrane, subduction continued beneath the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture where the northern Neotethys slab continued to sink into the deeper mantle. In the early Miocene (∼20-15Ma), the northern Neotethys slab started to retreat southward towards the trench, resulting in delamination of the lithospheric mantle. The last part of (early Miocene - recent) our scenario is testable. We use a coupled thermal-flexural model of the lithosphere. Model results show that delamination can explain the average present-day long-wavelength topography of the Central Anatolian plateau. For the Eastern Anatolian plateau, delamination explains half the present-day elevation: the other half resulted from crustal thickening.",

Miyama2\nInternational Pacific Research Center, University of Hawaii, USA\nApplication Laboratory, JAMSTEC, Japan\nIn climate models, simulating the monsoon precipitation climatology remains a grand challenge. Compared to CMIP3, the multi-model-mean (MMM) errors for Asian-Australian monsoon (AAM) precipitation climatology in CMIP5, relative to GPCP observations, have shown little improvement. One of the implications is that uncertainties in the future projections of time-mean changes to AAM rainfall may not have reduced from CMIP3 to CMIP5. Despite dedicated efforts by the modeling community, the progress in monsoon modeling is rather slow. This leads us to wonder: Has the scientific community reached a \"plateau\" in modeling mean monsoon precipitation?\nOur focus here is to better understanding of the coupled air-sea interactions, and moist processes that govern the precipitation characteristics over the tropical Indian Ocean where large-scale errors persist. A series idealized coupled model experiments are performed to test the hypothesis that errors in the coupled processes along the equatorial Indian Ocean during inter-monsoon seasons could potentially influence systematic errors during the monsoon season. Moist static energy budget diagnostics has been performed to identify the leading moist and radiative processes that account for the large-scale errors in the simulated precipitation. As a way forward, we propose three coordinated efforts, and they are: (i) idealized coupled model experiments; (ii) process-based diagnostics and (iii) direct observations to constrain model physics. We will argue that a systematic and coordinated approach in the identification of the various interactive processes that shape the precipitation basic state needs to be carried out, and high-quality observations over the data sparse monsoon region are needed to validate models and further improve model physics.",

Compared with single system, multi-GNSS can significantly improve the satellite visibility, optimize the spatial geometry, reduce dilution of precision and will be of great benefits to both scientific applications and engineering services. In this contribution, we focus mainly on its potential advantages for earthquake parameters estimation and tsunami early warning. First, we assess the precise positioning performance of multi-GNSS by an out-door experiment on a shaking table. Three positioning methods were used to retrieve the simulated seismic signal: precise point positioning (PPP), variometric approach for displacements analysis stand-alone engine (VADASE) and temporal point positioning (TPP). In addition to that, with respect to VADASE and TPP, we extended the original dual-frequency model to single-frequency model and then tested the algorithms. Accuracy, reliability, and continuity were evaluated and analyzed in detail accordingly. Our results revealed that multi-GNSS offer more precise and robust positioning results over GPS-only. At last, as a case study, multi-GNSS data recorded during 2014 Pisagua Earthquake were re-processed. Using co-seismic displacements from GPS and multi-GNSS, earthquake and the aftermath tsunami were inverted, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing extreme precipitations at different spatial and temporal scales is crucial in order to evaluate and predict the impacts of natural hazards on regional ecosystems. Being governed by climate and weather processes acting at different scales, extreme precipitations are highly variable in space and time. As a result, observational scales and measurement techniques have a major impact on the statistical description of extreme precipitation intensity. Equally important, the coverage and the resolution of available data, whether observed at meteorological stations or simulated by weather and climate models, often mismatch the resolution needed in applications.\nOne interesting paradigm in conducing multi-scale analysis of precipitations is the scaling model framework. In particular, physical evidences of the simple scaling properties of extreme precipitation distribution have been provided by several studies. However, the use of these models has been mainly restricted to specific regions and small observational datasets. A deeper analysis of the effect of geo-climatic factors over large regions and of datasets characteristics [e.g., their temporal and spatial resolution, or spatial coverage] is thus needed.\nThe present study aims to deepen the knowledge of the spatial distribution over North America of the estimated scaling laws for extreme rainfall intensities. The variability of these laws over various temporal scale ranges is also evaluated. The objective is to present the influence of climatic and geographic characteristics on scaling estimates over this study region for several duration ranges.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how fast the ocean melts Antarctic ice shelves, which are known to restrain the flow of ice from the continental interior, is important to future ice sheet contributions to global sea level rise. Dependant on oceanographic processes delivering ocean heat from the Southern Ocean to the ice, changing rates of ice shelf basal melting ultimately contribute to variations in ice shelf thickness that can affect the discharge of grounded ice into the ocean. Being able to understanding and then predict the way basal melting responds to a changing ocean, requires ocean models that include fully interactive ice shelves and melting processes within their domain. Although such ocean models exist, their performance in the sub-ice shelf part of the domain is very difficult to optimise and validate. Highly accurate measurements of melt rates can be provided by phase-sensitive radars (e.g. pRES), although these have been limited to long term averages. Recent developments by BAS and UCL however, have provided a lightweight, low-power and relatively low cost radar for year-round autonomous operation (ApRES), delivering long time series of ice thickness changes. At tidal time scales however, ice shelves respond elastically to tilting, with significant fluctuations in vertical strain that will appear as apparent basal melting or even freezing. To determine the true basal melt rate at tidal time scales these radar observed vertical strain fluctuations must be removed. At Site 5 on Ronne Ice Shelf, the combined availability of radar-derived melt rates, independent measurements from oceanographic instruments beneath the ice shelf, and GPS strain observations provide a powerful test of both how the ocean interacts with the ice shelf base and the tidally induced melt rates. Using these data we will discuss our ability to accurately predict the temporal details of melt rates beneath ice shelves using ApRES radar.",

This cool event has been associated with ice sheet readvance, meridional overturning, circulation changes, and southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In Southern California, the Younger Dryas has been associated with cooler SST, low marine productivity, a well-ventilated oxygen minimum zone, and a wetter climate. Similar rapid cooling events have been found at other terminations including Termination 5 at the MIS 11-12 deglaciation (~425 Ka) identified by ice rafting events in the North Atlantic. Here we present new pollen census data from a unique suite of cores taken from the sub-oxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin (MV0508-15JC, MV0805-20JC, MV0508-33JC, 29JC and 21JC). These short cores, collected on a truncated anticline within SBB, provide the opportunity to examine the response of southern California terrestrial and marine ecosystems to rapid climate change during the MIS 11-12 deglaciation (Termination 5), which is identified by a bioturbated interval within a sequence of laminated sediments. During Termination 1, changes in Southern California precipitation are reflected in pollen- based reconstructions Southern California vegetation. The high precipitation of glacial montane-coniferous assemblages of pine (Pinus) and Juniper (Juniperus/Calocedrus) transitions into interglacial drought, as expresssed by arid oak (Quercus)/chaparral vegetation. The Younger Dryas interrupts the transition as a high-amplitude pulse in pine associated with increased Gramineae (grass). Termination 5 differs, as the high precipitation of glacial montane-coniferous assemblages do not transition into arid oak/chaparral vegetation. However, a Younger Dryas-like rapid climate event was associated with increased pine and grass.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source of ammonia (NH3) on a global scale with major contributions from the application of synthetic fertilizer and manure from livestock. While strict controls are placed on the emissions of many industrial pollutants, NH3 concentrations are expected to increase this century. In addition to future expansion of agricultural activities that could lead to greater NH3 emissions, NH3 emissions are affected by changes in temperature and precipitation. Here we use a newly developed agricultural N pathways model running in a global terrestrial model (Community Land Model v4.0) to estimate future NH3 emissions from manure and synthetic fertilizer application, and the impact of changing climate on these emissions and other N pathways (runoff, denitrification, etc.). We include future increases in the application of manure and synthetic fertilizer that are consistent with a middle-of-the-road projection of population growth and per capita caloric intake. Combined with atmospheric forcing that follows RCP8.5, NH3 emissions increase by about 50% and 90% between years 2010 and 2100 from synthetic fertilizer and manure, respectively. Roughly 25% of this increase can be attributed to the changing climate, mainly increased global temperatures over the 21st century. We show associated changes in ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate aerosol concentrations and radiative forcings, the results of a set of additional simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model v5.0 and an offline radiative transfer scheme. This work suggests that projections of global NH3 concentrations need to take changes in climate into account.",

At the same time, agricultural practices can modify temperatures by altering the surface energy budget. Here we investigate growing season climate trends in major cropping systems and their relationship with agricultural land use change. In the US Midwest, 100-year trends exhibit a transition towards more favorable conditions, with cooler summer temperature extremes and increased precipitation. Statistically significant correspondence is found between the cooling pattern and trends in cropland intensification, as well as with trends towards greater irrigated land over a small subset of the domain. Land conversion to cropland, often considered an important influence on historical temperatures, is not significantly associated with cooling. We suggest that cooling is primarily associated with agricultural intensification increasing the potential for evapotranspiration, consistent with our finding that cooling trends are greatest for the highest temperature percentiles, and that increased evapotranspiration generally leads to greater precipitation. Temperatures over rainfed croplands show no cooling trend during drought conditions, consistent with evapotranspiration requiring adequate soil moisture, and implying that modern drought events feature greater warming as baseline cooler temperatures revert to historically high extremes. Preliminary results indicate these relationships between temperature extremes, irrigation, and intensification are also observed in other major summer cropping systems, including northeast China, Argentina, and the Canadian Prairies.",

A consistent positive Ps phase, presumably converted at the Moho interface, can be clearly observed at most stations. The Ps arrival time varies within 3-5.5 s, showing an increase from the passive continental margin to the eastern North American craton. Correspondingly, the crust thickens from 27 km to 45 km landward as inferred from the forward modeling of stacked radial receiver functions. A sharp Moho offset is observed across the state border from New York to Vermont and Massachusetts, which is expected at the transition from the older Proterozoic Grenville Province to the younger accreted Appalachian terranes. Nevertheless, no such pattern is observed beneath the northern part of the study area. A clear negative Ps phase is detected within a range of 6.5-9.5 s at most long-running broadband stations, which requires a sharp velocity decreasing with depth and may be generated at the base of the lithosphere. The arrival time of the negative phase gradually increases toward northwest, indicating the deepening of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.",

            "abstract": "A key process in wintertime orographic cloud seeding using ground-based generators is the dispersion of silver iodide particles released from the generators in the mountainous area. The dispersion features determine the targeting efficiency and ultimately the seeding effect on the ground under favorable seeding conditions. Previous field experiments showed that the silver iodide plumes were narrow (spread angle was around 20 degrees) and were confined within the mountainous boundary layer (usually lower than 1 km AGL). The numerical simulation of the particle dispersion in complex terrain using weather models is challenging due to the stable atmosphere in winter, the unresolved terrain-flow interaction, and the inherent numerical diffusion close to the source point in the Eulerian framework. A recent study by Xue et al. (2014) showed that Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the particle dispersion in complex terrain with grid spacing of 100 m could reproduce most observed features while simulations using PBL schemes with 500 m grid spacing had difficulty reproducing the vertical dispersion. This study will simulate the same case using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in LES mode and with several PBL schemes. The differences between the LES-simulated dispersion results and the PBL results will be analyzed and presented. Especially, the difference attributed to the unrepresented sub-grid scale (SGS) topography information in the PBL will be studied in detail. The ultimate goal of this study is to incorporate the dispersion due to turbulent kinetic energy induced by SGS topography into the existing PBL schemes to better simulate the process in mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "In mid 2012, a severe drought swept across the Midwest, the heartland of corn production in the U.S. When the drought persisted into late Fall, corn markets were affected in two distinct ways: (1) reduced rainfall led to projected and actual corn yields that were lower than expected and (2) navigation restrictions, a result of low water levels on the Mississippi River, disrupted barge transportation, the most common and inexpensive mode for moving corn to many markets. Both (1) and (2) led to significant financial losses, but due to the complexity of the economic system and the coincidence of two different market impacts, the size of the role that low water levels played wass unclear. This is important, as losses related to low water levels are used to justify substantial investments in dredging activities on the Mississippi River.\nAn “engineering” model of the system, suggests that low water levels should drive large increases in barge and corn prices, while some econometric models suggest that water levels explain very little of the changes in barge rates and corn prices. Employing a model that integrates both the engineering and economic elements of the system indicates that corn prices and barge rates during the drought display spatial and temporal behavior that is difficult to explain using either the engineering or econometric models alone. This integrated model accounts for geographic and temporal variations in drought impacts and identifies unique market responses to four different sets of conditions over the drought’s length. Results illustrate that corn and barge price responses during the drought were a product of comingled, but distinct, reactions to both supply changes and navigation disruptions. Results also provide a more structured description of how the economic system that governs corn allocation interacts with the Mississippi River system during drought. As both public and private parties discuss potential managerial or infrastructural methods for keeping shipping channels open during drought, the results of this work should help them to decide how different interventions might benefit or hurt barge operators and/or corn sellers.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster_JP.pdf\nWe present laboratory findings on burst-like premonitory slip propagation that leads to fault rupture. The experiments take place on a PMMA-PMMA interface in a direct shear configuration, where the effective strength heterogeneity is controlled by the non-uniform distribution of asperities throughout the fault. A pressure sensitive film was used to locate, size and measure normal stress on individual asperities. Prior to rapid sliding, we observed slow premonitory slip which accumulated non-uniformly along the fault. Slow displacement was measured using slip sensors placed at seven locations along the fault strike and showed intermittent, ‘burst-like’ increases in spectral power between the frequencies of 60 to 150 Hz. Each burst event lasted between 5 to 12 seconds, and a local increase in the extended fault slip rate was observed after its cessation. The ‘burst-like’ features migrated along the fault at speeds between Vprop ~ 1.3 mm/s to 9.3 mm/s. Propagation speed of the ‘burst-like’ front Vprop was dependent on the normal stress confining the fault σn– increased normal stress caused the rupture to move slower by increasing ‘effective fault strength’. Finally, foreshocks were recorded using absolutely calibrated acoustic emission sensors and occurred at the later stages of the slow slip phase. The source radii of the foreshocks [Brune, 1970] ranged from 0.21 to 1.09 mm and their ruptures occurred over timescales ~5-7 orders of magnitude faster than the ‘burst-like’ slow slip signals. Observations of similar variations in time scales have been made between regular earthquakes and aseismic transients in the field [Ide, 2007]. These results will help develop a mechanistic understanding of the effective fault strength heterogeneity necessary for the development of slow earthquakes and tremor-like shaking.\n",

Thus, their sustained shrinkage portrays these glaciers as archetype of global warming impacts on the local scale. However, there is still no deep understanding on the mechanism connecting temperature and these glaciers. Among others, the effect of temperature on the glacier surface mass balance (GSMB) can be expressed within accumulation regimes and hence in surface albedo, or in ablation dynamics through incoming longwave energy (LE). Here, we report a study combining statistical analyses of reanalysis data (~30km grid-cell), regional climate modeling and glacier mass balance simulations at high resolution (2km) to analyze long-term (30 years) and seasonal GSMB along north-central Peru. Our goal is to mechanistically understand climate change impact on these glaciers. Results suggest temperature as the main factor controlling GSMB changes through the lapse rate (LR). Correlations of GSMB with LR, humidity and zonal wind point to vertical homogenization of temperature, causing LE to increase, despite this flux always remaining negative. This “less negative” LE multiplies the impact of the seasonal fluctuation in albedo, thereby enhancing total ablation. As this mechanism only needs a relative increase in temperature, it may even occur in subfreezing conditions. Model output also indicates that turbulent fluxes are small, largely cancelling out. This suggests that the impact of LE is more likely to occur compared to either turbulent fluxes changes or shifts in the proportion of sublimation versus melt, which we find to be regionally stable. These findings imply that glaciers in north-central Peru are sensitive to subtle changes in temperature. We discuss the implications for process-based understanding and how this non-linear and somewhat hidden effect of temperature reduces the skill of temperature index models to simulate GSMB in the Tropics.",

Polar and equatorial measurements of differential travel times and relative amplitudes of PKP and PKIKP are compared with ak135 and PREM and modeled with respect to standard Earth models and their modifications. We find the inner core volume restricted by the range of North latitudes from 18° to 23°, East longitudes from 125° to 135° and depths exceeding 170 km exhibits specific properties as contrasted with its neighborhood. Polar PKIKP propagation velocity in the volume is by 1.4% above ak135 velocity profile, while the equatorial one is only by 0.3%. Amplitude ratio of PKP and PKIKP in the equatorial paths is 1.5 – 2 times as large as in the polar paths. The distinction between polar and equatorial paths in terms of both differential travel times and differential amplitudes indicates the sampled volume features pronounced anisotropic properties, whereas higher propagation velocity corresponds to stronger attenuation. On the contrary, distinction between polar and equatorial traces sampling the inner core outside the delineated volume is minor (in terms of both differential travel time and attenuation), which indicates weaker anisotropy. The observed pattern of localized anisotropic anomaly can be interpreted as an evidence for the plume mode of the inner core convection or in terms of the domain structure.",

These studies are particularly valuable in the arctic and subarctic, regions particularly vulnerable to rapid climate change, but where modern vegetation is understudied compared to proxy applications reliant on vegetation. Here we present δD values from leaf wax compounds of tundra vegetation in the Kangerlussuaq area of western Greenland. We collected samples along a transect that follows 12 sites from the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet, around a small lake (‘Bird Lake’) and to the town of Kangerlussuaq, along the Sandflugtdalen (‘Flying Sand Valley’). We collected a variety of common tundra species in these locations including dwarf shrubs (e.g. Betula nana, Rhododendron lapponica, and Salix glauca), forbs and graminoids (e.g. Calamagrostis lapponica and Eriophorum angustifolium), and horsetails (Equisetum arvense) to study possible interspecies isotopic variability. We measured leaf and stem waters of these plants to help constrain potential drivers of leaf wax n-alkane δD values across this transect. Results are discussed relative to local climate parameters and modelled precipitation values to elucidate source water contributions modified by evaporation and transpiration. This survey of δD values from leaf wax compounds and plant waters in western Greenland will extend stable isotope calibrations to tundra vegetation and provide insights into the use of sedimentary leaf wax compounds for reconstruction of paleohydroclimate.",

Continuous tilt is usually able to detect deformations that are expected to be large (tens to hundreds of microradians) and fast (hours to weeks) for short-term eruptive events. At Mt. Etna, the continuous measurements from shallow borehole tiltmeters have been successfully used to infer the mechanisms of magma accumulation and intrusive processes that foreran and accompanied the several eruptions occurring during the last thirty years on this very active volcano. On the contrary, there are fewer studies on continuous tilt measurements. Indeed, besides problems related to possible instrument failure causing interruptions in the data series, it is generally assumed that a tiltmeter is less stable for a long-term observation than for a short-term and its record could contain real ground deformation, environmental noise, local site effects and instrumental drift. For the first time, we present here 25 years (1990 – 2014) of continuous borehole tilt recorded at Etna volcano at different stations and vertical displacement periodically measured by GPS. To verify the robustness of the two patterns, we compare the borehole tilt series with the dry-tilt deduced from the GPS measurements. We show these long-term series that comprise several main flank eruptions, which we believe are unique in the landscape of instrumental monitoring of geodynamic active areas. We then discuss the coherence of the deformation patterns obtained by the two techniques that provide a new perspective on the long-term behavior of a very active volcano.",

We investigate how urbanization influences spatial and temporal evolution of the carbon cycle from small streams to major rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed using a variety of approaches such as stable isotopes, in situ water quality sensors, and remote sensing. Along the urban watershed continuum, we show that there is spatial evolution in: (1) the amount, chemical form, and reactivity of carbon, and (2) ecosystem metabolism and transformation of carbon sources from headwaters to coastal waters. Over shorter time scales, the interaction between land use and climate variability alters magnitude and sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as revealed by stable isotopes and in situ sensors. Over longer time scales, land use change has altered particulate carbon transport in coastal waters and the evolution of river sediment plumes as suggested by remote sensing data. Furthermore, there are increased long-term bicarbonate alkalinity concentrations in streams and rivers, and we present new analytical approaches for studying river alkalinization due to human inputs and accelerated chemical weathering. In summary, urbanization alters carbon over space and time with major implications for downstream ecosystem metabolism, biological oxygen demand, carbon dioxide production, and river alkalinization.",

            "abstract": "The structure, function, and services of urban ecosystems evolve over time scales from seconds to centuries as Earth’s population grows, infrastructure ages, and management decisions alter them. The concept of “urban evolution” was proposed in order to study changes in urban ecosystems over time. Urban evolution has exerted a major influence on Earth's water and elemental cycles from local to global scales over human history. A current understanding of urban evolution allows urban planning, management, and restoration to move beyond reactive management to predictive management. We explore two key mechanisms of urban evolution, urban selective pressure and adaptation, and their relationship to the evolution of modern water and biogeochemical cycles. Urban selective pressure is an environmental or societal driver contributing to urban adaptation. Urban adaptation is the sequential process by which an urban structure, function, or services becomes more fitted to its changing environment or human choices. We show how hydrological and biogeochemical traits evolve across successive generations of urban ecosystems via shifts in selective pressures and adaptations. We also discuss how urban evolution can be divided into distinct stages and transition periods of growth and expansion and decay and repair during the Anthropocene epoch. We explore multiple examples and drivers of urban evolution and adaptations including the role of unintended consequences and societal drivers. We also present a conceptual model for the evolution of urban waters from the Industrial Revolution to the present day emphasizing the role of urban adaptations in response to selective pressures. Finally, we conclude by proposing new concepts and questions for future research related to the urban evolution of water, material, and energy cycles.",

To provide such information, we developed climate scenarios, in form of narratives and quantitative information, of future climate change and its impacts in southwestern Colorado. This information was intended to provide detailed insights into the range of changes that natural resource managers may face in the future. The scenarios were developed in an iterative process through interactions among the ecologists, social and climate scientists. In our scenario development process, climate uncertainty is acknowledged by having multiple scenarios, where each scenario is regarded as a storyline with equal likelihood as another scenario. We quantified changes in several decision relevant climate and ecological responses based on our best available understanding and provided a tight storyline for each scenario to facilitate (a) a more augmented use of scientific information in a decision-making process, (b) differential responses from stakeholders across the different scenarios, and (c) identification of strategies that could work across these multiple scenarios. Here, we discuss the process of selecting the scenarios, quantifying climate and ecological responses, and the criteria for building the narrative for each scenario. We also discuss the process by which these scenarios get used, and provide an assessment of their effectiveness and users’ feedbacks that could inform the future development of these tools and processes.

            "abstract": "Neutral gases can, through the charge exchange processes, shape the distributions of energetic ions trapped within a planetary magnetosphere, and also redistribute the energetic ion charge states. One region where the prevalence of such processes has been proposed is the orbital region of Jupiter’s moon Europa, where the existence of a neutral gas torus has been inferred. Data from the Galileo Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) showed a depletion of protons with near equatorial pitch angles near Europa, while oxygen and sulfur maintained their trapped profile as they were transported inward. The contrast in these distributions was attributed by Lagg et al. (2003) to the multiple charge states of the oxygen and sulfur, dramatically increasing the charge exchange lifetimes of these species. It was proposed that as the ions diffuse inwards across Europa’s orbit and into the Io torus regions, the distributed neutral gas interactions redistribute the charge states of the heavy ions until, close to Io, these ions may be heavily depleted. And so, the charge state of the heavy ions is a critical parameter in determining whether or not these processes are taking place. Limited evidence for the multiple charged states of heavy ions was provided by Mauk et al. [1999], who analyzed three ion injection events and found evidence of multiply charged energetic oxygen and sulfur ions in two of the events, but not in the third event. Injections introduce a transient disturbance to the ion distributions, and the drift rate of disturbed ions away from the injection region depends on the charge state of the ions. In this work we revisit the Galileo EPD data set and find additional ion dispersion events from which composition can be measured and charge state can be inferred. We aspire to develop a much clearer picture as to the ordering of charge state as a function of radial distance. Results and conclusions will be presented as well as the importance from new measurements from the upcoming Juno, JUICE, and Europa missions.",

            "abstract": "Sediments of Mesozoic age deposited in the Arctic Hammerfest and Tromsø basins (southern Barents Sea) are the focus of a comprehensive provenance study which forms part of ongoing work by the LoCrA consortium (Lower Cretaceous Basin Studies in the Arctic). Jurassic (Stø, Fuglen, Hekkingen) and Cretaceous (Knurr, Kolje, Kolmule) formations were sampled from seven wells. Analytical methods include petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, heavy mineral (HM) analysis and U-Pb on detrital zircons. HM concentration is <1%, with an ultrastable HM assemblage of zircon, rutile, tourmaline, spinel, apatite, garnet, chloritoid and common authigenic heavy minerals and opaques. Cretaceous sedimentary rocks show geochemical variations that reflect an unrecycled Upper Continental Crust signature, whereas Jurassic detritus tends to show more evidence of recycling with a relatively low input of mafic material. Kolmule Formation whole-rock geochemistry indicates sediment recycling from a major Sc-depleted but intermediate to mafic source and hence suggests input of rift detritus from the syn-depositional opening of the Atlantic Ocean. U-Pb ages for detrital zircons for Cretaceous sandstones show age groups of 200-500 Ma, 1200-1800 Ma, and 2100-2800 Ma, indicating potential source regions in the Urals/Novaya Zemlya, the Caledonides, Grenvillian/Sveconorwegian, and Palaeoproterozoic and Archean sources. Provenance data via geochemistry and HM analysis indicate different sources in the same formation basin-wide, with a significant change in provenance and sediment composition from Jurassic to Cretaceous and between the Knurr and Kolmule formations. These differences in composition need to be compared to detailed single grain studies and may only be explained in terms of basin dynamics, or even on a smaller scale, in terms of facies distributions. If so, this case study raises concerns about the use of single samples for provenance models on a larger scale.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC), as one of the most important climate-warming agent, has been the focus of extensive studies in recent years. Mass absorption cross section (MAC) is a key parameter to assess the radiative forcing by linking the mass concentration with the radiation effect. In this study, we conducted a two-month field campaign in Beijing, the capital city of China, in a October and November, a period that severe PM2.5 pollution occurred.\nPM2.5 offline samples were collected daily onto quartz fiber filters by a Partisol 2300 Speciation Sampler. Size-segregated aerosol samples of the size ranged from 0.056 – 10 µm with 11 bins were collected onto quartz fiber filters by a cascade impactor developed by National Chiao Tung University (NCTU). A DRI Model 2001 thermal/optical carbon analyzer were used to analyze the samples. The MAC of BC is measured by a thermal-optical carbon analyzer. In contrast to previous studies, we found that after “shadow effect” has been corrected, the MAC is reduced from 14 m2/g to 5 m2/g with the increase of BC concentrations. There was no significant correlation between MAC with secondary inorganic aerosols. Such unexpected reduction in MAC of BC is possibly associated with the microphysical property of BC modulated under serious pollution condition. The study of size-segregated species concentrations shows that the size distribution of BC is unimodal, with the peak around 0.56-1.8 µm. The results also show the proportion of BC larger than 0.56 µm is significant increased. Additionally, “soot superaggregate”, as distinct from conventional sub-micron aggregates, was found in the bins of BC with size ranged from 1 to1.8 µm. Such high carbon aerosol proportion and large BC size distribution suggests that emissions from residential biomass burning is dominant during this episode. This study suggests that the optical property for BC from different emission sectors should be considered in the estimation of radiative forcing.",

Following amendment with bovine (Bos taurus) urine (Bu) or urea (Ur), we measured inorganic N, pH, N2O, and genes associated with nitrification in two soils (‘L’ and ‘W’) having similar texture, pH, C, and C/N ratio. Solution-phase ammonia (slNH3) was also calculated accounting for non-linear ammonium (NH4+) sorption capacities (ASC). Soil W displayed greater nitrification rates and nitrate (NO3−) levels than soil L, but was more resistant to nitrite (NO2−) accumulation and produced two to ten times less N2O than soil L. Genes associated with NO2− oxidation (nxrA) increased substantially in soil W but remained static in soil L. Soil NO2− was strongly correlated with N2O production, and cumulative (c-) slNH3 explained 87% of the variance in c-NO2−. Differences between soils were explained by greater slNH3 in soil L which inhibited NO2− oxidization leading to greater NO2− levels and N2O production. This is the first study to correlate the dynamics of soil slNH3, NO2−, N2O and nitrifier genes, and the first to show how ASC can regulate NO2− levels and N2O production.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for bottom-water anoxia on the continental shelves waned over the course of the Phanerozoic, which may be influenced by secular changes in the biological pump that led to weaker positive feedbacks within the oceans. The biological pump describes the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean, which creates vertical gradients in nutrients and oxygen, both important influences in the structure of marine ecosystems. We used the cGENIE Earth system model to quantitatively test the hypothesis that reductions in the efficiency of the nutrient recycling loop of the biological pump during the past 550 Ma reduced the extent of anoxia on the shelves and acted as an important control on marine animal ecosystems. When the modeled remineralization depth is shallow relative to the modern ocean, anoxia tends to be more widespread at continental shelf depths. As the modeled remineralization depth increases toward modern conditions, anoxia is less prevalent and occurs at depths below the continental shelves. Reduced marine productivity in the closed system configuration of cGENIE cannot produce the frequent bottom-water anoxia conditions envisioned for the Paleozoic. We hypothesize that evidence for greater animal abundance and metabolic demand during the Phanerozoic was driven by progressive oxygenation of shelf environments related to changes in the biological pump rather than greater food availability. In general, these model simulations suggest changes in the depth distribution of organic carbon remineralization may have controlled observed shifts in ocean chemistry, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem structure during the Phanerozoic.",

The dominant wave mode excited through cyclotron resonance is nearly parallel-propagating, whereas wave modes excited through Landau resonance and anomalous cyclotron resonance can propagate close to the resonance cone. Linear analysis on wave growth rate captures the major resonance modes in the experiment.

Potential processes contributing to mantle flow include northward progression of the African Superplume, radial flow from the Afar plume and vertical flow from small-scale convection along the margins of the Gulf of Aden. These would result in characteristic mantle flow directions, creating mantle anisotropy that can be detected by shear wave splitting. We analyse SKS, SKKS & PKS phases for shear wave splitting at 141 stations deployed throughout Yemen, Oman and Socotra along the margins of the Gulf of Aden. Large numbers of null measurements from a range of back azimuths are found beneath the entire region. These may indicate that vertical anisotropy is present in the upper mantle beneath the region, consistent with models of small-scale convection. The null measurements may also be due to complicated layering of crustal anisotropy interfering destructively and precluding measurement of shear wave splitting. Splitting measurements bordering the Red Sea show North-South orientations that may result from shallow aligned melt along the Red Sea or from variations in lower mantle flow. Fast polarization directions of splitting measurements along the Northern margin of the Gulf of Aden are rift parallel suggesting a shallow source such as rift related faulting might be responsible. These results show that anisotropy beneath the region is not controlled by the northward progression of the African Superplume or radial flow from the Afar plume. Upper mantle flow is likely vertical with splitting occurring either in the crust or the lower mantle.",

It currently uses high rate (1Hz), low latency (< ~5 seconds), accurate positioning (cm level) time series data from a regional GPS network and P-wave event triggers from existing EEW algorithms, e.g. ElarmS, to compute static offsets upon S-wave arrival. G-larmS performs a least squares inversion on these offsets to determine slip on a finite fault, which we use to estimate moment magnitude. These computations are repeated every second for the duration of the event. G-larmS has been in continuous operation at the BSL for over a year using event triggers from the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN) ShakeAlert system and real-time position time series from a fully triangulated network consisting of BARD, PBO and USGS stations across northern California. Pairs of stations are processed as baselines using trackRT (MIT software package). G-larmS produced good results in real-time during the South Napa (M 6.0, August 2014) earthquake as well as on several replayed and simulated test cases. We evaluate the performance of G-larmS for EEW by analysing the results using a set of well defined test cases to investigate the following: (1) using multiple fault regimes and concurrent processing with the ultimate goal of achieving model generation (slip and magnitude computations) within each 1 second GPS epoch on very large magnitude earthquakes (up to M 9.0), (2) the use of Precise Point Positioning (PPP) real-time data streams of various operators, accuracies, latencies and formats along with baseline data streams, (3) collaboratively expanding EEW coverage along the U.S. West Coast on a regional network basis for Northern California, Southern California and Cascadia.",

            "abstract": "The principle goal of FogNet is to make measurements of monomethylmercury (MMHg), total mercury (HgT) and major ions in Pacific Coast marine fog water samples taken from eight land stations from Big Sur to Trinidad, California in order to calculate the flux of MMHg and HgT to the terrestrial ecosystem, and observe their spatial and temporal patterns and relationships to major ion concentrations in fog water. During the summers of 2014 and 2015, fog water samples were analyzed and mean concentrations and standard deviations were found (number of samples shown in parentheses): MMHg = 1.9 +/- 2.4 ng L-1 (119), HgT = 28.7 +/- 26.8 ng L-1 (86), NH4+ = 2.5 +/- 2.0 mg L-1 (49), Cl- = 7.1 +/- 13.7 mg L-1 (52), SO42- = 15.3 +/- 26.0 mg L-1 (52), NO3- = 5.9 +/- 7.7 mg L-1 (48), and pH = 5.4 +/- 0.8 (38). For comparison, MMHg in rain is ~0.1 ng L-1 from previous studies. A temporal pattern in MMHg concentrations in fog was observed with monthly means of all samples for June, July, August and September 2014 (in ng L-1) of 4.2, 2.4, 1.4, and 0.8, respectively (see figure). No such temporal pattern was observed for HgT concentrations. The coastal site at Humboldt State University Marine Labs had fog water samples with the highest concentrations of MMHg (4.0 +/-4.3), whereas the inland site of Pepperwood had the lowest mean concentration of 0.7 +/- 0.5 ng L-1 among all sites. The temporal and spatial patterns observed in MMHg concentrations in fog water are consistent with a marine source. By combining the measured concentrations of analytes in fog water with an estimate of deposition from collocated 1 m2 passive fog collectors, the fluxes of MMHg and HgT for the summer of 2014 were 0.003-0.14 and 0.04-0.55 mg m-2 y-1, respectively. For MMHg, the mean fog water flux is about 4 times larger than that calculated for rain, and for HgT, the mean fog water flux is about 10% that calculated for rain.",

            "abstract": "Glacial loading has been shown to modulate volcanic melt generation in subaerial systems, and recent studies suggest that eustatic sea level fluctuations induced by glacial cycles may influence mantle-melting regimes at mid-ocean ridges. Models predict temporal variation in crustal thickness, and seafloor topography, linked to sea level change. Recent studies of bathymetry as a proxy for crustal thickness show significant spectral energy at periodicities linked to Milankovitch cycles of 23, 41, and 100ka (Crowley et al., 2015; Tolstoy, M., 2015). In this study we investigate climate driven periodicity in mid-ocean ridge magma supply utilizing basement topography and crustal thickness data. We use multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) data from two prior studies of the flanks of the Juan de Fuca (JdF) ridge, and 3D MCS data from the Northern East Pacific Rise (EPR) 9°37-57’N. The JdF datasets extend to crustal ages up to 8.78 Ma, and EPR data to ~180 ka. By performing spectral analysis on these data along with dO18 climate records from Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) for the last 5.32ma and Zachos et al. (2001) for earlier times we investigate intervals of similar periodicities in order to identify potential links between climate and magma supply to mid-ocean ridges. Further analysis is undertaken to determine whether depth to basement and crustal thickness are correlated within and across datasets, and whether significant spectral peaks occur in basement and crustal thickness data outside of known climate cycles. Initial results show significant spectral energy in basement depth at the 100ky cycle in the 0-1Ma time series, when eccentricity is understood to have the most impact. Long-term temporal variability is apparent in JdF data, with low relief abyssal hills (~70m on average) present 1-3.2Ma and 6-8.78Ma, but higher relief bathymetry (~200m) from 3.2-6Ma. These subsets align well with previously identified climatic subgroups (Zachos et al., 2001), correlating both low relief time periods with cooling trends and the high relief era with warming climate. Basement and crustal thickness are well correlated at long wavelengths within JdF datasets, with basement leading crustal thickness in most cases and lags less than the expected half width of the crustal accretion zone.",

            "abstract": "The northern Colorado Front Range continues to face challenges related to air quality, specifically ozone, and has been classified as a marginal non-attainment area by the U.S EPA. The highly complex topography and meteorology in the Colorado Front Range provide flow patterns that are driven by mountain-valley circulation, resulting in formation of the Denver Cyclone, strongly influencing concentrations of ozone and aerosol particles. However, the impact of the Denver Cyclone on aerosol formation has not been previously explored.\nIn this study, airborne measurements were made during July 16 - August 18, 2014 aboard the NSF C-130 aircraft during the 2014 Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ) project. We carried out fast time resolved measurements of ambient aerosol chemical constituents (organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride) of non-refractory sub-micrometer particles using an Aerodyne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (mAMS).\nPronounced increased mass concentrations of organics, nitrate, and sulfate in two distinct regions in the Front Range were observed during the cyclone episodes, in contrast to the non-cyclonic days. Organics dominated the mass concentrations on all days evaluated. The average mass concentration of organics during a cyclone event was 5.79 ± 1.48 μg·m-3 and were lower during the two non-cyclonic measurement days, 3.09 ± 1.18 μg·m-3. Average sulfate mass concentrations were 1.25 ± 0.41 μg·m-3 vs. 0.58 ± 0.20 μg·m-3 followed by nitrate with an average of 1.66 ± 0.92 μg·m-3 vs. 0.32 ± 0.41 μg·m-3 on cyclone vs. non-cyclonic days, respectively. Correlations between trace gas markers (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, ammonia, and ethane), meteorological variables (relative humidity, temperature), and the extent of aerosol aging are evaluated and used to assess the Front Range aerosol formation and air quality impacts in the region during these events.",

The effect of dissolved ions on soil water freezing point depression is included by combining an expression for osmotic head with the Clapeyron equation and the van Genuchten soil water retention function. The coupled water flow and heat transport equations are solved using the Thomas algorithm and Picard iteration. Ice pressure is always assumed zero and frost heave is neglected. The new model is tested using data from a high-elevation rangeland soil that is subject to significant soil freezing and a mountainous forest soil that is snow-covered for about 8 months of the year. Soil hydraulic parameters are mostly based on measurements and only vegetation parameters are fine-tuned to match measured and calculated soil water content, soil & snow temperature, and snow height. Modeling statistics for both systems show good performance for temperature, intermediate performance for snow height, and relatively low performance for soil water content, in accordance with earlier results with an older version of the model.",

We measured these key processes with whole-stream reach methods and smaller-scale incubations in numerous locations within stream networks across two years as part of a project on scaling ecosystem rates. Measurements were repeated across 7 biomes (tropical forest, tropical savanna, temperate deciduous forest, temperate rain forest, tallgrass prairie, boreal forest, and tundra). We found strong effects of light on primary production within and among biomes as a function of variable canopy among reaches and biomes. Community respiration and ammonium uptake were decoupled from light relative to gross primary production. Ammonium uptake rarely exhibited saturation with elevated concentrations, regardless of background concentrations or biome. We hypothesize that even though biomes exhibit major differences in gross primary production, the overall variation in community respiration and ammonium uptake is similar across biomes because respiration and uptake depend on carbon irrespective if it is derived from allochthonous or autochthonous inputs. Respiration and uptake are expected to vary depending upon factors not as tightly connected to the biome a stream is embedded in.",

            "abstract": "Surface inundation extent and its predictability vary tremendously across the globe. This dynamic is being and has been captured by three general categories of satellite imagery: 1) low-spatial-resolution microwave sensors with global coverage and a long record of observations (e.g., SSM/I), 2) optical sensors with high spatial and temporal resolution and global coverage, but with cloud contamination (e.g. MODIS), and 3) in more ‘‘snapshot’’ form by high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. We explore the ability to bridge techniques that can exploit the higher spatial resolution of more recent data products back in time with the help of the temporal evolution of lower resolution products.\nWe present a study of long term (20+ year) inundation patterns in the Mekong River Delta using baseline observations from the Surface Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), an inundation area fraction product derived at 25km scale from active and passive microwave instruments (ERS, QuikSCAT, ASCAT, and SSM/I) that spans from Jan. 1992 to Jun. 2015. Every hydrological basin has unique characteristics – such as its topography, land cover / land use, and space-time variability – thus, a downscaling algorithm needs to take into account these idiosyncrasies. We merge SWAMPS with topographical information derived from 30m SRTM DEM, river networks from USGS HydroSHEDS, and assess the best statistical procedure to “learn” from two sets of classified SAR data: (1) L-band imaging radar from ALOS PALSAR, 2007-2010, and (2) C-band imagery from the Sentinel-1 mission (2014 to present). We present a comparison of retrospective downscaled flood extent with Landsat imagery and recent observations from SMAP.\nWith a higher spatial resolution of past flooding extent, we can improve our understanding of how delta surface hydrology responds to local and regional events. This is important both in the short-term for accurate flood prediction, as well as on longer-term planning horizons.",

These cycles are influenced by the composition of the substrate, availability of nitrogen, the population of microorganisms, and by environmental factors. Therefore, land management and use, climate change, and nitrogen deposition patterns influence the dynamics of these macronutrients at the landscape scale.\nIn this work a physically based distributed hydrological model, the tRIBS model, is coupled with a process-based multi-compartment model of the biogeochemical cycle to simulate the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen (CN) in the Mameyes River basin, Puerto Rico. The model includes a wide range of processes that influence the movement, production, alteration of nutrients in the landscape and factors that affect the CN cycling. The tRIBS integrates geomorphological and climatic factors that influence the cycling of CN in soil. Implementing the decomposition module into tRIBS makes the model a powerful complement to a biogeochemical observation system and a forecast tool able to analyze the influences of future changes on ecosystem services.\nThe soil hydrologic parameters of the model were obtained using ranges of published parameters and observed streamflow data at the outlet. The parameters of the decomposition module are based on previously published data from studies conducted in the Luquillio CZO (budgets of soil organic matter and CN ratio for each of the dominant vegetation types across the landscape). Hydrological fluxes, wet depositon of nitrogen, litter fall and its corresponding CN ratio drive the decomposition model. The simulation results demonstrate a strong influence of soil moisture dynamics on the spatiotemporal distribution of nutrients at the landscape level. The carbon in the litter pool and the nitrate and ammonia pool respond quickly to soil moisture content. Moreover, the CN ratios of the plant litter have significant influence in the dynamics of CN cycling.",

However, groundwater dynamics can be highly variable in space and time, especially in steep headwater catchments. Prediction of groundwater response patterns at non-monitored sites requires transferring point scale information to the catchment scale through analysis of continuous groundwater level time series and their relationships to covariates such as topographic indices or landscape position. We applied time series analysis to a 4 year dataset of continuous groundwater level data for 51 wells distributed across a 20 ha pre-alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland to address the following questions: 1) Is the similarity or difference between the groundwater time series related to landscape position? 2) How does the relationship between groundwater dynamics and landscape position change across long (seasonal) and shorter (event) time scales and varying antecedent wetness conditions? 3) How can time series modeling be used to predict groundwater responses at non-monitored sites? We employed hierarchical clustering of the observed groundwater time series using both dynamic time warping and correlation based distance matrices. Based on the common site characteristics of the members of each cluster, the time series models were transferred to all non-monitored sites. This categorical approach provided maps of spatio-temporal groundwater dynamics across the entire catchment. We further developed a continuous approach based on process-based hydrological modeling and water table dynamic similarity. We suggest that continuous measurements at representative points and subsequent time series analysis can shed light into groundwater dynamics at the landscape scale and provide new insights into space-time patterns of hydrologic connectivity and streamflow generation.",

            "abstract": "The selection of landing and exploration sites for interplanetary robotic or human missions is a complex task. Historically it has been labor-intensive, with large groups of scientists manually interpreting a planetary surface across a variety of datasets to identify potential sites based on science and engineering constraints. This search process can be lengthy, and excellent sites may get overlooked when the aggregate value of site selection criteria is non-obvious or non-intuitive. As planetary data collection leads to Big Data repositories and a growing set of selection criteria, scientists will face a combinatorial search space explosion that requires scalable, automated assistance.\nWe are currently exploring more general computer-aided discovery techniques in the context of planetary surface deformation phenomena that can lend themselves to application in the landing site search problem. In particular, we are developing a general software framework that addresses key difficulties: characterizing a given phenomenon or site based on data gathered from multiple instruments (e.g. radar interferometry, gravity, thermal maps, or GPS time series), and examining a variety of possible workflows whose individual configurations are optimized to isolate different features. The framework allows algorithmic pipelines and hypothesized models to be perturbed or permuted automatically within well-defined bounds established by the scientist. For example, even simple choices for outlier and noise handling or data interpolation can drastically affect the detectability of certain features. These techniques aim to automate repetitive tasks that scientists routinely perform in exploratory analysis, and make them more efficient and scalable by executing them in parallel in the cloud. We also explore ways in which machine learning can be combined with human feedback to prune the search space and converge to desirable results.\nAcknowledgements: We acknowledge support from NASA AIST NNX15AG84G (PI V.

            "abstract": "An accurate representation of African aerosols in climate models is needed to understand the regional and global radiative forcing and climate impacts of aerosols, at present and under future climate change. However, aerosol simulations in regional climate models for Africa have not been well-tested. Africa contains the largest single source of biomass-burning smoke aerosols and dust globally. Although aerosols are short-lived relative to greenhouse gases, black carbon in particular is estimated to be second only to carbon dioxide in contributing to warming on a global scale. Moreover, Saharan dust is exported great distances over the Atlantic Ocean, affecting nutrient transport to regions like the Amazon rainforest, which can further impact climate. Biomass burning aerosols are also exported from Africa, westward from Angola over the Atlantic Ocean and off the southeastern coast of South Africa to the Indian Ocean.\nHere, we perform the first extensive quantitative evaluation of the Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) aerosol simulation against monitored data, focusing on aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations over Africa. We analyze historical regional simulations for 1999 – 2012 from CCAM consistent with the experimental design of CORDEX at 50 km global horizontal resolution, through the dynamical downscaling of ERA-Interim data reanalysis data, with the CMIP5 emissions inventory (RCP8.5 scenario). CCAM has a prognostic aerosol scheme for organic carbon, black carbon, sulfate, and dust, and non-prognostic sea salt. The CCAM AOD at 550nm was compared to AOD (observed at 440nm, adjusted to 550nm with the Ångström exponent) from long-term AERONET stations across Africa. Sites strongly impacted by dust and biomass burning and with long continuous records were prioritized. In general, the model captures the monthly trends of the AERONET data. This presentation provides a basis for understanding how well aerosol particles are represented over Africa in regional climate modeling and the potential impact on climate predictions, and is the first large scale climate model-measurement verification of aerosols over Africa that we are aware of. CCAM is widely used for regional climate modeling applications, and we also discuss further improvements to the aerosol parameterizations based on our results.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of the dynamic nature of the earthquake rupture process or natural earthquakes is still limited. On one side, seismologist try to estimate source parameters using simple point-source models to obtain source dimensions, average slip, stress drop, and seismic efficiencies, and in some cases rupture velocities as well. On the other side, kinematic source inversions are routinely performed on large earthquakes, and from the results estimates of these source parameters can also be obtained, in addition of fault geometry and slip distribution. More recently, dynamic source inversions are also performed, which results in a more physics-based inversion of the dynamic processes that act on the fault surfaces, including stress and friction parameters. All these methods have advantages and limitations. In particular, even though the physics-based dynamic source inversions are probably the more appropriate approach, the large number of parameters that need to be inverted for and the significant trade-offs between these parameters result in a infinite number of solutions that need to be explored using Monte Carlo methods. A particular approach has been put forward in the last 10 years to perform these kinematic and dynamic source inversions using elliptical patches, which significantly reduces the number of parameters to invert for, while still fitting the data. We have found that even in these cases, dynamic source inversions show significant trade-offs between the dynamic source parameters. We combine these three approaches to try an better constrain the dynamic rupture processes of moderate-to-large intermediate-depth earthquakes (M~6.0) using one and at most two elliptical patches. The teleseismic point-source estimates of stress drop, seismic efficiency and more importantly rupture velocity provide key parameters that can help ous constrain both kinematic and dynamic source inversions. We believe this may be a step towards improving our understanding of the earthquake’s energy budgets using a combination of source inversions and source parameter estimates.",

The ~50 km long ridge segment is the first completely mapped at such high-resolution. Using the AUV base maps, targeted sampling during 15 ROV dives and 29 wax-tip cores in 2012 and 2015 recovered 322 precisely located glassy lavas.\nMelts are most primitive (MgO>8.5%) near the shallowest part of the segment where a chemically heterogeneous (7.96-8.73% MgO) sheet flow erupted from a 9 km-long fissure, ~1/3 from the southwest end. Four active black-smoker hydrothermal fields were discovered here using the maps. Inactive fields occur to the north. Lavas are N- to T-MORB with an off-axis E-MORB near mid-segment. A cross-axis transect to the northwest shows similar lava chemistry to 3.4 km off-axis.\nExtensive flows with glass MgO of 5.3-7.3% and 6.7-7.5% occur on the Tamayo and Pescadero Transforms, respectively. The flows have variable sediment cover indicating a wide age range. The transforms have sediment domes likely uplifted and deformed by sills. Most domes are surrounded by younger lava flows. Magmatic activity on the transforms indicates they are transtensional.\nAn unusually rough faulted terrain on the northeastern end of the segment occurs near the northwestern edge of the neovolcanic zone. Sampling during 5 ROV dives recovered 110 glassy samples of rhyolite, dacite, andesite, and basaltic andesite from the 8 km-long fault-bounded region with basalt recovered along the southeastern part of the zone. The samples form an almost continuous sequence with glass compositions from 50-77% SiO2 and 8-0.05% MgO and include the first rhyolitic lavas from the global submarine ridge system. Isotopic data preclude significant continental crustal contamination, indicating the evolved rocks formed by fractional crystallization and magma mixing of mantle derived melts.",

The spectral-infinite-element method combines the spectral-element method with the infinite-element\nmethod. Spectral elements are used to capture the internal field, and infinite elements are used to represent the\nexternal field. To solve the weak form of the Poisson/Laplace equation, we employ Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto\nquadrature in spectral elements. In infinite elements, Gauss-Radau quadrature is used in the radial direction\nwhereas Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature is used in the lateral directions. Infinite elements naturally integrate\nwith spectral elements, thereby avoiding an iterative implementation.

            "abstract": "Rotational deformation (also called the pole tide) is the response of the solid earth and ocean to the Earth’s wobble, which includes gravitational and surface displacement components. An important part of the model is the Conventional Mean Pole, which is required to remove the slow variation in the polar motion. This ensures that the rotational deformation model removes only the principal periodic motions (annual, Chandler and any other high frequency variations). Previously, no dependable mean pole product had been available. Consequently, for the 2010 Conventions, a cubic was fit to a filtered time series of polar motion and this model was adopted, along with a simple linear extrapolation into the future that was expected to be adequate until the next Conventions update. In light of the large changes in the mean pole due to recent ice mass losses, such extrapolations may not be reliable. To avoid this, the next Conventions update will include the use of a regularly updated mean pole table. Some subtleties in that choice will be noted.\nHowever, the original pole tide model was conceived when the mean pole was moving (more or less) linearly, largely in response to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). With the recent ice mass losses, particularly in Greenland, this motion is decidedly non-linear, and it is unclear whether the pole tide model correctly reflects this new reality. There are questions as to whether the mean pole should be the slow variation as conceived currently or should it reflect only the long-term linear motion (either based on a GIA model or a linear fit over an appropriate time span).",

In this study, the ring current distribution is estimated with the Ring Current-Atmosphere Interactions Model with Self-Consistent Magnetic field (RAM-SCB) using, for the first time, data assimilation techniques and particle flux data from the Van Allen Probes. The state of the ring current within the RAM-SCB is corrected via an ensemble based data assimilation technique by using proton flux from one of the Van Allen Probes, to capture the enhancement of ring current following an isolated substorm event on July 18 2013. The results show significant improvement in the estimation of the ring current particle distributions in the RAM-SCB model, leading to better agreement with observations. This newly implemented data assimilation technique in the global modeling of the ring current thus provides a promising tool to better characterize the effect of substorm injections in the near-Earth regions.\nThe work is part of the Space Hazards Induced near Earth by Large, Dynamic Storms (SHIELDS) project in Los Alamos National Laboratory.",

This is a result of the coupling between the Troposphere and Stratosphere which can be observed as early as 60 days prior to the onset of an event. Impacts from the disturbed atmospheric circulation can alter storm tracks and cold temperature anomalies can be observed further south following the onset of an event. As a result of a warming atmosphere, rapidly decreasing arctic sea-ice is introducing changes to air-sea interactions. These changes are expected to increase the frequency of such events over the northern pole, leading to greater surface weather impacts. Previous research suggested a relationship between arctic sea-ice and the frequency of sudden stratospheric warming events, although details of this relationship are not yet well described. Using forced and unforced climate model data arctic sea-ice and sudden stratospheric warming events are analyzed to investigate how variations in the stratosphere and sea-ice are related.",

Starting in 2008, active restoration (log structures with dug pools, woody vegetation planting, and modifications to increase channel-floodplain hydrologic connectivity) was implemented on nearly 6 km within the cattle exclosure length. Implementation of active and passive restoration strategies in the same and adjacent reaches allows comparison of these two approaches. We have been monitoring these reaches since 2008.\nUnexpectedly in response to grazing exclosure, a native sedge, Carex nudata (torrent sedge), has exploded in population. C. nudata grows in the active channel, anchoring itself tightly to the gravel-cobble river bed with a dense root network. As a result, C. nudata has changed erosion and sedimentation patterns including bank erosion, channel bed scour, and island formation. We present data on fish cover increases due to C. nudata and log structures, and on channel complexity before and after restoration. Both active and passive restorations are increasing channel complexity and juvenile fish cover, although in different ways. Fish cover provided by active and passive restoration are similar in area but different in depth and position, with C. nudata fish cover generally shallower and partly mid-channel. Residual pool depth is larger in log structure pools than in C. nudata scour pools, but C. nudata pools are more numerous in some reaches. By producing frequent, small scour features and small islands, it can be argued that C. nudata is increasing hydraulic complexity more than the large, meander-bend pools at log structures, but this is hard to quantify. C. nudata has also stabilized active bars, perhaps changing the bedload sediment budget. Positive habitat benefits of active restoration appear to be greater in the short term, but over the long term (20 years or more) effects of C. nudata may be comparable or greater.",

Our results imply that pore fluids represent the dominant supply term for Nd to seawater. Based on a suite of analysis including rare earth element concentrations and εNd, we predict that the difference in grain size between the bulk sediment (pre leach) and the refractory particulates (post leach) is a key variable in determining the magnitude of the source of Nd to seawater, and that both the refractory phase (~20%) and labile phase (~80%) contribute to the pore fluid Nd concentrations during diagenesis. Our results suggest that pore fluid εNd ultimately determines the εNd of the labile phase because the labile phase appears to be formed during early diagenesis. The implication of our work is that the εNd recorded in the labile coatings, which is often utilized as a proxy for past seawater εNd, is not a bottom water signature. Instead, similarities between labile εNd and bottom water εNd occur where the pore fluid εNd controls both the bottom water εNd as well as the labile εNd, thus producing the apparent utility of the coatings as a seawater archive. Therefore, the labile εNd and bottom water εNd will be similar in regions with a large benthic flux. We suggest that this improved understanding of the factors influencing εNd as a tracer will make reconstructions more precise.",

Data acquisition involved 2-D and 3-D protocols, including several pairs of injection electrodes located on opposite sides of the volcano. For the mise-a-la-masse measurements, the contact with a conductive mass was achieved by immersing one of the current electrodes in the Tarissan acid pond (~25 Siemens/m) located in the volcano's summit. The 3-D inversion was performed using a deterministic smoothness-constrained least-squares algorithm with unstructured grid modeling to accurately account for topography. Resistivity contrasts of more than 4 orders of magnitude are observed. A thick and high-angle conductive structure is located in the volcano's southern flank. It extends from the Tarissan Crater's acid pond on the summit to a hot spring region located close to the dome’s southern base. This suggests that a large hydrothermal reservoir is located below the southern base of the dome, and connected to the acid pond of the summit's main crater. Therefore, the steep southern flanks of the volcano could be resting on a low-strength, high-angle discontinuity saturated with circulating and possibly pressurized hydrothermal fluids. This could favor partial edifice collapse and lateral directed explosions as shown recurrently in the volcano's history. The resistivity model also reveals smaller hydrothermal reservoirs in the south-east and northern flanks that are linked to the main historical eruptive fractures and to ancient collapse structures such as the Cratère Amic structure. We discuss the main resistivity structures in relation with the geometry of observed faults, historical eruptive fractures, the dynamics of the near surface hydrothermal system manifestations on the dome and the potential implications for future hazards scenarios .",

Although various chronological methods for in situ geochronology have been proposed (e.g. Rb-Sr, K-Ar), and even applied (K-Ar, Farley et al., 2014), the reliability, accuracy, and applicability of the 40Ar/39Ar method makes it by far the most desirable chronometer for dating extraterrestrial bodies. The method however relies on the neutron irradiation of samples, and thus a neutron source. We will discuss the challenges and feasibility of deploying a passive neutron source to planetary surfaces for the in situ application of the 40Ar/39Ar chronometer. Requirements in generating and shielding neutrons, as well as analyzing samples are discussed, along with an exploration of limitations such as mass, power, and cost. Two potential solutions for the in situ extraterrestrial deployment of the 40Ar/39Ar method will be presented. Although this represents a challenging task, developing the technology to apply the 40Ar/39Ar method on planetary surfaces would represent a major advance towards constraining the timescale of solar system formation and evolution.",

This need makes Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) one of the most active topics in seismic exploration research and there are a limited number of FWI algorithms that undertake the elastic approach required to model these multicomponent data. We developed an iterative Gauss-Newton 2D time-domain elastic FWI scheme that reproduces the vertical and horizontal particle velocity as measured by common seismic surveys and obtains simultaneously the distribution of three elastic parameters of our subsurface model (density ρ and the Lame parameters λ and μ). The elastic wave is propagated in a heterogeneous elastic media using a time domain 2D velocity-stress staggered grid finite difference method. Our code observes the necessary stability conditions and includes absorbing boundary conditions and basic multi-thread parallelization. The same forward modeling code is also used to calculate the Frechet's derivatives with respect to the three parameters of our model following the sensitivity equation approach and perturbation theory. We regularized our FWI algorithm applying two different criteria: (1) First order Tikhonov regularization (maximum smoothness) and (2) Minimum Gradient Support (MGS) that adopts an approximate zero-norm of the several property gradients. We applied our algorithm to various test models and demonstrated that their structural information resemble closely those of the original three synthetic model parameters (λ, µ and ρ). Finally, we compared the role of both regularization criteria in terms of data fit, model stability and structural resemblance.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian erosion of dry, flat, semi-arid landscapes is induced (and sustained) by kinetic energy fluxes in the aloft atmospheric surface layer. During saltation -- the mechanism responsible for surface fluxes of dust and sediment -- briefly suspended sediment grains undergo a ballistic trajectory before impacting and `splashing’ smaller-diameter (dust) particles vertically. Conceptual models typically indicate that sediment flux, q (via saltation or drift), scales with imposed aerodynamic (basal) stress raised to some exponent, n, where n > 1. Since basal stress (in fully rough, inertia-dominated flows) scales with the incoming velocity squared, u^2, it follows that q ~ u^2n (where u is some relevant component of the above flow field, u(x,t)). Thus, even small (turbulent) deviations of u from its time-averaged value may play an enormously important role in aeolian activity on flat, dry landscapes. The importance of this argument is further augmented given that turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer exhibits maximum Reynolds stresses in the fluid immediately above the landscape. In order to illustrate the importance of surface stress intermittency, we have used conditional averaging predicated on aerodynamic surface stress during large-eddy simulation of atmospheric boundary layer flow over a flat landscape with momentum roughness length appropriate for the Llano Estacado in west Texas (a flat agricultural region that is notorious for dust transport). By using data from a field campaign to measure diurnal variability of aeolian activity and prevailing winds on the Llano Estacado, we have retrieved the threshold friction velocity (which can be used to compute threshold surface stress under the geostrophic balance with the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory). This averaging procedure provides an ensemble-mean visualization of flow structures responsible for erosion `events’. Preliminary evidence indicates that surface stress peaks are associated with the passage of inclined, high-momentum regions flanked by adjacent low-momentum regions. We will characterize geometric attributes of such structures and explore streamwise and vertical vorticity distribution within the conditionally averaged flow field.",

            "abstract": "Salt domes occur throughout the Gulf Coast Region USA and are often associated with trapped hydrocarbons. These salt domes can be capped by sulfate and carbonate minerals that result from complex digenetic interactions in the subsurface. The specific natures of these interactions are poorly understood, in particular the role of microbes in facilitating mineralization and element cycling. Carbon isotope compositions of cap rock calcites (δ13Ccarb) are highly variable and range from near neutral to less than –40‰ (VPDB) indicative of methane-sourced carbon. These low values and the common coexistence of elemental sulfur and metal sulfides have spurred hypotheses invoking microbial sulfate reduction as driving carbonate mineral authigenesis. Here, we present new organic carbon isotope (δ13Corg) data that, similar to δ13Ccarb, exhibit depletions below –30 to –25‰. These δ13Corg values are lower than local liquid hydrocarbons and “normal” marine organic matter reflecting either microbial fixation of methane-sourced carbon or microbial fractionation from liquid hydrocarbon sources. The combined carbon isotope data (δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) indicate that methane likely plays an important role in microbial cycling in salt domes. The δ13Corg values are similar to those of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) related communities from methane-sulfate controlled marine sediments. Ultimately, salt dome environments may share some important characteristics with AOM systems.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that even a limited nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan would lead to a significant loss of life---on the order of a billion people. This claim is based upon the belief that a large amount of aerosol or soot from burning fires would be injected into the stratosphere eventually leading to significant cooling of the troposphere via nuclear winter. While a large amount of soot will be injected into the atmosphere, the fraction of soot getting into the stratosphere plays a primary role in subsequent climatological impacts and is the basis for this preliminary study. To examine soot transport from an urban firestorm, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code in conjunction with a simplified combustion model was utilized in the current study. Note, while simplified, the combustion model is based upon extensive simulations using a more refined, but expensive, combustion model that can simulate the propagation of a fire front through an array of buildings and vegation. The simulations conducted using the CFD model described in the next sections are designed to represent the worst case scenario for an urban firestorm: sufficient winds to propagate the fire but not prevent vertical plume rise; no impact of atmospheric water vapor or moisture within the fuel on damping the fire; buildings are wood and completely burn; soot particles do not have a settling velocity; and a grid resolution that maximizes plume rise at the expense of entrainment (no turbulence model active). Given these assumptions and preliminary analysis of several simulations, the following are a few tentative but important findings: 1) worst-case scenario leads to an over-shooting plume into the lower stratosphere; 2) this over-shoot transports a small portion of the total soot content produced by the urban firestorm into the stratosphere; and 3) departures from this worst-case scenario will lead, in some cases, to a significant reduction in the amount of soot that can be injected into the lower stratosphere. Hence, our preliminary findings suggest that estimates regarding the amount of soot displaced into the lower stratosphere are overstated.",

Quantifying environmental controls on the isotopic and chemical evolution of karst groundwater would improve the accuracy of speleothem-based paleoclimate reconstructions. In this study, drip water chemical evolution along flow paths was sampled monthly at two locations in Inner Space Cavern, Texas, over a period of 8 months. In each of the two locations, cave water drips off a stalactite, flows along a flowstone and subsequently drips off a lower stalactite, allowing cave water to be sampled at two points, 1-2 meters apart, along each flow path. The chemical and isotopic evolution of drip water along its flow path shows seasonality, where 1) summer months (high cave-air pCO2) have small variations in δ13C values along the flow paths, high and relatively invariant DIC and Ca values,; and 2) winter months (low cave-air pCO2) generally have large increases in DIC δ13C values along the flow paths, lower DIC and Ca values.\nThe magnitude of the increase in DIC δ13C values along the flow paths, <~1‰ to ~4‰, is controlled by the extent of DIC loss to CO2 degassing and calcite precipitation which is controlled by the pCO2 gradient between drip water and cave air. If the DIC loss is less than 15%, then the evolution of the δ13C value of the DIC reservoir can be modelled using a Rayleigh distillation model and equilibrium fractionation factors between (CO2(g)-HCO3-(aq)) and (CaCO3-HCO3-(aq)). As the loss of the DIC reservoir increases above 15% the DIC δ13C values become progressively higher such that the ε (CO2(g)-HCO3-(aq)) values needed to model the observed results change from equilibrium values of ~8‰ to non-equilibrium values up to ~25‰. The variance in magnitude of carbon isotope fractionation during CO2 degassing cannot be attributed to changes in temperature, and thus we infer significant kinetic isotope effects at higher rates of DIC loss.",

Advances in the distribution of real-time data are leading many new transient phenomena in space-time to be observed, however, real-time decision-making is infeasible in many cases as these streaming data are either completely inaccessible or only available to proprietary in-house tools or displays. This lack of accessibility prohibits advanced algorithm and workflow development that could be initiated or enhanced by these data streams. Small research teams do not have resources to develop tools for the broad dissemination of their valuable real-time data and could benefit from an easy to use, scalable, cloud-based solution to facilitate access. CHORDS proposes to make a very diverse suite of real-time data available to the broader geosciences community in order to allow innovative new science in these areas to thrive.\nThis presentation will highlight recently developed CHORDS portal tools and processing systems aimed at addressing some of the gaps in handling real-time data, particularly in the provisioning of data from the “long-tail” scientific community through a simple interface deployed in the cloud. The CHORDS system will connect these real-time streams via standard services from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and does so in a way that is simple and transparent to the data provider. Broad use of the CHORDS framework will expand the role of real-time data within the geosciences, and enhance the potential of streaming data sources to enable adaptive experimentation and real-time hypothesis testing. Adherence to community data and metadata standards will promote the integration of CHORDS real-time data with existing standards-compliant analysis, visualization and modeling tools.",

Graduate students surveyed (93.3%) agreed that natural history was relevant to science, approximately 70% believed it “essential” for conducting field-based research; however, 54.2% felt inadequately trained to teach a natural history course and would benefit from additional training in natural history (> 80%). Of the 185 professionals surveyed, all felt that natural history was relevant to science and “essential” or “desirable” in their vocation (93%).

            "abstract": "This study uses the droughts of 2011 in Texas and 2012 over the central Great Plains as case studies to explore the potential of satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) for monitoring drought dynamics. We find that the spatial patterns of negative SIF anomalies from the Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2) closely resembled drought intensity maps from the US Drought Monitor for both events. The drought-induced suppression of SIF occurred throughout 2011 but was exacerbated in summer in the Texas drought. This event was characterized by a persistent depletion of root-zone soil moisture caused by year-long below-normal precipitation. In contrast, for the central Great Plains drought, warmer temperatures and ample precipitation boosted SIF in the spring of 2012; however, a sudden drop in precipitation coupled with unusually high temperatures rapidly depleted soil moisture through evapotranspiration, leading to a rapid onset of drought in early summer. Accordingly, SIF reversed from above to below normal. For both regions, the GOME-2 SIF anomalies were significantly correlated with those of root-zone soil moisture, indicating that the former can potentially be used as proxy of the latter for monitoring agricultural droughts with different onset mechanisms. Further analyses indicate that the contrasting dynamics of SIF during these two extreme events were caused by changes in both fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and fluorescence yield, suggesting that satellite SIF is sensitive to both structural and physiological/biochemical variations of vegetation. We conclude that the emerging satellite SIF has excellent potential for dynamic drought monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Isolating the drivers and variations in column-averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) is essential for mining information from space-based remote-sensing observations, such as those available from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). Contrary to the large number of studies analyzing the variability of surface CO2 concentrations, studies analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of XCO2 are relatively limited. More importantly, these results are either based on a sparse network of ground-based total column observations (i.e., from the Total Column Carbon Observing Network - TCCON) or derived from low-resolution model simulations. In this study, using the high-resolution (~7 km) GEOS-5 model simulated fields and the high-density observations from OCO-2, we investigate how variability in surface fluxes and/or meteorological drivers impact the observed XCO2 variability across a range of scales. The study focuses on ~13:30 LT and is designed to highlight the significant contributors to local and regional scale XCO2 variability from daily to seasonal timescales. In collaboration with the OCO-2 Validation team, the variability information is also being used to identify small geographical areas (<1° or ~100km) where the XCO2 is expected to be relatively constant. These small areas then serve as target regions for examining the potential of external variables (for e.g., surface reflectance, aerosol) to generate biases (variability) in the XCO2 retrievals in those regions. We will also show comparison results of the model-based variability analyses with the variability statistics derived from actual OCO-2 retrievals. This comparison serves as an important consistency check for the simulated fields from the GEOS-5 model. Finally, we will review these results in terms of assessing and quantifying representation errors as well as developing and implementing data thinning/‘superobbing’ algorithms for OCO-2 retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan has served for several decades as a test-bed for study of the response of topography to tectonic and climatic forcing, allowing us to examine the important question of variability in erosion rates over space and time and their relationship to tectonic or climatic parameters. The extensive study of the region has provided a data base of thermochronometric ages and detrital cosmogenic isotope concentrations, both of which provide proxy measures of erosion rate, albeit over very different timescales. Is this study, we compare detrital zircon fission track (ZFT) ages and detrital cosmogenic radioactive nuclide (CRN) concentrations to each other and to topographic and climatic parameters, focusing on the eastern Central Range where catchments are dominantly orogen perpendicular. Detrital ZFT ages are dominantly unimodal and indicate erosion rates of 1 to 5 mm/yr. Inferred erosion rates correlate well with average steepness of the catchment rivers and the mean cross-orogen elevation, both of which vary systematically from south to north. This correlation indicates that the topography is consistent with erosion rates averaged over 1 to 2 Ma. There is only a weak correlation with mean annual precipitation (MAP) rate, but MAP does not show large variations across the studied catchments. Erosion rates averaged over a thousand year timescale are also available from CRN (10Be) concentrations in modern river sand from published and new data reported here. CRN-based erosion rates mostly overlap with ZFT-based erosion rates, indicating that erosion rates are stationary over these very different timescales. An exception is in southern Taiwan, which was affected by super- typhoon Morakot in 2009. Here we have obtained river sand samples that pre-date and post-date the 2009 event. We find that post-Morakot erosion rates are 2 to 5 times higher than pre-Morakot. This suggests significant dilution of 10Be in the sediment, presumably by sediment supplied by deep landslides. Taken together, these data suggest that erosion rates will stabilize to average tectonic and climatic conditions averaged over thousand year timescales, but will be affected over shorter timescales by extreme events.",

We will focus on ground based planetary radio observations (thus mainly Jupiter radio emissions), trying for instance to enhance the temporal coverage of jovian decametric emission. The data service we will be using is EPN-TAP, a planetary science data access protocol developed by Europlanet-VESPA (Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access). This protocol is derived from IVOA (International Virtual Observatory Alliance) standards. The Jupiter Routine Observations from the Nancay Decameter Array are already shared on the planetary science VO using this protocol, as well as data from the Iitate Low Frquency Radio Antenna, in Japan. Amateur radio data from the RadioJOVE project is also available. The attached figure shows data from those three providers. We will first introduce the VO tools and concepts of interest for the planetary radioastronomy community. We will then present the various data formats now used for such data services, as well as their associated metadata. We will finally show various prototypical tools that make use of this shared datasets.",

The key products include: 1) a new understanding of the limitations of methods used to quantify impacts of climate change on water resources; 2) development and evaluation of national-domain climate downscaling and hydrologic simulation capabilities to provide information from climate model output relevant to the multiple scales of water resources decision-making with a spatially consistent assessment of the impacts of climate change on hydrologic conditions; and 3) development and evaluation of advanced streamflow forecasting methods. This will support USACE Districts and their stakeholders and partners with new data, new and newly evaluated model output, and specific tools in a framework to help with routine applications for managing water resources throughout the U.S., and to enhance considerations of climate preparedness and resilience in that work.\nThis presentation will summarize the collaborative development of some of those products; describe current and planned future USACE capabilities for incorporating advanced climate information at multiple scales of analysis and decision; discuss uses of climate information in water-resources planning and management; and outline key unanswered science questions being addressed to increase utility and use of information in short- and longer-term planning. Specifically, we will describe the current suite and planned trajectory of new products, moving from capability development through to testing in limited pilot domains, on to product applications throughout the U.S., and, ultimately, into actual implementation at the level of USACE Districts to address climate change issues. Two key foci of this talk will be: 1) where climatological and hydrologic science is currently inadequate to meet user needs – or is perhaps misapplied or wrongly scaled – and 2) where investments in science and its translation are necessary to create the information and products needed in water resources planning and management to ensure that USACE can continue to meet the challenges of managing water resources for the nation.",

In the 1920s, a large cooperative experiment was promoted in the U.S. by Scientific American magazine. They collected over 2000 reports of AM broadcast stations from throughout the U.S. Unfortunately, many of the submissions were unusable because they lacked critical information such as date, time or location.\nWe propose to use the 2017 solar eclipse over the continental U.S. to conduct the first wide-area LF propagation study. To perform this study, we plan to crowdsource the collection of the data by engaging student groups, citizens, and the scientific community. The tools for the different collection stations will consist of a simple homemade antenna, a simple receiver to convert the radio frequency (RF) signals to audio frequencies and a smart phone app. By using the time, date and location features of the smart phone, the problems experienced in the Scientific American experiment will be minimized. By crowdsourcing the observation sites, a number of different short, medium and long-paths studies can be obtained as the total eclipse crosses the continental U.S. The transmitter for this experiment will be WWVB located near Fort Collins, Colorado on 60.000 kHz. This is a U.S. frequency standard that is operated by NIST and transmits time codes. A second frequency, 55.500 kHz transmitted by a LF station in Dixon, CA is also being considered for this experiment.\nWe will present an overall strategy for recruiting participants/crowdsourcing the RF collections during the 2017 total solar eclipse. Preliminary coverage calculations will be presented for WWVB and Dixon, as well as path loss calculations that can be expected during the solar eclipse condition. We will also present the 2016 plan to pilot/refine the design of the RF collection system (e.g., antenna, app) with multiple teams to help ensure project success during the eclipse. Also, we wish to solicit input from AGU attendees on how to increase participation and improve the experiment. Lastly, we will announce social media, website, and standards-based curriculum resources.",

            "abstract": "Most of our understanding of hydrothermal systems and the nature of their heat sources comes from models and observations at fast and intermediate spreading ridges. In these settings, hydrothermal systems are mainly located within the axial zone of a spreading segment, hosted in basaltic rock, and primarily driven by heat extracted from crystallization of crustal melt sills. In contrast, hydrothermal systems at slow-spreading ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) show a great variety of venting styles and host-rock lithology, and are located in diverse tectonic settings like axial volcanic ridges, non-transform discontinuities (NTDs), the foot of ridge valley walls, and off-axis inside corner highs. Among MAR systems, the Rainbow hydrothermal field (RHF) stands out as an end-member of this diversity: an ultramafic-hosted system emitting H2 and CH4-rich fluids at high temperatures and high flow rates, which suggests a magmatic heat source despite the lack of evidence for recent volcanism and its location within an NTD with presumably low magma budget.\nWe present 2D multichannel seismic reflection images across the Rainbow massif from the NSF-funded MARINER multidisciplinary geophysical study that reveal, for the first time, the magmatic system driving hydrothermal circulation in an ultramafic setting. Data were acquired in 2013 onboard the RV M. Langseth with an 8-km-long hydrophone streamer. The images have been obtained from pre-stack depth migrations using a regional 3D P-wave velocity model from a coincident controlled-source seismic tomography experiment using ocean bottom seismometers. Our images show a complex magmatic system centered beneath the RHF occupying an areal extent of ~3.7x6 km2, with partially molten sills ranging in depth between ~3.4 km and ~6.9 km below the seafloor. Our data also image high-amplitude dipping reflections within the massif coincident with strong lateral velocity gradients that may arise from detachment fault planes, lithological contacts, and/or alteration boundaries. Our results are an important step towards understanding the interactions of detachment faulting, magmatic intrusion, and hydrothermal circulation.",

It has also been argued on the basis of field measurements that ice nucleation under mixed-phase conditions appears to occur predominantly via a liquid-phase mechanism, requiring the presence of liquid droplets prior to substantial ice nucleation. Here we analyze the response of quasi-Lagrangian large-eddy simulations of mixed-phase cloud layers to IFN operating via a liquid-phase mode using assumptions that result in either slow or rapid depletion of IFN from the cloudy boundary layer. Using several generalized case studies that do not exhibit riming or drizzle, based loosely on field campaign data, we vary environmental conditions such that the cloud-top temperature trend varies. One objective of this work is to identify differing patterns in ice formation intensity that may be distinguishable from ground-based or satellite platforms.",

            "abstract": "Kinetic penetrators have the potential to enable low cost in situ measurements of the ice shells of astrobiologically exciting worlds including Europa and Enceladus [1]. Their small size and mass, critical to limiting their kinetic energy to an acceptable range, makes them ideal small landers riding on primarily orbiter missions, while still enabling sampling at several m depth due simply to burial and excavation. In situ microfluidic-based organic analysis systems are a powerful, miniaturized approach for detecting markers of habitability and recent biological activity.\nFurther development of microfluidic technology, like that of the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA) [2,3] and Enceladus Organic Analyzer (EOA), will lead to an instrument capable of in situ biomarker analysis compatible with a kinetic penetrator platform. This technology uses an integrated microfluidic processor to prepare samples for microchip capillary electrophoresis (µCE), where amine and amino acid components are chirally and compositionally separated prior to highly sensitive laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection.\nPreliminary modeling of the core microfluidic processing and analytical device indicates that the device is more than capable of surviving the stresses associated with an impact acceleration of >50,000g. However, a number of developments must still be made to both the microdevice itself and the supporting hardware to enable a system truly capable of surviving such large g-loads upon impact.\nPreliminary experiments indicate that switching to an incompressible (hydraulic) microvalve system may provide better impact resistance. A modification of an established microfabricated LIF detection system would use indium bump bonding to permanently weld optical components using standard microfabrication techniques with perfect alignment. Incorporation of microfabricated electrodes within the microdevice can enable robust and simple measurements of pH, total ion content, and potentially even individual ion concentration without adding significant mechanical complexity or risk.\n",

            "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of many river deltas is that they branch into distributary networks as they approach their receiving basin. Recent studies have shown that the pattern of sediment transport in the lower reaches of the trunk channel is controlled by interaction with the downstream water level, and that channel bed friction plays a critical role in modulating the relationship. However these studies have typically concentrated on regional scales, and not investigated the terminal distributary channels which have an additional upstream water level boundary constraint set by the trunk channel.\nIntuition gained from studies of trunk channels would suggest that friction is a dominant control in terminal distributary channels too. Contrary to this intuition, we present observations suggesting that in many cases large and small distributary channels emanating from the same crevasse have similar water surface slopes and velocities. We consider the hypothesis that big and small terminal distributary channels act similarly because the down-channel pressure gradient overwhelms inter-channel variations in bed friction over the observed distributary length. We then adapt existing models of backwater flow to account for the fixed upstream boundary condition in terminal distributary channels. Our results have implications for the management of coastal river systems and for our understanding of channel bifurcation stability.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic halocarbon emissions in the latter half of the twentieth century has led to a global decline in stratospheric ozone, particularly over the polar regions. The radiative induced cooling from ozone depletion results in a strengthened springtime polar vortex, which has been linked through dynamical coupling to trends in the dominant modes of tropospheric circulation variability, the Northern and Southern annular modes, and surface climate changes. The chemical mechanism for ozone depletion is dependent on the vertical location in the stratosphere. Heterogeneous chemical processes involving chlorine drive local chemical ozone depletion in the polar lower stratosphere (12-25 km), while gas-phase ozone photochemistry drives substantial depletion globally in the upper stratosphere (peak near 40 km). Trends in ozone depletion in the Artic are larger in the upper stratosphere than in the lower stratosphere. Whether the evolution of changes in ozone in the upper stratosphere could couple to long-term changes in the structure of the annular modes in the troposphere, particularly in winter and spring, is the primary focus of this study. We will present results utilizing the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which is a fully coupled state-of-the-art interactive chemistry-climate model. WACCM is a high-top atmospheric model well suited to our study that extends from the surface to 140km with fully interactive chemistry and dynamics. Two free-running historic simulations were run from 1955 to 2015, with the sole variation being the inclusion of heterogeneous halogen chemistry. Analysis of the trends in circulation between the two simulations reveal the effect to which gas-phase ozone loss of the upper stratosphere dynamically influences responses at lower altitudes in a fully coupled framework.",

The most dramatic atmospheric effect was the ablation of cometary dust that produced a transient metallic ion layer near 120 km, higher than the predicted (90 km) constant metallic ion layer from sporadic dust ablation due to the extreme relative velocity of the comet (56 km/s). Additionally, cometary gases such as H2O, CO2 and their daughter species delivered mass and energy to the upper atmosphere, where the temperature at 150 km was predicted to increase by 30 K.\nThe Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on MAVEN takes limb scans at periapse to construct altitude profiles of various ultraviolet species. Using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique to extract spectral features, we analyze the observations of the perturbed atmosphere to determine whether the gaseous mass and energy deposition is distinguishable within typical atmospheric variation. Furthermore, we use all subsequent dayside observations to identify the metallic ion layer, represented by the presence of Mg+, and compare these observations with a robust numerical model of ablation, CAMBOD (Chemical Ablation Model).",

Hence, properly modeling the 3-dimensonal distribution of aerosols is a crucial step for coherent climate simulations. Since surface networks only give 2-D data, and most satellites supply integrated column information, it is thus important to integrate aircraft measurements in climate model evaluation. In this study, the vertical distribution of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate, is constrained against a collection of 14 AMS flight campaigns, and surface measurements from 2000-2010 in the USA and Europe. GISS modelE2, one of the only models to include nitrate aerosol in CIMP5, is used with multiple aerosol microphysics (MATRIX, OMA) and thermodynamic (ISORROPIA-II, EQSAM) configurations. Our results show that the MATRIX microphysical scheme improves the model performance for sulfate and that there is a systematic underestimation of ammonium and nitrate over the USA and Europe. In terms of gaseous precursors, underestimation of nitrate and ammonium is likely tied to ammonia emissions uncertainties, while nitric acid concentrations are largely overestimated in the higher levels of the model, influenced by strong strat-trop exchange. At high altitudes, nitrate formation is calculated to be ammonia limited, whose profile measurements are scarce.",

For this purpose, we use data of ground-based GPS-receivers and ionosondes, along space-borne instruments onboard the following satellites: Jason-2, GRACE, Terra-SAR-X, the three Swarm satellites (A, B, and C), and GUVI/TIMED.\nThe storm consisted of two successive moderate storms. In the response to the first short storm, a short-term positive effect in the ionospheric vertical electron content (VTEC) occurred at low- and mid-latitudes on the dayside. The second event lasted longer and caused significant and complex storm-time changes around the globe. At high-latitudes, negative storm signatures were recorded in all longitudinal regions. The negative storm phase was found to be strongest in the Asian sector, in particular in the northern hemisphere (NH), but developed globally on March 18 at the beginning of the recovery phase. At mid-latitudes, inverse hemispheric asymmetries occurred in different longitudinal regions: in the European-African sector, positive storm signatures were observed in the NH, whereas in the American sector, a large positive storm occurred in the southern hemisphere (SH), and the NH experienced a negative storm. These observations performed around the spring equinox signify the existence of other impact factors than seasonal dependence for hemispheric asymmetries to occur. At low-latitudes, data from multiple satellites revealed the strongest storm-time effects in the morning (~100-150% enhancement) and post-sunset (~80-100% enhancement) sectors in the topside ionosphere. These dramatic VTEC enhancements were observed at different UT, but around the same area of Eastern Pacific region.\nTo further understand the storm development, we are planning to use thermospheric data from Swarm-C satellite, as well as the data from the electric field instrument onboard the three Swarm satellites.",

High-quality geological records of late Holocene Relative Sea Level (RSL) are now available for this region. These data provide an independent constraint on Glacial Isostatic Adjustments (GIA), for comparison to continuous GPS measurements that directly measure net vertical crustal motion from GIA and other processes. Installation of more than 130 permanent GPS stations since 2006 represents an improvement towards precise determination of present-day subsidence rates along the coastal plain. We present an improved vertical velocity field for the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and parts of Atlantic Canada with uncertainty estimates that incorporate time-correlated noise.\nWe use the geologic rates of RSL as an independent constraint to separate the long-term GIA-induced displacement (average motion over past 4 ka) from the GPS vertical displacement (average of one or two decades). Differences between the two are important for mitigating coastal land loss and predicting future storm surge inundation.\nOur results indicate that for most areas of the U.S. eastern seaboard there is no difference between GPS rates and late Holocene RSL rates. Exceptions are related to areas of recent excessive groundwater extraction in Virginia and South Carolina. The present-day subsidence rates in these areas are approximately double the long-term geologic rates.",

High resolution profiles of ozone and temperature with altitude, measured during daylight hours, showed the development of approximately week long high ozone episodes building from background levels of ~40 ppb to >150 ppb. The topography of the basin combined with a strong temperature inversion trapped oil and gas production effluents in the basin and the snow covered surface amplified the sun’s radiation driving the photochemical ozone production at rates up to 13 ppb/hour in a cold layer capped at 1600-1700 meters above sea level. Beginning in mid-morning, ozone mixing ratios throughout the cold layer increased until late afternoon. Ozone mixing ratios were generally constant with height indicating that ozone production was nearly uniform throughout the depth of the cold pool. Although there was strong diurnal variation, ozone mixing ratios increased during the day more than decreased during the night, resulting in elevated levels the next morning; an indication that nighttime loss processes did not compensate for daytime production. Even though the 3 tethersonde sites were at elevations differing by as much as 140 m, the top of the high ozone layer was nearly uniform in altitude at the 3 locations. Mobile van surface ozone measurements across the basin confirmed this capped structure of the ozone layer; the vehicle drove out of high ozone mixing ratios at an elevation of ~1900 meters above sea level, above which free tropospheric ozone mixing ratios of ~50 ppb were measured. Exhaust plumes from a coal-fired power plant in the eastern portion of the basin were intercepted by the tethersondes. The structure of the profiles clearly showed that effluents in the plumes were not mixed downward and thus did not contribute precursor nitrogen oxides to the observed ozone production in the boundary layer.",

We have evaluated the potential impacts of biofuel induced land use changes on hydrology, water quality, and ecosystem services. The bioenergy production scenarios, included: production of Miscanthus × giganteus and switchgrass on highly erodible landscape positions, agricultural marginal land areas, and pastures; removal of corn stover at various rates; and combinations of these scenarios. The hydrology and water quality impacts of land use change scenarios were estimated for two watersheds in Midwest USA (1) Wildcat Creek watershed (drainage area of 2,083 km2) located in north-central Indiana and (2) St. Joseph River watershed (drainage area of 2,809 km2) located in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. We have also simulated the impacts of climate change and variability on environmental sustainability and have compared climate change impacts with land use change impacts. The study results indicated improved water quality with perennial grass scenarios compared to current row crop production impacts. Erosion reduction with perennial energy crop production scenarios ranged between 0.2% and 59%. Stream flow at the watershed outlet were reduced between 0.2 and 8% among various bioenergy crop production scenarios. Stover removal scenarios indicated increased erosion compared to baseline condition due reduced soil cover after stover harvest. Stream flow and nitrate loading were reduced with stover removal due to increased soil evaporation and reduced mineralization. A comparison of land use and climate change impacts indicates that land use changes will have considerably larger impacts on hydrology, water quality and environmental sustainability compared to climate change and variability. Our results indicate that production of biofuel crops can be optimized at the landscape level to provide adequate supply of biomass while improving water quality and environmental sustainability.",

Compilations of ice creep data from tests at ambient and elevated confining pressures, however, suggest that dislocation creep of ice is characterized by a value of n=4, not 3. While high-pressure experiments on ice provide the best constraints on the dislocation creep regime and have consistently yielded a stress exponent of ~4, most of these tests have been conducted at much-lower-than-glaciological temperatures (Durham et al., 1992). To investigate dislocation creep of ice at glaciological conditions, we deformed samples at temperatures ≥264 K and elevated confining pressures up to ~30 MPa, the maximum cryostatic pressure in the ice sheets. Samples were formed by flooding evacuated cylindrical compacts of distilled-water seed ice of particle sizes 0.18-0.25 mm or 1-1.6 mm at 273 K, followed by freezing at 243 K. Each indium-jacketed specimen was deformed in compression in a gas-medium apparatus at a single constant displacement rate to ~20% strain, at nominally constant strain rates of from 10-6 to 10-3 s-1. In each test, we obtain the peak stress after ~2-3% strain and the steady-state flow stress at larger strains. Plots of strain rate vs. both peak stress and flow stress yield a value of n=4, consistent with previous data from higher-pressure, lower-temperature tests (Durham et al., 1992) and from some ambient pressure experiments (Goldsby and Kohlstedt, 2001), and with models of climb-limited dislocation creep (Weertman, 1968). At stresses <3 MPa, tests on the finer-grained samples show a slight decrease in n to a value <4, while data for the coarser-grained samples show no such transition, consistent with the onset of dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (GBS) in the finer-grained samples at low stresses (Goldsby and Kohlstedt, 2001). Our data demonstrate that the Glen law is an average of two creep regimes - dislocation creep proper, with n=4, and dislocation-accommodated GBS, with n≈2 - and fails to accurately describe the rheological behavior of ice over the broad range of strain rates in natural ice bodies.",

            "abstract": "Persulfate ISCO has been shown to treat a wide range of contaminants. While persulfate ISCO can be tailored to site and pollutant specific characteristics (e.g., activation via energy or catalysis), thermal activation of persulfate is particularly promising as it can be easily controlled and requires no additional reagents. A mechanistic study of the physical and chemical processes controlling the effectiveness of this remedial approach is not well documented in the literature with much therein focused on reactions in batch systems. The purpose of this research was twofold. Initial studies characterized the overall transport behavior of unactivated and thermally-activated persulfate (20, 60, and 90°C) in one-dimensional soil column systems. Finally, experiments were conducted to investigate persulfate ISCO as a remedial approach for residual-phase trichloroethylene (TCE). At all activation temperatures investigated, persulfate exhibited ideal transport behavior in miscible displacement experiments. Moment analysis of persulfate ion breakthrough curves indicated negligible interaction of persulfate with the natural sandy material. Persulfate ISCO for residual-phase TCE was characterized at two flow rates, 0.2 mL/min and 0.5 mL/min, resulting in two degrees of persulfate activation, 39.5% and 24.6%, respectively. Both ISCO soil column systems showed an initial, long-term plateau in effluent TCE concentrations indicating steady-state dissolution of pure phase TCE. Observed effluent concentrations decreased after 75 and 100 pore volumes (normalized for the measured residual NAPL fraction) compared to 110 pore volumes in the control study. Pseudo first-order reaction rate constants for the decreasing TCE concentrations equaled 0.063/hr and 0.083/hr, respectively, compared to 0.041/hr for the control. Moment analysis of the complete dissolution of TCE in the persulfate/activated persulfate remediation systems indicated approximately 33% oxidation of TCE mass present. By characterizing the overall transport behavior and application of persulfate/heat-activated persulfate in a natural porous media for the ISCO of residual nonaqueous phase liquid, this work aids in improving the implementation of persulfate ISCO systems.",

The\narea studied includes examples of physically different components of\nthe corona, such as coronal moss, a sunspot, quiet Sun and\nfan loop footpoints.\nWe show that a large fraction of the power spectra are well\nmodeled by a power spectrum that behaves like a power law f-n (n>0)\nat lower frequencies f, dropping to a constant value at higher\nfrequencies. We also show that there are areas where the power spectra\nare better described by the above power spectrum model, plus a narrow\nband oscillatory feature, centered in the 3-5 minute oscillation\nrange. These narrow-band spectral features are thought to be due to\nthe propagation of oscillations from lower down in solar atmosphere to\nhotter. This allows us to produce maps of large areas of the corona\nshowing where the propagation from one waveband to another does and\ndoes not occur. This is an important step in understanding wave\npropagation in different layers in the corona.\nWe also show the 171Å and 193Å power spectrum power law indices are\ncorrelated, with 171Å power law indices in the range n = 1.8 to 2.8,\nand 193Å power law indices n = 2 to 3.5 approximately. Maps of the\npower law index show that different ranges of values of the power law\nindices occur in spatially contiguous parts of the corona, indicating\nthat local spatial structure may play a role in defining the power law\nindex value. Taken with our previous result from Ireland et al. (2015)\nthat physically different parts of the corona have different mean\nvalues of the power law index, this new result strongly suggests that\nthe same mechanism producing the observed power law power spectrum is\noperating everywhere across the corona. We discuss the nanoflare\nhypothesis as a possible explanation of these observations.",

This paper presents an investigation of charged dust transport and distribution around small asteroids utilizing two newly developed numerical models and laboratory measurements of dust layer charging in a simulated asteroid plasma environment.\nThe first model is a full particle Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model to simulate plasma flow around an asteroid and calculate surface charging self-consistently from charge deposition on asteroid. A major feature of this model is that the asteroid surface is treated as an “interface” between two mediums rather than a boundary, and the simulation domain includes not only the plasma but also the entire asteroid. An immersed-finite-element field solver is applied which calculates both the surface floating potential and the electric field inside the asteroid directly from local charge deposition. The material properties of asteroid are also explicitly included in the simulation. Results from PIC simulations of asteroid-plasma interactions, along with laboratory measurements of dust charge-to-mass ratio under a simulated asteroid surface charging environment, are fed into a dust dynamics model to simulate charged dust levitation, transport and distribution. In addition to electrostatic and gravitational forces, the dynamics of dust surface impacts and asteroid body rotation are also included in the model. We discuss the effects of asteroid composition and space plasma environments on dust levitation and transport. We present simulation results of dust distribution around several different types of small asteroids.",

            "abstract": "The Brahmaputra River has followed three preferred pathways within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta during the Holocene: the principal course along the modern Jamuna braidbelt and two subsidiary routes through the tectonically deforming Sylhet Basin. The Jamuna braidbelt follows a relatively straight and tectonically stable (subsidence rates generally <2 mm/yr) route along much of its reach. In contrast, pathways through Sylhet Basin traverse an actively subsiding basin (typically 3-4 mm/yr, with rates as high as 7 mm/year near the adjacent Dauki foredeep). In spite of differential subsidence, the Brahmaputra has only episodically occupied Sylhet Basin for brief periods during most of the Holocene. We compare downstream rates of mass extraction via selective deposition along multiple sediment delivery pathways using quantitative grain size data from a network of over 400 closely-spaced (3-5 km) boreholes (up to 90 m deep). An exponential function to describe downstream fining was fitted to the data, with the exponent alpha taken to be the rate of downstream fining. Our data indicate 1.) the upper and lower reaches (~100 km) of all pathways exhibit limited to no fining, 2.) once fining begins it proceeds rapidly in a downstream direction until the coarse fraction has been extracted, and 3.) the fining rate in Sylhet Basin (α = 0.005) is considerably higher than that for the modern braidbelt (α = 0.001), likely due to a steeper slope down the fan delta. When converted to a scale-independent chi space, preserved stratigraphy along both courses show declining sand:mud ratios and sand body thickness at a chi distance of about 0.7, consistent with previous studies in other depositional settings. This downstream distance also generally coincides with a decrease in slope from the fan delta to the lower fluvial-tidal delta, as well as the cessation of downstream fining. Furthermore, this transition corresponds with the backwater length as calculated by a number of different methods. These initial results suggest that complete extraction of the coarse fraction occurs over relatively distinct transition zones in the delta’s landscape morphology and tectonic regime, leading to coherent interpretations of fluvial dynamics, stratigraphic architecture, and their coupling with sediment extraction.",

We present the origin and evolution of this basin through the study of its deformation events occurring mainly on the El Bajío fault, at the boundary between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Mesa Central. Detailed stratigraphy, and structural analysis suggest 4 deformation events in the northwest of the Sierra de Guanajuato. The first event (D1) with E-W shortening is characterized by the development of axial plane foliation (S1) with N-S direction, this event occurred between the Tithonian and Aptian age. In the second event (D2), occurred between the Albian and the early Eocene, foliations NW-SE (S2) were generated with a NE-SW shortening trend dated between the Albian and early Eocene, this deformation is related to the Laramide Orogeny. The Granito Comanja was emplaced during the third event (D3) and generated foliation (S3) in sediments of the complejo vulcanosedimentario Sierra de Guanajuato that circumscribes the Granito Comanja in response to its intrusion. After its emplacement, NW-SE normal faults were generated along the S-SE contact of the Granito Comanja, at that time El Bajío fault began. The fourth event (D4) has three phases that affected the sedimentary and volcanic Cenozoic rocks. D4F1 is marked by continental conglomerates deposition with variable thickness along of the main trace of the El Bajío fault. D4F2 affected the Oligocene volcanic rocks showing an important fault activity at that time, as evidenced the tilting above 45o in the Oligocene rocks, temporarily coincides with the triaxial extension to the Mesa Central. The direction of elongation of D4F3 is ESE-WNW, El Bajío fault had little movement. Since the Miocene the deformation was concentrated along the southern central sector of the Trans-mexican Volcanic Belt and there were few deformation in the Mesa central. During the three phases of deformation several faults were reactivated with N-S and NE-SW directions. The Taxco-San Miguel de Allende Fault System with N-S direction, and the El Bajio Fault with NW-SE trend, formed half grabens leading the formation of what is now known as El Bajio.",

            "abstract": "The snow cover on sea ice receives more and more attention in recent sea ice studies and model simulations, because its physical properties dominate many processes at the surface and inside the sea ice layer. In particular the temporal and spatial distribution of snow depth is of crucial importance for the energy and mass budgets of sea ice as well as for the interaction with the atmosphere and for the oceanic fresh-water budget. Snow depth is a crucial input parameter for sea ice thickness retrieval algorithms that are based on satellite altimetry data. Recent ice volume time series of Arctic sea ice are based on a monthly climatology, which is not able to take annual changes of the snow depth and properties into account. With a few exceptions, snow depth on sea ice is typically determined from manual measurements with very limited coverage in space and time. Hence, the need for more and more consistent observational data sets of snow depth on sea ice is frequently highlighted. Here, we present time series measurements of snow depths on Antarctic and Arctic sea ice, recorded by a novel and affordable platform. The instrument is optimized to autonomously monitor the evolution of snow depth on sea ice and will allow new insights into the seasonality of snow depth. We highlight two pairs of buoys, which drifted simultaneously through the Weddell Sea for more than one year, covering a full seasonal cycle. The data sets reveal characteristic differences within each pair (<200 km distance), between the pairs (>1000 km distance), and in comparison to Arctic time series. The results suggest the great importance of local effects and potential influences of dynamic sea ice processes on snow accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Moving beyond the widely used kinematic models for the deformation sources, we present new dynamic models to describe the process of injecting magma into an existing magma reservoir. The 3-dimensional numerical models account for a viscoelastic, gravitationally loaded domain with spatially variable rheological properties. A Newtonian fluid characterized by its viscosity, density, and overpressure (relative to the lithostatic value) intrudes into a viscoelastic solid via a conduit leading to the reservoir. Using the Finite Element Method (FEM), we simultaneously solve the coupled quasi-static elastic and Navier-Stokes governing equations for the solid and the fluid, respectively, using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. The fluid and the solid interact through buoyancy and viscoelastic relaxation, leading to time-dependent deformation. To quantify the \"strength\" of the source, we define the product of the volume change (in cubic meters) and pressure change (in Pascals) as the \"volcanic moment\" (in Newton-meters or Joules). This quantity serves as a basis for comparing the calculated displacement fields to analytical solutions. After validating our injection model, we apply it to the ongoing episode of unrest at Laguna del Maule (Chile). Since 2007, the volcanic field there has been deforming at an exceptionally high rate, with vertical velocities up to 200 mm/yr, as measured by GPS and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) between 2013 and 2014, as described recently by Le Mével et al. (2015, Geophys. Res. Lett.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064665\n). We are modeling the geodetic data to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of the displacement. These models constrain the mass flux of material into the reservoir and thus its impact on the stress in the crust. Our results contribute to understanding the current unrest episode at Laguna del Maule and to assessing geodetic signals at other active volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Woody-plant encroachment over the last 100 years has shaped the deserts in the southwestern United States. In this work, we examine the process of woody-plant encroachment in the Chihuahuan Desert at the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico. Our hypothesis is that differences in shrub phenology among mesquite, tarbush, and creosotebush relative to the seasonal timing of plant available water have governed the historic shifts in shrub-dominated states. This work tests that hypothesis using data obtained from a dense instrument network along with aerial images and phenological measurements. We installed sap flow sensors on 9 shrubs, 3 each of mesquite, tarbush, and creosotebush, to measure seasonal and interspecies variations in transpiration (T). These sensors are located within the footprint of an eddy covariance tower used to measure ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration (ET). We use a network of soil moisture sensors as well as a cosmic-ray sensing soil moisture sensor to measure soil water and relate this to overall ET and species-level transpiration. We partitioned ET into its components, bare soil evaporation (E) and T, using an empirical approach based on soil temperature and soil moisture. For the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons of 2013 (2014), we found that T/ET was 0.26 (0.24) and 0.70 (0.71), respectively. We use a hydrologic model to partition the ET during this period to compare to the observations from the empirical approach. We further partitioned T into shrub components using sapflow data. We then analyze the activity of each species throughout the year and how they compete for water by examining time series of rainfall, soil moisture, soil temperature, ET, shrub phenological data and vegetation greenness. Our evaluations provide a first look into how plant phenology can impact shrub competition and the implications this has on short-term soil water availability and ET as well as long-term state dynamics in mixed shrublands of the Chihuahuan Desert.",

            "abstract": "Flood risk is a well-known facet of natural hazards along the US coastline where nearly 40% of the population resides in its coastal counties. Furthermore, given the heavy reliance on the coastal zone for natural resources and economic activity, flood preparedness and safety is a key element of long-term resilience. A clear understanding of the various flood types and changes in the frequency of their occurrence is critical towards reliable estimates of vulnerability and potential impacts in the near-term as well as into the future. When the two main flood drivers for coastal areas storm surge and heavy precipitation occur in tandem the potential for significant flooding is much greater than from either in isolation. Exploring the probability of these ‘compound events’ and understanding the processes driving them is essential to mitigate the associated high impact risks. For the contiguous US the likelihood of the joint occurrence of the two phenomena is largely unknown. Here we show – using storm surge and precipitation records spanning the last century – that the risk of compound flooding is higher for the US east and Gulf coasts, relative to the west coast. We also show that the number of compound events has increased significantly over the last century along large coastline stretches including many of the major coastal cities. For New York City – as an example – this increase is attributed to a shift towards storm surge weather patterns also favouring high precipitation. Preliminary analyses reveal that these synoptic scale changes are closely linked to large scale and low frequency climate variations. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing the risk of compound flooding within the design process of coastal and urban infrastructure in a non-stationary framework and to explore the potential effects of climate change on these high impact events.",

However, a persistent problem with this hypothesis is the lack of definitive paleoshoreline features. Here, based on geomorphic and thermal surface character mapping and numerical analysis in the circum-Chryse region of the northern plains, we show evidence for two enormous tsunami events possibly triggered by bolide impacts resulting in craters ~30 km in diameter and occurring perhaps a few million years apart. The tsunami events produced widespread, extant littoral landforms, including run-up sedimentary lobes hundreds of kilometers long across gently sloping plains and backwash channels where wave retreat occurred on highland boundary surfaces. Variations among the features associated with each tsunami event suggest that the ocean was relatively more frozen during the second event.",

            "abstract": "The environmental costs of nitrogen use have prompted a focus on improving the efficiency of nitrogen use in the global food system, the primary source of nitrogen pollution. Typical approaches to improving agricultural nitrogen use efficiency include more targeted field-level use (timing, placement, and rate) and modification of the crop mix. However, global efficiency gains can also be achieved by improving the spatial allocation of nitrogen between regions or countries, due to consistent diminishing returns at high nitrogen use. This concept is examined by constructing a tradeoff frontier (or production possibilities frontier) describing global crop protein yield as a function of applied nitrogen from all sources, given optimal spatial allocation. Yearly variation in country-level input-output nitrogen budgets are utilized to parameterize country-specific hyperbolic yield-response models. Response functions are further characterized for three ~15-year eras beginning in 1961, and series of calculations uses these curves to simulate optimal spatial allocation in each era and determine the frontier. The analyses reveal that excess nitrogen (in recent years) could be reduced by ~40% given optimal spatial allocation. Over time, we find that gains in yield potential and in-country nitrogen use efficiency have led to increases in the global nitrogen production possibilities frontier. However, this promising shift has been accompanied by an actual spatial distribution of nitrogen use that has become less optimal, in an absolute sense, relative to the frontier. We conclude that examination of global production possibilities is a promising approach to understanding production constraints and efficiency opportunities in the global food system.",

            "abstract": "We report here new experimental kinetic data on the structural evolution of carbonaceous materials (CM) to graphite in a wide range of temperature conditions (1000 and 1450 °C) and treatment time (10 min to 115 hrs) under a pressure condition of 1GPa. The morphologies and crystallinities of natural CM, extracted from sediments in the Shimanto accretionary complex and Hidaka metamorphic belt, transformed to fully ordered graphite with increasing temperature and annealing duration. The time-temperature relations of each crystal parameter obtained using XRD analysis and micro-Raman spectroscopy demonstrated sigmoidal transformations from amorphous to graphitic structure, suggesting the complexity of chemical reactions undergoing during graphitization. To assess these kinetic processes, the results were analyzed using a superposition method in which the crystal parameters were superposed to reference temperature with non-linear regression curves. The master curves fitted by sigmoidal and power functions exhibited very good correlation coefficients of 0.940 to 0.991, suggesting the Arrhenian relation between temperature and time. On the basis of master curves and shift values, we obtained the effective activation energies of 274 +/– 9 kJmol-1 and 339 +/– 6 kJmol-1 for two different natural CM. When compared with the previous studies, our data gave remarkably low activation energies for natural graphitization, which can be represented in a time-temperature relation. In addition, the sigmoidal functions obtained from time-temperature relations can be extrapolated for low temperature condition at 1GPa. Our kinetic model predicts that if the CM underwent metamorphism for about one million years, it begins to crystallize at ≈ 420 °C and transform to fully ordered graphite at over ≈ 510 °C. Thus, natural graphitization could be discussed by the laboratory experiments using natural precursor materials under realistic pressure condition and time span in the Earth’s crust.",

The alluvium in this part of Yucca Flat is typical of desert basin fill, with discontinuous beds that are highly variable in clast size and provenance. Detailed understanding of the subsurface geology will be needed for interpretation of the SPE seismic data. A 3D seismic velocity model, created for Yucca Flat using interval seismic velocity data, shows variations in velocity within alluvium near the SPE Phase II site beyond the usual gradual increase of density with depth due to compaction. In this study we examined borehole lithologic logs, geophysical logs, downhole videos, and laboratory analyses of sidewall core samples to understand which characteristics of the alluvium are related to these variations in seismic velocity. Seismic velocity of alluvium is generally related to its density, which can be affected by sediment provenance, clast size, gravel percentage, and matrix properties, in addition to compaction. This study presents a preliminary subdivision of the alluvial strata in the SPE Phase II area into mappable units expected to be significant to seismic modeling. Further refinements of the alluvial units may be possible when seismic data are obtained from SPE Phase II tests.\nThis work was done by National Security Technologies, LLC, under Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25946 with the U.S. Department of Energy.",

We have developed a computer vision-based classification algorithm to distinguish smallholder agricultural land cover in Sub-Saharan Africa, using a group of high-resolution images from South Africa as a case study. For supervised classification, smallholder agriculture, with ambiguous patterns of small, irregular fields, requires a wide range of training data samples to adequately describe the variability in appearance. We employ crowd-sourcing to obtain new training data to expand the geographic range of our algorithm. A crowd-sourcing user is asked to hand-digitize the boundaries of agricultural fields in an assigned 1 km2 image. Yet random assignment of images to users could result in a highly redundant training data set with limited discriminative power. Furthermore, larger training data sets require a greater number of users to hand-digitize fields, which increases costs through crowd-sourcing engines like Amazon Mechanical Turk, as well as longer algorithm training times, which increases computing costs.\nTherefore, we employ an active learning approach to interactively select the most informative images to be hand-digitized for training data by crowd-sourcing users, based on changes in algorithm accuracy. We investigate the use of various image similarity measures used in content-based image retrieval systems, which quantify the distance, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, between a variety of extracted feature spaces to determine how similar the content of two images are. We determine the minimum training data set needed to maximize algorithm accuracy, as well as automate the selection of additional training images to classify a new target image that expands the geographic range of our algorithm.",

Recently, bamboo corals (gorgonian octocorals) have been proposed as archives of intermediate ocean conditions. This study used 'reconnaissance' radiocarbon analysis to identify the nuclear bomb 14C spike in the proteinaceous nodes of bamboo corals and to quantify radial growth rates and ages of corals spanning the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) (790-2055 m). Preliminary data suggest that these corals exhibit a wide range of growth rates (9.4-350 μm/yr) that are non-linear over time and decrease with coral age and depth. Records of Mg/Li were investigated in these corals, given that previous studies have demonstrated positive correlations between Mg/Li and temperature in benthic foraminifera and surface and deep-sea aragonitic corals, with a reduced influence of vital effects over Mg/Ca. Intracoral reproducibility observed for replicate Mg/Li timeseries within each sample (p=0.6±0.2, n=6) and strong correlations between Mg/Ca and Li/Ca (0.9±0.1, n=6) indicate similar environmental or biological drivers of Mg and Li incorporation in bamboo corals. Given the strong positive correlations between Mg/Li and water temperature across a depth transect (r2=0.87, n=6), increasing Mg/Li observed over the growth history of each of the corals more likely reflects declining growth rates resulting in decreased Li incorporation over time rather than cooling of California Margin intermediate waters. Reductions in growth rate over the lifespan of each coral (~100+ years) may be a function of natural coral growth patterns or changes in carbonate chemistry, oxygen, or food supply in a sensitive OMZ coral ecosystem.",

For example, loop antennas excited in the frequency range ωLH < ω < ωce (where ωLH and ωce are the lower hybrid and electron cyclotron frequencies) produce electrostatic lower oblique resonance (LOR) waves. Likewise a dipole antenna excited in the frequency range ωci < Ω < ωLH (where ωci is the ion cyclotron frequency) produce electrostatic ion acoustic (IA) type density perturbations. The goal of our research is to increase power radiated into the electromagnetic part of the VLF wave spectrum, specifically into electromagnetic Whistler waves. These waves are generated in a CMP due to a nonlinear parametric coupling of the strong quasi-electrostatic electric fields from the loop antenna and the density perturbations from the dipole antenna. Therefore, a parametric antenna is made by parametrically coupling these two waves. Because EM Whistler waves are effective sources of pitch angle diffusion, one application of a parametric antenna includes radiation belt remediation in Earth’s space environment. In this poster we show electric field patterns from the loop and dipole antennas and the EM spectrum excited due to the parametric interaction.",

            "abstract": "The increased water vapor content due to climate warming can impact the global hydrological cycle not only by the direct thermodynamic effect constrained by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, but also impinging on features of circulation through coupling with the atmospheric dynamics. Through implementing the concept of finite-amplitude wave activity (FAWA) and its three-dimensional extension to local FAWA, the increase of the hydrological extremes manifested in terms of FAWA under climate change scenario RCP8.5 can be decomposed into the part due to the background increase of moisture (scaled with the temperature warming, thus representing thermodynamical effect) and the part due to the change of waviness of the contours of moisture (representing the dynamical factor). It is found that the both thermodynamical increase of moisture and the change of the waviness project on to the enhancement of the climatological pattern of the FAWA associated with the poleward moisture intrusion (Am). Whereas, the change of the FAWA associated with the dry air intrusion (Ad) is characterized by both an enhancement of the background pattern and a poleward expansion thereof, the latter arising from the poleward shift of the wavy motion. This result may serve as a rationale for why both dry and wet extremes will become more frequent while the time mean temperature and water vapor increase under global warming. The relative contributions to the response of the waviness in the moisture distribution from the stationary wave versus the transient waves will also be examined.",

An E-W trending lineament, now known to be a strike-slip shear zone, separates the EGP from the Archaean Indian craton to the north which is characterised by penetrative 2.8 Ga granulite foliation. In contrast, the penetrative granulite foliation in the EGP is 1.0 Ga in age; in places along the contact zone, both granulite foliations are overprinted by a greenschist facies mylonitic fabric related to a later dextral strike-slip motion along the lineament. Identification of a sub-surface, sub-vertical structural discontinuity along the lineament through field gravity-magnetic studies further confirms that craton-mobile belt boundary continues in the sub-surface. The northern side of the lineament shows no overprint of the 1 Ga fabric on the 2.8 Ga fabric, implying that the presently juxtaposed 2.8 Ga and 1 Ga terranes in the Indian shield may not have been juxtaposed during the 1 Ga event. Kinematic analysis of the contact shear zone by using strain gradients across the width of the domain, confirms that a dominantly strike-slip deformation brought the terranes together. 40Ar-39Ar ages of ~490-470 Ma have been reported from deformed micas within the shear zone, and this is suggested to correspond to the age of this mobilization. This lineament can be traced into the Rauer Group in East Antarctica that separates similarly aged domains, suggesting that it represents a site preferred for terrane amalgamation during assembly of temporally disparate supercontinents. Whether the lineament developed during the last dextral strike-slip movement or it is a reactivated 1.0 Ga, 2.8 Ga or even older discontinuity, remains unclear.",

Current belief is that reactions involving OH and NO3 to be the predominate mechanism in initiating removal processes. Towards understanding these oxidative processes, the CIMS techniques for measuring OH radicals was developed. As part of this measurement a determination of non-OH SO­­­2 oxidants is made. This measurement has already changed the outlook of oxidation supporting the recent discovery that stabilized Criegee radicals (sCI) also have a significant capacity to oxidize compounds such as SO2 to ultimately form H2SO4. Here we present measurements of non-OH SO2 oxidants obtained during the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) and the Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distribution Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) field campaigns. Both of these campaigns provided the opportunity to sample a broad spectrum of atmospheric environments ranging from biogenic to urban influenced air masses. These measurements reveal the sources to derive from surface emissions, with the largest concentrations observed in the boundary layer. Large non-OH SO2 oxidant concentrations are seen over areas with large emissions of biogenic species such as isoprene, supporting the idea that they are mainly stabilized Criegee radicals. However large concentrations are also seen in areas of urban outflow, possibly indicating that there may be non-OH species other than stabilized Criegees which can oxidize SO2.",

However, for sloped measurement sites the different terms contributing to the energy balance are not aligned along the axes of a single reference coordinate system. Consequently, a measurement and data processing strategy is needed that enables consistently quantifying each contributing term.\nThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is currently deploying surface-atmosphere exchange sensors at several dozen measurement sites, 50% of which are located on slopes up to 20 degrees. To enable unbiased observations across sites, the incident angle between a flux and its measurement should be minimized, and instrument limitations and spatial representativeness need to be considered.\nHere, we present a strategy that combines site-adaptive instrument alignment with real-time attitude tracking and a set of trigonometric, radiative and source area conversions. This allows obeying the physical limitations underlying radiation, turbulence, profile and soil heat flux sensors, while providing observations in a consistent frame of reference. The strategy is evaluated against initial findings from the first months of surface-atmosphere exchange sensor deployments at NEON.",

            "abstract": "As part of the GOES-R and JPSS Satellite Proving Grounds, multiple proxy and operational products were available to analyze and forecast the complex evolution of Hurricane Arthur (2014). The National Hurricane Center, Ocean Prediction Center, Weather Prediction Center, and NESDIS Satellite Analysis Branch were able to monitor the tropical and extratropical transition of Arthur using various convective and red, green, blue (RGB) products that have been introduced in recent years. During the extratropical transition, the Air Mass RGB (AM RGB) product and AIRS/CrIS ozone products were available as a compliment to water vapor imagery to identify the upper-level low with associated stratospheric drying that absorbed much of Arthur’s energy. The AM RGB product provides forecasters with an enhanced view of various air masses that are combined into a single image and can help differentiate between possible stratospheric/tropospheric interactions, moist tropical air masses, and cool, continental/maritime air masses. Even though this product provides a wealth of qualitative information about the horizontal distribution of synoptic features, forecasters are also interested in more quantitative information such as the vertical distribution of temperature, moisture, and ozone which impact the coloring of the resulting AM RGB.\nCurrently, NOAA Unique CrIS/ATMS Processing System (NUCAPS) temperature and moisture soundings are available in AWIPS-II as a point-based display. Traditionally, soundings are used to anticipate and forecast severe convection, however unique and valuable information can be gained from soundings for other forecasting applications, such as extratropical transition, especially in data sparse regions. Additional research has been conducted to look at how NUCAPS soundings might help forecasters identify the pre-extratropical transition environment, leading to earlier diagnosis and better public advisories. NUCAPS soundings, AIRS soundings, NOAA G-IV GPS dropwindsondes, and the AM RGB were analyzed leading up to and during Arthur’s tropical to extratropical transition. The presentation will focus on the use of NUCAPS in concert with the AM RGB product to analyze Arthur’s extratropical transition for use in NWS operations.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges facing atmospheric and climate science is understanding the impacts human activities have on the natural environment and atmospheric chemistry. The production of condensable organic compounds due to interactions between atmospheric oxidants, nitrogenous pollutants, and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from the terrestrial biosphere can contribute significantly to the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Aerosol particles influence atmospheric radiative transfer, cloud formation, and thus atmospheric temperatures. Due to their solubility in water and adsorptive nature, hydroxylated organic nitrates (HORONO2) may contribute significantly to the formation and chemical aging of SOA, and serve as an important sink for NOx (NO+NO2). We recently observed that a monoterpene β-hydroxy-organic nitrate (C10H17NO4), produced from the OH oxidation of α-pinene in the presence of NOx, undergoes rapid processing in the aerosol phase via an acid-catalyzed and pH-dependent hydrolysis mechanism, potentially impacting SOA growth and molecular composition. Further processing in the aerosol phase via polymerization and formation of organosulfates is expected, yet studies related to product identification and their formation mechanisms are limited. In this presentation, I will discuss recent laboratory-based reaction chamber studies of gas-phase organic nitrate production, SOA formation, and acidity-dependent aerosol-phase processing of organic nitrates produced from the NO3 oxidation of γ-terpinene. This BVOC is a diolefin, which as modeling studies suggest, may be an important nighttime organic nitrate precursor. Gas-phase organic nitrate compounds resulting from NO3 oxidation were qualitatively identified applying I- chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) and quantified via calibration using synthetic standards generated in our laboratory. Aerosol-phase analysis was carried out employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-ToF-MS). The results highlight the importance of the organic nitrate-peroxy radical fate in dictating nighttime particle formation.",

These include relatively deep (~30-40 km), large slow slip events that occur about every 2 years, smaller events that locate at more intermediate depth (10-15 km) and occur more frequently (~1 per year), and very shallow events at the toe of the margin wedge that produce no discernible GPS signal on land but are detected on seafloor pressure sensors. Most of these slow slip events at the toe are accompanied by seismic tremor. Short-term, GPS only observations might have detected a few of these slow slip events; however, the longer more diverse instrument deployment was necessary to reveal their greater complexity. This demonstrates the need for a sustained, multi-instrument deployment and off-shore instrumentation at several different subduction zones, like that proposed for the Subduction Zone Observatory (SZO), to significantly advance our understanding of slow slip at convergent boundaries. Similar instrumentation to what exists in Nicoya is presently being established in the Osa-Burica region of southern Costa Rica to capture earthquake cycle deformation there. These two installations can provide a good nucleus for a larger circum-Pacific SZO effort.",

Contributions from the Fly River and small mountainous rivers to the clinoform have varied due to differing responses to rising sea levels since the last glacial maximum. Near-bed currents that advect sediment to the northeast further complicate this signal. Pairing geophysical and geochemical data from the 2004 NSF MARGINS Source-to-Sink program, we imaged clinoform architecture with CHIRP seismic profiles, identified clinoform sediment provenance, and constrained depositional timing with radiocarbon dates. Sediment provenance can be identified from higher illite:smectite and quartz:feldspar ratios in Fly River sediment than that from small mountainous rivers draining volcanoclastics. Increasing illite:smectite ratios in surficial sediment imply that the Fly River is presently building out clinoforms; however, for most of the late Holocene, the northeastern rivers contributed the bulk of the sediment. The time-lag for Fly River sediment flux to the clinoform suggests sediment storage within its wide floodplain during the rapid transgressions, compared to shorter time-lags in the small mountainous rivers during transgressions. CHIRP profiles reveal consistent patterns of oblique stacking on top of preexisting topography, creating topographic highs and intervening lows. Aggradation on topographic highs occurs during the lower-energy Monsoon season; however, this sediment is winnowed away by energetic currents during the Trade Wind season and advected to the northeast. Northeast progradation is supported by greater sediment thicknesses and accumulation rates along the northeast sides of GOP promontories. Teasing out influences of oceanographic currents can illuminate contributions of large and small-floodplain rivers in the same basin.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous distribution of solid contaminant residues in surface soils creates an unique challenge for collecting soil samples yielding representative and reproducible results. Research over the past decade involving energetic and metallic residues indicates conventional grab sampling yields unreproducible, biased, results with poor precision non-representative of site conditions. Spatially, grab sampling yields information only about the point sampled. However, risk assessment and remedial decisions are based on contaminant distribution over an area. Multiple grab samples are collected for spatial coverage with the number often based on “expert opinion”. Recent research suggests new field sampling and laboratory processing procedures encompassed in the Incremental Sampling Methodology (ISM) and incorporated into United States Environmental Protection (USEPA) Method 8330B for energetics and the update to Method 3050B for metals are necessary to overcome heterogeneity issues. The ISM approach is different from conventional grab sampling due to the focus on a spatially averaged result over a decision unit (DU) obtained by the collection of many increments using a systematic random sampling approach to form a single sample. Total precision error using ISM is typically <30%, whereas relative errors > 100% are observed between field splits and laboratory replicates with conventional grab sampling. Field splitting often employed prior to laboratory sample processing resulted in poor precision and is not recommended. Milling or grinding of soil samples is necessary to reduce the total error of the sample and to obtain acceptable precision, especially in situations where the mean contaminant concentration is expected to be near the action level or other regulatory value.",

In contrast with the rest of the country, the south has a wet, subtropical climate that permits two annual harvests (double cropping system). The soybean and/or maize (summer) and black oat and/or wheat (winter) succession is widely used by farmers in plateau areas. In river natural lowlands, the cultivation of flooded irrigated rice is common. Changes in the land use affect the carbon, water and energy balance, and crop management practices, such as fertilization, water management, harvest and crop residues have influence in carbon exchange between the crop field and the atmosphere. This study quantifies the net exchange ecosystem (NEE) between the atmosphere and the crop cultivations in this wide region of Brazil from 2010 to 2014. We use data from two micrometeorological sites: Cruz Alta, with crop rotation and Cachoeira do Sul, with rice paddy. The carbon flux was analyzed using the eddy covariance method and gap filling procedures. The annual integration of data carbon demonstrates that the agroecosystems in southern Brazil is a acting as an light atmospheric CO2 sink. However, the NEE emissions that occurred in the fallow periods contributed negatively for such annual accumulation. To reduce this loss of CO2, farmers could cultivate plants in fallow periods, because there are favorable weather conditions for growing plants year round. Additionally, other management practices can increase the influx of C, including the production of more dry matter with cover crops by improving management and the immediate harvesting of crop after physiological maturity to reduce the period between maturation and harvest.",

Nowhere has seismicity increased more than in Oklahoma, where large volumes of saline pore water are co-produced with oil and gas, then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These deeper formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although the majority of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted. To understand probability of slip on a given fault, we invert for stresses from the hundreds of M4+ events in Oklahoma for which moment tensors have been made. We then resolve these stresses, while incorporating uncertainties, on the faults from the preliminary Oklahoma fault map. The result is a probabilistic understanding of which faults are most likely active and best avoided.",

Here, we present a spatially explicit 2D model that allows us to simulate the behaviour of meteoric 10Be in the soil system. The Be2D model is then used to analyse the potential impact of human-accelerated soil fluxes on meteoric 10Be inventories. The model consists of two parts. A first component deals with advective and diffusive mobility of meteoric 10Be within the soil profile including particle migration, chemical leaching and bioturbation, whereas a second component describes lateral soil (and meteoric 10Be) fluxes over the hillslope. Soil depth is calculated dynamically, accounting for soil production through weathering and lateral soil fluxes from creep, water and tillage erosion. Model simulations show that meteoric 10Be inventories can indeed be related to erosion and deposition, across a wide range of geomorphological and pedological settings. However, quantification of the effects of vertical mobility is essential for a correct interpretation of the observed spatial patterns in 10Be data. Moreover, our simulations suggest that meteoric 10Be can be used as a tracer to unravel human impact on soil fluxes when soils have a high retention capacity for meteoric meteoric 10Be. Application of the Be2D model to existing data sets shows that model parameters can reliably be constrained, resulting in a good agreement between simulated and observed meteoric 10Be concentrations and inventories. This confirms the suitability of the Be2D model as a robust tool to underpin quantitative interpretations of spatial variability in meteoric 10Be data for eroding landscapes.",

The algorithm applies Delaunay triangulation to divide a dense sensor network into a mesh of 3-element arrays, called triads. In this study, we use infrasonic sensors in the USArray Transportable Array (TA), which comprises 400 stations deployed in a Cartesian grid with an average interstation spacing of 70 km. At this density, infrasound waveforms are incoherent between the sensors within each triad so the data are transformed into envelopes, which are cross-correlated to find signals consistent with infrasound propagation. The propagation azimuth, phase velocity and signal arrival time are computed for each signal. Triads with signals that are consistent with a single source are grouped as a cluster. The ensemble of arrival times and azimuths of detected signals within a cluster are used to locate a common source in space and time. In this study a total of 513 infrasonic stations that were active for part or all of 2013 were divided into over 2,000 triads. Low (.5-2 Hz) and high (2-8 Hz) catalogs of infrasonic events were created for the eastern United States. The low-frequency catalog includes over 900 events and reveals several highly active source areas on land corresponding to coal mining regions. The high-frequency catalog includes over 2,000 events, with most occurring offshore. Most events are clearly anthropogenic as they occur during regular working hours each week. The regions to which the TA is most sensitive vary seasonally, with the direction of reception dependent on the direction of zonal winds. The catalog reveals large acoustic events that may provide useful insight into the nature of long-range sound propagation in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Natural geothermal systems, which are used for energy generation, are usually associated with high seismic activity. This can be related to the large-scale injection and extraction of fluids to enhance geothermal recovery. This results in the changes of the pore pressure and pore-elastic stress field and can stimulate the occurrence of earthquakes. These systems are also prone to triggering of seismicity by the passage of seismic waves generated by large distant main shocks. In this study, we analyze clustering and triggering of seismicity at several geothermal fields in California. Particularly, we consider the seismicity at the Geysers, Coso, and Salton Sea geothermal fields. We analyze aftershock sequences generated by local large events with magnitudes greater than 4.0 and earthquake swarms generated by several significant long distant main shocks. We show that the rate of the aftershock sequences generated by the local large events in the two days before and two days after the reference event can be modelled reasonably well by the time dependent Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. On the other hand, the swarms of activity triggered by large distant earthquakes cannot be described by the ETAS model. To model the increase in the rate of seismicity associated with triggering by large distant main shocks we introduce an additional time-dependent triggering mechanism into the ETAS model. In almost all cases the frequency-magnitude statistics of triggered sequences follow Gutenberg-Richter scaling to a good approximation. The analysis indicates that the seismicity triggered by relatively large local events can initiate sequences similar to regular aftershock sequences. In contrast, the distant main shocks trigger swarm like activity with faster decaying rates.",

Throughout the Late Pleistocene, the coral and speleothem based data sets become more incomplete and reliable dated sea-level points, though showing the general amplitude of sea-level changes, are insufficient to establish the exact pattern and timing of millennial-scale changes.\nTo gain further insight into glacial-interglacial sea level variations throughout the Late Pleistocene, we generated a new benthic δ18O record of IODP Site U1386 in the Gulf of Cadiz for the past ~ 570 kyr. Site U1386 is located within the Gulf of Cadiz Contourite Depositional System (CDS). These sediments are characterized by high sedimentation rate (~35 cm/kyr), providing a unique opportunity to study sea level oscillations in high resolution. To estimate ice volume and deep-water temperature changes we used an inverse forward modeling approach based on our benthic δ18O data. The coupled model includes four ice-sheet-shelf components that simulate glaciation on Eurasia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica, thereby explicitly accounting for all individual ice-volume contributions throughout the investigated time period.\nOur initial findings suggest that older glacial periods were characterized by repeated and substantial δ18O enrichment events preceding their respective glacial maximum. We argue that the observed δ18O enrichment events are not an expression of local hydrographic changes of salinity and/or temperature limited to the Gulf of Cadiz but probably relate to global ice volume changes. In this regard, our results contrast estimates derived from the global mean benthic δ18O LR04 stack. On a regional scale, our results show similarities to recently published sea-level estimates from the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea.\nThe in-depth correlation of our initial findings with existing open ocean and regional sea level estimates for the last ~ 570 kyr provides new insights into the sea level evolution on glacial-interglacial timescales.",

Current sensors are able to detect the majority of explosive volcanic activity; those that tend to effect and represent larger scale changes in the volcanic systems, eventually relating to ash producing periods of extended eruptive activity, and effusive activity. As new spaceborne sensors are developed, the ability to detect activity improves so that a system to gauge the frequency of volcanic activity can be used as a useful monitoring tool.\nFour volcanoes were chosen for development and testing of a method to monitor explosive activity: Stromboli (Italy); Shishaldin and Cleveland (Alaska, USA); and Karymsky (Kamchatka, Russia). Each volcano studied had similar but unique signatures of pre-cursory and eruptive activity. This study has shown that this monitoring tool could be applied to a wide range of volcanoes and still produce useful and robust data. Our method deals specifically with the detection of small scale explosive activity.\nThe method described here could be useful in an operational setting, especially at remote volcanoes that have the potential to impact populations, infrastructure, and the aviation community. A number of important factors will affect the validity of application of this method. They are: (1) the availability of a continuous and continually populated dataset; (2) appropriate and reasonable sensor resolutions; (3) a recorded history of the volcano’s previous activity; and, if available, (4) some ground-based monitoring system. We aim to develop the method further to be able to capture and evaluate the frequency of other volcanic processes such as lava flows, phreatomagmatic eruptions and dome growth and collapse. The work shown here has served to illustrate the capability of this method and monitoring tool for use at remote, un-instrumented volcanoes.",

These instruments typically use nitrate to chemically ionize clusters for detection. In this study, we compare measured cluster concentrations formed by reacting sulfuric acid vapor with dimethylamine, ethylene diamine, tetramethylethylene diamine, or butanediamine (also known as putrescine) using nitrate and acetate ions. We show from flow reactor measurements that nitrate is unable to chemically ionize clusters with weak acidities. In addition, we vary the ion-molecule reaction time to probe the chemical ionization processes and lifetimes of ions composed of sulfuric acid and base molecules. We then model the neutral and ion cluster formation pathways, including chemical ionization, ion-induced clustering, and ion decomposition, to better identify which cluster types cannot be chemically ionized by nitrate. Our results show that sulfuric acid dimer with two diamines and sulfuric acid trimer with 2 or more base molecules cannot be chemical ionized by nitrate. We conclude that cluster concentrations measured with acetate CI gives a better representation of both cluster abundancies and their base content than nitrate CI.",

The Arctic region has warmed approximately twice as much as the global average, due to a number of feedback mechanisms related to energy partitioning, most importantly the snow and ice-albedo feedback.\nHowever, direct measurements of surface energy budgets in the Arctic are scarce, especially for the cold and dark winter period and over transects going from the ice sheet and glaciers to the sea. This study aims to describe annual cycles of the surface energy budget from various surface types in Arctic Greenland; e.g. glacier, snow, wet and dry tundra and sea ice, based on data from a number of measurement locations across coastal Greenland related to the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) program, including Station Nord/Kronprins Christians Land, Zackenberg/Daneborg, Disko, Qaanaq, Nuuk/Kobbefjord and Upernaviarsuk.\nBased on the available time series, we will analyze the sensitivity of the energy balance partitioning to variations in meteorological conditions (temperature, cloudiness, precipitation). Such analysis would allow for a quantification of the spatial variation in the energy exchange in aforementioned Arctic environments. Furthermore, this study will identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps in Arctic energy budgets and related climate feedback effects.",

            "abstract": "Interpretation of seismic reflection data from the western Chukchi Borderland has illuminated the structure and stratigraphy of the area. Basement rotated fault blocks are offset by two border fault systems (BFS1 and BFS2) and by secondary faults, striking curvilinear in the NW-SE direction, dipping to the NE. The BFS1 dissects the Chukchi Plateau into two first-order rotated blocks bounding two major sedimentary depocentres, the North Chukchi Basin and the Chukchi Plateau Central Basin. The BFS2, which has a larger offset than BFS1, forms the western boundary of the Northwind Basin.\nMuch of the stratigraphy is controlled by sediment supply. The basins were starved early in their history, resulting in a limited syn-rift section. Substantial sediment accumulation in the Borderland appears to post-date large scale progradation of the depostional shelf edge across the Chukchi Shelf. Basin infill stratigraphies are subdivided into pre-rift, syn-rift, early-, middle-, late post-rift, and glacio-marine sequences (SB1-SB5). SB1 shows truncation of the remnants of the pre-rift strata below and onlap of the syn-rift sequence(s) above; the SB2 marks the termination of the rifting stage and is bounded by bi-directional onlap surface of the early post-rift strata above; the base of SB3 is an onlap surface marks the arrival of the prograding shelf margin sequence(s); the SB4 shows evidence of erosion at the base of the prograding late post-rift sequence(s); and the SB5 is an downloap surface marking the first arrival of the glacio-marine sediments eroded from the Chukchi Shelf. Two ages of the major sequence boundaries, the SB3 and SB4, can be directly tied to Popcorn and Crackerjack Chukchi Shelf well data, and the older ones, the end of rifting and the top of the pre-rift, are inferred based on stratigraphic observations. The stratigraphic relationship suggests that the Chukchi Borderland stratigraphy can be correlated in part to the Chukchi Shelf stratigraphy.\nThe first and second-order rotated fault blocks and depositional history suggest that the Chukchi Borderland has been coupled to the Chukchi Shelf at least since the extension of the Borderland. Therefore we infer only small horizontal offsets between the Chukchi Borderland and the Chukchi Shelf, which have largely a shared geologic history.",

            "abstract": "Satellite microwave radiometers have been in continuous operation since 1987. When inter-calibrated and consistently processed, the data from a series of DMSP SSM/I and SSMIS sensors, TRMM TMI, Coriolis WindSat, Aqua AMSR-E, GCOM-W1 AMSR2, and GPM GMI collectively result in a long-term high-quality ocean data set of surface winds, atmospheric water vapor, cloud liquid water content, rain rate, and for some instruments, sea surface temperature and wind direction. Slight variations in frequencies, design and satellite orbits stress the need for carefully implementing an inter-calibration method, so as not to introduce trends or jumps when new instruments begin or when old instruments drift and/or die. The authors have developed a robust inter-calibration method using a published, well-developed and validated radiative transfer model (RTM) as the calibration standard. Most of the sensor data for this nearly 30-year period are available as the Version-7 RTM standard. The GMI sensor, recently launched in 2014, has strict calibration accuracy requirements and was built to have greater precision than any previous microwave sensor. We have utilized the dual calibration and non-linearity-measurement systems built into GMI to improve the RTM, which is now Version-8. In this talk we will present an overview of our calibration procedures and outline the steps required to produce climate quality earth data records. We also intend to present the latest validation results and provide information on recent changes in distribution, format, and availability for these already-popular data products.",

The DAS array recorded ground motions every one meter of optical cable that was arranged approximately in the shape of a rectangle with dimensions of 160 m by 80 m. The long dimension of the array was adjacent to a state highway. Three hours of record were used to compute noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs) in one-minute windows. The trace from each sensor channel was pre-processed by downsampling to 200 Hz, followed by normalization in the time-domain and bandpass filtering between 2 and 20 Hz (Bensen et al., 2007). The one-minute NCFs were then stacked using the time-frequency domain phase-weighted stacking method (Schimmel & Gallart, 2007). The NCFs between channels were asymmetrical reflecting the direction of traffic noise. The group velocities were found using the frequency-time analysis method. The energy was concentrated between 5 and 15 Hz, which falls into the typical traffic noise frequency band. The resulting velocities were between 100 and 300 m/s for frequencies between 10 and 20 Hz, which are in the same range as described in the results for surface-wave dispersion obtained using an active source for the same site (Lancelle et al., 2015). The group velocity starts to decrease for frequencies greater than ~10 Hz, which was expected on the basis of a previous shear-wave velocity model (Steidl et al., 1996). Then, the phase velocity was calculated using the multichannel analysis of surface wave technique (MASW - Park et al., 1999) with 114 NCFs spaced one meter apart. The resulting dispersion curve between 5 and 15 Hz gave phase velocities that ranged from approximately 170 m/s at 15 Hz to 250 m/s at 5 Hz. These results are consistent with other results of active-source DAS and seismometer records obtained at the Garner Valley site (e.g., Stokoe et al. 2004). This analysis is part of the PoroTomo project (Poroelastic Tomography by Adjoint Inverse Modeling of Data from Seismology, Geodesy, and Hydrology,\nhttp://geoscience.wisc.edu/feigl/porotomo\n).",

In order to understand the dynamics and variability of surface ozone, it is imperative to analyze individual sources, interactions between sources, transport, and chemical processes of ozone production and accumulation. Biomass burning and wildfires have been known to emit a suite of particulate matter and gaseous compounds into the atmosphere. These compounds, such as, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides are precursor species which aid in the photochemical production and destruction of ozone. The Colorado Front Range (CFR) is a region of complex interactions between pollutant sources and meteorological conditions which result in the accumulation of ozone. High ozone events in the CFR associated with fires are analyzed for 2003-2014 to develop understanding of the large scale influence and variability of ozone and wildfire relationships. This study provides analysis of the frequency of enhanced ozone episodes that can be confirmed to be transported within and affected by the fires and smoke plumes. Long-term records of surface ozone data from the CFR provide information on the impact of wildfire pollutants on seasonal and diurnal ozone behavior. Years with increased local fire activity, as well as years with increased long-range transport of smoke plumes, are evaluated for the effect on the long-term record and high ozone frequency of each location. Meteorological data, MODIS Fire detection images, NOAA HYSPLIT Back Trajectory analysis, NOAA Smoke verification model, Fire Tracer Data (K+), RAQMS Model, Carbon Monoxide data, and Aerosol optical depth retrievals are used with NOAA Global Monitoring Division surface ozone data from three sites in Colorado. This allows for investigation of the interactions between pollutants and meteorology which result in high surface ozone levels.",

The overarching goal of our work is to examine the interactions among carbon cycling, land use, and climate change in a human-dominated, mixed land use region that includes urban, suburban, agriculture, and forest land uses. We combine field measurements of carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O), an improved process-based biogeochemical model - DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition) designed to predict C fluxes and trace gas emissions, and historical and projected land use change data derived from Landsat imagery and cellular automata/agent-based modeling. Our specific objectives designed to achieve the overarching goal are to: (1) Measure C pools and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in urban, suburban, agricultural, and forested landscapes; (2) Improve and parameterize the DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition) model and validate model predictions; (3) Develop historical land use change data for the last three decades from Landsat imagery and projections of future land use change; (4) Generate spatially continuous predictions of C pools and greenhouse gas emissions using Urban-DNDC and assess how land use interacts with C cycling and climate change and how future land use change will influence carbon sequestration potential within these complex landscapes. Our results will have implications for crafting effective land management policies that balance C sequestration and climate mitigation with food production, forest resources and many other services that these landscapes provide.",

However, few studies show the quantitative analysis of water balance or basin-scale hydrological modeling in Northeast Africa. The NASA Land Information System (LIS) is implemented to simulate land surface processes in the Nile River Basin and the Greater Horn of Africa. In this context, the Noah land surface model (LSM) and the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HYMAP) are used to reproduce the water budget and surface water (rivers and floodplains) dynamics in that region. The Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) meteorological dataset is used to force the system . Due to the unavailability of recent ground-based observations, satellite data are considered to evaluate first model outputs. Water levels at 10 Envisat virtual stations and water discharges at a gauging station are used to provide model performance coefficients (e.g. Nash-Sutcliffe, delay index, relative error). We also compare the spatial and temporal variations of flooded areas from the model with the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)’s MEaSUREs Wetland data. Finally, we estimate surface water storage variations using a hypsographic curve approach with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) topographic data and evaluate the model-derived water storage changes in both river and floodplain.

On Earth the role of carbon involved in volcanic outgassing is strongly influenced by tectonic setting, with the greatest weight percent contributions coming from partial mantle melts associated with hot spot volcanism. Most martian volcanic centers appear to represent this style of volcanism. Thus, one important factor in understanding the martian carbon cycle through time is understanding this volatile’s link to the planet’s volcanic history.\n  The identified volcanic constructs on Mars are not unlike those of the Earth suggesting similar magmatic and eruptive processes. However, the dimensions of many martian volcanic features are significantly larger. The distribution of volcanoes and volcanic deposits on Mars are not spatially or temporally uniform. Large volcanoes (> 100 km diameter) are spatially concentrated in volcanic provinces that likely represent focused upwellings or zones of crustal weakness that enabled magma ascension. Smaller (10s km diameters) volcanoes such as cones, low shields and fissures are often grouped into fields and their lava flows coalesce to produce low slope plains. In some cases plains lava fields are quite extensive with little to no evidence for the volcanic constructs. Although martian volcanism appears to have been dominated by effusive eruptions with likely contributions from passive degassing from the interior, explosive volcanic centers and deposits are known to exist. After the development of a martian crust the planet’s volcanic style appears to have evolved from early explosive activity to effusive activity centered at major volcanoes to effusive distributed activity in fields. However, questions remain as to whether or not these styles significantly overlapped in time and if so, why? As scientists continue to learn more about carbon’s role in terrestrial volcanism, it is reasonable to question how and how much carbon was involved in different styles of martian volcanic activity and how carbon and other volatiles have affected the martian atmosphere and climate through time.",

            "abstract": "The Southwest Partnership on Carbon Sequestration is performing seismic based characterization and monitoring activities at an active CO2 EOR project at Farnsworth Field, Texas. CO2 is anthropogenically sourced from a fertilizer and an ethanol plant. The field has 13 CO2 injectors and has sequestered 302,982 metric tonnes of CO2 since October 2013. The field site provides an excellent laboratory for testing a range of monitoring technologies in an operating CO2 flood since planned development is sequential and allows for multiple opportunities to record zero CO2 baseline data, mid-flood data, and fully flooded data. The project is comparing and contrasting several scales of seismic technologies in order to determine best practices for large scale commercial sequestration projects. Characterization efforts include an 85 km2 3D surface seismic survey, baseline and repeat 3D VSP surveys centered on injection wells, cross-well tomography baseline and repeat surveys between injector/producer pairs, and a borehole passive seismic array to monitor induced seismicity.\nAll surveys have contributed to detailed geologic models which were then used for fluid flow and risk assessment simulations. 3D VSP and cross-well data with repeat surveys have allowed for direct comparisons of the reservoir prior to CO2 injection and at eight months into injection, with a goal of imaging the CO2 plume as it moves away from injection wells. Additional repeat surveys at regular intervals will continue to refine the plume. The goal of this work is to demonstrate seismic based technologies to monitor CO2 sequestration projects, and to contribute to best practices manuals for commercial scale CO2 sequestration projects. In this talk the seismic plan will be outlined, progress towards goals enumerated, and preliminary results from baseline and repeat seismic data will be discussed.\nFunding for this project is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy under Award No. DE-FC26-05NT42591.",

            "abstract": "Many of the world’s major groundwater aquifers are rapidly depleting due to unsustainable groundwater pumping, while demand for food production – and therefore demand for irrigation water ­– is increasing. While it is likely that groundwater users will be impacted by the future’s inevitable reduction in groundwater availability, there is a major gap in our understanding of potential impacts downstream of pumping sites. Due to inefficiencies in irrigation systems, significant amounts of abstracted groundwater become runoff, entering surface waters and flowing downstream to be re-abstracted and used again. In this study, we use a gridded water balance model to calculate the amount of unsustainably pumped groundwater that enters surface water systems by way of irrigation runoff, and quantify the additional irrigation water supplied by the re-use of this water. We assess the global budget of unsustainable groundwater sources and sinks, including downstream re-use, groundwater recharge, and flow to the oceans.\nGlobally, we find that 80% of unsustainable groundwater is re-abstracted for irrigation either downstream or locally from groundwater recharge. This re-abstracted water contributes the water equivalent needed to irrigate 200,000 km2 of cropland globally. Including irrigation runoff reuse in an assessment of irrigation efficiency, we see that the traditional concept of irrigation efficiency (net irrigation/gross irrigation) significantly overestimates water “waste”. We define a basin efficiency for unsustainable groundwater use that includes re-use, and see that while global irrigation efficiency is often estimated at 50%, global average unsustainable water use efficiency is > 60%. Losing this re-use resource by increasing irrigation efficiency does little to alleviate unsustainable groundwater demands.",

Currently, saturation of the firn is assumed to be 100% (Koenig et. al., 2014; Forster et. al., 2014), and using a firn density correction this saturation level drives the present liquid water volume estimate (140±20 Gt) of the Greenland firn aquifer (Koenig et. al., 2014). Based on earlier studies on mountain glacier firn aquifers, we suspect that saturation levels vary with depth, annual precipitation patterns, and local topography (Fountain, 1989; Christianson et. al., 2015). Refining the liquid water volume estimation is an important parameter as it allows for a better determination of the amount of water potentially available for release and consequent sea level rise, as well as to better model glacial processes such as englacial flow, crevasse fracture, and basal lubrication.\nGPR and GPS data collected along a 2.6 km transect in 2011, 2013, and 2014 in southeastern Greenland is used to measure the spatial and temporal variability of saturation levels within the aquifer. A bright reflector seen in the GPR at the water table depth responds to local topography. At surface lows, the reflector rises, intersecting annual density change layers visible in the GPR data. At these intersections, the annual layers deflect down beneath the water table before being lost due to signal attenuation. We assume that this deflection is due to a change in dielectric permittivity, and that by measuring the angle of deflection, and implementing a mixing model and density correction from nearby firn cores, we can determine the saturation level at each point along a deflection. This allows us to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of saturation within the firn aquifer.",

While isoprene oxidation is the source of a large fraction of the organic mass in biogenic SOA formation over forested regions, few ambient measurements of the isoprene-derived products exist at sufficient time-resolution to fully parameterize the dynamic reactions in the particle phase. We deployed the Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph (SV-TAG) during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in the Southeastern U.S. in summer 2013 and during the wet and dry seasons of the Green Ocean Amazon experiment (GoAmazon 2014/5) in central Amazonia. Both field campaigns were located in isoprene-rich forested regions under the varying influence of anthropogenic pollution. We measured oxidation products at the molecular level, including 2-methyl tetrols, C5-alkene triols, and 2-methyl glyceric acid in the gas and particle phases at hourly time resolution. Using supporting measurements of particle composition (e.g. sulfate) and modelled liquid water content, we compare the relative contribution of these tracers to the particle-phase across these regions and explore possible parameterizations that can be used for modeling SOA formation from isoprene.",

            "abstract": "The Ste. Genevieve Fault Zone (SGFZ) runs from SE Missouri into SW Illinois, in the cratonic platform of North America. This NW-trending, 190 km-long belt separates the Illinois Basin from the Ozark Dome and has served as a tectonically significant crustal boundary throughout the Phanerozoic. Data obtained from OIINK (part of EarthScope), a seismometer array that extended from the central Ozark Plateau into Kentucky, indicates that the SGFZ is more seismically active than previously recognized. A subsurface DEM of the Great Unconformity (the contact between Precambrian basement and Paleozoic strata) shows that the fault zone roughly overlies 7 km of structural relief. Interpretation of OIINK data shows that there are likely deeper crustal manifestations of the SGFZ. A recompilation of surface geological mapping of the SGFZ, coupled with new mapping of structures exposed in roadcuts along the NE corner of the Ozark Plateau, suggests that the SGFZ is a broader structure than previously observed. The complex configuration of fault traces supports a model in which the fault zone has accommodated more than one phase of transpressional and transtensional reactivation during the Phanerozoic. The SGFZ includes many splays, some of which die out up-dip in monoclinal folds whose traces control local topography. The facing of the folds indicates that some of these splays dip northeast, though the pattern of regional uplift, by analogy to uplift in the Colorado Plateau, suggests that the master fault of the SGFZ dips southwest. This association supports models in which synthetic and antithetic splays of the SGFZ locally delineate positive flower structures. LIDAR-based maps suggest the plateau was rejuvenated after the establishment of meandering streams, for a set of incised meanders serve as the local base level for subsequent dendritic drainage networks. The landscape therefore may have been affected by a phase of post-Paleozoic uplift, a hypothesis currently being tested by U/Th-He thermochronology.",

This study aims to quantify changes in precipitation intensities at different temporal scales across agricultural regions of the U.S. during the last 4-5 decades. The USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) experimental watersheds, now largely part of the LTAR network, have a unique long-term and high-resolution precipitation measurement dataset that permit a detailed analysis of storm characteristics. We begin the multi-site evaluation at a semi-arid watershed in southern Arizona, the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed LTAR, and a humid watershed, the Mahantango Creek Watershed (Upper Chesapeake Bay LTAR), in eastern Pennsylvania. Changes in sub-daily precipitation intensities for durations ranging from 2 minutes to daily are analyzed with an over-the-threshold approach. A Generalized Pareto distribution function is used to compare precipitation intensities for different return periods.

            "abstract": "The hydroxyl radical is universally recognized as the dominant oxidizing species in the earth’s atmosphere. OH initiates the chemical transformation and degradation of greenhouse gases, pollutants, and volatile organic compounds and plays a critical role in both urban ozone pollution and aerosol formation. Because of its high reactivity, OH radicals have an atmospheric lifetime of less than a second and only reach mixing ratios of parts per trillion (ppt) in the free troposphere. The combination of these two factors makes in-situ observations of OH challenging. Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) is a highly sensitive technique that has been successfully applied to measurements of stratospheric OH. The LIF technique has also been adapted to instrumentation for OH observations in the troposphere. However, results for tropospheric OH have been inconclusive due to poorly understood interferences, and large discrepancies exist between modeled and measured OH concentrations. A Two-Photon LIF (TP-LIF) technique has been proposed as a means of enhancing sensitivity by shifting to lower-energy pumping frequencies, which also minimizes laser-induced interference pathways. In this detection scheme, OH is pumped into an excited vibrational state and subsequently pumped into an excited electronic\nstate. A major limitation in the sensitivity of the TP-LIF detection scheme has been the lack of a mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source with enough power to adequately pump the vibrational transition. We have developed a high-power, pulsed laser system at 2.97 μm using an optical parametric generator (OPG). The OPG system delivers narrow-linewidth, tunable radiation with high peak-power to substantially populate the vibrational excitation. The development of the OPG laser system effectively addresses the major challenge in the TP-LIF detection of OH.",

Cloud seeding enriches orographic super cooled liquid water layers with plumes of ice nuclei, increasing the water yield of a storm event. Weather model assessments of cloud seeding estimate controlled releases of the ice nucleating agent, silver iodide (AgI), increases snow precipitation between 3-15% annually. However, efficacy of cloud seeding programs are difficult to assess using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models alone. Therefore, this study validated the spatial and temporal distribution of AgI predicted by WRF models using ultra-trace snow chemistry data collected in the target area.\nField methods utilized in this study are unique to previous trace chemical assessments of cloud seeding in two ways. First, nearly all snow samples were collected within 24 hours of deposition. Focusing on freshly deposited snow was more effective at constraining AgI plume timing and spatial extent with greater precision (via WRF, SNOTEL, and chemistry data). Second, this study employed geostatistics to describe AgI variability on the pit scale, site scale, and regional scale to optimize on the amount of samples to collect. The analysis revealed 4 columns of vials per snow pit and 1 snow pit per sampling site are optimal. Identifying the seeding signature at the regional scale was also successfully accomplished over a 40 mile sampling transect. All 6 sites had an identical AgI seeding signature despite drastic differences in of canopy cover, aspect, and distance from AgI source. The furthest sites from the AgI source were difficult to identify with Ag concentrations alone. Therefore, enrichment factors were essential to locating AgI influence at the most distal sites.",

In particular, the 10-fold elevation during the southern winter indicates episodic sources of methane that are yet to be discovered. Using the temperature and humidity measurements from the rover, we find that perchlorate salts in the regolith deliquesce to form liquid solutions, and deliquescence progresses to deeper subsurface in the season of the methane spikes. We therefore formulate the following three testable hypotheses as an attempt to explain the apparent variability of the atmospheric methane abundance. The first scenario is that the regolith in Gale Crater adsorbs methane when dry and releases this methane to the atmosphere upon deliquescence. The adsorption energy needs to be 36 kJ mol-1 to explain the magnitude of the methane spikes, higher than laboratory measurements. The second scenario is that microorganisms exist and convert organic matter in the soil to methane when they are in liquid solutions. This scenario does not require regolith adsorption. The third scenario is that deep subsurface aquifers sealed by ice or clathrate produce bursts of methane as a result of freezing and thawing of the permafrost, as the terrestrial arctic tundra. Continued monitoring of methane by Curiosity will test the existence of the near-surface reservoir and its exchange with the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Effects of hydraulic redistribution (HR) on the hydrological cycle and ecosystem dynamics have been demonstrated in the field, but few modeling studies have compared HR’s influences on the carbon cycle in different ecosystems and climate regions. The soil moisture changes associated with HR could influence plant carbon gain via two mechanisms: (1) improved plant water status supporting stomatal opening, and/or (2) enhanced nutrient availability to plants caused by enhanced soil microbial activity. In this study, using a modified version of the Community Land Model with Century-based soil carbon pool kinetics that includes the “Ryel et al. 2002” scheme for hydraulic redistribution (HR), the influence of HR on the carbon flux and storage is investigated at four Ameriflux sites where HR was detected from soil moisture measurements. The study sites include a Douglas-fir site (US-Wrc) in Washington State with a mediterranean climate, a savanna site (US-SRM) in Arizona with a semi-arid climate, an oak/pine forest site (US-SCf) in Southern California with a mediterranean climate, and an evergreen broadleaf forest site (BR-Sa1) with tropical monsoon climate. Simulations revealed that HR tended to enhance plant growth at all four sites, and incorporating HR into CLM4.5 reduces the temporal fluctuation of soil carbon storage at all four sites. Simulations with HR can capture the net carbon exchange between ecosystem and the atmosphere (NEE) at the US-Wrc, US-SRM, and BR-Sa1 sites over the annual cycle. Incorporation of HR into CLM4.5 clearly improved the weekly and sub-daily NEE simulation during dry periods at US-SCf and BR-Sa1 site. HR-induced increase in Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at the US-Wrc and US-SRM sites was driven approximately equally by the two distinct mechanisms we investigated: increased stomatal conductance and increased nutrient availability to plants.",

            "abstract": "Assuming that methane and its higher chain homologues derive from a common source, carbon isotope patterns have been applied as a criterion to identify occurrences of abiogenic hydrocarbons. Based on these, it has been postulated that abiogenic hydrocarbon production occurs within several (ultra)mafic environments.\nMore evolved volcanic-hydrothermal systems may also provide all the prerequisites necessary for abiogenic hydrocarbon production, such as availability of inorganic CO2, hydrogen and heat. We have investigated the chemical and isotopic composition of n-alkanes contained within subaerial hydrothermal discharges emitted from a range of hot spot, subduction and rift-related volcanoes to determine the origin of hydrocarbons in these systems. Amongst these are Nisyros (Greece), Vesuvio, Campi Flegrei, Ischia, Pantelleria and Vulcano (all Italy), Mt. Mageik and Trident (USA), Copahue (Argentina), Teide (Spain), Furnas and Fogo (Portugal).\nThe carbon isotopic composition of methane emitted from these sites varies from -65 to -8‰ , whereas δ13C of ethane and propane exhibit a much narrower variation from -17‰ to -31‰. Methane that occurs most enriched in 13C is also characterized by relatively positive δD values ranging up to -80‰. Carbon isotope reversals between methane and ethane are only observed for locations exhibiting δ13C-CH4 values > -20‰, such as Teide, Pantelleria, Trident and Furnas. At Furnas, δ13C-CH4 varies by 50‰ within a relatively short distance of <50m between two vents, whereas δ13C-C2H6 varies by less than 2‰ only. For some of the investigated locations apparent carbon isotopic temperatures between methane and CO2 are in agreement with those derived from gas concentration geothermometers. At these locations methane, however seems to be in disequilibrium with ethane and propane. These findings imply that methane on the one hand and the C2+ hydrocarbons on the other hand often might derive from distinct sources.",

            "abstract": "The earthquake hazard mitigation goal is to reduce losses due to severe natural events. The first step is to conduct a Seismic Risk Assessment consisting of 1) hazard estimation, 2) vulnerability analysis, 3) exposure compilation. Seismic hazards include ground deformation, shaking, and inundation. The hazard estimation may be probabilistic or deterministic. Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) is generally applied to site-specific Risk assessments, but may involve large areas as in a National Seismic Hazard Mapping program. Deterministic hazard assessments are needed for geographically distributed exposure such as lifelines (infrastructure), but may be important for large communities. Vulnerability evaluation includes quantification of fragility for construction or components including personnel. Exposure represents the existing or planned construction, facilities, infrastructure, and population in the affected area. Risk (expected loss) is the product of the quantified hazard, vulnerability (damage algorithm), and exposure which may be used to prepare emergency response plans, retrofit existing construction, or use community planning to avoid hazards. The risk estimate provides data needed to acquire earthquake insurance to assist with effective recovery following a severe event. Earthquake Scenarios used in Deterministic Risk Assessments provide detailed information on where hazards may be most severe, what system components are most susceptible to failure, and to evaluate the combined effects of a severe earthquake to the whole system or community. Casualties (injuries and death) have been the primary factor in defining building codes for seismic-resistant construction. Economic losses may be equally significant factors that can influence proactive hazard mitigation. Large urban earthquakes may produce catastrophic losses due to a cascading of effects often missed in PSHA. Economic collapse may ensue if damaged workplaces, disruption of utilities, and resultant loss of income produces widespread default on payments. With increased computational power and more complete inventories of exposure, Monte Carlo methods may provide more accurate estimation of severe losses and the opportunity to increase resilience of vulnerable systems and communities.",

Both simulations include soil organic matter and use a deep soil configuration for better representation of permafrost. Interactive phenology is represented in CRCM5 by means of the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM), which is coupled to the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). Previous offline simulations of CTEM coupled to CLASS, driven by reanalysis data, show that these models have significant skill in simulating carbon pools and fluxes, as well as permafrost extent and active layer thickness.\nThe performance of the CRCM5 simulations is first assessed by comparing simulated fields, e.g. 2m temperature, precipitation, snow water equivalent, leaf area index, primary productivity, soil carbon and permafrost, to observation-based datasets. The impact of interactive phenology on the simulated land surface and climate is then assessed by focusing on the biophysical feedbacks. The differences in the representation of interannual variability are also analyzed in order to quantify the added value of interactive phenology.",

Historically, it was the most productive fish and wildlife habitat in the region\n[BP1]\n and as such, traditional livelihoods in the local Cree and Métis community were supported by a flourishing fur trade, dense moose populations, and commercial and subsistence fisheries. But water resource development upstream has truncated flood peaks and introduced hydro-peaking with adverse consequences for biological production and these livelihoods. Local science and traditional knowledge, combined with a growing wealth of western science measurements are painting a picture of long-term ecological change. Remote sensing techniques coupled with hydrometric data show strong correlations between surface water coverage area and in-channel flow, thus enabling backcasting and forecasting of inundation patterns. The implications of losses of hydrological connectivity are evaluated using environmental DNA and stable isotope markers of fish movement and avian origins, with a focus on species that are most important for the economy and culture of the delta’s people. The work aims to contribute to the setting of environmental flows and the re-licensing of major dams in 2015, as well as to support the development of a community-led water stewardship planning process that is now underway, with a goal of identifying threats to the delta and to make recommendations on threat mitigation. This presentation will describe how this community-informed, interdisciplinary approach aims to understand linkages between water, wildlife and people in this vital ecosystem.\n [BP1]In what region?

The efficiency of in-situ remediation efforts that target hydraulically connected and dead-end fracture zones is limited, in part, due to the diffusion of aqueous phase contaminants into and out of the less-mobile pore spaces in the matrix surrounding fractures. Two geophysical technologies, complex resistivity (CR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are sensitive to pore geometry and may provide key information on transport parameters where diffusion can be a limiting factor in and around boreholes. We present laboratory CR and NMR data from cores collected from field sites with variable lithologies and examine the sensitivity of these measurements to less-mobile versus mobile porosity. Supporting data include surface area measurements using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, pore size distributions from mercury porosimetry, gravimetric measurements of matrix total porosity and gas permeability. We examine the predictive capability of CR and NMR to determine these pore scale properties as a function of geological setting. The petrophysical relationships illustrate the potential for use of new borehole logging tools to determine the spatial variability of physical properties controlling mass transfer close to fractures. The correlations of measurements to rock-type specific relations indicate that minimal core measurements might be needed to calibrate the results to a specific site.",

UNAVCO already produces hydrological models from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), estimating the elastic loading from surface water at GPS coordinates for stations and processed by the GAGE Analysis Center. GLDAS incorporates satellite and ground observations into forcing parameters to be used for climate and weather models. The GLDAS forcing parameters include temperature, humidity, precipitation, radiation, wind, and pressure data at global 1º grid squares, excluding the oceanic surface. NLDAS uses the same set of forcing parameters but in an area restricted to the continental United States plus parts of Canada and Mexico and with a 0.125º grid. Research groups contribute Land Surface Models (LSMs) based on NLDAS or GLDAS to produce time series of modeled environmental parameters. Individual LSMs differ based on model equations and soil and vegetation properties. In this study we extract the parameters from the NLDAS LSMs to produce hydrologic displacement models at GPS station coordinates within the conterminous US. We check whether NLDAS displacement models can resolve regional variations due to topography that are smoothed in the GLDAS models. We compare the soil moisture, snowpack, and vegetation mass per area directly between the GLDAS and NLDAS LSMs, to see whether the mass variations between GLDAS and NLDAS are large enough to cause significant deformation changes. By comparing the hydrologic displacement models with GPS time series, we estimate how well the surface water loading predicts observed seasonal and secular GPS signals as opposed to tectonic signals. These comparisons will help us evaluate the NLDAS-derived displacement models as part of the process of developing a new model product for use in time series analysis, tectonic or hydrologic studies, and reference frame evaluations.",

This ranking was based on the EPA Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model using the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program. The metals foundry identified in the report as the leading contributor to the poor air quality at Chapman currently meets its Title V permit and reports these permitted emissions to the TRI program. However, the poor air quality ranking is based on models that rely on emissions from permits and are not necessarily reflective of actual emissions. Several observational approaches were employed to assess the potential source contributors to air quality at Chapman. Two MiniVol Tactical Air Samplers (TAS) were co-located 1km from the facility at Chapman Elementary to sample according to the EPA six-day monitoring schedule for one year, filters were analyzed for mass and metals via XRF. Ogawa NO2 samplers were placed at various points around the Chapman neighborhood to develop an NO2 high-density measurement campaign to assess pollutant transport. In addition, a novel mobile environmental odor diaries app was developed and deployed to collect and geo-locate resident observation of odors. All observations were analyzed through mapping, dispersion modeling (AERMOD) and positive-matrix-factorization (PMF) analysis. This multi-dimensional analysis is designed to provide a framework for future studies to address increasing citizen concern about neighborhood level pollution.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are geomorphic structures located in ecotone environments such as lagoon and estuaries, providing lot of ecosystem services to local population. In the last decades they are disappearing due to several factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and edge erosion due to surface waves. The latter is likely the chief mechanism modeling marsh boundaries and leading to the loss of wide marsh areas. In the case of the Venice Lagoon, from the beginning of the last century, the whole salt marsh surface has more than halved and trends indicate that the salt marshes might completely disappear over the next 50 years.\nHere, we present a field monitoring activity on a retreating salt marsh located in the north part of the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The marsh is subject to North-East (Bora) wind. Marsh area loss during the last decades has been documented through the comparison of georeferenced aerial photographs showing a retreat rate of the order of 1 m/year.\nField measurements started by the end of November 2013 and consist of: salt marsh bank geometry at different cross-sections and wave climate in the lagoon about 30 m in front of the salt marsh. Erosion data are obtained by means of erosion pins located horizontally on the marsh scarp; at higher banks (about 0.9 m), two pins are located along the same vertical direction, for lower banks (about 0.4 m), only one pin is employed. Significant wave height has been measured during three storm surges by means of pressure transducers.\nThe measured wave climate in front of the bank was then put into relationship with the offshore wave climate estimated using wind data (intensity and direction) and bathymetric data. Wind intensity and direction is measured hourly by several measurement stations located in the Lagoon of Venice. In this way, it is possible to extrapolate wave climate hourly at the monitored marsh and calculate the wave power that acted on the bank in a given time interval.\nField survey revealed that the main retreating mechanisms are particle by particle erosion alternated to cantilever failures. Preliminary results show a linear relationship between erosion rate and wave energy flux and the existence of a critical threshold for the onset of erosion. Moreover, these relationships appears to much more severe than the one previously proposed in the literature.",

            "abstract": "This work studies the parameter uncertainty on tropical cyclone (TC) simulations in Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) using the Reed-Jablonowski TC test case, which is illustrated in Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). It examines the impact from 24 parameters across the physical parameterization schemes that represent the convection, turbulence, precipitation and cloud processes in AGCMs. The one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis method first quantifies their relative importance on TC simulations and identifies the key parameters to the six different TC characteristics: intensity, precipitation, longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCF), shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF), cloud liquid water path (LWP) and ice water path (IWP). Then, 8 physical parameters are chosen and perturbed using the Latin-Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method. The comparison between OAT ensemble run and LHS ensemble run shows that the simulated TC intensity is mainly affected by the parcel fractional mass entrainment rate in Zhang-McFarlane (ZM) deep convection scheme. The nonlinear interactive effect among different physical parameters is negligible on simulated TC intensity. In contrast, this nonlinear interactive effect plays a significant role in other simulated tropical cyclone characteristics (precipitation, LWCF, SWCF, LWP and IWP) and greatly enlarge their simulated uncertainties. The statistical emulator Extended Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (EMARS) is applied to characterize the response functions for nonlinear effect. Last, we find that the intensity uncertainty caused by physical parameters is in a degree comparable to uncertainty caused by model structure (e.g. grid) and initial conditions (e.g. sea surface temperature, atmospheric moisture). These findings suggest the importance of using the perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) method to revisit tropical cyclone prediction under climate change scenario.",

            "abstract": "The 2009 Karonga earthquakes occurred in an area where active faults had not previously been known to exist. Over 5000 buildings were destroyed in the area and at least 4 people lost their lives as a direct result of the 19th of December magnitude 6.2 earthquake. The earthquake swarms occurred in the hanging wall of the main Livingstone border fault along segmented, west dipping faults that are synthetic to the Livingstone fault. The faults have a general trend of 290-350 degrees. Electrical resistivity surveys were conducted to investigate the nature of known rupture and seismogenic zones that resulted from the 2009 earthquakes in the Karonga, Malawi area. The goal of this study was to produce high-resolution images below the epicenter and nearby areas of liquefaction to determine changes in conductivity/resistivity signatures in the subsurface. An Iris Syscal Pro was utilized to conduct dipole-dipole resistivity measurements below the surface of soil at farmlands at 6 locations. Each transect was 710 meters long and had an electrode spacing of 10 meters. RES2DINV software was used to create 2-D inversion images of the rupture and seismogenic zones. We were able to observe three distinct geoelectrical layers to the north of the rupture zone and two south of the rupture zone with the discontinuity between the two marked by the location of the surface rupture. The rupture zone is characterized by ~80-meter wide area of enhanced conductivity, 5 m thick underlain by a more resistive layer dipping west. We interpret this to be the result of fine grain sands and silts brought up from depth to near surface as a result of shearing along the fault rupture or liquefaction. Electrical resistivity surveys are valuable, yet under-utilized tools for imaging near-surface effects of earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming is expected to have considerable impact on the regional water balance of high latitude Arctic and sub-Arctic glacerized watersheds. In this study we combine field observations and the physically based Water Balance Simulation Model WaSiM to refine our understanding of the linkages between glaciers, permafrost and hydrology at two nearby basins with contrasting precipitation regimes: Jarvis Cr. watershed (630 km2) on the north (rain-shadow) side of Eastern Alaska Range and the south facing Phelan Cr. (32 km2), which include the US Geological Survey benchmark site Gulkana Glacier. Both are characterized by a semi-arid climate and are sub-watersheds of the Tanana River basin (12,000 km2). Our research questions include: How has glacier water storage and release varied in the past and how are they expected to change in the future? And what are the subsequent effects on lowland runoff and regional groundwater recharge? Our analyses show i) an increase in air temperature and summer warmth index (the sum of all mean monthly air temperature above 0 °C) in recent decades and ii) a continued negative glacier mass balance. Our findings suggest that, on the larger spatial scale (Tanana River basin), the reduced glacier coverage and increased glacier wastage has, in combination with limited changes in precipitation, lead to (i) increased mean annual and (ii) late winter (March) runoff. We postulate that this is due to increased groundwater recharge, which has been fueled by the 20% reduction in glacier coverage of the Tanana River basin. Here we aim to assess the combined effect of climate change, glacier shrinkage and thawing permafrost on the regional sub-arctic mountain- to lowland hydrologic system, which may transition into a regime with less surface and more subsurface water availability.",

            "abstract": "Driven by an increase in extreme weather events in a warming world, flooding appears to be increasing in many regions. Since 2012, we have been using the twice-daily near-global observations of the two MODIS instruments to operate a near real-time flood mapping capability. Primarily intended to support disaster response efforts, our system generates daily near-global maps of flood water extent, at 250 m resolution. Although cloud cover is a challenge, the twice-daily coverage from the Terra and Aqua satellites helps to capture most major events. We use the MOD44W product (the \"MODIS 250-m land-water mask\") to differentiate \"normal\" water from flood water. Products from the system are freely available, and used by disaster response agencies and academic and industry researchers.\nAn open question, however, is: how \"normal\" are recently observed floods? Destructive and — as reported by the press — record floods seem to be occurring more and more frequently. With the MODIS archive going back to 1999 (Terra satellite) and 2002 (Aqua satellite), we now have more than a decade of twice-daily near-global observations to begin answering this question. Although the 13 years of available twice-daily data (2002-2015) are not sufficient to fully characterize surface water normals (e.g., 100-year floods), we can start examining recent trends in surface water extent and flood frequency.\nTo do so, we have back-processed our surface water product through mid-2002 (Aqua launch) for a few regions, and have used this to evaluate the variability in surface water extent and flood frequency. These results will eventually feed back into an improved characterization of flood water in our near real-time flood product. Here we will present results on trends in surface water extent and flood frequency for a few regions, including the Indus in Pakistan, the Tonle Sap lake in Cambodia, and lake Chad in Africa.",

            "abstract": "For many large river basins, especially in Africa, the lack of access to in-situ measurements, and the large areas involved, make modelling of water storage and runoff difficult. However, remote sensing datasets are useful alternative sources of information, which overcome these issues. In this study, we focus on the Congo Basin and, in particular, the cuvette central. Despite being the second largest river basin on earth and containing a large percentage of the world’s tropical wetlands and forest, little is known about this basin’s hydrology.\nCombining discharge estimates from in-situ measurements and outputs from a hydrological model, we build the first large-scale hydrodynamic model for this region to estimate the volume of water stored in the corresponding floodplains and to investigate how important these floodplains are to the behaviour of the overall system. This hydrodynamic model covers an area over 1.6 million square kilometres and 13 thousand kilometres of rivers and is calibrated to water surface heights at 33 virtual gauging stations obtained from ESA’s Envisat satellite.\nOur results show that the use of different sources of discharge estimations and calibration via Envisat observations can produce accurate water levels and downstream discharges. Our model produced un-biased (bias =-0.08 m), sub-metre Root Mean Square Error (RMSE =0.862 m) with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 80% (NSE =0.81). The spatial-temporal variations in our simulated inundated areas are consistent with the pattern obtained from satellites. Overall, we find a high correlation coefficient (R =0.88) between our modelled inundated areas and those estimated from satellites.",

            "abstract": "Complex hydrologic models are commonly used as computational tools to assess and quantify fluxes at the land surface and for forecasting and prediction purposes. When estimating water and energy fluxes from vegetated surfaces, the equations solved within these models require that multiple input parameters be specified. Some parameters characterize land cover properties while others are constants used to model physical processes like transpiration. As a result, it becomes important to understand the sensitivity of output flux estimates to uncertain input parameters. The active subspace method identifies the most important direction in the high-dimensional space of model inputs. Perturbations of input parameters in this direction influence output quantities more, on average, than perturbations in other directions. The components of the vector defining this direction quantify the sensitivity of the model output to the corresponding inputs. Discovering whether or not an active subspace exists is computationally efficient compared to several other sensitivity analysis methods. Here, we apply this method to evaluate the sensitivity of latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes from the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM). Of the 19 input parameters used to specify properties of a grass covered surface, between three and six parameters are identified as important for heat flux estimates. Furthermore, the 19-dimenision input parameter space is reduced to one active variable and the relationship between the inputs and output fluxes for this case is described by a quadratic polynomial. The input parameter weights and the input-output relationship provide a powerful combination of information that can be used to understand land surface dynamics. Given the success of this proof-of-concept example, extension of this method to identify important parameters within the transpiration computation will be explored.",

While δ13C measurement can provide information on the sources of the CO2, be it photosynthesis, natural gas combustion, other fossil fuel sources, landfills or other sources, δ18O, and δ17O are thought to be determined by the hydrological cycling of the CO2. Though researchers have called for analytical tools for CO2 isotope measurements that are reliable and field-deployable, developing such instrument remains a challenge.   \nThe carbon dioxide isotope analyzer developed by Los Gatos Research (LGR) uses LGR’s patented Off-Axis ICOS (Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy) technology and incorporates proprietary internal thermal control for high sensitivity and optimal instrument stability. This new and improved analyzer measures CO2 concentration as well as δ13C, δ18O, and δ17O from CO2 at natural abundance (150-2500 ppm). The laboratory precision is ±200 ppb (1σ) in CO2 at 1 s, with a long-term (2 min) precision of ±20 ppb. The 1-second precision for both δ13C and δ18O is 0.7 ‰, and for δ17O is 1.8 ‰. The long-term (2 min) precision for both δ13C and δ18O is 0.08 ‰, and for δ17O is 0.18 ‰. The instrument has improved precision, stability and user interface over previous LGR CO2 isotope instruments and can be easily programmed for periodic referencing and sampling from different sources when coupled with LGR’s multiport inlet unit (MIU).\nWe have deployed two of these instruments at two different field sites, one at Twitchell Island in Sacramento County, CA to monitor the CO2 isotopic fluxes from an alfalfa field from 6/29/2015-7/13/2015, and the other at the Wind River Experimental Forest in Washington to monitor primarily the oxygen isotopes of CO2 within the canopy from 8/4/2015 through mid-November 2015. Methodology, laboratory development and testing and field performance are presented.   ",

            "abstract": "The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta (GBMD), an archetypal tidally-influenced deltaic margin, has been the subject of several multi-national, multi-institutional, and interdisciplinary field studies over the past several years, resulting in an unprecedented density of data coverage for stratigraphy, hydrodynamics, and tectonics on a scale previously only found on well-studied delta systems of other types (e.g., Nile, Mississippi, Rhine-Meuse). Using a suite of geochemical, geophysical, and lithologic data extracted from a network of over 400 shallow (<100m) boreholes, the rich Holocene evolution of the Bengal Basin has been illuminated. Provenance of pre- to early-Holocene sediments suggests the position of the Brahmaputra River was once west of its modern location, following a course along the eastern edge of the Tista Fan and west of the modern confluence with the Ganges. Construction of the modern delta, consisting of a thick (up to 80 m) succession of fluvial and deltaic sediments, was initiated by an intensified summer monsoon, coincident with accommodation generated by rapid sea-level rise following the Younger-Dryas. Sediment delivery has been focused along three pathways associated with antecedent topography inherited from Pleistocene lowstands. Stacked channel sands are the predominant facies within the upper delta, grading to isolated sand lenses in the distal reaches of Sylhet Basin, indicative of a shift from a highly mobile braidbelt to a less mobile distributary system as bedload is extracted to deposition. Episodic avulsions of the Brahmaputra River into Sylhet Basin during the mid-Holocene have been documented using a robust radiocarbon geochronology. The volume of sediment preserved from these events is insufficient to account for the entire sediment budget based on estimates of modern discharge, likely a consequence of both a weakened mid-Holocene monsoon and bypass out of the basin. Rapid (up to 7 mm/yr) subsidence in Sylhet Basin has not acted as an attractor for channel steering during much of the Holocene. Instead, the Brahmaputra has followed the steepest descent path associated with flexural loading downstream of the hinge zone along the modern braidbelt.",

However, they are a key element of the water, energy, and carbon balance and abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. Ponds and lakes have been subject to both wetting and drying in a warming climate yet studies remain ambivalent regarding the causes of these changes. Goals of this study are to (i) investigate the variability of water body size distributions as a function of landscape characteristics, and (ii) assess the vulnerability of water bodies in different landscapes to scenarios of wetting and drying. Ponds and lakes were mapped from high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with resolutions of 4 m or better in 14 regions in Alaska, Canada, and Siberia covering a total area of ca. 1.6*104 km². Whereas lake distributions are similar, pond distributions in our study regions vary significantly with the area-normalized number of ponds differing up to 3 orders of magnitude. Landscape characteristics that may explain the current water body distributions include climate (eg., precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature), permafrost (eg., ground ice content, maximum thaw depth) and terrain characteristics (eg., topography, glaciation, landscape age) which we derive from in situ, remote sensing and modeling data sources. Multivariate regression analysis are used to relate landscape characteristics to distribution parameters. This study for the first time allows to quantify the circum-arctic variability of pond distribution. The current maps are the start of a high-resolution circum-arctic water body inventory and present a baseline for future surface inundation mapping and modelling. We present representative regional probability density functions (pdf) and assess the potential to upscale pdfs using spatial landscape characteristics. We then discuss the vulnerability of water bodies to wetting or drying based on the distribution parameters, their correlation with landscape characteristics and the likeliness of both to change in different future climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Sinters are sedimentary, siliceous deposits, and are common in geothermal areas. Formation occurs in two steps. Hot water circulates underground, and dissolves silica from the host rock. Silica then precipitates at the surface as water is discharged from hot springs. Extensive sinter formations are linked to up-flow areas of fluids originated in high temperature (>175 °C) reservoirs. Sinter samples provide a guide for geothermal and epithermal ore deposit exploration. Fluid geochemistry, microbial communities, and environmental conditions of deposition determine the texture of sinter. To better understand the water balance in geothermal systems, and interpret geophysical observations, we studied 21 samples of modern geyserite sinter deposits (<10,000 years) from an active geothermal field located in the north of Chile, El Tatio. We measured the physical properties (hydraulic, seismic, and electrical), and internal micro-structure (using X-Ray micro- tomography). The pore structure, and thus hydraulic and physical properties, are controlled by the distribution of microbial matter. Based on velocity-porosity relationships, permeability-porosity scaling, and image analysis of the 3D pore structure, we find that the sinter more closely resembles vesicular volcanic rocks than clastic sedimentary rocks.",

At mid-IR wavelengths, the salt-bearing deposits display a blue slope superimposed on the regional regolith spectral shape. At VNIR wavelengths, ratio spectra display a featureless red slope between 1.0 and 2.5 µm and a reduced 3 µm band, indicating that the deposits are desiccated compared to the surrounding terrain.\nIn this work, we compare laboratory and model spectra to THEMIS spectra to evaluate the abundance and physical properties of salt in these deposits. We acquired mid-IR emissivity spectra of a suite of halite/basalt mixtures separated to <10 µm, 63-90 µm, 125-180 µm, and 250-355 µm. Halite concentrations for each size separate ranged from 1-75%. Laboratory spectra of the coarsest particulates do not adequately reproduce the spectral shapes associated with any of the Martian salt deposits. The finest particulates display spectral characteristics associated with salt deposits found in high albedo, dusty regions of Mars, and those in the middle size ranges are consistent with the spectra of most Martian salt deposits and suggest abundances between 10 and 25 wt.% salt. The increase in salt content from ~10-25% coincides with a shift in the THEMIS emissivity maximum from band 3 to band 4, suggesting this can be used as a rough indicator of salt content in remote sensing studies.\nWe also used a hybrid T-matrix/Hapke light scattering model to model the scattering properties and mid-IR spectra of clusters of salt/silicate spheres. The model results show that as halite content is increased, the transparency of the cluster increases substantially, resulting in multiple internal scattering, and substantially reduced emissivity, consistent with the THEMIS data and laboratory spectra. Phase function changes associated with increased halite abundance result in the cluster being slightly less forward scattering, which also contributes to the observed spectral changes.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of low-permeability, hydrocarbon-rich shales has recently become an important energy source in the United States. However, hydrocarbon recovery rates are low and drop rapidly after a few months. Hydraulic fracture fluids, which contain dissolved oxygen and numerous organic additives, induce dissolution and precipitation reactions that change the porosity and permeability of the shale. To investigate these reactions, we studied the interactions of four shales (Eagle Ford, Barnett, Marcellus, and Green River) with a simulated hydraulic fracture fluid in batch reactors at 80 °C. The shales were chosen for both economic viability and chemical variety, allowing us to explore the reactivities of different components. The Eagle Ford shale is carbonate rich, and the Green River shale contains significant siderite and kerogen. The Barnett shale also has a high organic content, while the Marcellus shale has the highest fractions of clay and pyrite. Our experiments show that hydrochloric acid in the fluid promotes carbonate mineral dissolution, rapidly raising the pH from acidic to circumneutral levels for the Eagle Ford and Green River shales. Dissolution textures in the Green River shale and large cavities in the Barnett shale indicate significant mineralogical and physical changes in the reacted rock. Morphological changes are not readily apparent in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales. For all shales, ongoing changes to the solution Al: Si ratio suggest incongruent aluminosilicate dissolution. Siderite or pyrite dissolution occurs within days and is followed by the formation of secondary Fe precipitates in suspension and coating the walls of the reactor. However, little evidence of any coatings on shale surfaces was found. The net effect of these reactions on porosity and permeability and their influence on the long-term efficacy of oil and gas recovery after hydraulic fracturing are critical to the energy landscape of the United States.",

            "abstract": "Stream restoration projects strive to improve water quality and degraded habitat, yet restoration projects often fall short of achieving their goals. Hyporheic exchange facilitates biogeochemical interaction which can contribute to positive water quality and habitat, but there are limited data on how restoration affects hyporheic processes. Hyporheic flowpaths can be altered by the processes and products of stream restoration, as well as the transport of fine sediment through the stream bed post-restoration. In two northeastern Ohio headwater streams, variations in hydraulic conductivity and pore water chemistry were monitored following restoration, as measures of hyporheic functioning. A second-order stream restored in August 2013, had a slight decrease in average hydraulic conductivity but an increase in heterogeneity from pre-restoration to four months post-restoration. Data collected 10 and 15 months post-restoration show continued declines in hydraulic conductivity throughout large constructed riffles. These piezometers also indicate dominance of downwelling throughout the riffles with only isolated upwelling locations. Grain size analysis of freeze cores collected in streambed sediments show differences suggesting fluvial transport and sorting have occurred since construction was completed. Pore water sampled from piezometers within the riffles had Mn2+ concentrations ten times higher than surface water, suggesting redox transformations are occurring along hyporheic flowpaths. A first-order stream reach, immediately downstream of a dam, restored in April 2014 had no significant change in average hydraulic conductivity between 1 and 2 months post-restoration, but many individual piezometers had increases of over 100% in high gradient positions or decreases of over 50% in low gradient positions. Changes in hydraulic conductivities in both restored streams are thought to be an adjustments from disturbance to a new dynamic equilibrium influenced by the morphology and sediment regime established by restoration, suggesting these are important processes to consider in the design of such projects.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015_AGU.pdf\nHeterogeneous land surface conditions are essential components of land-atmosphere interactions in regions of complex terrain and have the potential to affect convective precipitation formation. Yet, due to their high complexity, hydrologic processes over mountainous regions are not well understood, and are usually parameterized in simple ways within coupled land-atmosphere modeling frameworks. With the improving model physics and spatial resolution of numerical weather prediction models, there is an urgent need to understand how land surface processes affect local and regional meteorological processes. In the North American Monsoon (NAM) region, the summer rainy season is accompanied by a dramatic greening of mountain ecosystems that adds spatiotemporal variability in vegetation which is anticipated to impact the conditions leading to convection, mountain-valley circulations and mesoscale organization. In this study, we present results from a detailed analysis of a high-resolution (1 km) land surface model, Noah-MP, in a large, mountainous watershed of the NAM region – the Rio Sonora (21,264 km2) in Mexico. In addition to capturing the spatial variations in terrain and soil distributions, recently-developed features in Noah-MP allow the model to read time-varying vegetation parameters derived from remotely-sensed vegetation indices; however, this new implementation has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we assess the simulated spatiotemporal fields of soil moisture, surface temperature and surface energy fluxes through comparisons to remote sensing products and results from coarser land surface models obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System. We focus attention on the impact of vegetation changes along different elevation bands on the diurnal cycle of surface energy fluxes to provide a baseline for future analyses of mountain-valley circulations using a coupled land-atmosphere modeling system. Our study also compares limited streamflow observations in the large watershed to simulations using the terrain and channel routing when Noah-MP is run within the WRF-Hydro modeling framework, with the goals of validating the rainfall-runoff partitioning and translating the spatiotemporal mountain processes into improvements in streamflow predictions.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow modeling is highly complex. Beyond the identification and mapping of dominant runoff processes to mathematical models, additional challenges are posed by the switching of dominant streamflow generation mechanisms temporally and dynamic catchment responses to precipitation inputs based on antecedent conditions. As a result, model calibration is required to obtain parameter values that produce acceptable simulations of the streamflow hydrograph. Typical calibration approaches assign equal weight to all observations to determine the best fit over the simulation period. However, the objective function can be biased toward (i.e., implicitly weight) certain parts of the hydrograph (e.g., high streamflows). Data transformations (e.g., logarithmic or square root) scale the magnitude of the observations and are commonly used in the calibration process to reduce implicit weighting or better represent assumptions about the model residuals. Here, we consider a time domain data transformation rather than the more common data domain approaches. Flow-corrected time was previously employed in the transit time modeling literature. Conceptually, it stretches time during high streamflow and compresses time during low streamflow periods. Therefore, streamflow is dynamically weighted in the time domain, with greater weight assigned to periods with larger hydrologic flux. Here, we explore the utility of the flow-corrected time transformation in improving model performance of the Catchment Connectivity Model. Model process fidelity was assessed directly using shallow groundwater connectivity data collected at Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest. Our analysis highlights the impact of data transformations on model consistency and parameter sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Northern high-latitudes (NHLs) regions are estimated to contain half of world’s soil carbon and the dynamics of soil carbon fluxes in these regions will likely impact the global climate. However, the dynamics of soil carbon fluxes in these regions is likely to be significantly altered by increasing temperatures, resulting in a positive feedback on future climate. Processes that are most likely to generate strong carbon cycle feedbacks through redistribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration (e.g., cryoturbation and dissolved organic carbon movement) and subsequently change soil thermal and hydraulic dynamics are poorly represented in Earth system models (ESMs) and thus have not been well-studied. We will present a multi-layer soil biogeochemical model that was implemented into a land surface model, the Integrated Science and Assessment Model (ISAM), to explicitly represent vertical heterogeneity of SOC profiles due to cold region processes and their impacts on soil thermal and hydraulic properties. The newly implemented ten-layer soil biogeochemical model, which extends down to 3.5 meters, includes two types of physical processes for estimating SOC distribution with depth: 1) diffusion, representing SOC movements through bioturbation/cryoturbation, and 2) convection, which describes SOC movements in the liquid phase. Soil type-dependent diffusion and advection rates applied in this model were calibrated and validated using SOC profile data from across the Pan-arctic region. The resulting calibrated and validated coupled model was also driven by future climate projections from CMIP5 output at different sites with varying soil types to study the impact of future climate change on SOC storage.",

Measurements of water vapor isotopic composition can provide quantitative constraints on these processes. We developed a stochastic model that parameterizes water vapor isotopic composition in terms of these processes and fit the model parameters to data from the Chajnantor Plateau, Chile (23S). The results show that the observed moistening in 2014, relative to 2012, required increases in both the last-saturation mixing ratio and the post-condensation moistening and illustrate the utility of isotopic measurements for constraining the processes governing the humidity of the troposphere.",

A series of climate downscaling experiments are conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 1 km horizontal resolution for a hot period with strong lake breeze. The study examines the impacts of land use data assimilation for initialization of the regional climate model, the role of urbanization on UHI and the lake breeze, and the effects of sub-grid scale land cover variability on urban predictions. Comparisons of simulations with station observations and MODIS satellite data show that the WRF model, with modifications, is able to replicate the measured surface temperature and wind speeds reasonably well. Variation of near surface temperatures was significant during nighttime, when the UHI was pronounced, and the inclusion of sub-grid scale variability of landuse in sub-urban areas improved the near surface temperatures predictions. The results show that representing surface characteristics with better detail and model initialization with reliable land surface observational data yield more accurate near surface temperatures and wind speeds.",

CHORDS addresses the ever-increasing importance of real-time scientific data in the geosciences, particularly in mission critical scenarios, where informed decisions must be made rapidly. Access to constant streams of real-time data also allow many new transient phenomena in space-time to be observed, however, much of these streaming data are either completely inaccessible or only available to proprietary in-house tools or displays. Small research teams do not have the resources to develop tools for the broad dissemination of their unique real-time data and require an easy to use, scalable, cloud-based solution to facilitate this access. CHORDS will make these diverse streams of real-time data available to the broader geosciences community.\nThis talk will highlight a recently developed CHORDS portal tools and processing systems which address some of the gaps in handling real-time data, particularly in the provisioning of data from the “long-tail” scientific community through a simple interface that is deployed in the cloud, is scalable and is able to be customized by research teams. A running portal, with operational data feeds from across the nation, will be presented. The processing within the CHORDS system will expose these real-time streams via standard services from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) in a way that is simple and transparent to the data provider, while maximizing the usage of these investments. The ingestion of high velocity, high volume and diverse data has allowed the project to explore a NoSQL database implementation. Broad use of the CHORDS framework by geoscientists will help to facilitate adaptive experimentation, model assimilation and real-time hypothesis testing.",

The data for this whole period has been recently reprocessed with the new fully polarimetric version (v620) of the Level-1 processor which also includes refined calibration schema for the antenna losses. This reprocessing has allowed the assessment of an improved performance benchmark.\nThe long term drift exhibited by the previous processor version has been significantly mitigated thanks to a better calibration of the antenna losses and the use of only the most accurate Noise Injection Radiometer. These improvements have also reduced the orbital and seasonal variations, although residual drifts still remain, in particular during the satellite eclipse season. The spatial tilt existing in the images produced with the previous version of the Level-1 processor has been considerably decreased, removing the negative trend at low incidence angles and reducing the overall standard deviation of the spatial ripples. The expected improvement in the 3rd and 4th Stokes, after correcting the use of the cross-polar antenna patterns, has been confirmed, enabling accurate retrieval of the Faraday rotation angle. Finally, a better Sun and RFI flagging strategy has been implemented, allowing for the removal of the corrupted data. A problem which still persist in the new Level-1 data is the land-sea contamination. However, recent progress in the calibration investigations has shed new light on the origin of the land-sea contamination, linking it to visibility amplitude calibration errors. Thus, future versions of the Level-1 processor will have very much reduced land-sea contamination.\nAn overview of the results and the progress achieved in both calibration and image reconstruction will be presented in this contribution.",

In these investigations fluid flow is restricted to two-dimensions allowing for real time visualization and quantification of complex flow and reactive transport behavior, which is difficult to obtain in other experimental systems. One drawback to these studies is the use of engineered materials that do not faithfully represent the rock properties (e.g., porosity, wettability, roughness, etc.) encountered in subsurface formations. In this work, we describe a unique high pressure (up to 1500 psi) and temperature (up to 80 °C) microfluidics experimental system in which we investigate fluid flow and transport in geo-material (e.g., shale, Portland cement, etc.) micromodels. The use of geo-material micromodels allows us to better represent fluid-rock interactions including wettability, chemical reactivity, and nano-scale porosity at conditions representative of natural subsurface environments. Here, we present experimental results in fracture systems with applications to hydrocarbon mobility in hydraulically fractured shale. Complex fracture network patterns are derived from 3D x-ray tomography images of actual fractures created in shale rock cores. We use both shale and glass micromodels, allowing for a detailed comparison between flow phenomena in the different materials. We discuss results from two-phase huff-and-puff experiments involving N2 and n-Decane, as well as three-phase displacement experiments involving supercritical CO2, brine, and n-Decane.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_7.pdf\nThe South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which extends southeastward from New Guinea to Tahiti, is the largest perennial rainfall feature in the Southern Hemisphere. The position of the SPCZ and its associated rainfall varies significantly on multidecadal timescales, as documented by instrumental and climate proxy data. For example, stalagmite δ18O records (rainfall proxy) from Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu (Partin et al., 2013) and Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands (Maupin et al., 2014), document large (~1‰), abrupt changes in stalagmite δ18O on multidecadal timescales over the past 600 years that arise from internal variability in the climate system. The proxy data agree with the type of rainfall changes observed in the instrumental record, such as the change across 1976/77, but the older changes are larger in relative magnitude.\nWe expand on these earlier studies of rainfall variability in the SPCZ system using stable isotope variations in stalagmites from two other locations in the Solomon Islands (Munda, New Georgia, 8.3°S, 157.3°E; Suku, Nggela Pile (9.8° S, 160.2° E). These stalagmites range in age from about 400 CE to 1850 CE, based on U-Th dating, and have relatively fast growth rates (60 to 300 µm/yr). Stalagmite δ18O time series were generated from sub-samples milled every 500 µm, or approximately 1 to 8 years per data point. Initial results from these two new Solomon Island stalagmites not only confirm the presence of multidecadal variability in stalagmite δ18O identified in previous studies, but suggest that the same amplitude of variability has occurred over several windows of time during the past 1600 years. When complete, these new proxy rainfall records from Munda and Suku will further constrain the pattern and mechanism of SPCZ rainfall variability in western tropical Pacific region.",

The conjunctive management objectives are to maximize groundwater withdrawals and maximize reservoir storages while satisfying water demands and raising groundwater level to a target level. The decision variables in the management problem are reservoir releases and spills, network flows and groundwater pumping rates. Using the fractional programming approach, the objective function is defined as a ratio of total groundwater withdraws to total reservoir storage deficits from the maximum storages. Maximizing this ratio function tends to maximizing groundwater use and minimizing surface water use. This study introduces a conditional constraint on groundwater head in order to sustain aquifers from overpumping: if current groundwater level is less than a target level, groundwater head at the next time period has to be raised; otherwise, it is allowed to decrease up to a certain extent. This conditional constraint is formulated into a set of mixed binary nonlinear constraints and results in a mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming (MINLFP) problem. To solve the MINLFP problem, we first use the response matrix approach to linearize groundwater head with respect to pumping rate and reduce the problem to an MILFP problem. Using the Charnes-Cooper transformation, the MILFP is transformed to an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The solution of the MILP is successively updated by updating the response matrix in every iteration. The study uses IBM CPLEX to solve the MILP problem. The methodology is applied to water resources management in northern Louisiana. This conjunctive management approach aims to recover the declining groundwater level of the stressed Sparta aquifer by using surface water from a network of four reservoirs as an alternative source of supply.",

            "abstract": "Thermal springs in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, provide geochemical evidence for deeply circulated hydrothermal fluids that carry significant mantle-derived helium. The Cordillera Blanca is a ~200 km-long NNW-SSE trending mountain range in the Peruvian Andes located above an amagmatic flat-slab subduction segment. The west side of the range is bounded by the Cordillera Blanca detachment that preserves a progression of top to the west ductile shear to brittle normal faulting since ~5 Ma. We report aqueous and stable isotope geochemical results from fluid and gas samples collected in 2013 and 2015 from 13 hot springs emanating from the Cordillera Blanca detachment and associated hanging wall faults. Most springs are vigorously bubbling (degassing), and range in temperature, pH, and conductivity from 17-89 °C, 5.95-8.87, and 0.17-21.5 mS, respectively. The hottest springs issue directly from the northern segment of the detachment. Geochemically, springs are CO2-rich, alkaline-chloride to alkaline-carbonate waters, with elevated trace metal contents including Fe, Cu, As, Zn, Sb, and Tl. Notably, As contents are ≤11 ppm, indicating that thermal waters may be adversely impacting local water quality. Water δ18O and δD, trends in elemental chemistry, and cation geothermometry collectively demonstrate mixing of hot (200–260 °C) saline fluid with cold meteoric recharge along the fault. Helium isotope ratios (3He/4He) for dissolved gases in the hot springs range from 0.62 to 1.98 RC/RA, indicating the presence of ~25% mantle–derived helium, assuming mixing of an asthenospheric end-member with the crustal helium reservoir. CO2/3He and carbon stable isotope ratios indicate a carbon source derived from mixing of crustal sources with minor mantle carbon. Overall, the volatile signature overlaps with orogen-wide datasets where crustal overprinting has modified mantle contributions at active arc volcanoes. Given the long duration since active magmatism in the Cordillera Blanca region, we suggest that mantle helium was mobilized from the continental mantle-lithosphere by metasomatic fluids derived from slab dehydration. These spring data thus reveal a mantle to surface connection and highlight the role of detachment faults in compressional orogens for fluid transfer in the crust.",

Combined with existing detrital zircon age data from potential source areas, zircon grains at different ages can be assigned different origins. Using the zircon age distribution pattern of all samples on the NTP plain as one end member, that on the GAMs plain as another, and those from the North China Craton (NCC) as a third, the mixing ratio of the three deposits could be calculated. Following this, deposits in the Tengger Desert, Mu Us sand field and CLP are divided into different groups by different sources. Tengger Desert sediments are mainly made of sediments from GAM plain, except for thoes on the southern edge, which are mainly influenced by sediments from the NTP plain. Sediments in the northeast Mu Us sand field are largely from NCC material and those in the southwest are mainly from the NTP plain. Moreover, we estimate that at least more than 60% of Quaternary loess materials on the CLP probably originate from the materials on the NTP plain.

            "abstract": "Climate is intrinsically multivariate—the collective influence of various aspects of weather at different times of year. A central challenge of climate change impact analysis is therefore to characterize changes in multiple temperature and precipitation variables simultaneously. Historical climate variability provides key context for relating climate variables to each other and assessing collective deviations from historical climate conditions. We have developed a Mahalanobian probability metric to describe spatial and temporal climatic dissimilarity in terms of local interannual climatic variability. Our approach is particularly suited to evaluation of climate analogs in space and time, but also facilitates multivariate extensions to several prominent indices of climate change. We use this metric to detect the departure of multivariate climate conditions from the historical range of local variability across North America and to identify regions that are particularly susceptible to emergence of no-analog climates. With respect to interpreting climate extremes, some critical considerations emerge from this research. In particular, we highlight the potential for temporal aggregation to exaggerate the statistical significance of extreme conditions, and the dilemma of identifying an appropriate statistical distribution for precipitation across both space and time. Despite the challenges of interpreting the specific impacts associated with multivariate climate changes and extremes, expressing these conditions relative to historical climate variability provides a useful first approximation of their ecological and socioeconomic significance.\nFigure Caption: Demonstration of the use of the chi distribution to measure spatial climatic dissimilarity in terms of local interannual climatic variability.",

Satellite-derived surface variable fields, sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface height (SSH) and sea-surface salinity (SSS), along with gridded vertical profiles of temperature (T) and salinity (S) from ARGO, are used as signatures of upper-ocean dynamics. The NN technique employs adaptive weights that are tuned using statistical learning (training) algorithms applied to past data sets, providing robustness with respect to random noise, accuracy, fast emulations, and fault-tolerance. This study uses Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ocean color fields, satellite SSS/SSH/SST fields, and gridded vertical profiles of temperature (T) and salinity (S) from ARGO. All data sets were interpolated to the same spatial (one-degree latitude-longitude) grid and temporal resolution (daily) for 2012-2014. The NN technique is trained for two years and tested on the remaining year; however, by rotating the time series, we are able to cover all three years. The NN output are assessed for bias, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and cross-correlations; and a Jacobian is evaluated to estimate the impact of each input (SSH, SSS, SST, T and S) on the NN ocean color estimates. The differences between results from an ensemble of NNs versus a single NN are examined. After training the NN for the VIIRS period, the NN is retrospectively applied to 2005-2012 data, a period covered by other satellite ocean color missions — the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS AQUA) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS).",

Considerable progress has been made to reduce the overall uncertainty of mass balance assessments. Here, we address the uncertainty in runoff production, which is of the largest remaining uncertainty in ice sheet mass balance. Runoff model outputs are difficult to evaluate due to a lack of in-situ monitoring networks. We document the uncertainty in runoff and how it varies spatially by comparing runoff products from different regional climate models (RCM) with two other sets of observations: 1) GRACE regional time series calculated using a least-squares mascon approach and corrected for regional ice discharge - with an emphasis on regions where ice dynamics is less significant: southwest and north Greenland; 2) At the smaller scale, NASA IceBridge and ICESat surface elevation change products, dh/dt, in the ablation zone to compare the observed volume changes with those predicted by RCMs. These two comparisons help evaluate how well seasonal melt and runoff are modeled by RCMs. The results help constrain uncertainties in present-day surface mass balance and runoff, as well as identify sources of RCM error. We also examine the constraints applied to the models (re-analysis data, albedo, energy budget, scheme to implement water retention, etc.) to gain insights into the processes responsible for the difference between models. Overall, we find substantial differences between MAR and RACMO results, and the results vary by region in terms of magnitude, timing and duration of surface melt. For instance, melt-water production and refreeze in the southwest are greater in RACMO, but total runoff is greater in MAR, and RACMO agrees better with GRACE. In the northeast, MAR predicts less runoff than RACMO and agrees better with GRACE. In the southeast, we find that the current version of MAR over-predicts runoff production.

Here, we propose a theoretical framework using concepts from cluster statistics of percolation, fractal scaling of percolation clusters, and critical path analysis to model dispersion in disordered porous media.\nIn our approach, the key influence on the variability of the dispersivity at shorter length scales is the magnitude of the medium heterogeneity. We show that our theoretical results correctly lie within the experimental range of observed dispersivities over more than 10 orders of magnitude of length scale. Our model predicts that: (1) the arrival time distribution decays slowly and approximately as a power law, and (2) the transport time is a superlinear power of the transport distance. The most important influence on these properties is the topology of the percolation backbone. In order to further evaluate our theory, we compare the arrival time distributions predicted by the proposed model with those measured on experimental columns over a range of saturations and find excellent match between theory and the measurements.",

The over-deepened, seaward shallowing bathymetry of Antarctica’s continental shelves is ideally configured to promote past, and potentially future, marine ice-sheet instability. The retreat history of the LGM ice sheet in the Ross Sea region is primarily constrained by C-14 ages on coastal beach ridges and relict penguin colonies along the Transantarctic Mountain front in the Western Ross Sea. Although these terrestrial sites offer more reliable dates than imprecise C-14 chronologies derived from bulk marine sediments, they may reflect retreat of local piedmont glaciers derived from East Antarctic outlet glaciers rather than representing the timing of retreat of the ice sheet in the central Ross Embayment. We present a sedimentary facies succession and foraminifera-based C-14 chronology from a core collected beneath the Ross Ice Shelf via a hot water drill access hole used for the ANDRILL Coulman High site survey. The site is to the east of Ross Island and distal from the coast, and yields a minimum age for glacial retreat that is approximately 1000 yrs earlier than suggested by coastal records along the nearby Victoria Land coast. We examine the implications of this constraint on the timing of ice sheet retreat in the context of model simulations and new multi-beam bathymetry data acquired in the Western Ross Sea. On the basis of these data we hypothesize that marine-based ice sheet retreat was triggered by oceanic forcings along most of the Pacific Ocean coastline of Antarctica simultaneously, but continued retreat in the Ross Sea occurred primarily as a consequence of marine ice sheet instability.",

            "abstract": "The Climate Data Management System is an object-oriented data management system, specialized for organizing multidimensional, gridded data used in climate analyses for data observation and simulation. The basic unit of computation in CDMS3 is the variable, which consist of a multidimensional array that represents climate information in four dimensions corresponding to: time, pressure levels, latitudes, and longitudes. As model become more precise in their computation, the volume of data generated becomes bigger and difficult to handle due to the limit of computational resources. Model today can produce data a time frequency of one hourly, three hourly, or six hourly for spatial footprint close to satellite data used run models. The amount of time for scientists to analyze the data and retrieve useful information is more and more unmanageable. Parallelizing libraries such as CMDS3 would ease the burden of working with such big datasets. Multiple approaches of parallelizing are possible. The most obvious one is embarrassingly parallel or pleasingly parallel programming where each computer node processes one file at a time. A more challenging approach is to send a piece of the data to each node for computation and each node will save the results at its right place in a file as a slab of data. This is possible with Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). A final approach would be the use of Open Multi-Processing API (OpenMP) where a master thread is split in multiple threads for different sections of the main code. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. This poster bring to light each benefit of these methods and seek to find an optimal solution to compute climate data analyses in a efficient fashion using one or a mixtures of these parallelized methods.",

            "abstract": "The Colonia river system, draining the eastern edge of the Northern Patagonia Icefield, Chile, has experienced a dramatic shift in flow regime from one characterized by seasonal discharge variability to one dominated by episodic glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). We use multi-temporal visible satellite images, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from stereo image pairs, and in situ observations to quantify sediment and water fluxes out of the dammed glacial lake, Lago Cachet Dos (LC2), as well as the concomitant downstream environmental change. GLOFs initiated in April 2008 and have since occurred, on average, two to three times a year. Differencing concurrent gage measurements made on the Baker River upstream and downstream of the confluence with the Colonia river finds peak GLOF discharges of ~ 3,000 m3s-1, which is ~ 4 times the median discharge of the Baker River and over 20 times the median discharge of the Colonia river. During each GLOF, ~ 200,000,000 m3 of water evacuates from the LC2, resulting in erosion of valley-fill sediments and the delta on the upstream end of LC2. Differencing DEMs between April 2008 and February 2014 revealed that ~ 2.5 x 107 m3 of sediment was eroded. Multi-temporal DEM differencing shows that erosion rates were highest initially, with > 20 vertical m of sediment removed between 2008 and 2012, and generally less than 5 m between 2012 and 2014. The downstream Colonia River Sandur also experienced geomorphic changes due to GLOFs. Using Landsat imagery to calculate the normalized difference water index (NDWI), we demonstrate that the Colonia River was in a stable configuration between 1984 and 2008. At the onset of GLOFs in April 2008, a change in channel location began and continued with each subsequent GLOF. Quantification of sediment and water fluxes due to GLOFs in the Colonia river valley provides insight on the geomorphic and environmental changes in river systems experiencing dramatic shifts in flow regime.",

            "abstract": "The Sicilian Channel presents a very remarkable structural complexity due to the presence and superposition of compressional, extensional and transcurrent structures. In particular, the SW Sicily and its offshore area are affected by two different tectonic processes: (1) compressional, responsible of the Late Miocene Maghrebian Fold-Thrust Belt; (2) transcurrent, responsible of the NS trending lineaments modeled offshore.\nA geophysical data set composed by seismic reflection profiles (VIDEPI, MS, CROP, OGS profiles) and GEBCO bathymetric data, in addition with analog models, have been used here to shed light on the interaction between the thrust belt and transcurrent deformation.We use clay box with thrust front precut and an undergoing mobile plate for the simulation of the transcurrent movement. Through this setup the interaction angle between the thrust belt and transcurrent displacement was varied in order to check the influence of the interaction angle on the newly formed structures. From the 3D model, we have seen that the region is dominated by N-NE transpressional structure called Sciacca structural high. In the southern part of this structure some faults are still active, as they deform the sea-floor. Lateral branches composing positive flower structures form an open horsetail splays. The plate on the eastern side of the Sciacca high is uplifted due a transpressional displacement and shortening in front of Maghrebian Fold-Thrust Belt. The analog modelling supports the structural setting of Sciacca high, where we equally observe comparable positive flower structures, horsetail splays, and uplift of the moving plate.\nFrom the offshore dataset we have seen that these two geodynamic processes coexist independently, but from the onshore structural map, the transcurrent strike-slip deformation affects the Maghrebian Fold-Thrust Belt. These two coexisting geodynamic processes can help in interpreting the 1968 Belice earthquake sequence, where both right-lateral strike–slip and compressive focal mechanisms have been observed.",

Even though the district has been intensively studied, many questions still remain about its emplacement. The complicated structural setting, and the great extension of post-glacial sediments, pose a challenge for geophysical and geological investigations.\nMost recent research efforts in the area have been directed at the construction of 3D geological models through the combined interpretation of independently modeled geophysical and geological data. Our aim is to take these studies further and derive, through joint and constraint inversions, a common 3D earth model consistent with all the available data. By integrating the datasets already at the modelling stage we intend to reduce significantly the uncertainties associated to the constructed 3D models.\nThe available geophysics in the district includes regional gravity and magnetic data acquired by the Geological Survey of Sweden in the 1970s, four lines of seismic reflection data totalling approximately 70 km, and more than 60 magnetotelluric sites spread across the area. The existing geological data (from surface, borehole, and in-mine observations) is condensed on interpreted surfaces representing the most important lithological boundaries. Additionally, there are density and susceptibility values obtained from samples across the whole district. We are looking for the best way to integrate the different geophysical datasets with geologically-constrained joint and cooperative inversions.",

            "abstract": "The Val d’Agri Quaternary basin is located within the Southern Apennine extensional belt, hosting the largest oilfield in Europe. Since 2006 wastewaters coming from oil production were re-injected by a single disposal well into the reservoir, represented by the carbonates of the Apulian platform. Consequently, induced micro-seismicity (219 events, ML < 2.3) was recorded close to the beginning of injection and within 5 km of the well. Afterwards, a detailed analysis of the oilfield underground dataset was performed to define a 3D geological model of the injection site. A pre-existing thrust system inherited by a Plio-Pleistocene compressional tectonic phase mainly constituted by NE-verging high-angle thrusts and SW-verging back-thrusts interesting the Apulian carbonates was interpreted. Below the injection well a mainly E-dipping back-thrust completely developed between two major thrusts can be modeled. The depth conversions of seismic interpretation based on sonic logs, VSP and seismic check-shots highlighted that the back-thrust geometry is compatible with accurate 3D absolute location and high precision relative location of induced events. Such analysis also show that wastewater injection firstly caused the reactivation of the deep portion of the back-thrust, and then seismicity mainly migrated up-dip toward shallower depths and interesting some portions of other faults, but remaining almost confined within the reservoir volume, and close to the injection well. These combined results also suggest that induced events presumably occurred on a small and high-permeability patch of the fault zone, favorably oriented with respect to the present-day SW-NE trending extensional stress field. Results can be read in the light of understanding the impact that induced seismicity due to the reactivation of pre-existing/inactive faults might have on seismic hazard and seismogenic potential evaluations, especially in tectonically active areas like Italy",

            "abstract": "Bacteria belonging to the newly classified candidate phylum “Atribacteria” (formerly referred to as \"OP9\" and “JS1”) are common in anoxic methane-rich sediments. However, the metabolic functions and biogeochemical role of these microorganisms in the subsurface remains unrealized due to the lack of pure culture representatives. This study observed a steady increase of Atribacteria-related sequences with increasing sediment depth throughout the methane-rich zone of the Adélie Basin, Antarctica (according to a 16S rRNA gene survey). To explore the functional potential of Atribacteria in this basin, samples from various depths (14, 25 and 97 meters below seafloor), were subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Additionally, individual cells were separated from frozen, unpreserved sediment for whole genome amplification. The successful isolation and sequencing of a single-amplified Atribacteria genome from these unpreserved sediments demonstrates a future use of single cell techniques with previously collected and frozen sediments. Our resulting single-cell amplified genome, combined with metagenomic interpretations, provides our first insights to the functional potential of Atribacteria in deep subsurface settings. As observed for non-marine Atribacteria, genomic analyses suggest a heterotrophic metabolism, with Atribacteria potentially producing fermentation products such as acetate, ethanol and CO2. These products may in turn support methanogens within the sediment microbial community and explain the frequent occurrence of Atribacteria in anoxic methane-rich sediments.",

            "abstract": "Since the proposal by Brace and Byerlee that the mechanism of stick-slip is similar to earthquake mechanics, many experimental studies have been conducted in order to improve our understanding of earthquakes. Here we report macroscopic stick-slip events in saw-cut Westerly granite samples deformed under controlled upper crustal stress conditions in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted under triaxial loading (σ1> σ2 =σ3) at confining pressures σ3 ranging from 10 to 100 MPa. A high frequency acoustic monitoring array recorded particle acceleration during macroscopic stick-slip events allowing us to estimate rupture speed. In addition, we were able to record the stress drop dynamically, and we show that the dynamic stress drop, measured locally close to the fault plane, is almost total in the breakdown zone, while the strength recovers to values of 0.4 within a few hundred of microseconds only. Enhanced dynamic weakening is observed to be linked to the melting of asperities, which can be well explained by flash heating theory, in agreement with our post-mortem microstructural analysis. Relationships between initial state of stress, rupture velocities, stress drop and energy budget suggest that at high normal stress (i.e. at supershear velocities), the rupture processes are more dissipative. Our experimental results were compared to natural observations, theory and existing experimental results. Our observations question about the current dichotomy between the fracture energy and the frictional energy in terms of rupture processes. A power law scaling of the fracture energy with final slip is observed over eigth orders of magnitude in slip, from the microns to tens of meters.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that streamflow-generating processes are not only dependent on climatic conditions, but also affected by physical catchment properties such as topography, geology, soils and land cover. We hypothesize that these landscape characteristics do not only lead to highly variable hydrologic behavior of rather similar catchments under the same stationary climate conditions, but that they also play a fundamental role for the sensitivity of a catchment to a changing climate. A multi-model ensemble based on 15 regional climate models was combined with a multi-catchment approach to explore the hydrologic sensitivity of 14 partially nested and rather similar catchments in Northern Sweden to changing climate conditions and the importance of small-scale spatial variability. Current (1981-2010) and future (2061-2090) streamflow was simulated with the HBV model. As expected, projected increases in temperature and precipitation resulted in increased total available streamflow, with lower spring and summer flows, but substantially higher winter streamflow. Furthermore, significant changes in flow durations with lower chances of both high and low flows can be expected in boreal Sweden in the future. This overall trend in projected streamflow pattern changes was comparable among the analyzed catchments while the magnitude of change differed considerably. This suggests that catchments belonging to the same region can show distinctly different degrees of hydrological responses to the same external climate change signal. We reason that differences in spatially distributed physical catchment properties at smaller scales are not only of great importance for current streamflow behavior, but also play a major role as first-order control for the sensitivity of catchments to changing climate conditions.",

They are known to play important roles in the initiation and propagation of lightning [Rakov and Uman, 2003]. A few recent studies have investigated the initiation of streamers from hydrometeors under thundercloud electric field conditions in order to understand the initiation process of lightning [e.g., Liu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 109 (2), 025002, 2012; Petersen et al., Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 141, 1283, 2014; Sadighi et al., J. Geophys. Res., 120, 3660, 2015]. But the properties of long streamers initiated from isolated hydrometeors are poorly understood. A recent observation [Rison et al., AGU Abstract AE22A-02, 2014] reported the initiation of lightning discharges began with electric breakdown waves that propagated through 500-900 m with speeds of 3-5×107m/s and suggested these were positive streamers.\nIn the presentation, we will report a modeling study on the dynamics of a relatively long positive streamer (~4 cm) initiated from an isolated hydrometeor in a background electric field with a reasonable magnitude. The modeling results indicate while the streamer shows a generally exponential growth feature, its characteristics such as channel radius, electron density, and current density exhibit collocated fluctuations. The exponential growth property allows us to use the modeling results to predict the characteristics of longer streamers, and to quantify the thunderstorm electrical conditions including the high-field region size and potential difference in order to accelerate the streamer to the high speed of the initial breakdown waves of lightning observed by Rison et al. [2014]. It is found that the streamer radiates in the high frequency and very high frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A potential difference of 0.3-1.8 MV is required to accelerate it to the high speed of 1-5×107 m/s.",

            "abstract": "Active topography is a predominant feature of Southern California’s landscapes where intense erosion and depositional processes can influence SOC translocation and accumulation and where changes in chemical, physical, and topographic conditions may affect long-term stability of SOC. Considering the large variability in SOC content across areas with active topography, it is necessary to develop landscape-scale stratifications of sampling that capture SOC variability due to erosion and deposition processes at different topographic locations. To achieve this goal, landscape SOC needs to be assessed based on more than just slope position by taking into account specific topographic indices, such as slope class, curvature, and catchment area. In this work, we used a series of analytical approaches, including total and water extractable C fractions, ultraviolet absorbance, infrared spectroscopy and a radio-isotope tracer (137Cs) in combination with GIS and digital terrain attributes analyses to investigate the quality and distribution of SOC along the sloping landscape of Puente Hills Preserve, in Whittier, CA. The complex interaction of terrain attributes on erosion and depositional processes was evident from 137Cs analysis, which allowed us to identify depositional and eroding areas. Our findings indicate that greater SOC accumulation is associated with concave profile and plane curvature, when combined with low slope class. Slope appears to be the terrain attribute that most affects SOC content and slope effects persist at depth. Ultraviolet absorbance of water extractable OC and infrared spectroscopy of SOC allowed the identification of different levels of aromaticity and distribution of SOC moieties that have been correlated to rates of mineralization. Southern California, like other Mediterranean regions around the world, is expected to experience increasingly severe droughts, more intense erosion and more frequent fire perturbation – which can exacerbate erosion - in the context of a changing climate. For these reasons, our findings are relevant to make better predictions on future SOC dynamics in areas with evolving and complex three-dimensional landscapes.",

Therefore, measuring the root-zone-soil-moisture across large spatial scales is of great importance for crop monitoring and yield estimation as well as hydrological and ecological modeling. Unlike L-band instruments, which are sensitive to only a few centimeters of the top soil layer, P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments have a penetration depth that can be used to retrieve soil moisture profiles in depths of several tens of centimeters (depending on soil texture and moisture content). NASA’s Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) mission is designed to study the application of P-band SAR measurements for monitoring root-zone-soil-moisture.\nIn this study, we introduce a new framework to retrieve vegetation parameters and smooth-surface soil reflection coefficients using SAR polarimetry and the fully polarimetric covariance matrix of the backscattering signal from AirMOSS observations. The retrieved soil reflectivities (both horizontally and vertically -polarized) can then be used to estimate the soil moisture profile. The retrieval model takes into account contributions from surface, dihedral and volume scattering coming from the vegetation and soil components, and does not require prior vegetation parameters. This approach reduces the dependency of the retrieval on allometry-based vegetation models with large numbers of uncertain parameters. The performance of this method will be validated using observations from AirMOSS field campaigns in July 2013 over Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, USA. This will enable a quality assessment of the polarimetry-based retrieval of the soil reflectivities and the estimated root-zone-soil-moisture profiles.",

Negative data, while critical are especially at risk. Samples are even more vulnerable because of the space needed and cost of maintenance.

            "abstract": "The evolution of fracture permeability during shearing is crucial in defining the impact of hydraulic stimulation in geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs and in describing earthquake mechanisms in induced seismicity. We report laboratory measurement of fracture permeability evolution associated with transient increases in shear velocity during frictional shearing. Core plugs of Westerly granite are saw-cut to form a smooth axial fracture that is subsequently roughened to simulate a natural fracture with controlled surface topography. Fluid-flow experiments are conducted in a triaxial pressure vessel to independently apply confining pressure, pore pressure, and shear velocity, and to concurrently monitor the evolution of fracture permeability, k, during experiments. We conduct velocity stepping experiments, where shear-induced dilation is expected to occur in response to shearing velocity increase [e.g., Samuelson et al., 2009], under a range of conditions: background shearing rate of ~1 mm/s with steps to ~5, ~10, and ~15 micron/sec at confining stresses of 1, 3, and 6 MPa. We find that, regardless of confining stress, the trend of permeability-versus-displacement clearly varies in response to an increase in shearing velocity. In most cases, the k values following a velocity increase are larger than would be expected by extrapolating the permeability-displacement trend at lower velocity. We interpret this discrepancy in k as being caused by shear-induced dilation. In other words, shear-induced dilation may have a role in incrementing fracture permeability. This concept is probed by linking permeability evolution to concepts of dilation and wear recovered from rate-state characterizations of frictional behavior.",

The TVZ is home to two of the most active rhyolitic calderas in the world, Taupo and Okataina, and is thought to have erupted more than 10,000 km3 of predominately rhyolitic magma, with ~640 km3 of material over the past 61 ka from Taupo and Okataina alone. Using GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, collected by the European (ESA) and Japanese (JAXA) space agencies, we present ground deformation observations from 2003 to 2011 and show widespread subsidence across the central TVZ at rates of up to 20 mm/yr. Using simple elastic dislocation models to represent the contraction of a sill like body, we predict an annual volume change of up to 0.016 km3 beneath the central TVZ and suggest that the majority of the observed subsidence is a result of the cooling and subsequent contraction of magma within the shallow crust. Furthermore, with New Zealand volcanoes now added to the GEO’s Geohazard Supersites and Natural Laboratories initiative, we will detail our attempts at integrating geodetic, magnetotelluric and petrological datasets to image the plumbing system beneath the TVZ.",

More recently, the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument on the NASA Curiosity Rover detected the presence of perchlorate in Gale Crater, suggesting that it is globally distributed. Perchlorates are of great interest on Mars due to their high affinity for water vapor (deliquescence) as well as their ability to greatly depress the freezing point of water when in solution. This has intriguing biological implications as resulting brines could potentially provide a habitable environment for living organisms. Additionally, it has been speculated that these salts may play a significant role in the hydrological cycle on Mars. A sample of magnesium perchlorate was subjected to the water vapor pressure and temperatures found at the landing site of the Phoenix Mars mission. Laser Raman scattering was applied to detect the onset of deliquescence and provide a relative estimate of the quantity of water taken up and subsequently released by the sample. As the temperature of the sample decreased at the same rate as measured on Mars during the evening, significant uptake of water from the atmosphere was observed to occur prior to the frost point temperature being reached. As the temperature was lowered, water uptake continued as saturation was reached and frost formed on the surface surrounding the perchlorate sample. Freezing of the brine film was observed at the eutectic temperature of -67°C and thawing occurred at a temperature of -62°C.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that there is something lacking in our understanding of the temperature of the Io plasma torus. In situ observations show that the temperature in the torus increases more than can be accounted for by ion pickup; as much as 20% of the needed energy is missing. However, the role of centrifugal acceleration has not been investigated as a potential source of plasma heating. Analysis of the role of centrifugal forces on the plasma population is difficult as the effects are both energy and pitch-angle dependent: adiabatic outward displacement of flux tubes in a rotating frame results in net cooling of equatorially mirroring plasma even when a centrifugal force is acting, but this is not necessarily the case for particles mirroring off the equator. An ion in a rotating, adiabatically stretching system bouncing away from its mirror point will gain parallel energy from the centrifugal force, but will lose it again as it moves back towards its mirror point; the bounce-averaged change in energy is small. Therefore the centrifugal force in an adiabatically expanding system is only able to impart significant energy to a particle if the timescale of the stretching is less than that of a bounce period. As a prelude to a full Large Scale Kinetic (LSK) simulation of particles in a rotating magnetic field, here we check that two prerequisite conditions are met. Firstly, we estimate an upper bound to the thermal energy that could be gained through centrifugal acceleration in order to demonstrate that there is sufficient energy to account for the temperature anomaly observed at Io's plasma torus. Secondly, we calculate the bounce period of ions typical to the torus to establish the range of energies for which the quarter bounce times are is shorter than the ~4 days required for the field in the Io plasma torus to stretch from 6-10 RJ. We will also describe preliminary results from our modeling efforts.",

The 1980’s vintage legacy data from Project PROBE have been reprocessed through pre-stack depth migration in Lake Tanganyika, and similar reprocessing of legacy data from Lake Malawi is forthcoming. New high-fold and large-source commercial and academic data have recently been collected in southern Lake Tanganyika, and in the northern and central basins of Lake Malawi as part of the 2015 SEGMeNT project. In the case of Lake Tanganyika, new data indicate the presence of older sediment packages that underlie previously identified “pre-rift” basement (the “Nyanja Event”). These episodes of sedimentation and extension may substantially predate the modern lake. These deep stratal reflections are absent in many localites, possibly on account of attenuation of the acoustic signal. However in one area of southern Lake Tanganyika, the newly-observed deep strata extend axially for ~70 km, likely representing deposits from a discrete paleolake. The high-amplitude Nyanja Event is interpreted as the onset of late-Cenozoic rifting, and the changing character of the overlying depositional sequences reflects increasing relief in the rift valley, as well as the variability of fluvial inputs, and the intermittent connectivity of upstream lake catchments. Earlier Tanganyika sequences are dominated by shallow lake and fluvial-lacustrine facies, whereas later sequences are characterized by extensive gravity flow deposition in deep water, and pronounced erosion and incision in shallow water depths and on littoral platforms. The age and provenance of the sub-Nyanja Event sequences is unknown, but may correlate to Miocene, Cretaceous or Karroo-age sedimentary packages documented elsewhere in the southwestern part of the East African Rift, including in the region around Lakes Rukwa and Malawi.",

            "abstract": "Emissions of aerosols and their precursors have due to air quality regulations drastically decreased at northern hemisphere mid-latitudes during the latest decades. At the same time, emissions in the northern hemisphere tropics and subtropics have increased e.g. as a consequence of the strong economic growth in East Asia. Using the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model NorESM, we assess the influence of these regional emission changes on climate with a particular focus on the Arctic. Different mechanisms that couple the localized forcing with the corresponding temperature response are also suggested. The European emission reductions of SO2 that have taken place since the 1980’s, seem to have had a disproportionally large effect on the Arctic climate compared to the rest of the northern hemisphere. Locally, the Arctic warming due to the decreased SO2 exceeds 1K. The primary reason for this strong remote temperature response is an increased poleward dry-static heat transport, which is initiated by the enhanced meridional temperature gradient. Emission changes of other aerosol types and over other regions such as North America and Asia appear to have had a much smaller influence on recent Artic climate change. Possible reasons for this differential response will be discussed.",

We have recently extended the associated modeling to include the passage of a CME, and we describe the preliminary results. The electron temperature in the solar corona determines the amount of Doppler broadening of the solar spectrum as it Thomson scatters off the coronal electrons. The outward flow of the coronal electrons from the solar surface causes the coronal electrons to see a red-shifted Sun and determines the amount of red-shift in the K-coronal spectrum. Thus, the intensity, smoothness and red-shift of the K-coronal spectrum along any given line of sight provide a measure of the electron density, electron temperature and electron bulk flow speed, respectively, along that line of sight. Likewise, the passing of a CME across a line of sight in the ambient corona will alter the shape of the K-coronal spectrum with respect to the ambient background.",

            "abstract": "Our ability to detect and probe the vertical extent of cirrus was hugely improved with the launch of the NASA-CNES CALIPSO mission in April 2006. However, our skill at retrieving the optical properties of the cirrus detected by the CALIPSO lidar is not yet commensurate with our detection abilities. As with any new observing system, CALIPSO faces challenges and uncertainties in the retrieval of the geophysical parameters from its fundamental measurements. Specifically, extinction and optical depth retrievals for elastic backscatter lidars like CALIPSO typically rely on a priori assumptions about layer-mean extinction-to-backscatter ratios (AKA lidar ratios), which can vary regionally and for which uncertainties are high.\nTo improve CALIPSO optical properties retrievals, we show High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) measurements acquired with systems from the University of Wisconsin and NASA Langley. HSRLs can directly determine ice cloud extinction and lidar ratio by separately measuring the molecular and particulate components of the total backscattered signal, thus largely eliminating many of the uncertainties inherent in elastic backscatter retrievals. These measurements were acquired during the SEAC4RS (Huntsville, AL, USA and Singapore), and FRAPPE/DISCOVER-AQ 2014 (BAO tower near Boulder, CO, USA) field campaigns, and an intensive operations period in Hampton, VA, USA.",

            "abstract": "Following the 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake, surface rupture was mapped along the West Napa Fault Zone (WNFZ) for a distance of ~ 14 km and locally within zones up to ~ 2 km wide. Near the northern end of the surface rupture, however, several strands coalesced to form a narrow, ~100-m-wide zone of surface rupture. To determine the location, width, and shallow (upper few hundred meters) geometry of the fault zone, we acquired an active-source seismic survey across the northern surface rupture in February 2015. We acquired both P- and S-wave data, from which we developed reflection images and tomographic images of Vp, Vs, Vp/Vs, and Poisson’s ratio of the upper 100 m. We also used small explosive charges within surface ruptures located ~600 m north of our seismic array to record fault-zone guided waves. Our data indicate that at the latitude of the Hendry Winery, the WNFZ is characterized by at least five fault traces that are spaced 60 to 200 m apart. Zones of low-Vs, low-Vp/Vs, and disrupted reflectors highlight the fault traces on the tomography and reflection images. On peak-ground-velocity (PGV) plots, the most pronounced high-amplitude guided-wave seismic energy coincides precisely with the mapped surface ruptures, and the guided waves also show discrete high PGV zones associated with unmapped fault traces east of the surface ruptures. Although the surface ruptures of the WNFZ were observed only over a 100-m-wide zone at the Hendry Winery, our data indicate that the fault zone is at least 400 m wide, which is probably a minimum width given the 400-m length of our seismic profile. Slip on the WNFZ is generally considered to be low relative to most other Bay Area faults, but we suggest that the West Napa Fault is a zone of widely distributed shear, and to fully account for the total slip on the WNFZ, slip on all traces of this wide fault zone must be considered.",

The watershed area includes six states from New York to Virginia and is nearly 167,000 km2 in size with more than 150 rivers and streams entering the 300-km Bay main stem. Forested and agricultural lands make up 58 and 22 percent of the land use, respectively. Nearly 9 percent is urban and suburban use, and the watershed is home to over 17 million people. However, the population is expected to reach 19 million by 2025, raising the potential for conflict between the agricultural and urban communities over land and water use and in protecting natural resources, especially in the lower portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Lower Chesapeake Bay study area, part of the USDA-ARS Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network, will provide much-needed data to support decisions at this critical agriculture-urban interface. Current long-term projects seek to assess the economic, production, and environmental performance of conventional and organic cropping systems and to evaluate the resilience of these systems to climate change. Large-scale studies are being conducted to examine the effects of land-use and landscape characteristics on ecosystem services and on energy, water, nutrient, carbon, and pest dynamics within watersheds. New in-situ measurement and remote sensor technologies are being considered with the expectancy that the data streams will be available on-line and for use in modeling. Results and outcomes of these research efforts will greatly benefit the national LTAR network and will be applicable to other US coastal urban-agricultural regions.",

            "abstract": "The physical properties of the seismic source play a major role in the generation of earthquake ground motions. One of the key parameters typically used in this context is the so-called stress drop since it can be directly linked to the high-frequency spectral level of ground motion, and it is an important input parameter for ground motion modeling. At the same time, classically determined stress drop estimates from moment-corner frequency analysis have been shown to be extremely variable, and this to a much larger degree than might be expected from the decomposition of ground motion variability into its between-event and within-event components following the random effects approach (Cotton et al., 2013). This discrepancy raises the question of whether classically determined stress drop variability is too large, which would have significant implications for ground motion prediction in seismic hazard analysis.\nWe use the rich high-quality accelerometric databases available in Japan to derive non-parametric ground motion models on these data that serve as reference models. We then investigate the relation between the between-event terms for the individual earthquakes from these regressions with stress drop estimates determined nation-wide for crustal earthquakes. As a complement to the non-parametric models, we also apply a parametric mixed effects modeling approach to investigate the influence of between-event, between-region and between-sequence variability. The analysis is carried out for JMA equivalent seismic intensity, PGA and PGV data. Our results indicate a clear correlation of the between-event terms with stress drops estimates, both for non-parametric and parametric approaches – however with the interesting effect of the appearance of two major families of events with widely different stress drop, yet similar range of between-event terms. This effect is in agreement with the observation made by Cotton et al. (2013) that the between-event ground motion variability is significantly smaller than expected from the stress drop variability. Stress drop & ground motions also vary systematically between earthquake sequences.",

            "abstract": "A series of six repeat surveys along 27 kilometers of the coastal Trinity River in east Texas, USA, reveal the temporal and spatial changes in bed material load during and following a historically large flood. The river event was above the National Weather Service flood stage for 55 days at the Liberty USGS station, and had a maximum discharge of about 80,000 cfs. As a community, we are beginning to understand how fluvial geomorphology is influenced by the backwater effect, but we still lack an understanding of how the bed-material transport adjusts to accommodate larger-scale changes in river bend pattern and kinematics. Survey data from this project includes sidescan sonar along the channel centerline, multibeam bathymetry, and channel bed sediment samples. In combination, this data set provides new insight into how and when bed material, primarily medium sand with some pebbles, moves through this region, and how this connects to previously observed changes in channel geometry (including downstream decreases in channel width to depth ratio, bar form volume and surface area, and lateral migration rates of river bends). Preliminary examination of sidescan sonar of two bends within the survey area, one upstream and one downstream, reveal a striking difference in bedform behavior in response to the changing hydrograph. Upstream, bedforms decrease 80% in height and 83% in length and increase in 3-dimensionality throughout the extended peak flow. During the falling limb of the flood these same bedforms increase in size as they become more laterally continuous and straight-crested. Downstream, 3-dimensional bedforms decrease 80% in height and 87% in length throughout the extended peak flow and then remain this size during the falling limb of the flood. This presentation will discuss these results with respect to backwater dynamics, sediment supply and transport, implications for coastal geomorphology as well as sediment delivery into deltaic systems.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface heterogeneity has an important control on water balance. Groundwater recharge is one of its most relevant processes feeding the world’s groundwater storages and therefore supplying fresh water to large parts of the global population for their drinking water and food production. However, large-scale hydrological models do not usually consider subsurface heterogeneity adequately to simulate groundwater recharge.\nIn this study we compare the model simulations of two different representations of the subsurface, one with heterogeneous and the other with homogeneous subsurface, from present day to the future (1991-2099). We look at simulated recharge rates and their inter-annual variability. In addition, we calculate the elasticity of recharge rates concerning climate variability, in terms of annual precipitation, temperature and average intensity during strong rainfall events, to quantify their controls on simulated recharge and how these controls evolve in the future.\nOur model comparison shows that regions with strong subsurface heterogeneity have enhanced recharge rates with greater inter-annual variability compared to those with more homogenous subsurface properties. Furthermore, the heterogeneous representation shows stronger elasticity concerning climate variability than the homogeneous subsurface representation. This difference tends to increase towards the future.\nOur results suggest that water management in regions with heterogeneous subsurface can expect a higher water availability than estimated by most of the large-scale simulations. But measures should be taken to prepare for increasingly variable groundwater recharge rates.",

            "abstract": "We present new results from bistatic Goldstone to Green Bank Telescope (GBT) high-resolution radar imaging of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Previously, most radar observations used either the 305-m Arecibo radar or the 70-m DSS-14 radar at Goldstone. Following the installation of new data-taking equipment at the GBT in late 2014, the number of bistatic Goldstone/GBT observations has increased substantially. Receiving Goldstone radar echoes at the 100-m GBT improves the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) two- to three-fold relative to monostatic reception at DSS-14. The higher SNRs allow us to obtain higher resolution images than is possible with DSS-14 both transmitting and receiving. Thus far in 2015, we have used the GBT receiver in combination with the 450 kW DSS-14 antenna and a new low-power 80kW transmitter on the 34-m DSS-13 antenna at the Goldstone complex to image five and two NEAs respectively.\nAsteroids 2005 YQ96, 2004 BL86, and 1994 AW1 are binary systems. 2011 UW158 has a spin period of 36 minutes that is unusually fast among asteroids its size (~500 m). 1999 JD6 is a deeply bifurcated double-lobed object. 2015 HM10 is an elongated 80 m asteroid with a spin period of 22 minutes. Our best images of these objects resolve the surface with resolutions of 3.75 m and reveal numerous features. Such images are useful to estimate the 3D shape, spin state, and other physical and dynamical properties of the objects. This knowledge is of particular interest for spacecraft mission planning, impact threat assessment, and resource utilization. Over the long term, such observations will help answer fundamental questions regarding the origin of the diversity in asteroid morphologies, the importance of spin-up mechanisms and collisional influences, the interior structure and thermal properties of asteroids, and the variety of dynamical states.",

            "abstract": "In 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation directing the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to complete a national assessment of subsurface helium gas resources. As part of this assessment, the USGS has constructed a database of helium concentration from compositional analyses of produced gas. Though most data of this data is non-proprietary, helium data have been taken from both public and proprietary sources, with a majority taken from the USGS geochemical database (http://energy.usgs.gov/GeochemistryGeophysics/GeochemistryLaboratories/GeochemistryLaboratories-GeochemistryDatabase.aspx#4413382-introduction) and from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) natural gas database. Altogether, there are over 16,000 analyses of natural gas composition compiled.\nIn order to complete the assessment, it was necessary to correlate the well data with geologic reservoir data so that the helium concentrations could be compared with the reservoir and field-level gas production, in place gas volumes, and gas recovery factors. The well data from the compiled database were initially cross-referenced with the proprietary IHS Inc. well database, where possible. The results of that effort were then cross-referenced with three additional databases: the proprietary NRG Associates database of significant oil and gas fields of the United States, the non-proprietary U.S. Department of Energy’s gas information system (GASIS), and an internal BLM reservoir and field database. These field and reservoir databases provide the data needed to estimate the in-place helium resources for fields with economic concentrations of helium. In order for helium production to be economic, the gas produced from geologic reservoirs must be greater than 0.3 mole percent (mol%), or in the case of liquefied natural gas processing, greater than 0.04 mol%. The field and reservoir specific estimates of total gas in place volumes, gas recovery factors, and helium concentrations, can be used as inputs for a probabilistic assessment of known helium resource per reservoir. These reservoir resource values can then be statistically aggregated to estimate a total U.S. known helium resource, which will fulfill the Congressional mandate and provide crucial information on the future availability of domestic helium supply.",

Understanding these processes within a hierarchical context for Pacific Northwest rivers may be helpful for proactive monitoring and restoration of native western brook lamprey (Lampetra richardsonii) and Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). To that end, our study assessed the processes creating thick, fine-grained sediment deposits that lamprey larvae rely on as rearing habitat in the Umpqua River basin, southwestern Oregon. We first developed a spatial framework for characterizing basins based on expected fluxes of suspended and bed-material sediment and transport capacity. We then assessed the reach-scale controls on sediment deposition and erosion. Coupling remotely based watershed analyses and field sampling helped us assess the broad-scale spatial controls on sediment supply imposed by geology, and in turn, local factors that control sediment deposition and create larval lamprey habitat. Collectively, the results of this work aid in understanding the critical physical controls influencing the patterns in local habitat availability for larval lamprey within river networks. ",

We focus on the petrology and U-Pb geochronology of seven intrusions in the North Central region (NC) with the goals of: (1) comparing chemical and Sr-Nd isotopic characteristics of these plutons with those of similar age plutons to the east and west, (2) delineating terrane boundaries using Nd model ages, and (3) identifying geographical trends in age or composition that could help explain the anomalous breadth of Cretaceous magmatism in the area.\nNC plutons are primarily biotite granites; some also contain hornblende, garnet, and/or K-spar megacrysts. All are peraluminous (ASI = 1.10 – 1.41) and have SiO2 ranging from 65-74 wt% and arc chemical signatures (HFSE depletions). The less silicic ones are high-Si adakites. Isotopic data (87Sr/86Sri  = 0.7034 to 0.7053; εNd (t) = +4.87 to -3.48) suggest the NC plutons are mixtures of material from depleted mantle and older crust, some of which was eclogitic. Depleted mantle Nd model ages cluster between 750-950 Ma; younger than those of Northeastern region plutons (1250-1500 Ma) but older than those of North Cascades plutons (250-450 Ma) (Loewen et al., AGU 2007). We interpret these discontinuities in model ages as terrane boundaries, with NC plutons demarking the southern extension of Quesnellia, a Paleozoic-Mesozoic island arc accreted to North America by the late Jurassic as part of the Intermontane Superterrane. Ongoing U-Pb dating will clarify whether there are differences in the timing of Cretaceous magmatism between the different regions.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies illustrated the potential of aerosols to change the large-scale atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, but it remains unclear to what extent the proposed aerosol-induced changes reflect robust model behavior and are affected by the climate system's internal variability. \"Easy Aerosol\" addresses this question by subjecting nine comprehensive climate models with prescribed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) to the same set of idealized \"easy\" aerosol perturbations.\nThe aerosol perturbations are designed based on a global aerosol climatology and mimic the gravest mode of the anthropogenic aerosol. They both scatter and absorb shortwave radiation, but to focus on direct radiative effects aerosol-cloud interactions are omitted. Each model contributes seven simulations. A clean control case with no aerosol-radiative effects is compared to six perturbed simulations with differing aerosol loading, zonal aerosol distributions, and SSTs. To estimate the role of internal variability, one of the models contributes a 5-member ensemble for each simulation.\nWhen observed SSTs from years 1979-2005 are used, the aerosol leads to a local depression of precipitation at the Northern Hemisphere center of the aerosol and a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This is consistent with the aerosol’s shortwave atmospheric heating and the fact that SSTs are fixed. Moreover, the Northern hemisphere mid-latitude jet shifts poleward in the annual and zonal-mean. Due to large natura variability, however, these signals only emerge in ensemble runs or if the aerosol optical depth is increased by a factor of five compared to the observed magnitude of the present-day anthropogenic aerosol. When SSTs are adapted to include the cooling effect of the aerosol, the ITCZ and the Northern hemisphere jet shift southward in the annual and zonal-mean. The models exhibit very similar precipitation and zonal wind changes in response to the SST change, showing that SSTs are a key factor for the circulation response. Yet, model differences in the surface and top-of-atmosphere energy balances due to evaporation and cloud-radiative effects imply that the models would show much more different responses if they were coupled to an interactive ocean.",

            "abstract": "El Niño is one of the most dominant modes of climate variability that is closely linked to hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts that cause great loss of lives and properties. However, the different impacts of the two types of El Niño-Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP)-El Niño on runoff across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) are not well understood. This study characterizes the impacts of the CP- and EP-El Niño on seasonal and annual runoff using observed historical streamflow data from 658 reference gaging stations and NCAR-CCSM4 model. We found that surface runoff responds similarly to the two types of El Niño events in Southeast, Central, South and Western coastal regions, but differently in Northeast (NE), Pacific Northwest (PNW) and West North Central (WNC) climatic zones. Specifically, EP-El Niño events tend to bring above-average runoff in NE, WNC, and PNW throughout the year while CP-El Niño events cause below-than normal runoff in the three regions. Similar findings were also found by analyzing NCAR-CCSM4 model outputs that captured both the CP- and EP-El Niño events representing the best datasets among selected CMIP5 models. The CCSM4 model simulates lower runoff values during CP-El Niño years than those in EP-El Niño in all of the three climatic regions (NE, PNW and WNC) during 1950-1999. In the future (2050-2099), for both El Niño years, runoff is projected to increase over the NE and PNW regions, mainly due to increased future precipitation (P). In contrast, the increase of future evapotranspiration (ET) is higher than that of future P, leading to a projected decrease in runoff over the WNC climate region. In addition, model analysis indicates that all of the three climatic regions (NE, PNW and WNC) are projected to have lower runoff values during CP-El Niño years than EP-El Niño. Our study suggests that U.S. water resources may be distributed more unevenly in space and time with a character of as more frequent and intense flood and drought events. The findings from this study have important implications to water resource management at the regional scale. Information generated from this study is useful for water resource planners to anticipate the influence of two different types of El Niño events on droughts and floods across the CONUS.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstructions from the northern Alaska tundra since the LGM have mainly relied on paleoecological proxies such as pollen and chironomids. However, lack of trees, non-analogue assemblages, and limited species diversity present significant challenges to quantitative reconstructions. The abnormally warm LGM conditions implied by pollen assemblages, supported by the CCSM3 but contradicted by CCSM4 simulations, have been a source of great confusion. Here we present a synthesis of results from a NSF-funded project, aiming at utilizing a full suite of organic geochemical and paleolimnological proxies, in conjunction with model comparison, to quantitatively reconstruct temperature and moisture changes since the LGM. Compound specific hydrogen isotopic ratios of plant leaf waxes from Lake E5 near Toolik Lake suggest summer temperature at the LGM is ~ 7 degrees colder than the early Holocene and there is a temperature decline of 2-3 degrees over the Holocene, coherent with greenhouse and insolation forcings respectively. A similar LGM to present temperature gradient is found in the alkenone-inferred early summer temperatures, although an expanded Arctic sea ice in the early Holocene significantly suppressed this temperature. The LGM to present temperature gradient is further supported by temperatures inferred by br-GDGTs from our sediment core, which also display an early Holocene to present temperature decline of 2 to 3 degrees. Our paleotemperature data are supported by model results using CCSM4, with its use of newer generation ice sheet configuration, indicating lower LGM temperatures than present. Our paleohydrological reconstructions based on hydrogen isotopic contrast between inferred precipitation and lake water isotopic ratios, and carbon isotopic fractionation of terrestrial plant leaf waxes, suggesting an arid last glacial relative to the Holocene. This presentation will also summarize all geochemical measurements including TOC, bulk C and N isotopic ratios, terrestrial and aquatic biomarker fluxes (with implication for terrestrial and aquatic productivities) from Lake E5. We will also discuss the cause for an unusual observation that the Bølling-Allerød event is highly muted in the study region relative to other Arctic regions, such as Greenland.",

            "abstract": "New facility-level methane emissions measurements obtained from 114 natural gas gathering facilities and 16 processing plants in 13 U.S. states were combined with facility counts obtained from state and national databases in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate methane emissions from U.S. natural gas gathering and processing operations. Total annual methane emissions of 2,421 (+245/-237) Gg were estimated for all U.S. gathering and processing operations, representing a methane loss rate of 0.47% (±0.05%) when normalized by 2012 CH4 production. The largest source of emissions from gathering and processing operations were attributed to normal operation of gathering facilities (1,697 +189/-185 Gg). The methane emissions from processing plants (506 +55/-52 Gg) was 40% lower than the 2014 EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimate but a factor of three higher than that reported under the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Since gathering operations are currently embedded within the production segment of the EPA GHGI, field observations equipment counts at gathering facilities were used to estimate the fraction of the methane emissions in the EPA production inventory to assign to gathering facilities. Based on this analysis, the study results suggest that methane emissions from gathering facilities could be as high as eight times that of the EPA GHGI estimate. Because methane emissions from most gathering facilities are not reported under the current rule and not all source categories are reported for processing plants, the total CH4 emissions from gathering and processing reported under the EPA GHGRP (180 Gg) represents only 14% of that tabulated in the EPA GHGI and 7% of that predicted from this study.",

            "abstract": "An important goal of the EARTHTIME initiative is to produce an accurate and precise sequence of geologic events, allowing the evaluation of the rates of geologic processes. Toward this end, the Ar-Ar and U-Pb communities require a set of standards that permit inter-laboratory and inter-technique comparisons. Natural zircon and sanidine samples that are extensively analyzed by multiple labs play a critical role for these comparisons, but are currently limited in number (Plesovice, R33, Temora 2 zircons; Fish Canyon, Alder Creek, Taylor Creek sanidine). Calibration between the sanidine Ar-Ar and zircon U-Pb is sparse and complexity in one or both of the systems is a general problem. Further, there is currently no Paleozoic sanidine monitor standard for Ar-Ar geochronology. The sanidine- and zircon-bearing Carboniferous Fire Clay tonstein provides potential natural Paleozoic standards for these two systems. The Fire Clay tonstein is a voluminous Carboniferous ash bed from the Appalachian basin. Exposures of the tonstein span over 300 km, making it a valuable marker bed for Appalachian geology. Here we report the results of 64 single-grain zircon U-Pb TIMS analyses and 223 single-grain sanidine Ar/Ar analyses. Although previous efforts have been plagued by xenocrystic zircons, by careful selection of only elongate crystals we were able to entirely avoid discordant analyses older than 316 Ma. Unfiltered analyses of zircons analyzed from a population of acicular crystals give a range of dates between ~315 and ~314 Ma with 2 sigma uncertainties of ~0.2 Ma. A weighted mean of these dates has an MSWD of ~4.0, suggesting geological complexity in the magma chamber or post-eruption lead loss. Sanidine ages have a range of less than 1 %, and only a single population can be distinguished with precision at the 1 Ma level for individual crystals. The ability to select crystals of both zircon and sanidine that give a narrow range of ages suggests that the Fire Clay tonstein holds promise as a Paleozoic Ar-Ar monitor standard. However, as U-Pb zircon data becomes more precise, we must grapple with the questions that data sets such as this one raises including how to interpret complex zircon populations from volcanic samples.",

            "abstract": "In recent observations, Baker et al. (Nature, 2014) reported the observation of an “impenetrable barrier” to the inner edge of the ultra-relativistic electron radiation belt. These authors demonstrated that this barrier location was not co-incident with the location of the plasmapause nor any other identifiable magnetospheric boundary; nor could it be explained by spatial structure resulting from the impacts of ground-based VLF transmitters. Here we show how the location of the “impenetrable barrier” can be explained as the location where there is a balance between inwards ULF wave radial diffusion and loss from lower band chorus and/or plasmaspheric hiss. Using recently derived data-driven ULF wave radial diffusion rates based on observations of ground-based ULF wave power characterised upto Kp=9 we can estimate the inward transport rates across a wide range of extreme activity levels. Contrary to the suggestion by Baker et al., there does not appear to be any need for active local wave particle acceleration between the plasmapause and the edge of the barrier at L*~2.8 since the radial diffusion rates appear to be sufficient to transport particles there during the most active times. The ”impenetrable barrier” is explained as being defining as the locus where the rate of drift averaged loss matches the rate of inwards ULF wave radial diffusion. During more active times the location where loss is dominant moves inwards but reaches a limit of closest approach at L*~2.8 during the most active geomagnetic conditions (except during very short exceptional periods where interplanetary shocks and other shorter timescale processes can cause temporary filling of the slot). Overall, the “impenetrable barrier” is explained as a simple and natural consequence of the activity-dependent rates of ULF wave transport balanced by slow wave-particle scattering losses to the atmosphere closer to the Earth.",

Like other ET models, SSEBop model also faces a challenging issue—uncertainty from inevitable input errors, poorly defined parameters, and inadequate model structures. Recent uncertainty assessment at multiple Ameriflux tower sites showed the uncertainties of seasonal ET estimates by the SSEBop model were within a reasonable range (less than 20%). In this study, we further quantified the uncertainties of seasonal SSEBop ET estimates at 1-km pixel resolution for the contiguous U.S.A. (CONUS) from 2001 to 2014. The uncertainty analysis focused on quantifying uncertainties from errors of key parameters (i.e., difference between cold and hot temperature boundaries (dT)) and primary driving forces, including the 8-day composite 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, Global Land Data Assimilation System daily air temperature data, and USGS/EROS daily short grass reference ET data.\nThe sensitivity analysis indicated that relative errors of ET estimates from errors of input data and parameters were less than 20% in most areas of CONUS, except for western mountain areas with complex topography, southwestern bare desert areas with high albedo and dry climate conditions, and southeastern areas with high emissivity and humid climate conditions. The relative errors of ET estimates were around 30% in those specific areas where the large ET errors stemmed from errors of input data and parameters, such as LST data with errors over 1.5K, and dT with errors over 2.5K. The uncertainty assessment showed that SSEBop model is a reliable method for wide-area ET calculation. Reduction of errors from input variables (e.g., LST from MODIS) and key parameters (e.g., dT) in topographically complex areas and high albedo and emissivity surfaces can significantly improve the ET calculation of the SSEBop model.",

SOCCR-2 is inspired by the\n US Carbon Cycle Science Plan\n(2011) which emphasizes global scale research on long-lived, carbon-based greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, and the major pools and fluxes of the global carbon cycle. Accordingly, the questions framing the Plan inform this report’s topical roadmap, with a focus on US and North America in the global context: 1) How have natural processes and human actions affected the global carbon cycle on land, in the atmosphere, in the oceans and in the ecosystem interfaces (e.g. coastal, wetlands, urban-rural)? 2) How have socio-economic trends affected the levels of the primary carbon-containing gases, carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere? 3) How have species, ecosystems, natural resources and human systems been impacted by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, the associated changes in climate, and by carbon management decisions and practices? To address these aspects, SOCCR-2 will encompass the following broad assessment framework: 1) Carbon Cycle at Scales (Global Perspective, North American Perspective, US Perspective, Regional Perspective); 2) Role of carbon in systems (Soils; Water, Oceans, Vegetation; Terrestrial-aquatic Interfaces); 3) Interactions/Disturbance/Impacts from/on the carbon cycle. 4) Carbon Management Science Perspective and Decision Support (measurements, observations and monitoring for research and policy relevant decision-support etc.). In this presentation, the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group and the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Program Office will highlight the scientific context, strategy, structure, team and production process of the report, which is part of the USGCRP's Sustained National Climate Assessment process.",

            "abstract": "Electrostatic and electromagnetic waves excited by electron beam around the separatrix region are analyzed in detail during the collisionless magnetic reconnection with a weak guide field by using 2D particle-in-cell simulation with the adaptive mesh refinement. Broadband electrostatic waves are excited both in the inflow and outflow regions around the separatrices due to the electron bump-on-tail, two-stream, and Buneman instabilities. In contrast, the quasi-monochromatic electromagnetic waves are excited only in the inflow side of the separatrices due to a beam-driven Whistler instability. The localization of the Whistler waves is attributed to the non-uniformity of the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_y$. The Whistler instability is suppressed in the outflow side where $B_y$ is too small for the oblique propagation. The electrostatic waves with distinct speeds can explain the in situ spacecraft observations. From the causality point of view, the waves are generated as the consequence of the electron bulk acceleration to thermalize the particles through wave-particle interactions. These simulation results provide guidance to analyze high-resolution wave observations during reconnection in the ongoing and upcoming satellite missions, as well as in dedicated laboratory experiments.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_FB_2015.pdf\nThe FB instability mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the presence of large amplitude plasma waves in the cm to few m wavelength range in the high latitude E region whenever the ambient electric field exceeds 20 mV/m. Observations suggest that the instabilities are moving at their threshold speed when they reach their largest amplitudes. This can be explained in terms of a combination of decreasing electric field and increasing aspect angle inside individual structures. However, another feature of observations is that linear theory predicts instability for aspect angles smaller than 1.5 degree, up to maybe 2 degrees even though there is plenty of evidence to show that large amplitude structures exist at aspect angles well beyond 2 degrees during FB events. We show that this observational feature is caused by the weak altitude dependence of the eigenfrequency, which forces the aspect angle to grow monotonically with time. This means that after the structures have reached their maximum amplitude, they continue to exist, but with the caveat that their aspect angle increases while their amplitude decreases. This allows damped modes at large aspect angles to be observed. However, as the aspect angle increases, the phase velocity will also change, although that change is actually a strong function of the wavelength. This means that we must assess the real and imaginary part of the eigenfrequency to query the Doppler shift of the structures and see how they compare with observations at different radar frequencies. To this goal, we have studied both the fluid isothermal dispersion relation, as well as the full kinetic dispersion. Our results for sub-meter wavelengths show that the phase velocity remains very constant at only slightly less than the ion-acoustic speed as the aspect angle increases. At larger wavelengths, the transition to zero phase velocity proceeds according to V_d/(1+\\psi), a result in agreement with simple fluid predictions based on small growth rate considerations. The transition wavelength is controlled by the ion collision frequency. We have used our calculations to determine how the phase velocity and the growth/decay rate depend on altitude (or collision frequency) and electric field conditions. The phase velocity calculations compare favorably with observations.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate change is the combined response to global and regional radiative forcing, circulation and interactions between the atmosphere and Earth surface. A potentially key component of regional climate change derives from natural and human-caused land use and land-use change (LULC) and related atmosphere-surface feedbacks. In the first step of disentangling and quantifying the effect of LULC over the southeastern United States, we conducted a series of simulations with the RegCM4 regional climate model which includes the Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) surface physics package. Land use and vegetation types determine the specified values of a number of biophysical and physical parameters in BATS such as albedo, roughness length, stomatal resistance, and rooting depth. We ran four simulations in which we specified BATS land use types derived from harmonized reconstructions for 1650, 1850, 1920 and Landsat-based observations for 1992 (Steyaert and Knox, 2008). The simulations were run over a model domain comprising a 20 km × 20 km horizontal grid and 23 atmospheric levels for the period 1990-2000. The boundary conditions for the simulations were derived from the NCAR-NCEP Reanalysis and the NOAA Optimum Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature global data sets.\nDepending on the time periods considered, the simulations indicate regionally coherent patterns of April-September changes in surface radiation, warming and cooling of up to 2 °C or more, substantial changes in soil moisture and atmospheric humidity associated with conversion of native vegetation to agriculture and agriculture back to forest, draining of wetlands and marshes, and urbanization. Extensive draining of wetlands in the lower Mississippi Valley during the 20th century induced a robust feedback with the atmosphere which suppressed convective summertime precipitation. Our joint analysis of LULC classes and the model simulations suggests a need to be able to disaggregate land use to a finer grid and expand BATS surface types to encompass a more diverse range of wetland and soil types.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric and sea-ice conditions around Antarctica, particularly in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, respond to climate dynamics in the tropical Pacific Ocean on interannual time scales including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It has been hypothesized that the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including its floating ice shelves, also responds to this climate signal; however, this has not yet been unambiguously demonstrated. We apply multivariate singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to our 18-year (1994-2012) time series of ice-shelf height in the Amundsen Sea (AS) region. This advanced spectral method distinguishes between regular deterministic behavior (\"cycles\") at sub-decadal time scale and irregular behavior (\"noise\") at shorter time scales. Although the long-term trends of AS ice-shelf height changes are much larger than the range of interannual variability, the short-term rate of change dh/dt can vary about the trend by more than 50%. The mode of interannual variability in the AS ice-shelf height is strongly correlated with the low-frequency mode of ENSO (periodicity of ~4.5 years) as represented by the Southern Oscillation Index. The ice-shelf height in the AS is expected to respond to changes in precipitation and inflows of warm subsurface Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) into the ocean cavities under the ice shelves, altering basal melt rates. Since both of these processes affecting ice-shelf mass balance respond to changes in wind fields for different ENSO states, we expect some correlation between them. We will describe the spatial structure of AS ice-shelf height response to ENSO, and attempt to distinguish the precipitation signal from basal mass balance due to changing CDW inflows.",

            "abstract": "Using temperature probes is a common exploratory method for studying groundwater-surface water interaction due to the ease for collecting measurements and the simplicity of the different analytical solutions. This approach requires to define the surface water temperature, the groundwater temperature and a set of parameters (density and specific capacity of water, and thermal conductivity of sediments) that can be easily extracted from tabulated values under the assumption that they are homogeneous in the study area. In the case of the thermal conductivity, it is common to apply a standard value of 1.84 Wm-1 C-1 corresponding to sand. Nevertheless the environments where this method is applied, like streambeds or lake/lagoons shores, are sedimentary depositional systems with high energy and biological activity that often lead to sediments dominated by organic matter or sharp changes in grain size modifying greatly the thermal conductivity values. In this study, the thermal conductivity was measured in situ along transects where vertical temperature profiles were collected in a coastal lagoon bed receiving groundwater discharge (Ringkøbing Fjord, Denmark). A set of 4 transects with 10-20 temperature profiles during 3 different seasons was analyzed together with more than 150 thermal conductivity measurements along the working transects and in experimental parcels of 1 m2 where the cm scale spatial variability of the thermal conductivity was assessed. The application of a literature-based bulk thermal conductivity of 1.84 Wm-1 C-1 instead of field data that ranged from 0.62 to 2.19 Wm-1 C-1, produced a mean flux overestimation of 2.33 cm d-1 that, considering the low fluxes of the study area, represents an increase of 89 % and up to a factor of 3 in the most extreme cases. The changes in thermal conductivity can alter the estimated fluxes hindering the detection of patterns in groundwater discharge and modifying the interpretation of the results.",

            "abstract": "Streamlined islands are often assumed to be the product of erosion by water and are cited as evidence of aqueous flows on Mars. However, lava can build streamlined islands in a manner that is more easily explained by flow thickening followed by partial drainage of preferred lava pathways. Kīlauea’s December 1974 (D1974) flow was emplaced as a broad sheet-like flow from a series of en echelon fissures across an older hummocky pāhoehoe tumulus field. The lavas surrounded the tumuli and coalesced to fill a topographic low near the basal scarp of the Koae Fault System. As these obstacles were inundated by the D1974 flow, the lava preferentially cooled around the tumuli to form a higher viscosity zone beneath a smooth crust. Stagnation of these thinner, cooler, and more viscous zones focused the flow into a series of preferred lava pathways located between the stagnant islands. Changes in the local discharge rate disrupted the crust of the flow above the lower viscosity pathways. Older tumuli adjacent to the D1974 flow display the same relief as the flow’s islands and uncovered portions of this older flow are exposed at the tops of many islands, supporting an interpretation that islands were anchored by high-standing pre-flow tumuli. As the local lava supply waned, partial drainage of the preferred pathways occurred between the higher-standing surfaces anchored to the older tumuli. The resulting morphology consists of a relatively smooth flow field with thin margins that is dissected by depressed pathways or channels. This morphology resembles an erosional surface incised into a smooth plain, but actually represents an initial constructional process followed by partial drainage within a viscous lava flow. Many other Hawaiian rift zone, fissure-fed flow fields display comparable morphologies in the near vent facies, including islands, terraces, thin flow margins and a lack of well defined topographic levees along channels. Thus, branching channel networks and streamlined islands within fissure-fed flow fields on Mars could have resulted from a combination of initial flow thickening followed by partial drainage of preferred lava pathways, and therefore do not necessarily imply substrate erosion or modification by fluvial processes.",

            "abstract": "Microstructural and geochemical techniques combined with prior observations of naturally occurring faults provide insights into slip rates and slip dimensions of seismicity. We review four indicators for high coseismic paleotemperatures in brittle to semi-brittle faults from a wide range of tectonic settings with mm to km of slip. Thin, high-gloss, Fe-rich slip surfaces indicate high-temperature slip occurred on mm- to m-scales. Elliptical and circular zones of concentric iridescence indicate localized sites of elevated temperature that may be caused by heating at asperity contacts. The surface iridescence is associated with changes in Fe oxidation states detected by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Minimum temperature increases of 300 °C above ambient are supported by geochemical arguments and up to 800 °C are supported by analogs to high-speed friction experiments in steels and ceramics firing in reduced conditions. The presence of clay-rich foliated fault-related rocks, and the presence of nm- to mm-thick clay coatings indicate that syn-kinematic endothermic reactions occur at a range of scales. We suggest these features reflect temperature increases of ≥100-200 °C for activation energy required to drive the clay alteration is sourced from seismic energy and Schleicher-van der Pluijm-type slip surfaces to record instantaneous slip. Dense, low porosity planar porcelainite zones mm- to cm-thick along fault surfaces are the result of sintering of quartz-clay–feldspar mixtures and indicate T≥1000 °C localized along the surfaces, the result of post-slip cooling. Highly indurated, ultrafine fault-related rocks often consists of comminuted grains, vein fragments, and neocrystallized grains that represent retrograde cooling or alteration after peak heating. These observations and those of other recent workers indicate that many naturally occurring exhumed faults record elevated temperatures. In many cases, careful observations can delineate fault slip-related heating vs. hydrothermally induced alteration associated with the fault zone. These data suggest that naturally occurring faults reflect a range of coseismic to postseismic thermal processes, and enable us to elucidate and test new ideas for how seismic slip is manifested in faults.",

            "abstract": "Water flooding is increasingly being used as a method of enhanced oil recovery and frequently involves calcium carbonate reservoirs. Very often, thermodynamic conditions in the upper few hundred meters allow for hydrate formation. One possible method of preventing hydrates is to inject hydrate inhibitors such as triethylene glycol (TEG) into the reservoir. Thus, it is of importance to know how such glycols affect water wettability, which is an important factor defining the oil behavior in such reservoirs.\nWettability of a surface is defined by the contact angle of a liquid drop on the surface. The stronger the liquid is attracted to the surface, the smaller the wetting angle becomes, implying an increased degree of wetting. Therefore, it is possible to gain qualitative knowledge of the change in wetting properties with respect to external influences by studying corresponding changes in free energy of adsorption of the liquid.\nIn our work [1], we used molecular dynamics (MD) and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) to study how adsorbed TEG on the {1014} calcium carbonate surface affected adsorbed water. We used the changes in density profiles of water to estimate changes in adsorption free energy of water. The adaptive biasing force (ABF) method was applied to TEG to calculate the adsorption free energy of TEG on the calcium carbonate surface. We found that water wetting of the calcium carbonate surface decreased in the presence of adsorbed TEG.\n[1] - Olsen, R.; Leirvik, K.; Kvamme, B.; Kuznetsova, T.

When the Mach number exceeds a critical value, some of the incident ions are reflected. This needs to be included into the description of the shock structure and entropy production at the shock front. We present an analytical model of ion reflection from a quasi-perpendicular collisionless shock and the formation of the foot region associated with this reflection. Reflected ions perturb the electrostatic and magnetic fields in the foot region which we self-consistently include in determining the fraction of reflected ions, depending on the Mach number of the shock. The subsequent motion of the shock reflected ions downstream and formation of the downstream field structure is analyzed. Models for thermalization of the downstream plasma and approaches to Rankine-Hugoniot relations will also be discussed. The obtained overall shock structure is compared with the Cluster observations.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change is driving shifts in local environmental conditions, and many organisms are projected to become poorly adapted to their current ranges. Some species may respond by gradually shifting their range limits to track environmental change. This adaptation strategy is expected to be most feasible in regions with sharp climatic gradients, such as mountain ranges. However, the extent to which this process is taking place is poorly understood, and some evidence suggests that shifts upwards in elevation might be more difficult than expected. Direct empirical evidence of range shifts in response to recent climate change could inform models and conservation strategies. Here we used Monte Carlo spectral unmixing of Landsat surface reflectance data to characterize changes in vegetation cover across major North American mountain ranges over the past 30 years. This approach allows us to observe changes in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic vegetation as well as absolute change in vegetation cover. We found evidence of a gradual increase in total vegetation cover at increasing elevations, but this pattern varied in its strength both within and among mountain ranges. We also observed more dramatic changes in vegetation type which differed strongly between regions with different climates. Our analysis shows that upslope range shift is a possible climate response in many cases, but that this process does not occur uniformly.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that smoke particles modify clouds, which in turn affects climate. However, no studies have quantified the temporal dynamics of aerosol-cloud interactions with direct observations. Here, for the first time, we use temporally-offset satellite observations from northern Africa between 2006 and 2010 to quantitatively measure the effect of fire aerosols on convective cloud dynamics. We attribute a reduction in cloud fraction during periods of high aerosol optical depths to a smoke-driven inhibition of convection. We find that higher smoke burdens limit upward vertical motion, increase surface pressure, and increase low-level divergence -- meteorological indicators of convective suppression. The resulting decrease in rainfall is substantial and may increase human ignitions during the dry season. These results are corroborated by climate simulations that show a smoke-driven increase in regionally averaged shortwave tropospheric heating and decrease in convective precipitation during the fire season. Our results suggest that, in tropical regions, anthropogenic fire initiates a positive feedback loop where increased aerosol emissions limit convection, dry the surface and enable increased fire activity via human ignition.",

Despite a harsh climatic setting, a vibrant microbial and inveterate soil ecosystem is present. Predicted warming in MDVs will likely facilitate enhanced landscape hydrologic connectivity, resulting in an increased abundance of perennially wet soils. It is worthwhile to understand the moisture and energy budget of perennially wet soils to develop a predictive understanding of how soil habitats may change in the future. This work aims to quantify how the abiotic soil environment in the MDVs will change under future CMIP5 climate scenarios. Specifically, we simulate ground-temperature, soil moisture, and thaw depth in four representative landscape unit models: snow-covered soil, perennially wet soil, intermittently wet soil, and dry snow-free soil. Preliminary results show that degree-days above freezing and thaw depths are greatest beneath perennially wet soils. Furthermore, perennially wet soils exhibit the greatest climate sensitivity. Overall, these results show that enhanced wetting of MDV soils will fundamentally alter the abiotic characteristics of the soil habitat, possibly promoting changes to the form and function of soil ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "In this research we test the viability of using a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) to detect gas hydrate. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) occur at many gas hydrate sites near the thermodynamic base of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), and are frequently used to identify possible presence of gas hydrate on a regional scale. To find if drilling a BSR actually increases the chances of finding gas hydrate, we combine an updated dataset of BSR distribution from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management with a comprehensive dataset of natural gas hydrate distribution as appraised from well logs, covering an area of around 200,000 square kilometers in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The BSR dataset compiles industry 3-D seismic data, and includes mostly good-quality and high-confidence traditional and non-traditional BSRs. Resistivity well logs were used to identify the presence of gas hydrate from over 700 existing industry wells and we have found over 110 wells with likely gas hydrate occurrences.\nBy integrating the two datasets, our results show that the chances of encountering gas hydrate when drilling through a BSR is ~ 42%, while that when drilling outside the BSR is ~15%. Our preliminary analysis indicates that a positive relationship exists between BSRs and gas hydrate accumulations, and the chances of encountering gas hydrate increases almost three-fold when drilling through a BSR.\nOne interesting observation is that ~ 58% of the wells intersecting a BSR show no apparent evidence of gas hydrate. In this case, a BSR may occur at sites with no gas hydrate accumulations due to the presence of very low concentration of free gas that is not detected on resistivity logs. On the other hand, in a few wells, accumulations of gas hydrate were observed where no BSR is present. For example in a well in Atwater Valley Block 92, two intervals of gas hydrate accumulation in fractures have been identified on resistivity logs, of which, the deeper interval has 230 feet thick accumulation of gas hydrate with resistivity as high as 9 ohm*m. However, no BSR was observed at the site. We hypothesize that the absence of a BSR may be a result of gas hydrate generated in-situ within the GHSZ from biogenic sources, such that the hydrate interval does not extend to the base of GHSZ.",

The earthquake with a magnitude of 8.3, located on the Gloria Fault, was one of the largest strike slip events recorded. The Gloria fault is a 500 km long scarp in the North Atlantic Ocean between 19W and 24W known to be a segment of the Eurasia-Nubia plate boundary between Iberia and the Azores.\nTen tide stations recorded the tsunami. Six in Portugal (mainland, Azores and Madeira Islands), two in Morocco, one in the United Kingdom and one in Spain (Tenerife-Canary Islands). The tsunami waves reached Azores and Madeira Islands less than one hour after the main shock. The tide station of Casablanca (in Morocco) recorded the maximum amplitude of 0.54 m. All amplitudes recorded are lower than 0.5 m but the tsunami reached Portugal mainland in high tide conditions where the sea flooded some streets\nWe analyze the 25 November 1941 tsunami data using the tide-records in the coasts of Portugal, Spain, Morocco and UK to infer its source. The use of wavelet analysis to characterize the frequency content of the tide-records shows predominant periods of 9-13min e 18-22min.\nA preliminary location of the tsunami source location was obtained Backward Ray Tracing (BRT). The results of the BRT technique are compatible with the epicenter location of the earthquake.\nWe compute empirical Green functions for the earthquake generation area, and use a linear shallow water inversion technique to compute the initial water displacement. The comparison between forward modeling with observations shows a fair agreement with available data.\nThis work received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)\"",

            "abstract": "The calving of icebergs is responsible for a significant proportion of annual mass loss from marine-terminating glaciers and is believed to be a major factor in the rapid demise of paleo-ice sheets. Iceberg calving indirectly influences buttressing against the ice flow by controlling the structure and extent of ice mélange. This mixture of icebergs and seasonal sea ice that forms at the ice-ocean interface of many fast flowing outlet glaciers is believed to have an important influence on the flow of outlet glaciers. However, its physical properties are not well understood and there is disagreement about how to represent it in models. With recent forecasts anticipating that the majority of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet will be dynamic in origin over the next two centuries, improving understanding of the mélange is key. We applied stereo digital photogrammetric methods to a high temporal and spatial resolution time series of time-lapse imagery to generate velocity fields and elevation models of the terminal region and ice mélange of Helheim glacier in Greenland’s southeast. For the first time, we use an inverse method implemented in an ice sheet model to determine the spatial pattern of mélange rheology that is consistent with the velocity fields. We explore the variation of the rheology pattern through time to identify areas that support higher stresses and thus provide greater buttressing.",

            "abstract": "To assess the influence of hotspot anomalies on crustal accretion along the Juan de Fuca Ridge, we examine lavas and olivine-hosted melt inclusions (MIs) erupted at segments adjacent to (Coaxial) and isolated from (Cleft) the Cobb Hotspot, which currently intersects the ridge at Axial Seamount. Coaxial samples (host basalt N = 7; MIs N=113) were collected from the center of an axial rise, ~60 km north of Axial Seamount. Cleft samples were collected within the axial graben, ~100 km south of Axial Seamount (host basalts N=3; MIs N=38). The MIs and host glasses were analyzed for major, trace and volatile element concentrations. Vapor-saturation pressures of each MI were determined using CO2-H2O concentrations. Entrapment depths for Coaxial MIs range from 0-16 km below seafloor (bsf) with a broad frequency peak centered about 1.5 km bsf. By contrast, the Cleft segment MIs have a narrower range of entrapment depths (0 to 12 km bsf), with a narrow and deeper frequency distribution centered around 3 km bsf. The average rare-earth element (REE) concentrations for the MIs closely resemble those of the host-basalt glasses. Coaxial MIs display variably depleted light and heavy REE patterns and indicate variable degrees of fractional crystallization. The Cleft MIs are uniformly depleted in light REEs only, and span a narrower compositional range, indicating similar crystallization histories. This suggests a model of accretion at Cleft, where relatively homogeneous mantle melts crystallize from ~10 km bsf to the seafloor, with significant storage and crystallization in a shallow (3 km depth) melt lens. At Coaxial, crystallization begins at greater depths (~15 km bsf) with a broader, shallower peak of MI entrapment depths and more variable trace element patterns. The peaks in crystallization depths are broadly consistent with the depths for seismically imaged melt lenses (Carbotte et al., 2006) at both segments. The broader peak of MI entrapment depths observed at Coaxial may reflect the transient nature of the melt lens, as a result of variability in mantle temperatures, composition and crustal structures induced by the nearby Cobb Hotspot.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variations in precipitation isotopes have been the focus of much recent research, but relatively less work has explored changes at various temporal scales. This is partly because most spatially-diverse and long-term isotope databases are offered at a monthly resolution, while daily or event-level records are spatially and temporally limited by cost and logistics. A subset of 25 United States Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (USNIP) sites with weekly-resolution in the east-central United States was analyzed for site-specific relationships between δ18O and δD (the local meteoric water line/LMWL), δ18O and surface temperature, and δ18O and precipitation amount. Weekly data were then aggregated into monthly and seasonal data to examine the effect of aggregation on correlation and slope values for each of the relationships. Generally, increasing aggregation improved correlations (>25% for some sites) due to a reduced effect of extreme values, but estimates on regression variable error increased (>100%) because of reduced sample sizes. Aggregation resulted in small, but significant drops (5-25%) in relationship slope values for some sites. Weekly data were also grouped by month and season to explore changes in relationships throughout the year. Significant subannual variability exists in slope values and correlations even for sites with very strong overall correlations. LMWL slopes are highest in winter and lowest in summer, while the δ18O-surface temperature relationship is strongest in spring. Despite these overall trends, a high level of month-to-month and season-to-season variability is the norm for these sites. Researchers blindly applying overall relationships drawn from monthly-resolved databases to paleoclimate or environmental research risk assuming these relationships apply at all temporal resolutions. When possible, researchers should match the temporal resolution used to calculate an isotopic relationship with the temporal resolution of their applied proxy.",

            "abstract": "In preparation for the second stage of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) and as part of related research projects, borehole and surface seismic stations were installed near the intended DFDP-2 drill-site in the Whataroa Valley from late 2008. The final four borehole stations were installed within 1.2 km of the drill-site in early 2013 to provide near-field observations of any seismicity that occurred during drilling and thus provide input into operational decision-making processes if required. The basis for making operational decisions in response to any detected seismicity had been established as part of a safety review conducted in early 2014 and was implemented using a “traffic light” system, a communications plan, and other operational documents. Continuous real-time earthquake monitoring took place throughout the drilling period, between September and late December 2014, and involved a team of up to 15 seismologists working in shifts near the drill-site and overseas. Prior to drilling, records from 55 local earthquakes and 14 quarry blasts were used as master templates in a matched-filter detection algorithm to test the capabilities of the seismic network for detecting seismicity near the drill site. The newly detected microseismicity was clustered near the DFDP-1 drill site at Gaunt Creek, 7.4 km southwest of DFDP-2. Relocations of these detected events provide more information about the fault geometry in this area. Although no detectable seismicity occurred within 5 km of the drill site during the drilling period, the region is capable of generating earthquakes that would have required an operational response had they occurred while drilling was underway (including a M2.9 event northwest of Gaunt Creek on 15 August 2014). The largest event to occur while drilling was underway was of M4.5 and occurred approximately 40 km east of the DFDP-2 drill site. In this presentation, we summarize the setup and operations of the seismic network and discuss key aspects of seismicity recorded prior to and during drilling operations.",

            "abstract": "Natural processes create dynamic habitat features in large rivers and floodplains, and past land uses that restrict fluvial processes have altered habitat conditions in those environments in Puget Sound, USA. As a result, Chinook salmon and steelhead are listed as threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). To help restore these salmon populations, restoration actions often focus on removing constraints on natural processes to restore fluvial dynamics and ultimately restore critical salmon habitats on floodplains. An important aspect of this restoration effort is monitoring whether habitat conditions are improving as anticipated, yet there are currently few protocols available for monitoring trends in large river and floodplain habitats. We identified several remote-sensing metrics that are indicators of salmon habitat condition, and developed repeatable protocols for measuring those metrics. We then tested their sensitivity to land use change by comparing habitat conditions among land cover classes (developed, agriculture, forested, and mixed). As expected, metrics of habitat complexity or condition such as side-channel length, node density, wood jam area, or riparian buffer widths were highest in forested sites and lowest in agriculture and urban sites. By contrast, percent disconnected floodplain and percent armored banks were highest in developed sites and lowest in forested sites. Our results indicate that remote sensing metrics are sensitive enough to detect differences in habitat status among land cover classes, and therefore help us understand the impact of various land uses on habitat conditions. However, detecting trends in habitat condition through time may be difficult because magnitudes of change through time are very small.",

The software package provides a user-friendly graphical user interface that eases its practical use in water resources-related research and practice. The modular modeling system organizes the options available to users when assembling models according to the stages of hydrological cycle, such as potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture accounting, and snow/glacier melting processes. The software is intended to be a comprehensive tool that simplifies the task of developing, calibrating, validating, and using hydrologic models through the inclusion of intelligent automation to minimize user effort, and reduce opportunities for error. Processes so far automated include the definition of system boundaries (i.e., watershed delineation), climate and geographical input generation, and parameter calibration. Built-in post-processing toolkits greatly improve the functionality of the software as a decision support tool for water resources system management and planning. Example post-processing toolkits enable streamflow simulation at ungauged sites with predefined model parameters, and perform climate change risk assessment by means of the decision scaling approach. The software is validated through application to watersheds representing a variety of hydrologic regimes.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructing past changes in precipitation amount is critical to delineating controls on paleovegetation dynamics in South America. Although speleothem, lake, and ice core δ18O records from the region serve as a proxy of monsoon intensity, δ18O values do not serve as a direct proxy of local precipitation amount. To address this, we are developing a reconstruction of past moisture conditions using 87Sr/86Sr values measured in a fast growing speleothem (~2 mm/yr) from the central Brazilian savanna for which a late Holocene (0-1.8 ka) δ18O record has previously been developed. Speleothem 87Sr/86Sr values reflect the degree of water-rock interaction, as dictated by water residence time, and are used to interpret relative moisture conditions. In this study, we explore the potential of developing a high-resolution speleothem 87Sr/86Sr record using laser-ablation multi-collector ICP-MS by comparing analyses generated using both laser- and solution-mode techniques.\nLaser-mode techniques allow for sampling of individual speleothem lamina, which provides a higher resolution record than solution-mode techniques and eliminates the potential of contamination from conventional drilling. Preliminary results from a younger portion of the speleothem yield a laser-mode (averaged) value of 0.72294 ± 0.00046 (reproduced with parallel scans) and a solution mode value of 0.72338 ± 0.00002 suggesting that these methods provide analogous 87Sr/86Sr values. However, the preliminary results on an older portion of this speleothem have solution- mode derived values of 0.72239 ± 0.00001 and 0.72166 ± 0.00001, with corresponding laser-mode values of 0.72188 ± 0.00029 and 0.72102 ± 0.00037, respectively. Suggesting that in the older portion of the speleothem, laser-mode techniques do not yield analogous solution-mode 87Sr/86Sr values. These differences in different areas of the speleothem highlight the need for method development and further testing.",

            "abstract": "Crustal thickness in global ridge systems is widely believed to be nearly uniform (~7 km) at slow- and fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, but appears significantly thinner (< ~4 km) at ultraslow-spreading ridges. At the slowest-spreading Arctic Gakkel Ridge, the crust becomes extremely thin (1.4 – 2.9 km; [1]). The thin crust at the Gakkel and other ultraslow-spreading ridges, has been attributed to lithosphere thickening, ancient mantle depletion, lower mantle temperature, ridge obliquity, and melt retention/focusing. To better understand the magma supply at ultraslow-spreading ridges, we examined melting dynamics by linking peridotites and basalts dredged along the Gakkel Ridge. We analyzed rare earth elements in clinopyroxene from 84 residual peridotites, and estimated melting parameters for individual samples through nonlinear least squares analyses. The degrees of melting show a large variation but mainly center at around 7% assuming a somewhat arbitrary but widely used depleted MORB mantle starting composition. Thermobarometry on published primitive basaltic glasses from [2] indicates that the mantle potential temperature at the Gakkel Ridge is ~50°C cooler than that at the East Pacific Rise. The ridge-scale low-degree melting and lower mantle potential temperature place the final depth of melting at ~30 km and a melt thickness of 1.0 or 2.9 km for a triangular or trapezoidal melting regime, respectively. The final melting depth is consistent with excess conductive cooling and lithosphere thickening suggested by geodynamic models, while the estimated melt thickness is comparable to the seismic crust (1.4 – 2.9 km; [1]). The general agreement among geochemical analyses, seismic measurements, and geodynamic models supports that lower mantle potential temperature and thick lithosphere determine the ridge-scale low-degree melting and thin crust at the Gakkel Ridge, while melt retention/focusing and excess ancient mantle depletion are perhaps locally important at short length scales (e.g., < 50 – 100 km).\n[1] Jokat and Schmidt-Aursch (2007) Geophys.

            "abstract": "Marine-terminating outlet glaciers drain 90 percent of the Greenland Ice Sheet and are responsible for about half of the ice sheet’s net annual mass loss, which currently raises global sea level by 1 mm per year. The basal controls on these fast-flowing glaciers are, however, poorly understood, with the implication that numerical ice sheet models needed to predict future dynamic ice loss from Greenland relies on uncertain and often untested basal parameterizations. The Subglacial Access and Fast Ice Research Experiment – SAFIRE – is addressing this paucity of observational constraints by drilling to the bed of Store Glacier, a fast-flowing outlet glacier terminating in Uummannaq Fjord, West Greenland. In 2014, we gained access to the bed in four boreholes drilled to depths of 603-616 m near the center of the glacier, 30 km inland from the calving terminus where ice flows at a rate of 700 m/year. A seismic survey showed the glacier bed to consist of water-saturated, soft sediment. The water level in all four boreholes nevertheless dropped rapidly to 80 m below the ice surface when the drill connected with a basal water system, indicating effective drainage over a sedimentary bed. We were able to install wired sensor strings at the bed (water pressure, temperature, electrical conductivity and turbidity) and within the glacier (temperature and tilt) in three boreholes. The sensors operated for up to 80+ days before cables stretched and ultimately snapped due to high internal strain. The data collected during this sensor deployment show ice as cold as -21 degrees Celcius; yet, temperature of water in the basal water system was persistently above the local freezing point. With diurnal variations detected in several sensor records, we hypothesise that surface water lubricates the ice flow while also warming basal ice. The fast basal motion of Store Glacier not only occurs by basal sliding, but from high rates of concentrated strain in the bottom third of the glacier. Deployment of an autonomous phase-sensitive radar near the drill site complements the data collected by sensors installed in boreholes, as internal reflectors measured at hourly timescale show very high, and highly variable internal strain within the glacier. In 2016, we plan to install new sensors while also sampling cores from the bed.",

The potential value of a wetland carbon stock, in relation to its location, soon could be influential in determining governmental policy and management activities, or in stimulating market-based CO2 sequestration projects. To meet the national need for high-resolution maps, a blue carbon stock database was developed linking National Wetlands Inventory datasets with the USDA Soil Survey Geographic Database. Users of the database can identify the economic potential for carbon conservation or restoration projects within specific estuarine basins, states, wetland types, physical parameters, and land management activities. The database is geared towards both national-level assessments and local-level inquiries. Spatial analysis of the stocks show high variance within individual estuarine basins, largely dependent on geomorphic position on the landscape, though there are continental scale trends to the carbon distribution as well.

            "abstract": "All large observational datasets contain varying quality data due to instrument limitations, retrieval software imperfections, and confounding (poorly modeled) effects in the system being observed. Traditionally, we image large percentages of data that are of limited or no scientific use, so called “bad data.” The previous solution was for an instrument team to create a binary filter (quality flag) to remove unwanted observations before any analyses are performed. However, quality flags assume fully separable “good”/ “bad” data and produce a fixed percentage of data that may still be too high or low for a particular user’s needs. Additionally, atmospheric soundings are confounded by clouds and aerosols that continuously vary in optical depth and size scale without a sharp, simple boundary between “good” and “bad,” breaking the data quality concept.\nOCO2 has for the first time at JPL/NASA developed an alternative to quality flags: the award-winning DOGO (Data Ordering Genetic Optimization) system. DOGO uses machine-learning to derive a coarse ordering of the data from most to least trusted without making arbitrary good/bad decisions. By seeking to reduce metrics like stdev of southern hemisphere XCO2, difference from TCCON, and stdev of global small areas, DOGO searches the space of all possible filters and isolates a handful of predictive metadata features that, through simple formula, can be used to predict an optimal ordering. This ordering seeks to keep the above metrics reduced while gradually admitting more data for analysis. The ordering is crystallized into the Warn Level (WL) product, so named because higher Warn Levels for an individual sounding indicate higher chances that the sounding will not prove useful. Users use WL’s by accepting the soundings with lowest values first, then proceeding higher until the data volume need, coverage need, or problem tolerance is reached. DOGO’s WL’s are the official quality estimation tool provided with OCO-2 data products starting with version 7.1.\nThis discussion will focus on the precise metadata features and formula derived by DOGO for the v7.1 dataset, demonstrations of its positive impact on science results, and the critical role DOGO’s Warn Levels play in determining Bias Correction for OCO-2 XCO2.",

            "abstract": "We present lossy compression techniques, tailored to the inexact computation of sensitivity kernels, that significantly reduce the memory requirements of adjoint-based minimization schemes.\nAdjoint methods are a powerful tool to solve tomography problems in full-waveform inversion (FWI). Yet they face the challenge of massive memory requirements caused by the opposite directions of forward and adjoint simulations and the necessity to access both wavefields simultaneously during the computation of the sensitivity kernel. Thus, storage, I/O operations, and memory bandwidth become key topics in FWI.\nIn this talk, we present strategies for the temporal and spatial compression of the forward wavefield. This comprises re-interpolation with coarse time steps and an adaptive polynomial degree of the spectral element shape functions. In addition, we predict the projection errors on a hierarchy of grids and re-quantize the residuals with an adaptive floating-point accuracy to improve the approximation. Furthermore, we use the first arrivals of adjoint waves to identify \"shadow zones\" that do not contribute to the sensitivity kernel at all. Updating and storing the wavefield within these shadow zones is skipped, which reduces memory requirements and computational costs at the same time.\nCompared to check-pointing, our approach has only a negligible computational overhead, utilizing the fact that a sufficiently accurate sensitivity kernel does not require a fully resolved forward wavefield. Furthermore, we use adaptive compression thresholds during the FWI iterations to ensure convergence.\nNumerical experiments on the reservoir scale and for the Western Mediterranean prove the high potential of this approach with an effective compression factor of 500-1000. Furthermore, it is computationally cheap and easy to integrate in both, finite-differences and finite-element wave propagation codes.",

The SML is biogeochemically distinct from the underlying water and overlying atmosphere in terms of physical environment, chemical composition, and biological community. We sampled the Pacific Ocean in coastal waters off the state of Oregon (United States) along a seaward transect out from the mouth of the Columbia River (3 stations) and in deeper waters beyond the shelf break (2 stations) in July 2011. SML samples were collected using the glass plate method and the underlying water was sampled using a peristaltic pump from 1, 5 and 10 m depth. The samples were analyzed for carbohydrates and exopolymer particles. Carbohydrates were significantly enriched in the SML compared with the underlying water. The concentration of polysaccharides was higher than monosaccharides at all depths. We enumerated two classes of exopolymer particles: transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie staining particles (CSP). TEP are composed of acid polysaccharides and CSP are formed from proteins. While TEP have been widely studied, CSP are generally overlooked, despite the biogeochemical significance of proteins. Our data showed that TEP and CSP concentrations were enriched in the SML compared with the underlying waters in most cases. The ubiquitous presence of empty diatom frustules in the samples indicates that the collapse of a diatom bloom was the source of the exopolymers. Further, we conducted image analysis of particle size and abundance, which indicated that TEP and CSP are not the same particles and form distinct populations in the ocean. Our data confirm recent observations indicating that TEP are an important component of the SML. In addition, these data show that CSP are also important components of the SML.",

Early star parties tended to be strictly small, local events. But with improvements in transportation, larger regional star parties became popular. These advanced the considerable capabilities for citizen science in the amateur community, shared technology and engineering innovations in the field of telescope making, and refined numerous mathematical techniques in areas such instrument design and ephemeris generation, covering the full breadth of STEM. Advancements in astrophotography showcased at these events brought the star party from STEM to STEAM. Now, the advent of social media, web streaming, and virtual presence has facilitated the phenomenon of very large, networked star parties with international scope. These mega star parties take public engagement to a new, far greater levels, giving a vastly larger and more diverse public the opportunity to directly participate in exciting first-hand STEM activities. This presentation will recount the evolution of the star party and will focus on two examples of large, multinational, networked star parties, International Observe the Moon Night and Noche de las Estrellas.

            "abstract": "Fire regimes differ between Eurasian and North American boreal forests, due in part to differences in climate and the dominant forest types. While North American boreal forests are dominated by stand-replacing fires, much of the Eurasian boreal forest is characterized by lower intensity surface fires. These different fire regimes have important consequences for continental-scale biogeochemical cycling and surface-energy fluxes1. Here, we use generalized linear models (GLM) and boosted regression trees (BRT) to explore the relative importance of vegetation, annual climatic factors, and their interactions in determining annual fire occurrence across Eurasian and North American boreal forests. We use remotely sensed burned area (MCD64A1), land cover (MCD12Q1), and observed climate data (CRU) from 2002-2012 at 0.25° spatial resolution to quantify these relationships at annual temporal scales and continental spatial scales.\nThe spatial distribution of boreal fire occurrence was well explained with climate and vegetation variables, with similarities and differences in fire-climate-vegetation relationships between Eurasia and North America. For example, while GLMs indicate vegetation is a significant factor determining fire occurrence in both continents, the effect of climate differed. Spring temperature and precipitation are significant factors explaining fire occurrence in Eurasia, but no climate variables were significant for explaining fire occurrence in North America. BRTs complement this analysis, highlighting climatic thresholds to fire occurrence in both continents. The nature of these thresholds can vary among vegetation types, even within each continent, further implying regional sensitivity to climate-induced shifts in wildfire activity. To build on these results and better understand regional sensitivity of northern-high latitude fire regimes, future work will explore these relationships in forest-tundra and arctic tundra ecosystems, and apply historical relationships to 21st-century climate scenarios.\n1B.

            "abstract": "El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the strongest source of interannual climate variability on the planet. Its behaviour leads to major hydro-climate impacts around the world, including flooding, drought, and altering cyclone frequency. Simulating ENSO behaviour is difficult using climate models, as it is a complex non-linear system, and hence predicting its future variability under changing climate is challenging. Using palaeoclimate data thus allows an insight into long-term ENSO behaviour against a range of different forcings throughout the Holocene. To date long, coherent, high resolution records from lake sediment archives have been limited to the Pacific Rim. We present new data from the closed crater Lake Lanoto’o, on Upolu Island, Samoa, located within the tropical South Pacific. The lake sediment record extends back into the early Holocene with an average sedimentation rate 0.4mm a-1. We demonstrate a strong correspondence between precipitation at the study site and measures of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)1. We compare geochemical proxies of precipitation to a long-term reconstruction of the SOI2. The resulting proxy SOI record extends over the last 9000 years, revealing scales of change in ENSO that match those recorded from sites located on the Pacific rim3,4. A major period of La-Nina dominance occurs around 4.5ka BP before abruptly switching to El-Nino dominance around 3.2ka. Thereafter, phases of El-Nino - La Nina dominance, alternate every c. 400yrs. The results point to prolonged phases of enhanced or reduced precipitation – conditions that may influence future population resilience to climate change, and may also have been triggers for the colonisation of more remote eastern Polynesia.\n1. http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/SOI.signal.annstd.ascii.\n2.

            "abstract": "The March 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake was only the second giant (Mw ≥ 9.0) earthquake in the last 50 years and is the most recent to be recorded using modern geophysical techniques. Available data place high-resolution constraints on the kinematics of earthquake rupture, which have challenged prior knowledge about how much faults can slip in a single earthquake and the seismic potential of a partially coupled megathrust interface. But it is not clear what physical or structural characteristics have controlled either the rupture extent or the amplitude of slip. Here we use residual topography and gravity anomalies to constrain the geological structure of the overthrusting plate in NE Japan. These data reveal an abrupt SW-NE striking forearc segment boundary, across which gravity modelling indicates a south-to-north increase in the density of rocks overlying the megathrust of ~150-200 kg m-3. We suggest this boundary represents the offshore continuation of the Median Tectonic Line (MTL), which onshore juxtaposes geological terranes composed of granite-batholiths (north) and accretionary complexes (south). The megathrust north of the MTL is strongly coupled, has a history of large earthquakes (18 with Mw ≥7 since 1896) and produced peak slip exceeding 40 m in the Tohoku-oki earthquake. In contrast, the megathrust south of this boundary is weakly coupled, has not generated an earthquake with Mj ≥7 since 1923, and experienced relatively minor (if any) co-seismic slip in 2011. We show that forearcs are not passive components of subduction zones and propose that the structure and frictional properties of the overthrusting plate control megathrust coupling and seismogenic behavior in NE Japan.",

The Decadal Survey outlined a notional New Frontiers class Trojan asteroid rendezvous mission to conduct geological, elemental composition, mineralogical, and geophysical investigations. AJAX, our Discovery mission proposal, addresses the Decadal Survey science goals by using a focused payload and an innovative mission design. By responding to the most important questions about the Trojan asteroids, AJAX advances our understanding of all of the Solar System. Are these objects a remnant population of the local primordial material from which the outer planets and their satellites formed, or did they originate in the Kuiper Belt? Landed measurements of major and minor elements test hypotheses for the Trojan asteroid origin, revealing the outer Solar System dynamical history. How and when were prebiotic materials delivered to the terrestrial planets? AJAX's landed measurements include C and H concentrations, necessary to determine their inventories of volatiles and organic compounds, material delivered to the inner Solar System during the Late Heavy Bombardment. What chemical and geological processes shaped the small bodies that merged to form the planets in our Solar System? AJAX investigates the asteroid internal structure, geology, and regolith by using global high-resolution stereo and multispectral imaging, determining density and estimating interior porosity by measuring gravity, and measuring regolith mechanical properties by landing. AJAX's science phase starts with search for natural satellites and dust lifted by possible cometary activity and shape and pole position determination. AJAX descends to lower altitudes for global mapping, and conducts a low flyover for high-resolution surface characterization and measurement of hydrogen abundance. Finally, it deploys a small landed package, which measures elemental abundances and physical properties of the regolith.

The lateral leaching of particulate nutrients, however, is missing due the lack of plausible soil erosion and sediment transportation processes. This study aims to fill this missing gap by developing a physically based soil erosion and suspended sediment transport module on top of Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), which has been coupled with the Community Land Model (CLM). The conceptual design of the MOSART-sediment module will be introduced, followed by the analysis of some preliminary simulation results of riverine sediment at the global scale. Then the lateral leaching of particulate nitrogen will be added on top of MOSART-sediment, and its potential impacts on the overall nitrogen balance will be investigated in the earth system modeling context. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to shed light on the parameterization strategy. Finally current limitations and future directions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Floodplain and riparian areas provide some of the most dynamic and complex habitat mosaics found on Earth. The lateral connectivity of water and sediment during seasonal flood pulses is a key factor controlling the abiotic and biotic processes that determine floodplain habitat structure. However, riverside levees have largely eliminated floodplain hydrologic connection in human-dominated riverscapes, resulting in widespread loss of floodplain habitats and associated ecosystem services. Recently, an emphasis has been placed on the re-establishment of hydrogeomorphic processes to lowland river floodplains through the breaching of riverside levees, with the lower Cosumnes River in California’s Central Valley being one exemplar for this approach to floodplain ecosystem restoration. Observations following more than two decades of intentional and accidental levee breaches identified highly variable hydrologic and geomorphic responses to restoration actions. Principal among these observations is that narrow (<75 m) breaches generate archetypal, lobate crevasse-splay complexes, but result in minimal geomorphic change within the main river channel. However, recent observations from a wide (>400 m) levee breach identified the development of multiple and overlapping crevasse-splay complexes, along with upstream bed erosion and downstream aggradation in the main river channel. We hypothesize that geomorphic change in the main river channel adjacent to this large levee breach is the result of flood basin filling and associated water surface drawdown at flood stage. Additionally, longitudinal variability in channel capacity results in large differences in floodplain hydrologic connectivity thresholds and the duration of floodplain inundation, which ultimately influence biotic responses to flooding. Our observations suggest not all levee breaches are created equal, and an understanding of levee breach and adjacent main channel geometry is key to predicting and evaluating both hydrogeomorphic and biotic responses to this burgeoning approach to floodplain ecosystem restoration.",

Monitoring began in phases during 2012–2015 and included nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) at 40 monitoring sites nationwide. We conducted a national-scale review of near-road air pollutant concentrations, identified areas where high concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and CO occurred, and evaluated how concentrations varied by factors such as location, distance to roadway, fleet mix characteristics, and traffic volume.

The treatment of zero-distance kappa, referred to as kappa_0 and commonly attributed to material damping and scattering in the shallow crust, was given extensive consideration in these studies. Available ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) do not typically include kappa_0 as a prediction parameter and are developed for an average kappa_0 of the host region. Kappa scaling is routinely applied to adjust for the differences in average kappa between the GMPEs host regions and the target regions. The impact of kappa scaling on the results of probabilistic seismic hazard analyses is significant for nuclear and other facilities that are sensitive to high frequency ground motions (frequencies greater than about 10 Hz). There are several available approaches for deriving kappa scaling factors to GMPEs, which all require estimating kappa_0 at the target site. It is difficult to constrain the target kappa_0 empirically due to the scarcity of ground-motion data from hard-rock sites in ground-motion databases.\nThe hazard studies for the three nuclear power plants had different data, faced different challenges in the estimation of kappa_0, and used different methods for the estimation of the effect of kappa_0 on the site-specific ground motions. This presentation summarizes the approaches used for the evaluation of kappa_0 and for their incorporation in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Emphasis is given to the quantification of the kappa_0 uncertainty, and on the evaluation of its impact to the resulting seismic hazard at the different sites.\n ",

            "abstract": "Human activities have profoundly transformed the land surface through land use/land cover change (LULCC). The consequence of this transformation is twofold: First, the conversion from natural to anthropogenic systems exert a direct forcing on climate (through both biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes); Second the transformed ecosystems may modify land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms thus modulating the response to climate change or to specific weather events. The first point will be illustrated by reviewing recent modelling results, including LUCID and CMIP5 model intercomparisons, to shed some light on the relative importance of LULCC versus other climate forcings. Given the importance of LULCC impacts at the regional scale, some recent efforts to improve the representation of land processes in regional climate models [1] as well as a regional assessment of the impact of amazonian deforestation [2] will be presented. The second point will be discussed through two examples. First, the fact that LULCC may modulate certain modes of variability will be illustrated based on model experiments highlighting the regional interplay between ENSO variability and amazonian deforestation. Second, we will show that peak temperatures during heat waves can be strongly influenced locally by the type of land cover or land management practices. In particular no-till farming, by increasing surface albedo, can lead to a substantial attenuation of hot temperatures during heat waves, in part due to a more efficient radiative cooling effect during cloud-free conditions [3].\n",

            "abstract": "Conventional models of the heliosphere assume that the heliopause is formed, similarly to the magnetopause of a planet, at the location where the total pressure of the exterior (interstellar) medium is balanced by the total pressure of the interior (heliospheric) medium. The heliosphere, however, differs greatly from a planetary magnetosphere in being dominated by a continuous interior source of mass (present in some planetary magnetospheres, notably Jupiter and Saturn, but not to anything like the same extent), and it differs as well from systems with large interior mass sources such as comets (to which it has also been compared) in being threaded by magnetic flux from its central object (the Sun). The heliosphere must thus expand continually as more and more mass is put into it by the solar wind, with the heliopause marching into the interstellar medium at some non-zero speed while maintaining the plasma total (thermal plus magnetic) pressure equal to that of the interstellar medium. A steady state heliosphere is, strictly speaking, impossible unless and until the distinction between the heliospheric and the interstellar medium has disappeared. The geometry of the expansion can be visualized in different ways. Conventionally it is taken for granted that the expansion is deflected by interstellar flow sideways and channeled into an extended wake/tail region, the rest of the heliosphere being in apparently steady state. Even if this may occur, it would be at a distance much larger than commonly assumed. We explore the alternative possibility of a heliosphere expanding predominantly in the radial direction and describe some of its properties. The input from solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field during each solar cycle forms a shell, with subsequent cycles adding shells of alternating magnetic polarities. The ultimate extent of the heliosphere (in all directions) and the number of shells can be limited by the time until either the solar output or the interstellar medium have changed substantially, as well as by development of local instabilities and other processes associated with the interaction between the heliopause and the interstellar medium which may tend to destroy the distinction and merge the two.",

            "abstract": "Many present-day hot spots are located within ~ 1000 km of a mid-ocean ridge, either currently or in the geologic past, leading to frequent interaction between these two magmatic regimes. The consequent plume-ridge interactions provide a unique opportunity to test models for asthenosphere-lithosphere dynamics, with the plume acting as a tracer fluid in the problem, and excess magmatism reflecting otherwise unsampled sub-surface phenomena.\nGalapagos is an off-ridge hotspot with the mantle plume located ~150-250 km south of the plate boundary. Plume-ridge interaction in Galapagos is expressed by the formation of volcanic lineaments of islands and seamounts – e.g., the Wolf-Darwin lineament (WDL) – providing a direct probe of the plume-ridge interaction process, especially in regards to geochemical data. Although several models have been proposed to explain plume-ridge interaction in Galapagos, none adequately explain the observed characteristics, especially the WDL. In particular, predicted lithospheric fault orientations and melt density considerations appear at odds with observations, suggesting that lithospheric extension is not the primary process for formation of these islands. Other off-ridge hotspots interacting with nearby spreading ridges, such as Reunion and Louisville, also exhibit volcanic lineaments linking the plume and the ridge. Thus these lineament-type features are a common outcome of plume-ridge interaction that are indicative of the underlying physics. We propose that the lineaments are surface expressions of narrow sub-lithospheric melt channels focused towards the spreading ridge. These channels should form naturally due to the reactive infiltration instability in a two-phase flow of magma and solid mantle as demonstrated in two-phase flow simulations (e.g., Katz & Weatherley 2012). For Galapagos, we show that melt channels can persist thermodynamically over sufficient length-scales to link the plume and nearby ridge segments. We also show that the relevant timescales for magma movement through these channels are sufficiently brief to account for observed U-Th systematics along the ridge (Kokfelt et al. 2005). We suggest more generally that plume-ridge interaction may be dominated by transport of magma in melt channels rather than by solid-state mantle flow.",

The model is based on Salmon's wave-vortex approximation, which can describe flows with high Rossby number and low Froude number. After introducing an additional approximation designed to filter propagating inertia-gravity waves, the problem is reduced to the prediction of potential vorticity (PV) and the inversion of this PV to obtain the balanced wind and mass fields. This PV prediction/inversion problem is solved analytically for two types of forcing: a two-region model in which there is nonzero forcing in the cyclone core and zero forcing in the far-field; a three-region model in which there is non-zero forcing in both the cyclone core and the eyewall, with zero forcing in the far-field. The solutions of the two-region model provide insight into why tropical cyclones can have long incubation times before rapid intensification and how the size of the mature vortex can be influenced by the size of the initial vortex.

            "abstract": "The Archean North China Craton (NCC) has undergone significant reactivation since the Mesozoic in its eastern part, whereas the western part, composed mainly of the Ordos Block, has maintained its stability as a craton. As expected for a cratonic block, receiver function (RF) and seismic tomography studies suggest that Ordos has a much thicker lithospheric root than the eastern part of NCC.\nBoth RF and Virtual Deep Seismic Sounding (VDSS) have been applied to three E-W linear broadband arrays across north (~39.5°N), central (~37.5°N) and south (~36°N) Ordos. Along the central profile, the Moho suggested by VDSS is ~20km deeper than the RF Moho in the eastern part of Ordos but generally agrees with the RF Moho at west and east ends of the profile. The ~20km thick lower crust between the RF Moho and VDSS Moho is interpreted to be mafic or eclogitic in composition. Along the northern profile, the VDSS Moho agrees well with the RF Moho across the array. Along the southern profile, beneath Shanxi Graben and the Ordos block the VDSS Moho generally follows the same westward deepening trend as the RF Moho though is slightly shallower than the RF Moho beneath the Shanxi Graben at ~112ºE. The shallower VDSS Moho could be due to the fact that the VDSS reflection points are more than ~30km south of the RF conversion points at the Moho, which causes VDSS to sample different Moho depths from RF in the rift zone where strong lateral variation in crustal structure is expected. Further west, across the boundary between Ordos and the NE Tibet Plateau, the VDSS Moho rapidly shoals and then starts deepening again westward, whereas the RF Moho stays at the depth of ~50km.\nOur observations suggest that the mafic/eclogitic lower crust revealed by the central line may be limited to the central-eastern part of Ordos, rather than extending beneath the entire Ordos block. The westward thickening of the crust in the southern profile as well as the discrepancy between RF and VDSS Moho beneath the NE Tibet Plateau might be related to the lateral growth of the Tibet Plateau.",

Spectral measurements (n=3) were collected using a field radiometer in five upland and five lowland plots in a moist acidic tundra ecosystem at the Imnaviat Creek Watershed, North Slope Alaska. After spectral measurements were taken individual species were removed in the same order in each plot by clipping them at the moss layer. As individual species were removed NDVI values decreased. Decreases were greatest when dwarf shrub species Salix richardsonii sb. pulchra and Betula nana were removed. Notable increases in NDVI were observed once standing litter was removed. The NDVI values of the moss layer were comparable to intact vegetation communities depending on the bryophyte species composition. This suggests that the NDVI signal of moss is largely masked by vascular species but represents a significant factor missing from overall, large-scale NDVI signals. The results of this study corroborate recent data that points to the mismatch between ground based NDVI and aerial and satellite derived NDVI. This preliminary case study provides a strong basis for better characterization of the contribution of moss to NDVI for improved correction of air and space borne imagery.",

The GABBs project aims at enabling broader access to geospatial data exploration and computation by developing spatial data infrastructure building blocks that leverage capabilities of end-to-end application service and virtualized computing framework in HUBzero. Funded by NSF Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) initiative, GABBs provides a geospatial data architecture that integrates spatial data management, mapping and visualization and will make it available as open source. The outcome of the project will enable users to rapidly create tools and share geospatial data and tools on the web for interactive exploration of data without requiring significant software development skills, GIS expertise or IT administrative privileges. This presentation will describe the development of geospatial data infrastructure building blocks and the scientific use cases that help drive the software development, as well as seek feedback from the user communities.",

High latitude biomes are also identified as most vulnerable to changing climate. High latitudes are characterized by a strong seasonality in incoming solar radiation, weather conditions and biogeochemical processes. The strong seasonality in incoming solar radiation, not to change in response to a changing climate, constitute firm constraints on how changes in air temperature, evapotranspiration and precipitation will affect biogeochemical processes underlying the land atmosphere exchange of green house gases. Timing of the soil frost thaw and plant phenology thus constitutes two master controls on how fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 will be affected by weather conditions. In addition also the wintertime conditions importantly affect GHG fluxes both during winter time as well as during the succeeding summer. Examples will primarily be given for peatlands and coniferous forests.",

            "abstract": "Solar flares present the most dramatic energy releases from the Sun. The solar flares accelerate electrons, which form bump-on-tail distributions, and excite electrostatic waves called Langmuir waves, which are subsequently converted into escaping radiation at the fundamental and second harmonic of the electron plasma frequency by some nonlinear processes. These radio emissions are called the type III radio bursts. The sources of these bursts represent natural laboratories of beam-plasma systems. The WAVES experiment on the STEREO spacecraft contains an improved Time Domain Sampler (TDS), improved over that of all similar high time resolution receivers flown in earlier spacecraft. It is primarily intended for the study of Langmuir waves. These in situ high time resolution wave measurements enable us to identify and understand the physical processes associated with beam-plasma systems, as well as for conversion of Langmuir waves into escaping radiation at the fundamental and second harmonic of the electron plasma frequency. The waveforms captured by the TDS usually contain a variety of distortions caused by various nonlinear processes. The normalized peak intensities, wave numbers and spectral widths of these wave packets determine the nonlinear processes, which control the evolution of these wave packets. We have analyzed the in situ high time resolution measurements of Langmuir wave packets and determined their three dimensional relative peak intensities, spectral components and spectral widths. Using the frequency drifts of the type III bursts, we have estimated the velocities of the electron beams which in turn yielded the corresponding wave numbers. We will present the distributions of these important physical quantities and their implications for the theoretical models.",

            "abstract": "Ice streams in Antarctica account for most of the ice volume discharged to the ocean, and their flow variability greatly influences the mass balance of the ice sheet. Today, the Siple Coast region is the only one in West Antarctica to experience a positive mass balance of 36 Gt/yr, as a consequence of the stagnation of Kamb Ice Stream 170 years ago as well as the ongoing slowdown of Whillans Ice Stream. However, this positive trend could be temporary, as reconstructions of past flow show that the Siple Coast ice streams have experienced significant flow variability over the past millennia, with episodes of stagnation typically followed by reactivation on a centennial timescale. The impact that this internally induced variability may have on the future mass balance remains unknown.\nHere, we use the three-dimensional ice sheet model CISM to study the flow variability of the Ross ice streams over a 250 year period, during which the basal properties controlling ice flow evolve according to the distribution of meltwater in a dynamic, regional hydrological system, coupled to a subglacial till layer. To obtain realistic initial flow conditions, we assimilate the 1997 velocity data available for this region. During the forward simulation, all ice streams undergo dynamic changes, traced to persistently weak bed conditions beneath the tributaries of the currently dormant Kamb Ice Stream. This source of regional instability propagates into the catchments of Whillans as well as Bindschadler ice streams within decades, and re-organizes the flow of all the Ross ice streams within two centuries. Ice piracy from Kamb Ice Stream prolongs the fast flow on Whillans Ice Stream, maintaining its trunk active during the first modeled century. At the same time, ice piracy into the catchment of Bindschadler ice stream reactivates the relict Siple Ice Stream, which significantly reduces the mass balance for this region. The trunk of Kamb Ice Stream reactivates last (during the second half of the experiment), because high rates of basal freezing were induced after its stagnation. These model outputs are similar to the reconstruction of past flow. We discuss the mechanisms of flow migrations, and the implication for the future mass balance of the region.",

            "abstract": "Water is a sought after commodity in the solar system. It is used as an indication of life, planetary formation timescales, and signatures of past cometary impacts. In Saturn’s atmosphere there are two sources of water: an internal primordial reservoir that is confined to the troposphere, and an external source of unknown origin that delivers water to the stratosphere. Potential sources of stratospheric water include: Saturn’s main rings (via neutral infall and/or ions transported along magnetic field lines – “Ring Rain”), interplanetary dust particles, and the E-ring that is supplied with water from the plumes of Enceladus. Measuring the latitudinal and seasonal variation of H2O on Saturn will constrain the source of Saturn’s stratospheric water.\nCassini’s Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) has detected emission lines of H2O on Saturn at wavelengths of 40 and 50 microns. CIRS also retrieves the temperature of the stratosphere using CH4 lines at 7.7 microns. Using our retrieved temperatures, we derive the mole fraction of H2O at the 0.5-5 mbar level for comparison with water-source models. The latitudinal variation of stratospheric water vapor between 2004-2009 will be presented as a first step in understanding the external source of water on Saturn. The observed local maximum near Saturn’s equator supports either a neutral infall from the rings or a source in the E-ring. We will look for secondary maxima at mid-latitudes to determine whether “Ring Rain” also contributes to the inventory of water in Saturn’s upper atmosphere.",

We have developed a nonlinear model that addresses these issues: it simultaneously captures the soil’s low-strain stiffness and large-strain strength of soil, and yields reliable predictions of soil response to weak and strong shaking using as sole input the shear wave velocity profile. We here present the formulation of the model and an extensive validation study based on downhole array recordings, with peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.01-0.9g. We also show that our model, referred to as hybrid hyperbolic, outperforms existing nonlinear formulations and simplified site response analyses widely used in practice for ground motions that induce more than 0.02% of soil strain (roughly equivalent to PGA higher than 0.02g). In addition to site-specific response predictions at sites with limited site characterization, the hybrid-hyperbolic model can help improve site amplification factors of ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) by complementing the empirical data with simulated site response analyses for very strong ground shaking; as well as physics-based ground motion simulations, particularly for deeper sedimentary sites with low resonant frequencies.",

            "abstract": "Nepal and the Himalayan region are hotspots for landslide activity due to mountainous topography, complex terrain, and monsoon rains. Current research in landslide modeling and detection generally requires high resolution imagery with software aided classification or manual digitization by analysts. These methods are plagued by low spatial and temporal accuracy. Addressing issues in conventional measurement, this study combined optical data from Landsat 8, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) to create two products. The Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP) uses Landsat 8 and the ASTER DEM to identify landslides in near real-time, and provides damage assessments by mapping landslides triggered by precipitation. Detecting Real-time Increased Precipitation (DRIP) monitors precipitation levels extracted from the GPM-IMERG 30-minute product to create alerts in near real-time when current rainfall levels exceed regional threshold values. After a landslide detection is made by SLIP, historical rainfall data from DRIP is analyzed to estimate a date for the detected landslide. Together, DRIP and SLIP will be used by local and regional organizations in Nepal such as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), as well as the international scientific community to protect lives, preserve infrastructure, and manage local ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Ramanathan AGU 2015 Poster Final.pdf\nRemote sensing measurements of CO2 from space can help improve our understanding of the carbon cycle and help constrain the global carbon budget. However, such measurements need to be sufficiently accurate to detect small (1 ppm) changes in the CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) against a large background (~ 400 ppm). Satellite measurements of XCO2 using passive spectrometers, such as those from the Japanese GOSAT (Greenhouse gas Observing Satellite) and the NASA OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) are limited to daytime sunlit portions of the Earth and are susceptible to biases from clouds and aerosols. For this reason, NASA commissioned the formulation study of ASCENDS a space-based lidar mission. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s CO2 Sounder lidar is one candidate approach for the ASCENDS mission.\nThe NASA GSFC CO2 Sounder measures the CO2 mixing ratio using a pulsed multi-wavelength integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) approach. The CO2 Sounder has flown in the 2011, 2013 and 2014 ASCENDS airborne campaigns over the continental US, and has produced measurements in close agreement with in situ measurements of the CO2 column. In 2014, the CO2 Sounder upgraded its laser with a precision step-locked diode laser source to improve the lidar wavelength position accuracy. It also improved its optical receiver with a low-noise, high efficiency, HgCdTe avalanche photo diode detector. The combination of these two technologies enabled lidar XCO2 measurements with unprecedented accuracy.\nIn this presentation, we show analysis from the ASCENDS 2014 field campaign, exploring: (1) Horizontal XCO2 gradients measured by the lidar, (2) Comparisons of lidar XCO2 measurements against the Parameterized Chemistry Transport Model (PCTM), and (3) Lidar column water vapor measurements using a HDO absorption line that occurs next to the CO2 absorption line. This can reduce the uncertainty in the dry air column used in XCO2 retrievals.",

            "abstract": "On the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the evolution of the Yangtze River and its major tributaries has become an important source of data for investigating geodynamics. In particular, the timing of river incision is frequently interpreted as a proxy for the timing of surface uplift in the absence of structural evidence. We investigate the timing of the incision of the gorge at the First Bend using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating of coarse, quartz sediments from caves. Sediments were deposited when the caves were near river level and subsequently abandoned as the river incised. To resolve burial ages >5 Ma, we measured the radionuclides 10Be and 26Al, and the stable nuclide 21Ne. Results from 4 caves show that 26Al and 10Be concentrations are an order of magnitude lower in abandoned cave samples than in a river-level cave sample where deposition is active (10Be: 1.3x104 and 3.4x105 at/g). In contrast, 26Al/10Be ratios in all caves are ≥6.2 and indistinguishable within error. 21Ne concentrations range from 2.1x106 to 7.8x106 at/g. The results are consistent with an old age for the abandoned cave deposits, such that most of the radionuclides initially present have decayed and the concentrations that we measure today are the result of millions of years of exposure to muons. We solve for burial ages, taking into account in situ muogenic production, and find that the majority of the gorge (1 km) was likely incised between ~12 and 9 Ma. The results also require that the rate of river incision declined after the gorge was cut below the lowest elevation cave at 9 Ma. Inverse modeling of published low-temperature thermochronology (Ouimet et al., 2010) supports our burial age results. River capture near the First Bend, which likely integrated the modern Yangtze, likely occurred prior to the mid-Miocene incision of the gorge. In view of the geographic position of the First Bend—just downslope from the southeast margin of the Plateau—it is difficult to explain a declining rate of river incision in terms of existing models of surface uplift by lower crustal flow. Our results may be better explained by other processes, such as the onset of faulting at Tiger Leaping Gorge. Our results highlight the challenges of using the timing of river incision as a proxy for the timing of surface uplift.\nOuimet et al. (2010), Lithosphere, 2(1), doi:10.1130/L57.1",

            "abstract": "Earth's radiation budget is affected by the mineral dust blowing up from arid and semi-arid sources areas. It can act as negative radiative forcing (mainly by sunlight backscattering out to the space) and positive forcing (as absorbing solar and infrared radiation). The combination of absorption and reflection of solar radiation caused by dust microparticles can lead to a net (longwave and shortwave) negative radiative forcing at the surface and at the top of atmosphere, in opposition to the greenhouse gases.\nTransported from the Southern Hemisphere continental landmasses to the remote East Antarctic plateau (long-term transport), mineral dust travels in the high troposphere and interacts with climate. However, processes occurring during atmospheric transport from source areas to polar ice sheets are responsible for the strong reduction of dust concentration and size in the polar atmosphere. Moreover, concentration and grain size, such as mineralogy and shape of dust and aerosols, influencing the dust radiative effect are still poorly known.\nWe present here new Synchrotron radiation spectroscopy data, i.e., X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) at the Fe and Ti K edge from Talos Dome dust samples (72°49'S, 159°110'E; 2315 m a.s.l.) spanning the last two climate cycles (ca. 250 kyrs). The analysis allows the reconstruction of dust geochemistry and Fe and Ti coordination state in selected climatic periods. Dust composition changes in time provide an important contribution to the scientific knowledge on palaeoclimate changes in near coastal regions of the Antarctic ice sheet and novel information on possible changes occurred at the source areas.",

            "abstract": "Although hydrocarbon production from unconventional energy resources has increased dramatically in the last decade, total unconventional oil and gas recovery from black shales is still less than 25% and 9% of the totals in place, respectively. Further, the majority of increased hydrocarbon production results from increasing the lengths of laterals, the number of hydraulic fracturing stages, and the volume of consumptive water usage. These strategies all reduce the economic efficiency of hydrocarbon extraction. The poor recovery statistics result from an insufficient understanding of some of the key physical processes in complex, organic-rich, low porosity formations (e.g., phase behavior, fluid-rock interactions, and flow mechanisms at nano-scale confinement and the role of natural fractures and faults as conduits for flow).\nNoble gases and other hydrocarbon tracers are capably of recording subsurface fluid-rock interactions on a variety of geological scales (micro-, meso-, to macro-scale) and provide analogs for the movement of hydrocarbons in the subsurface. As such geochemical data enrich the input for the numerical modeling of multi-phase (e.g., oil, gas, and brine) fluid flow in highly heterogeneous, low permeability formations\nHerein we will present a combination of noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe abundances and isotope ratios) and molecular and isotopic hydrocarbon data from a geographically and geologically diverse set of unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs in North America. Specifically, we will include data from the Marcellus, Utica, Barnett, Eagle Ford, formations and the Illinois basin. Our presentation will include geochemical and geological interpretation and our perspective on the first steps toward building an advanced reservoir simulator for tracer transport in multicomponent multiphase compositional flow (presented separately, in Moortgat et al., 2015).

In many cases, ecosystems are dependent on the vast systems of water resting just below the surface. This groundwater supports a variety of organisms that live far from surface water and its surrounding riparian zone, where more than 70% of species reside. In order to observe the correlation of groundwater presence and biodiversity in non-riparian ecosystems, a study was conducted to look specifically at terrestrial insect species linked to groundwater in Bighorn National Forest, WY. It was hypothesized that the more groundwater present, the greater the diversity of insects would be. Sample areas were randomly selected in non-riparian zones and groundwater was evaluated using a transient electromagnetic (TEM) geophysical instrument. Electrical pulses were transmitted through a 40m by 40m square of wire to measure levels of resistivity from near the surface to several hundred meters below ground. Pulses are echoed back to the surface and received by a smaller 10m by 10m square of wire, and an even smaller 1m by 1m square of wire set inside the larger transmitting wire. An insect population and species count was then conducted within the perimeter set by the outer transmitting wire. The results were not as hypothesized. More inferred groundwater below the surface resulted in a smaller diversity of species. Inversely, the areas with a smaller diversity held a larger total population of terrestrial insects.",

Deep fog occurrence is reported in routine weather reports that are encoded in an ICOADS ship observation. Occurrence is estimated by the number of deep fog observations divided by the total present weather observations in a one-degree area centered on latitude and longitude grid point intersections. The mean fog occurrence for the summer (June-July-August) 1950-2007 was computed for each one degree point for the world.\nThere are five major world locations with coastal SST minimums due to wind driven upwelling. Four of these are during the local summer on the eastern side of a semi-permanent anticyclone on eastern sides of northern and southern mid-latitudes of the Pacifica and the Atlantic. The fifth is during the SW monsoon in the Indian Ocean. For all five of these locations, the deep fog occurrence is at maximum during the upwelling season, with the greatest occurrences concentrated along the coast and isolated over the SST minimum. For the five coastal fog maxima, the greatest and longest duration occurrence along coast occurrence is associated with the coldest sea surface temperature and longest along coast occurrence, which is along N. California- S. Oregon. In contrast, the lowest occurrence of fog and the least along coast occurrence is associated with the warmest sea surface temperatures and least along coast occurrence along the SE Arabian Peninsula. The remaining three zones, Peru-Chile, NW Africa, and SW Africa are between the two extremes in fog occurrence, along coast coverage and sea surface temperature. Peru-Chile is more complex than the others as the Peru upwelling and fog appears the more dominant although ship observations are sparse along Chile.",

Although very cold temperature and existence of charged ice particles are the most important ingredient required for PMSE to appear, several other factors could potentially influence the absolute signal strengths of these echoes. One of them is neutral air turbulence. Previous studies indicate that upper mesospheric turbulence’s strength decreases with latitudes, especially in the very high latitudes [Becker, 2004; Lubken et. al., 2009].

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs is important to the United States energy portfolio. Hydrocarbon production from new wells generally declines rapidly over the initial months of production. One possible reason for the decrease is the mineralization and clogging of microfracture networks proximal to propped fractures. One important but relatively unexplored class of reactions is oxidation of Fe(II) derived from Fe(II)-bearing mineral dissolution (primarily pyrite and siderite) and subsequent precipitation of Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides. To explore this topic, we reacted fracture fluid with sand-sized and whole rock chips from four different geological localities (Marcellus Fm., Barnett Fm., Eagle Ford Fm., and Green River Fm.) containing highly varied concentrations of clays, carbonates, and TOC. Additionally, kerogen was isolated from the Green River Fm. and reacted with fracture fluid. All the shale sands showed an initial release of Fe into solution during the first 96 hours of reaction followed by a plateau or significant drop in Fe indicating that mineral precipitation occurred. Conversely, the Fe concentrations in the kerogen reactors kept increasing throughout the 3-week experiments. The whole rock samples showed a steady increase then a plateau in Fe during the 3-weeks, indicating a slower Fe release and subsequently, slower Fe precipitation. Reactors with Marcellus Fm. Sands contained dilute HCl, water only, the fracture fluid with no headspace, and fracture fluid with no HCl. Results from these experiments show that HCl is the most important additive for the promotion of Fe release into solution. Iron oxidation is not promoted solely by O2 or organics but instead requires a combination of the two for precipitation in these systems. These results indicate that Fe redox cycling is an important and complex part of hydraulic fracturing that most likely results in production slowdown over the life of a well.",

            "abstract": "As auroral-type disturbances moved equatorward during the March 17-2015 storm, coherent E region echoes were observed simultaneously with three radar links separated by 40 km each in the east-west direction in northern Germany. One radar operated at 36.2, and the other two at 32.55 MHz. One of the latter operated in a bistatic configuration. On each radar site five separate antennas were used to locate the echoes using interferometry. The unique configuration provided an unsurpassed opportunity to study the origin and evolution of ionospheric structures in a wide field of view during a strong storm. A most noticeable feature was that over a few time intervals, several minutes in duration each, very narrow spectra were observed, with Doppler shifts roughly 1/2 the ion-acoustic speed (often called \"type III\" echoes in the past). The inferred location indicated that the echoes came from below 100 km altitude. Echoes moving at the nominal ion-acoustic speed came from higher up and/or different flow angles. In one particularly clear instance the \"Type III\" echo region came from a region 50 to 75 km in extent drifting at roughly 1.5 km/s, while moving at some small (but non-zero) flow angle with respect to the line-of-sight. In view of the observations, a reevaluation of existing theories indicates that the echoes cannot be related to ion cyclotron waves. Instead, their low altitude and flow angle dependence reveal that they are the by-product of the ion Pedersen instability, which has been investigated by a few groups in relation to a non-isothermal treatment of the Farley-Buneman instability. In our present treatment of the problem, nonlinear effects are invoked to compute the final Doppler shift of the resulting structures. We find that the stronger the electric field is, the closer the region of slow echoes has to be to the ExB direction. In our most dramatic example of Type III structures, the size of the echo region pointed to a region of high energy precipitation 50 km by 50 km in size which was moving at a speed of 1.5 km/s. Without the high energy precipitation, there would have been no plasma produced below 100 km and therefore no \"Type III\" echoes. The high energy precipitation inference is reminiscent of previous \"Type III\" radar observations that associated their occurrence with regions of auroral precipitation.",

Varying ratios of Thermal versus Epithermal, low-energy-Epithermal versus high-energy-Epithermal, and Thermal versus Fast neutron emissions are diagnostics of the depth in which hydrogen/water layers are buried within the top 1-2 meters of the regolith. In addition, we apply model calculations to Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) thermal and epithermal data, acquired on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), in specific regions of the Moon to retrieve the vertical distribution of buried ice from the remote sensing information.\nGEANT4 is a set of particle physics transport simulation codes that exploits object-oriented software methods to deliver a comprehensive and flexible toolkit that is modular and extensible, based on a free open-source development model.

Next, we address how one might incorporate nonlinear reactions into this upscaled framework. To do so we consider recent advances in reactive particle tracking methods, which suggest that the probability of reaction between two particles can be calculated as the product of two thing (i) the probability that both particles collocate and (ii) the probability of reaction given collocation. This naturally decouples the problem as (i) depends only on transport and (ii) only on chemistry. Calculating (i) in advection-diffusion systems is relatively trivial, but here we demonstrate the challenge associated with doing so in an upscaled framework such as the Spatial Markov model and propose some ways around these challenges.",

Unfortunately, many of the datasets do not permit direct comparison or are limited in either spatial or temporal extent. Concerted efforts have been made in several IGCP project (440, 509 and now 648) to address some of these issues and to facilitate more consistent data compilation and availability, especially for geochronology, regional geology, large igneous provinces and ore deposits. Existing and new compilations for palaeomagnetics and geochemistry are being added to these existing systems so as to facilitate interoperability and querying.\nGeochronology for igneous and metamorphic material provides clear evidence for cyclical events and permits distinctions not evident in detrital zircon spectra. Alternative ways to process data permit more robust interpretations so as to partly overcome sample bias related to preservation. The growing dataset also permits direct quantitative identification of potential provenance sources for detrital studies, drawing on information from multiple continents where necessary. When overlayed on a developing plate reconstruction model back to the early Proterozoic, these and other data provide important constraints on model validity. Spatial patterns for igneous and metamorphic activity, geochemical signature of igneous intrusions and of ore deposit type provide important additional constraints. \nPlate reconstruction models which require the presence of all known crustal blocks and continual integrity across multiple age steps both better constrain feasible models and identify critical blocks for which additional information are essential. They also demonstrate the importance of linear arcs when cosntraining permissible plate motions.\nModern reconstruction software such as Paleogis and GPlates allow one to effectively visualise an evolving earth, its geodyamic settings and associated ore deposits. Integration of additional information from the deeper earth, such as seismic tomography and the location of past subduction zones and slab graveyards should complete the cycle of information and further constrain viable plate models.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary dolomite rocks are commonly considered to be primarily a replacement product of the calcium carbonate components comprising the original limestone, a process known as secondary replacement dolomitization. Although numerous dolomite formations in the geologic record are composed of fine-grained crystals of micritic dolomite, an alternative process, i.e., direct precipitation, is often excluded because of the absence of visible or geochemical indicators supporting primary precipitation. We present a study of a modern coastal hypersaline lagoon, Brejo do Espinho, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, which is located in a special climatic regime where a well-defined seasonal cycle of wet and dry conditions occur. The direct precipitation of modern high-Mg calcite and Ca-dolomite mud from the lagoonal waters under low-temperature hypersaline conditions is associated with the activity of microbial organisms living in this restricted environment. The mud undergoes an early diagenetic transformation into a 100% dolomite crust on the margins of the lagoon. The biomineralization process, characterized by the variations of the physico-chemical conditions in this environment during the annual hydrologic cycle, is integrated with isotopic analysis to define the early diagenetic processes responsible for the formation of both dolomitic mud and crust. The carbon isotope values indicate a contribution of respired organic carbon, which is greater for the crust (δ13C = -9.5‰ VPDB) than mud (δ13C = -1.2‰ VPDB). The oxygen isotope values reflect a moderate degree of evaporation during mud formation (δ18O = 1.1‰ VPDB), whereas it is greatly enhanced during early diagenetic crust formation (δ18O = 4.2‰ VPDB). The clumped isotope formation temperatures derived for the Brejo do Espinho mud is 34°C and 32°C for the crust. These temperatures are consistent with the upper range of measured values during the dry season when the lagoon experiences the most hypersaline conditions.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography can reveal the spatial seismic structure of the mantle, but has little ability to constrain composition, phase or temperature. In contrast, petrology and geochemistry can give insights into mantle composition, but have severely limited spatial control on magma sources. For these reasons, results from these three disciplines are often interpreted jointly. Nevertheless, the limitations of each method are often underestimated, and underlying assumptions de-emphasized. Examples of the limitations of seismic tomography include its ability to image in detail the three-dimensional structure of the mantle or to determine with certainty the strengths of anomalies. Despite this, published seismic anomaly strengths are often unjustifiably translated directly into physical parameters. Tomography yields seismological parameters such as wave speed and attenuation, not geological or thermal parameters. Much of the mantle is poorly sampled by seismic waves, and resolution- and error-assessment methods do not express the true uncertainties. These and other problems have become highlighted in recent years as a result of multiple tomography experiments performed by different research groups, in areas of particular interest e.g., Yellowstone. The repeatability of the results is often poorer than the calculated resolutions. The ability of geochemistry and petrology to identify magma sources and locations is typically overestimated. These methods have little ability to determine source depths. Models that assign geochemical signatures to specific layers in the mantle, including the transition zone, the lower mantle, and the core-mantle boundary, are based on speculative models that cannot be verified and for which viable, less-astonishing alternatives are available. Our knowledge is poor of the size, distribution and location of protoliths, and of metasomatism of magma sources, the nature of the partial-melting and melt-extraction process, the mixing of disparate melts, and the re-assimilation of crust and mantle lithosphere by rising melt. Interpretations of seismic tomography, petrologic and geochemical observations, and all three together, are ambiguous, and this needs to be emphasized more in presenting interpretations so that the viability of the models can be assessed more reliably.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is a key control on the physical properties of the mantle, in particular the extent of melting during upwelling. It is not, however, a unique control on many of the parameters used to estimate mantle temperature. For example igneous crustal thickness which has often been used as a first-order proxy for mantle temperature, is also affected by mantle lithology and plume flux. Alternatives to geophysical indicators of mantle temperature are petrological thermometers. However, these record crystallisation temperatures, therefore a series of assumptions about the coupled melt- solid mantle thermal history must be made when calculating back to mantle potential temperature. In this study we investigate how these assumptions may affect mantle temperature estimates and how crystallisation temperatures may offer insights into the melting and melt transport processes, focussing on a new set of crystallisation temperature estimates we have made on primitive Icelandic basalts.\nWe used the aluminium-in-olivine thermometer of Coogan et al. (2014) to estimate crystallisation temperatures of olivine phenocrysts in a suite of samples from the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) of Iceland. The data suggest that within a single volcanic system crystallisation temperature depends strongly on the olivine forsterite content, thus the history of melt evolution, and how the eruption samples this, must be considered when extrapolating to mantle temperature. To assess the influence of the assumptions required to obtain mantle temperature we constructed a simple thermal model incorporating varying proportions of lherzolite, pyroxenite and harzburgite undergoing decompression melting. A trade off between increasing mantle temperature and decreasing pyroxenite (or increasing harzburgite) in the source is observed. Using this dataset and our model, calculations reveal a potential temperature of 1470±130 °C for Iceland, and a temperature excess of 150±40 °C relative to ambient mantle. These estimates are consistent with temperatures estimated using crustal thickness and melt chemistry.",

The information on the onset of the caldera-forming eruption is gone due to the catastrophic eruption, but Ikeda caldera is a relatively small-scale eruption that the information before the eruption may have been conserved. We conducted a geological research to understand the eruptive history of Ikeda caldera, including a study of the processes leading to the catastrophic eruption. Pre-caldera activity began at about 20 cal kBP by Iwamoto ash and the effusion of Senta lava, which may have similar composition as the caldera-forming eruption. The caldera-forming eruption began at 6.4 cal kBP with a phreatic explosion that produced the Ikezaki tephra. The phreatic eruption was followed by Osagari scoria, Mizusako scoria and Ikeda pumice plinian eruption. During the climactic stage, Ikeda ignimbrite was erupted and reclaimed the coastal area at that time, and formed the ignimbrite plateau along the coast. Immediately after this event, four maars were formed to the southeast of the caldera. Yamagawa maar, which is the largest and is located at the southeastern end of the fissure vent, erupted pumiceous base surge (Yamagawa base surge), but other maars ejected small amount of accidental materials. During the late stage of the Ikeda eruption, phreatomagmatic eruption occurred at the bottom of the caldera floor, and erupted the Ikedako ash which covered a wide area. The Central lava dome was generated at the late stage of this eruption. After Ikedako ash deposition, secondary explosion of Ikeda ignimbrite occurred mainly along the coastal area, generating small-scale base surge deposits. About two thousand years after the caldera-forming eruption at 4.8 cal kBP, new magmatic activity began on the margin of the caldera rim, and generated Nabeshimadake lava dome.",

This is performed through the decomposition of the 3x3 coherency matrix [T], matrix which retains spatial-power information over a “target area”. This leads to the concept of distributed target which averaged backscattered power can be related to simple canonical targets. SAR data are in essence the coherent summation of backscattered signals from multiple scatterers. It follows that the concept of distributed target relies on the statistical variability of the physical scattering mechanisms within the target. In the present communication, we analyse the different physical scattering mechanisms which may be correlated with several sea ice environments as classified using a Wishart classifier. Results underline that the classification must be analysed as much in terms of backscattered energy as in terms of diffused energy away from the satellite.",

Our regression model also holds for high-rate GPS derived strains during the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, from GEONET subnetworks located as close as 140 km, indicating that the model does not saturate for large earthquakes. Moreover, using linear mixed-effects regression, we show that the largest source of bias in the residual mean squared error in the magnitude-distance regression arises from effects associated with the source and/or propagation path, rather than with the station. For instance, earthquakes on the Blanco fracture zone produce dynamic strains with lower amplitudes on average than earthquakes around the Sierra microplate, indicating that dynamic strains are also affected by earthquake source parameters other than the magnitude; these source and path effects are not large enough to degrade the relationship between dynamic strain and magnitude and distance though. We also show that by including PBO stations into current source characterization efforts would enhance station density significantly in critical regions. That is, 32 (41%) of the BSMs are located within 280 km from the trench axis of the Cascadia subduction zone where, for example, the probability of a M9 earthquake within 50 years might be as high as 15% and the probability of a smaller but still damaging M8 event might be as high as 40% (Goldfinger, et al., 2012). Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of BSMs to earthquake early warning and discuss challenges associated with real-time implementation.",

The LCU is tectonically sandwiched between the eclogitic Zermatt-Saas Zone (ZSZ; 540 °C-3.2 GPa) [4] and the blueschist Combin Zone (400 °C-0.9 GPa) [5] along a tectonic structure joining HP units recording a ~1.2 GPa (40 km) pressure difference. So far, the ZSZ has been attributed to normal HP conditions and the mechanism driving exhumation and accretion of the LCU in its present structural position is not fully understood.\nWe performed petrography and bulk-rock trace element analyses of rocks from LCU and ZSZ serpentinites. We observed that, while serpentinites in the core of the ZSZ show normal subduction zone trace elements and REE’s patterns, the Ol+Ti-chu+Chl veins and host serpentinites enveloping the LCU are strongly enriched in sediment-derived fluid-mobile elements (U, Th, Nb, Ta, Ce, Y, As, Sb) and REE’s: their patterns well match those of the closely associated LCU-UHP rocks.\nThe presence of extremely enriched Ol+Ti-chu+Chl veins in the serpentinites at direct contact with the UHP Lago di Cignana Unit suggests that fluid exchange between serpentinite and LCU crustal rocks occurred at peak metamorphic conditions. Their coupling therefore occurred during subduction burial and/or peak UHP conditions. As such, the buoyancy force originating from the relatively light serpentinites fuelled the exhumation of the Lago di Cignana Unit. In this contest, the tectonic contact between the Zermatt-Saas Zone and the Combin Zone evolved into a true tectonic plate interface surface.\n1. Reinecke (1998). Lithos 42(3), 147-189; 2.

            "abstract": "The water resources of the Black Volta Basin in West Africa constitute a major resource for the four countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali) that share it. For Burkina Faso and Ghana, the river is the main natural resource around which the development of the diverse sectors of the two economies is built. Whereas Ghana relies heavily on the river for energy, land-locked Burkina Faso continuously develops the water for agricultural purposes. Such important role of the river makes it an element around which there are potential conflicts: either among riparian countries or within the individual countries themselves. This study documents the changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in the Black Volta Basin region for the past (1981-2010) and makes projections for the mid-late 21st century (2051-2080) under two emission scenarios; RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) temperature- and precipitation-based indices are computed with the RClimdex software. Observed daily records and downscaled CORDEX data of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures are used for historical and future trend analysis respectively. In general low emission scenarios show increases in the cold extremes. The region shows a consistent pattern of trends in hot extremes for the 1990’s. An increasing trend in hot extremes is expected in the future under RCP 8.5 while RCP 2.5 shows reductions in hot extremes. Regardless of the emission scenario, projections show more frequent hot nights in the 21st century. Generally, the region shows variability in trends for future extreme precipitation indices with only a few of the trends being statistically significant (5% level). Results obtained provide a basic and first step to understanding how climatic extremes have been changing in the Volta Basin region and gives an idea of what to expect in the future. Such studies will also help in making informed decisions on water management in the basin. The various water users; agriculture, household, industries will be able to prepare adequately and adapt to changes when they have information of the trends of extreme events well ahead of time.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the crustal storage depths of magmas is important in understanding volcanism. The reaction: anorthite (pl) = Ca-Tschermak’s (cpx) + silica (Q or liq) has a large volume change and hence offers potential as a geobarometer, but has not been extensively exploited as such. One of the chief barriers to its wide application is consistent estimation of melt silica activity for assemblages that lack quartz. We have skirted this problem by confining attention to metaluminous silicic compositions (SiO2 > 60% by weight), for which silica activity during crystallization is presumed to be close to 1, and calibrated the barometer for the range 0 - 2 GPa using the LEPR database and additional experiments from the literature. Additional improvement is obtained by excluding hydrous phase-bearing assemblages. Despite the analytical uncertainties present in older experimental investigations, with knowledge of temperature, and clinopyroxene, plagioclase and host melt compositions, pressures for amphibole- and biotite-free dacites and rhyolites can be estimated to ±0.17 GPa (1 sigma). The limitations of the barometer render it most applicable to intraplate, A-type rhyolites. Application to one such system, the Snake River Plain rhyolites, indicate that both melt-hosted phenocrysts and clinopyroxene-plagioclase aggregate grains found in these rhyolites formed at low pressures, <0.5 GPa. This is consistent with isotopic evidence for a shallow crustal origin for Snake River Plain rhyolites.",

For this purpose different techniques are applied, including comparative analysis with global data, which are available in the region for the moderate size earthquakes (i.e. magnitude larger than 3.0).\nUsing the revised data, a quantitative analysis of seismicity patterns is performed. In particular, a formal method for detection of earthquake clusters, based on nearest-neighbor distances of events in space-time-energy domain, is applied. Different techniques are considered to estimate the main parameters that characterize seismicity in the region, including the b-value and the fractal dimension. Stability tests are carried out with respect to the time span of the input catalog.\nResults from clusters identification are discussed and are compared with those from earlier studies, discussing limits and possible improvements.",

            "abstract": "With an average mole fraction of 100 ppb carbon monoxide (CO) plays a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and thus has an indirect global warming potential. While sources/sinks of CO on land at least partially cancel out each other, the magnitude of CO sources and sinks is highly uncertain. Even if direct CO fluxes from/to land ecosystems are very much likely clearly lower in magnitude compared to anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning, emissions from chemical precursors and the OH sink, it may be premature to neglect any direct contributions of land ecosystems to the CO budget. In addition, changes in global climate and resulting changes in global productivity may require re-evaluating older data and assumptions. One major reason for the large uncertainty is a general scarcity of empirical data. An additional factor contributing to the uncertainty is the lack of ecosystem-scale CO exchange measurements, i.e. CO flux data that encompass all sources and sinks within an ecosystem. Here we present data on continuous eddy covariance measurements of CO-fluxes above a managed mountain grassland in combination with soil chamber flux measurements, within- and above-canopy concentration profiles and an inverse Lagrangian analysis to disentangle sinks and sources of CO. Preliminary results show the grassland ecosystem to be a net source for CO during daytime, with increasing flux rates at higher solar radiation. At night, if at all, the meadow is a slight sink for CO. The same holds true for soil flux measurements.",

The BDSR mechanism provides a means for acoustic signals and noise from distant sources to appear with significant strength on the deep seafloor. At depths greater than the conjugate depth ambient noise and PE- predicted arrivals are sufficiently quiet that BDSR paths, scattered from small seamounts, can be the largest amplitude arrivals observed. The Ocean Bottom Seismometer Augmentation in the North Pacific (OBSANP) Experiment in June-July 2013 was designed to further define the characteristics of the BDSRs and to understand the conditions under which BDSRs are excited and propagate. An example of BDSR arrivals is shown on the record section in the figure. Other arrivals are the direct water wave and first and second multiples. The reciprocal of the BDSR mechanism also plays a role in T-phase excitation. To further understand the BDSR mechanism, the SPECFEM3D code was extended to handle high-frequency, deep water bottom scattering problems with actual bathymetry and a typical sound speed profile in the water column.

            "abstract": "We use an Earth System model with a dynamic land-ice component to explore several inconsistencies between traditional Milankovitch theory and δ18O sediment records of the Pleistocene. Our model results show that a combination of albedo feedbacks, seasonal offset of precession forcing, and orbital cycle duration differences can explain much of the 41-kyr glacial cycles that characterize the early Pleistocene. The obliquity-controlled changes in annual average high-latitude insolation produce large variations in arctic vegetation-type and sea-ice cover, which amplify the land-ice response. In contrast, the seasonal nature of the precession insolation signal dampens net ice-melt. For instance, when precession enhances ice melt in the spring, it reduces ice melt in the fall, and vice versa. The lower frequency of obliquity cycles in combination with amplified climate sensitivity due to albedo feedbacks help produce a larger ice-volume response to cycles of obliquity compared to precession, despite precession contributing more to variations in high-latitude summer insolation.\nIn addition, we can simulate the appearance of a 100-kyr ice-volume signal by reducing basal sliding in the ice sheet model. Model experiments with enhanced basal drag have greater ice sheet elevation because the ice sheets are not able to flow as quickly, leading to increased ice thickness at the expense of ice extent. These thicker ice sheets have colder surface temperatures, receive more snowfall, and do not readily advance past the ice equilibrium line. Greater high-latitude summer insolation from the combination of high obliquity and precession/eccentricity is then necessary to cause complete ice sheet retreat. This research lends support to the regolith hypothesis, which proposes gradual erosion of high-latitude northern hemisphere regolith by multiple cycles of glaciation helped cause the mid-Pleistocene transition.",

This tunnel extends roughly 300 feet into the hillside, with a maximum depth below the surface of approximately 300 feet. We will deploy LANL’s Mini Muon Tracker (MMT), a detector consisting of 576 drift tubes arranged in alternating parallel planes of orthogonally oriented tubes. This detector is capable of precise determination of trajectories for incoming muons with angular resolution of a few milliradians.\nWe will deploy the MMT at several locations within the tunnel, to obtain numerous crossing muon trajectories and permit a 3D tomographic image of the overburden to be built. In the same project, UNM will use a Scintrex digital gravimeter to collect high-precision gravity data from a dense grid on the hill slope above the tunnel as well as within the tunnel itself. This will provide both direct and differential gravity readings for density modeling of the overburden. By leveraging detailed geologic knowledge of the canyon and the lithology overlying the tunnel, as well as the structural elements, elevations and blueprints of the tunnel itself, we will evaluate the muon and gravity data both independently and in a simultaneous, joint inversion to build a combined 3D density model of the overburden.",

            "abstract": "Observations of solar energetic particles (SEPs) over Solar Cycles 22-24 included the measurement of their pitch-angle distributions (PADs). When only magnetically “well-connected” SEP events were selected, i.e., with the spacecraft on interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines whose coronal foot-points were within about 30 deg of the associated flare site, the PADs were usually “beam-like” during the rise-to-maximum phase (RTM) of the events. This nearly “scatter-free” propagation (due to magnetic focusing of the IMF) revealed that the injection times of the SEPs were delayed up to 10s of minutes after the onset of electromagnetic emissions from the flare. Direct comparison with the flare-associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the western hemisphere indicated that the SEP acceleration/injection was occurring at least 1 Rs into the corona (and often continuing well above that radial distance). Moreover, the RTM profiles exhibited a continuum of shapes, from “spikes” to “pulses” to “ramps”, and these shape characterizations ordered the properties of the associated CMEs. Most importantly, when compared at nearly the same near-relativistic velocities, electrons and protons exhibited similar PADs and RTM profiles. Clearly, such orderly patterns in the data call for a single dominant acceleration process that treats all particles of similar velocities the same, regardless of mass and charge. A simple theory that meets all of these requirements, based on nearly scatter-free propagation and energy change within particle “reservoirs” (such as the closed magnetic structure of a CME), has recently been proposed [Roelof, Proc. 14th Ann. Int’l. Astrophys. Conf., IOP, in press, 2015]. The acceleration results from compression (-divV) of the driver plasma, well sunward of the CME shock. Acceleration (e-folding) times of only a few minutes can be obtained from representative parameters of 1000 km/s CMEs. A companion paper [Roelof and Vourlidas, op. cit.], proposed a new observational technique by which (divV) may be extracted directly from coronograph white-light movies of out-going CMEs, thus offering observational closure of the new theory for SEP acceleration/injection that should be relevant to the Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge about lightning activities in tropical cyclones (TCs) has been increasing during the last few years. Previous studies showed variation of spatial and temporal characteristics of TC lightning, and indicated the potential of using lightning data to predict changes of storm intensity and evolution of structure. Typhoon Molave (2009) exhibited strong convection and intense lightning during its landfall in China. In this work, lightning data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), as well as data from S-band Radar were utilized to study the evolution of lightning during landfall and to investigate its relationship to TC convection. Simulation results from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) mesoscale model (version 3.2.1) were used to focus on the convective properties of Molave. The model reproduced well the strong convections in the inner core and rainbands, and featured the horizontal and vertical characteristics of convection evolution of the typhoon.\nOur results showed that lightning in the inner core outbreak prior to the maximum intensity of the storm and the bursts could be a good indicator of the imminent intensification of the storm. The large concentrations and increased distribution height of graupel and cloud water particles in the inner core, and the enhancement of updraft velocity were the main reasons for lightning outbreak in the inner core. The increased concentration of ice phase particles and the emergence of strong convection nuclear in the outer rainbands caused the peak frequency of TC lightning at the maximum intensity of the storm.",

            "abstract": "The current climatic mean state of the Pacific is characterized by trade wind induced upwelling of cold water in the east and accumulation of warm surface waters in the west, resulting in a strong E-W sea surface temperature (SST) gradient. The initiation and propagation of ENSO events are due to perturbations in this system. Changes in the mean state have the potential to alter ENSO-related processes, feedbacks, and properties. However, it remains unclear how ENSO feedbacks interact as the mean state changes - an increasingly important question as current climate warms, potentially altering the mean state.\nHere, we use the abrupt climate warming events of Marine Isotope Stage 3 from 32-64 kyr as a natural experiment for understanding how the tropical Pacific mean state varied across past periods of rapid climate warming. We measured Mg/Ca ratios in the thermocline dwelling planktonic foraminifera N. dutertrei as a proxy for thermocline temperature variability from Eastern Pacific sediment core MV1014-17JC (0°10.8’S, 85°52.0’W). Reconstructing subsurface temperatures removes the seasonal cycle imprint on SSTs, and instead, thermocline temperatures vary with ENSO conditions. Our record reveals that interstadial warming events are characterized by a more El Niño-like mean state, characterized by increased thermocline temperatures up to 6°C. Thermocline warming events are more pronounced from 64-44 kyr when overall global climate was in a warmer state. Moving from 44-32 kyr, our record shows cooler thermocline temperatures, suggesting a shift to a more La Niña-like mean state, as climate began transitioning into the Glacial Maximum.\nWe also measured Mg/Ca ratios in the surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera G. ruber. Our G. ruber SST record displays the same cooling trend as the N. dutertrei record from 64-32 kyr. SSTs cool 1-1.5°C while thermocline temperatures cool 2.5-3°C. Preliminary comparison with a SST record from the Western Pacific suggests a strengthening of the E-W SST gradient from 44-32 kyr, consistent with our N. dutertrei record revealing a shift to a more La Niña-like mean state. We will also present a record of G. ruber δ18OSW variability from the same sediment core, along with a synthesis of available tropical Pacific δ18OSW records to examine hydrologic variability across MIS 3.",

            "abstract": "The continental shelf region off the Washington-Oregon-California coast is seasonally exposed to water with a low aragonite saturation state by coastal upwelling of CO2-rich waters. To date, the spatial and temporal distribution of anthropogenic CO2 (Canth) contribution to the CO2-rich waters is largely unknown. Here we use an adaptation of the linear regression approach described in Feely et al. (2008) to utilize the GO-SHIP Repeat Hydrography data set from the northeast Pacific to establish an annually updated relationship between Canth and potential density. This relationship was then used with the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program West Coast cruise data sets from 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2013 to determine the spatial variations of Canth in the upwelled water. Our results show large spatial differences in Canth in surface waters along the coast with the lowest values (40-45 µmol kg-1) in strong upwelling regions of off northern California and southern Oregon and higher values (50-70 µmol kg-1) to the north and south of this region. Canth contributes an average of about 70 % of the increased amount of dissolved inorganic carbon in the upwelled waters at the surface relative to what would be expected from physical circulation and exchange with a preindustrial atmosphere alone. In contrast, Canth contributes an average of about 31%, and 16% of the increased amount of dissolved inorganic carbon at 50 m depth, and at 100 m depth respectively. The remaining contributions are either due to respiration processes in the water that was upwelled and transported to coastal regions or respiration processes that occurs locally during the course of the upwelling season. The uptake of Canth has caused the aragonite saturation horizon to shoal by approximately 30-50 m since preindustrial period so that the undersaturated waters are well within the regions of the continental shelf that affect the biological communities.",

This cross-site comparative assessment provides an overview of factors that influence streamflow dynamics at ten relatively undisturbed reference watersheds in the USFS EFR network across the continental United States, including low-gradient watersheds with wetlands that generally have lower water yields, lower runoff ratios, and higher evapotranspiration than upland-dominated watersheds. We used daily flow duration curves (FDCs) to illustrate and compare streamflow magnitude and distributions from these watersheds located in vastly different eco-hydrologic regions. Monthly average flows were also calculated to characterize variability within and among sites and a dryness index (a ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation) was used as an indicator of energy limited versus moisture limited watersheds. Results generally indicated that snowmelt-dominated watersheds have lower relative variance in discharge, that larger watersheds have dampened high flows with large baseflows, and that none of the site characteristic parameters considered, except rainfall, had a significant (α = 0.05) relationship with annual streamflow. Despite the differences among site characteristics, widely different sites produced very similar FDCs. While some seasonal flow patterns were observed among sites along the eastern and the western near-coastal areas, rain and snowmelt water flow paths were shown to vary greatly across and within six reference watersheds, potentially affecting the timing and peak of storm runoff. However, using the dryness index, a threshold of 0.50-0.70 was found to separate sites with high or low runoff coefficients (the ratio of streamflow to precipitation). The long term data from USFS EFR reference watersheds have been and will continue to be valuable in developing, calibrating, and validating hydrologic models to address contemporary issues, such as the impacts of climate and land use change on hydrology, biogeochemistry, and water supply throughout the country.",

In addition, the vertical profiles of 14CO2 from ~2 km to the lower stratosphere in 2012 and 2013 provide much needed constraints on the vertical distribution of 14CO2 necessary for modeling studies that seek to (1) quantify the partitioning of carbon between the atmosphere, biosphere, and oceans, and (2) infer regional fossil fuel emissions from the large number of 14CO2 measurements made at Earth’s surface.",

            "abstract": "The Guliya ice cap, located in the Kunlun Mountains in the western Third Pole (TP) region near the northern limit of the southwest monsoon influence, may be the only non-polar ice field that provides detailed histories of climate and environment over the last glacial cycle. A continuous climate record from an ice core drilled in 1992 contains Eemian ice, and basal temperatures measured that year confirmed that the record was not being removed from the bottom. The δ18O record throughout Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS2) displays the occurrence of high-amplitude (~20‰) episodes of ~200-year periodicity, and the aerosol records suggest snow cover, regional vegetation and fire frequency that vary in synchrony. These oscillations might reflect the movement of the northernmost penetration of the monsoon precipitation through the Late Glacial Stage, which is restricted by the topographic barrier posed by the Kunlun range, and might also reflect solar-driven nonlinearities in the climate system such as sudden shifts in the jet stream. Recent model simulations suggest that glacial cooling over China was significantly amplified by stationary waves, and the Guliya MIS2 oscillations could reflect cyclical variability in these waves. These results are supported by clumped isotope thermometry of carbonates from the Chinese Loess Plateau, which indicate a 6 to 7oC decrease in Last Glacial Maximum summer temperatures. These studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving such high-frequency, high-amplitude oscillations.\nA review of the 2015 Sino-American cooperative ice core drilling program on Guliya is presented. This program will serve as a flagship for the TP Environment Program, an international, multidisciplinary collaboration among professionals and students in 14 countries designed to investigate environmental changes across the TP. The rapidly warming TP contains ~46,000 glaciers that collectively hold one of Earth’s largest stores of fresh water that feeds Asia’s largest rivers and helps sustain 1.5 billion people. Information on the accelerating warming of these glaciers and the impact on future water resources in this important region is urgently needed to help guide mitigation and adaptation policies.\n ",

            "abstract": "We present results from a comprehensive observing simulation system for remote sensing observations by the Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) and Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) missions. These NASA missions to explore the terrestrial thermosphere and ionosphere are planned for launch in 2017. The GOLD instrument is a far-ultraviolet spectrograph to be deployed on a commercial communications satellite at geostationary orbit. It will measure thermospheric temperature and composition during the day, and electron density at night, to understand the global effects of solar and geomagnetic events on the thermosphere-ionosphere system. ICON is an Explorer-class satellite to be launched into low-Earth orbit at 27 degrees inclination, and will measure thermosphere and ionosphere parameters with multiple remote-sensing and in-situ instruments, to discover the connections between lower atmosphere weather and changes in the low-latitude ionosphere. Instrument development, algorithm development, and ultimately data analysis, depend on a robust capability for simulating what we expect the instruments to observe. Therefore, we are constructing a flexible software system to serve both missions. The system uses simulations from general circulation models of the atmosphere-ionosphere system as input to an airglow model, performs spectral synthesis calculations, and applies observational parameters to predict what the instruments may observe from a generalized viewing geometry that can be applied to other space-based remote sensing measurements as well. In this presentation, we describe the system architecture and methodology, and present preliminary simulation results.",

            "abstract": "Impervious surfaces in urban areas generate excess runoff, which in turn causes flooding, combined sewer overflows, and degradation of adjacent surface waters. Municipal environmental protection agencies have shown a growing interest in mitigating these effects with ‘green’ infrastructure practices that partially restore the perviousness and water holding capacity of urban centers. Assessment of the performance of current and future green infrastructure projects is hindered by the lack of adequate hydrological modeling tools; conventional techniques fail to account for the complex flow pathways of urban environments, and detailed analyses are difficult to prepare for the very large domains in which green infrastructure projects are implemented. Currently, no standard toolset exists that can rapidly and conveniently predict runoff, consequent inundations, and sewer overflows at a city-wide scale. We demonstrate how streamlined modeling techniques can be used with open-source GIS software to efficiently model runoff in large urban catchments. Hydraulic parameters and flow paths through city blocks, roadways, and sewer drains are automatically generated from GIS layers, and ultimately urban flow simulations can be executed for a variety of rainfall conditions. With this methodology, users can understand the implications of large-scale land use changes and green/gray storm water retention systems on hydraulic loading, peak flow rates, and runoff volumes.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, streamflow recession events has often been evaluated by comparing the rate of change in flow (dQ/dt) versus the concurrent average flow (Q) within so-called dQ/dt-Q graphs. Recent work has evaluated independent streamflow recession events instead of a cloud of all dQ/dt and Q data points plotted irrespective of time of occurrence. When viewed as individual events, the dQ/dt-Q cloud displays meaningful structure, with individual curves having relatively constant slope and displaying seasonal offsets. With this shift to evaluating independent recession curves, recession has also been considered as possibly being dependent on landscape features instead of being dependent on aquifer properties.\nFrom the viewpoint of considering landscape controls on recession, we consider whether spatial heterogeneity in flow at the scale of first-order subcatchments can explain the behavior of recession in mesoscale watersheds. We present continuous flow data collected concurrently in multiple, small first-order subcatchments that drain to a common outlet. To compare among subcatchments, we make use of area-normalized fractional flow [ (Qsub/Areasub)/(Qmain/Areamain) where “sub” refers to the respective subcatchment and “main” refers to the main catchment each subcatchment is nested within] . We observe clear variations in area-normalized fraction flow contributions among subcatchments. In particular, we see that some subcatchments contribute flow disproportionately larger than their drainage area early in the baseflow period while others contribute relatively little early on but contribute disproportionately larger amounts during later baseflow periods. This difference in hydrologic behavior of subcatchments is quantified within a model composed of multiple, parallel linear reservoirs of differieng drainage rates. The parallel linear reservoir model is able to reproduce the distinct signatures of observed individual recession curves. Using observations from several watersheds in the Northeastern US, this work offers a novel approach to integrate observable subbasin heterogeneities into a simple model that is able to reproduce distinct streamflow recession behaviors of mesoscale watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is one of many biologically derived gases and particles emitted from the ocean that has the potential to affect climate. In the case of DMS it is oxidized to sulfate, which increases the aerosol loading in the atmosphere either through nucleation or condensation on other aerosols, which in turn changes the energy balance of the Earth by reflection of sunlight either through direct reflection by the aerosols or by modifying clouds. We have previously shown that the geographical distribution of DMS emission from the ocean may be quite sensitive to climate changes, especially in the Southern Ocean. \nOur state-of-the-art sulfur-cycle Earth system model (ESM), based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) climate model, includes an ocean sulfur ecosystem model, the oxidation of DMS to sulfate by atmospheric chemistry, and the indirect effect of sulfate on radiation via clouds using the Modal Aerosol Model (MAM). \nOur multi-decadal simulations calculate the impact of DMS on the energy balance and climate of the Earth system, and its sensitivity/feedback to climate change. The estimate from our simulations is that DMS is responsible for ~6 W/m2 of reflected sunlight in the pre-industrial era (globally averaged), and ~4 W/m2 in the present era. The reduction is caused by increased competition with cloud condensation nuclei from anthropogenic aerosols in the present era, and therefore partially offsets the cooling from the anthropogenic aerosols. The distribution of these effects are not uniform, and doesn’t necessarily follow the simulated DMS distribution, because some clouds are more sensitive to DMS derived sulfate than others, and there are surface feedbacks such as the ice-albedo feedback. Although our calculated impact of DMS is higher than some previous studies, it is not much higher than recent observational estimates (McCoy, et al., 2015). \nWe are now porting these capabilities to the US Department of Energy’s Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME) model. \nThis work was conducted by the ACME and SciDAC programs of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research and the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research of the U.S. Department of Energy.

All but the first campaign provided full coverage of Pluto's 6.4 day rotation. Even though many of these images were taken when surface features on Pluto and Charon were unresolved, these data provide a unique opportunity to study Pluto over a timescale of several months. Earth-based data from an entire apparition must be combined to create a single light curve, as Pluto is never otherwise continuously available for observing due to daylight, weather and scheduling. From the spacecraft, Pluto's sub-observer latitude remained constant to within 0.05 degrees of 43.15 degrees, comparable to a week's worth of change as seen from Earth near opposition. During the July 2013 to June 2015 period, Pluto's solar phase curve increased from 11 degrees to 15 degrees, a small range, but large compared to Earth's 2 degree limit. The slope of the solar phase curve hints at properties such as surface roughness. Using PSF photometry that takes into account the ever-increasing sizes of Pluto and Charon as seen from New Horizons, as well as surface features discovered at closest approach, we present rotational light curves and solar phase curves of Pluto and Charon. We will connect these observations to previous measurements of the system from Earth.",

During March 2013, the NASA/JPL L-band polarimetric airborne imaging radar, UAVSAR, conducted airborne studies over regions of South America including portions of the western Amazon basin. We collected UAVSAR datasets over regions of the Amazon basin during that time to support systematic analyses of error sources related to the Inundated Wetlands ESDR. UAVSAR datasets were collected over Pacaya Samiria, Peru, Madre de Dios, Peru, and the Napo River in Ecuador. We derive landcover classifications from the UAVSAR datasets emphasizing wetlands regions, identifying regions of open water and inundated vegetation. We compare the UAVSAR-based datasets with those comprising the ESDR to assess uncertainty associated with the high resolution and the coarse resolution ESDR components. Our goal is to create an enhanced ESDR of inundated wetlands with statistically robust uncertainty estimates. The ESDR documentation will include a detailed breakdown of error sources and associated uncertainties within the data record.\nThis work was carried out in part within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative.

            "abstract": "Increasing the efficiency and sustainability in operation of hydrocarbon recovery from organic-rich shales requires a fundamental understanding of chemomechanical properties of organic-rich shales. This understanding is manifested in form of physics-bases predictive models capable of capturing highly heterogeneous and multi-scale structure of organic-rich shale materials. In this work we present a framework of experimental characterization, micromechanical modeling, and uncertainty quantification that spans from nanoscale to macroscale. Application of experiments such as coupled grid nano-indentation and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and micromechanical modeling attributing the role of organic maturity to the texture of the material, allow us to identify unique clay mechanical properties among different samples that are independent of maturity of shale formations and total organic content. The results can then be used to inform the physically-based multiscale model for organic rich shales consisting of three levels that spans from the scale of elementary building blocks (e.g. clay minerals in clay-dominated formations) of organic rich shales to the scale of the macroscopic inorganic/organic hard/soft inclusion composite. Although this approach is powerful in capturing the effective properties of organic-rich shale in an average sense, it does not account for the uncertainty in compositional and mechanical model parameters. Thus, we take this model one step forward by systematically incorporating the main sources of uncertainty in modeling multiscale behavior of organic-rich shales. In particular we account for the uncertainty in main model parameters at different scales such as porosity, elastic properties and mineralogy mass percent. To that end, we use Maximum Entropy Principle and random matrix theory to construct probabilistic descriptions of model inputs based on available information. The Monte Carlo simulation is then carried out to propagate the uncertainty and consequently construct probabilistic descriptions of properties at multiple length-scales. The combination of experimental characterization and stochastic multi-scale modeling presented in this work improves the robustness in the prediction of essential subsurface parameters in engineering scale.",

            "abstract": "Although relatively rare in space and time, skeletal carbonates deposited in glacially influenced settings hold great potential for improving understanding of the oceanography of the high latitudes. Accumulation in an environment where ocean water is close to carbonate undersaturation has major implications for component preservation and thus potential translation into the geological record. To understand the effects of early seafloor processes, we investigate Quaternary deposits of carbonates recovered in piston cores from the Ross Sea, Antarctica. In this setting, unconsolidated skeletal gravels and sands mantle areas of the outer shelf swept by bottom currents and beneath a zone of high primary productivity. Deposits are dominated locally by either stylasterine hydrocorals, barnacles, or bryozoans, comprising assemblages that differ from those living today. Radiocarbon ages indicate that carbonate factories were most prolific during the leadup to the Last Glacial Maximum, when sediment input was minimized, and have been mostly dormant since. Although there is little evidence for dissolution, skeletal debris is highly fragmented, abraded, and intensely bioeroded. The degree of destruction by these processes is highly selective amongst taxa, with skeletal structure influencing resistance to physical and biological breakdown. Overlapping generations of endolithic borings reflect moderate to high nutrient availability and repeated exposure of grains to infestation. Preserved grains are entirely calcitic and lack evidence of inorganic precipitation, implying potential taphonomic loss of aragonitic components. Observations indicate that seafloor processes in this setting combine to destroy a significant amount of carbonate as well as alter original depositional textures of deposits. Interpretations of ancient glaciomarine carbonates must consider the potential for significant biases created by destructive early seafloor processes.",

Such processes are most simple during the initial growth of the channel, when the channel is relatively short and has not yet branched extensively throughout the cloud. During this initial growth phase, impulsive electromagnetic emissions (preliminary breakdown pulses) can be well-described as produced by current pulses generated as the channel extends, but the overall growth rate, channel geometry, and degree of branching are not known. We approach such issues by examining electric field change measurements made with the Huntsville Alabama Marx Meter Array (HAMMA) during the first few milliseconds of growth of a lightning discharge. We compare HAMMA observations of electromagnetic emissions and overall field change to models of lightning channel growth and development and attempt to constrain channel growth rate, degree of branching, channel physical properties, and uniformity of thunderstorm electric field. Preliminary comparisons suggest that the lightning channel branches relatively early in the discharge, though more complete and detailed analysis will be presented.",

Throughout the prairie, burning is a common practice used to preserve the prairie from encroachment of woody species such as eastern Red Cedar, and to enhance the quantity and quality of the grass grown for cattle grazing in the region. However, widespread annual burning in early spring has led to air quality exceedances and pollution impacts in urban areas such as Kansas City, Topeka, and Wichita. Our research effort focuses on developing a modelling environment that simulates the effects of burning in the Flint Hills using an integrated modeling system, including an eco-hydrological model, an air quality and dispersion model, an economic and health effects model, and a terrestrial-species model. Using this integrated system, we can model historical burning practices as well as hypothetical variations in timing and quantity of burns. Then, we can investigate the relative trade-offs between farm productivity, ecological effects, urban health effects, and habitat diversity for terrestrial species given different burning scenarios. The results from this systems approach will provide land managers with information about the relative trade-offs associated with burning considering multiple elements of sustainability throughout the Flint Hills.",

            "abstract": "A number of recent studies have targeted emissions of methane and other hydrocarbons from oil and gas exploration and production activity. These measurements are greatly increasing understanding of the atmospheric impacts of oil and gas development. Very few measurements exist, however, of emissions of formaldehyde and other carbonyls from oil and gas equipment. Carbonyls are toxic and serve as important ozone precursors, especially during winter ozone episodes in places like Utah’s Uintah Basin. Current air quality models are only able to reproduce observed high wintertime ozone if they incorporate emissions inventories with very high carbonyl emissions.\nWe measured carbonyl emissions from oil and gas equipment and facilities—including glycol dehydrators, liquid storage tanks, raw gas leaks, raw gas-burning engines, and produced water surface impoundments—in Rocky Mountain oil and gas fields. Carbonyl emissions from raw gas were below detection, but emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and other carbonyls were detected from liquid storage tanks, glycol dehydrators, and other oil and gas equipment. In some cases, carbonyls may be formed from the degradation of methanol and other chemicals used in oil and gas production, but the collected data provide evidence for other non-combustion formation pathways. Raw gas-burning engines also emitted carbonyls. Emissions from all measured sources were a small fraction of total volatile organic compound emissions.\nWe incorporated our measurements into an emissions inventory, used that inventory in an air quality model (WRF-SMOKE-CAMx), and were unable to reproduce observed high wintertime ozone. This could be because (1) emission sources we have not yet measured, including compressors, gas processing plants, and others, are large; (2) non-carbonyl emissions, especially those that quickly degrade into carbonyls during photochemical processing, are underestimated in the inventory; or (3) the air quality model is unable to accurately simulate inversion conditions or wintertime chemistry, thus leading to low ozone production in spite of an accurate inventory.",

Team members live in close quarters for extended periods of time, team building and leadership affect the scientific process, and research tools are limited to what is available on site. Girls on Ice is an expeditionary science experience primarily for disadvantaged girls; it fully immerses girls in a mini scientific expedition to study alpine, glacierized environments. In addition to mentoring the girls through conducting their own scientific research, we encourage awareness and discussion of different sociocultural perspectives on the relation between the natural world, science, and society. The experience aligns closely with the apprenticeship model of learning, which can be effective in enhancing identification with science. Using a mixed-methods approach, we show that the Girls on Ice model helps girls (1) increase their interest and engagement in science and build a stronger science identity, (2) develop confidence, importantly they develop a combined physical and intellectual confidence; (3) engage in authentic scientific thinking, including critical thinking and problem solving; and (4) enhance leadership self-confidence. We discuss these results in a learning sciences framework, which posits that learning is inseparable from the social and physical contexts in which it takes place.",

Only ‘Semutang’ is discovered in the high amplitude structures, where rest of are in the gentle to moderate structures of western part of Chittagong-Tripura Fold Belt. But it has some major thrust faults which have strongly breached the reservoir zone. The major objectives of this research are interpretation of gas horizons and faults, then to perform velocity model, structural and property modeling to obtain reservoir properties. It is needed to properly identify the faults and reservoir heterogeneities. 3D modeling is widely used to reveal the subsurface structure in faulted zone where planning and development drilling is major challenge. Thirteen 2D seismic and six well logs have been used to identify six gas bearing horizons and a network of faults and to map the structure at reservoir level. Variance attributes were used to identify faults. Velocity model is performed for domain conversion. Synthetics were prepared from two wells where sonic and density logs are available. Well to seismic tie at reservoir zone shows good match with Direct Hydrocarbon Indicator on seismic section. Vsh, porosity, water saturation and permeability have been calculated and various cross plots among porosity logs have been shown. Structural modeling is used to make zone and layering accordance with minimum sand thickness. Fault model shows the possible fault network, those liable for several dry wells. Facies model have been constrained with Sequential Indicator Simulation method to show the facies distribution along the depth surfaces. Petrophysical models have been prepared with Sequential Gaussian Simulation to estimate petrophysical parameters away from the existing wells to other parts of the field and to observe heterogeneities in reservoir. Average porosity map for each gas zone were constructed. The outcomes of the research are an improved subsurface image of the seismic data (model), a porosity prediction for the reservoir, a reservoir quality map and also a fault map. The result shows a complex geologic model which may contribute to the economic potential of the field. For better understanding, 3D seismic survey, uncertainty and attributes analysis are necessary.",

Climate is known to drive complex critical zone processes determining sulfur fate and transport in the PPR, but the specific mechanisms controlling the storage and release of salinity beneath the wetlands remain poorly understood. To help clarify this, we conducted a DC resistivity field survey of a closed-basin groundwater discharge wetland at the Cottonwood Lake Study Area, North Dakota; and collected wetland cores along one of the survey transects for laboratory analyses of resistivity, porewater/solid-phase geochemistry, and other physical properties.\nInversions of our field survey delineate two primary geoelectrical layers beneath the wetland: the top ~8 m of wetland sediments and weathered glacial till (ρ25 = 4 – 5 Ω-m) overlying more resistive glacial till at depth (ρ25 = 7 – 12 Ω-m). Conductive lenses (ρ25 = 1 – 2 Ω-m) occur within the upper layer at 2 – 3 m depths in the center of the wetland and along a concentric band within the current ponded area, which corresponds to the location of the pond shoreline before extremely wet conditions in the 1990’s expanded the wetland. The resistivities of wetland core segments (ρ25 = 2 – 7 Ω-m) match well with the upper layer inferred from the field survey, and show an inverse trend of bulk core to porewater resistivity for clay-rich intervals due to variations in moisture content. Our results demonstrate that geospatial patterns of subsurface salinity relate to wetland hydrodynamics during dry-wet climate cycles and should be considered when using geoelectrical methods to upscale geochemical measurements in PPR wetlands.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas has been touted as a “transition fuel” that can ease the Unites States’ move towards a low-carbon economy. However, recent studies have shown natural gas leakage rates are larger than expected. High emission rates have the potential to minimize or entirely counteract the early climatic benefits of switching from coal because of the high global warming potential of methane, the primary component of natural gas. Several studies have noted that the distribution of well emissions seems to be skewed, or “fat tailed,” with a small number of sites accounting for disproportionately large percentages of emissions. The subset of high-emitting wells, dubbed “super-emitters,” is poorly understood and difficult to quantify in studies with small sample sizes. This study seeks to quantify natural gas leaks and understand the statistical significance of “super-emitters” within the Marcellus Shale region. During a field campaign in July 2015, we sampled 250 separate well pads in the Marcellus Region, with an ultimate goal of 1000 wells to be completed in subsequent campaigns in 2015 and 2016. A mobile lab was equipped with LICOR open-path sensors measuring CH4, CO2, and H2O mixing ratios as well as a GPS device.\nWell pad emissions are determined by isolating peaks and employing an inverse Gaussian plume method. The wind information necessary for these calculations is taken from NOAA READY archived meteorology modeling. Median emission rates of a data subset are 0.14 g CH4/s among emitting wells, which are comparable in order of magnitude with those in other basins. The preliminary distribution also exhibits skewed characteristics with about 10% of wells accounting for 75% of emissions. Data comparing the prevalence and relative emission strength of these ‘super-emitters’ will be presented. Further research will examine their prevalence, shared attributes, and implications for the Marcellus Shale natural gas industry.",

            "abstract": "The northern Antarctic Peninsula (nAP, north of 66°S) is a north-south trending mountain range extending transverse across the prevailing westerly winds of the Southern Ocean resulting in an extreme west-to-east precipitation gradient. Snowfall on the west side of the AP is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the east side. This gradient drives short, steep, fast-flowing glaciers into narrow fjords on the west side, while longer lower-sloping glaciers flow down the east side into broader fjord valleys. This pattern in ice dynamics affects ice–ocean interaction on timescales of decades to centuries, and shapes the subglacial topography and submarine bathymetry on timescales of glacial cycles. In our study, we calculate ice flux for the western and eastern nAP using a drainage model that incorporates the modern ice surface topography, the RACMO-2 precipitation estimate, and recent estimates of ice thinning. Our results, coupled with observed rates of ice velocity from InSAR (I. Joughin, personal communication) and Landsat 8 -derived flow rates (this study), provide an estimate of ice thickness and fjord depth in grounded-ice areas for the largest outlet glaciers. East-side glaciers either still terminate in or have recently terminated in ice shelves. Sedimentary evidence from the inner fjords of the western glaciers indicates they had ice shelves during LIA time, and may still have transient floating ice tongues (tabular berg calvings are observed). Although direct oceanographic evidence is limited, the high accumulation rate and rapid ice flux implies cold basal ice for the western nAP glaciers and therefore weak subglacial discharge relative to eastern nAP glaciers and or other tidewater fjord systems such as in Alaska. Finally, despite lower accumulation rates on the east side, the large elongate drainage basins result in a greater ice flux funneled through fewer deeper glaciers. Due to the relation between ice flux and erosion, these east-side glaciers have longer and deeper fjords than the west-side glaciers. These distinct differences between the glaciers of the west and east side of the AP exert a primary control on the differing ice-ocean interactions, grounding-line retreat, and subglacial erosion rates, and provide context to understand rates of nAP ice mass loss.",

The ion loss is found to be strongly energy dependent where only ions with energies measured above ~100 keV have a significant drop in intensity. At these energies the ion dynamics are principally controlled by variations of the geomagnetic field which, during magnetic substorms, exhibits large scale variations on timescales from minutes to hours (or even days). Here we show that ~ 19:00 UTC on March 17 the geomagnetic field was compressed from 200 to 250 nT on a time scale of about an hour. This compression was capture by RBSPICE-A at spacecraft apogee [GSM coordinates (x=-4.98, y=3.00, z=-0.73)]. We demonstrate the relationship between this large geomagnetic field compression and the drop-outs of the heavy ions.",

Pressure gradients developed in the inner magnetosphere can shield the near-Earth region from solar wind-induced electric fields. The distortion of Earth’s magnetic field due to the ring current affects the dynamics of particles contributing both to the ring current and radiation belts. Therefore, understanding the long-term evolution of the inner magnetosphere energy content is essential. We have investigated the evolution of ring current proton pressure (7 - 600 keV) in the inner magnetosphere based on data from the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment (RBSPICE) instrument aboard Van Allen Probe B throughout the year 2013. We find that although the low-energy component of the protons (< 80 keV) is governed by convective timescales and is very well correlated with the Dst index, the high-energy component (>100 keV) varies on much longer timescales and shows either no or anti-correlation with the Dst index. Interestingly, the contributions of the high- and low-energy protons to the total energy content are comparable. Our results indicate that the proton dynamics, and as a consequence the total energy budget in the inner magnetosphere (inside geosynchronous orbit), is not strictly controlled by storm-time timescales as those are defined by the Dst index.",

            "abstract": "Accommodation zones connect rift segments, which are fundamental elements of continental rift architecture. The sedimentary record aids our assessment of the evolution of this linkage. The central basin of Lake Malawi is one of the most structurally complex regions of the Malawi Rift. Border fault margins have been interpreted on both shorelines; three structures within the basin have been interpreted as segments of a corresponding accommodation zone. We investigate these structures by integrating single- and multi-channel reflection seismic data, including new MCS acquired in 2015 for the SEGMeNT project. The stratigraphic record in the central basin, inferred from seismic reflection profiles, provides compelling evidence that most fault-related subsidence is accommodated by the western border fault. Strata on both sides of all three structures dip to the west. The pre-rift basement in the sub-basin west of the central structure is considerably deeper (~ 4 s TWTT sub-bottom) than that in the broader eastern sub-basin (~ 2.5 s TWTT sub-bottom). A syncline in the eastern sub-basin shows little variation in seismic facies, particularly over the last 1.3 m.y. In contrast, the western sub-basin exhibits seismic facies indicative of fluvial input from two major rivers, siliciclastic input from the border fault footwall rising > 1000 m above lake level, and mud diapirs in the deepest part of the sub-basin. Horizons pierced by these diapirs onlap the central structure, suggesting diapir rise postdates relative uplift of the structure. Correlations with the age model from a 2005 scientific drilling project will better constrain this timing. The structural high helps focus siliciclastic sediments into the sub-basin, resulting in the overpressure conditions required for mud diapirism. We hypothesize that the diapirs are the result of sediment loading in the deep main depocenter of the central basin rather than fault mechanisms. The basement highs in the central basin control sediment distribution but are not accommodation zones sensu stricto.",

While natural gas has been praised as a cleaner source of fuel than coal, methane’s potent global-warming potential could pose barriers in reducing greenhouse gas footprints if significant leaks are observed from the natural gas supply chain. A field campaign spanning two and a half weeks was undertaken in July 2015 to quantify the levels of methane emitted from sites of petrochemical activity in the Marcellus Shale. Additional campaigns are expected in late 2015 and early 2016. Measurements of methane and carbon dioxide were taken downwind of known well sites using open-path laser spectroscopy mounted to the roof of the mobile platform. Approximately 250 well sites were visited, covering over 2000 miles on the road. The majority of the well pads were in southwestern Pennsylvania, but the compiled database includes wells in West Virginia and northeastern Pennsylvania. The data set consists of a variety of operators and equipment types spread over several counties.\nCorrelating well pad characteristics with emission levels may provide useful insight into predicting which well pads are likely to be large emitters. Using the inverse Gaussian plume model and meteorology data from the NOAA Ready archive, the emissions from each transect were calculated. Preliminary results were examined with respect to two easily identifiable variables: the number of wells at each well pad and the operator. Higher emissions were not correlated with increased number of wells, despite the fact that additional infrastructure may provide additional leak pathways. In fact, the emission levels for pads with only a singular well, which accounted for nearly 70% of the wells analyzed thus far, had a range of 0 to 9 grams of methane per second. Sites with two or more wells tended to be concentrated on the lower end of the distribution. Higher emissions were also distributed roughtly equally among the 10 operators in the data subset. Continued analyses of methane emission rates will provide further insight into Marcellus Shale.",

Few high-temporal resolution GPS observations of ice-sheet flow extend for longer than a couple years, limiting multiyear analyses of seasonal variability in ice-sheet flow. Using a small GPS network installed at ~1000-m above sea level (m a.s.l.) operating from 2006–2014, and supplemented with a larger array of 20 GPS stations installed from 2011­–2014, we observe nine years of ice-sheet surface motion on the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The GPS array spans a horizontal distance of 30 km across an elevation range of 700–1250 m a.s.l., and captures the ice-sheet’s velocity response to the seasonal melt cycle. By combining the GPS array measurements with temperature, precipitation, and runoff estimates from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO), we examine the relationship between ice-sheet flow and surface melt variability both at the seasonal scale (i.e., during melt onset, summer melt season and melt cessation) as well as during transient high melt periods such as precipitation events, anomalously high melt episodes, and supraglacial lake drainages. We observe varying surface motion following early versus late summer extended melt events, with early-season extended melt events inducing longer sustained speed-up than late summer events. We also examine differences in the timing of melt onset and magnitude, comparing the anomalously high runoff observed across the ice sheet in 2010 and 2012 against the average to low runoff observed in the years comprising the remainder of the record. This nearly decadal record improves our understanding of the role of meltwater variability in modulating ice-sheet flow on diurnal to inter-annual timescales.",

Due to a sparse network of observations in the developing world, many of these variables are estimated using remotely sensed data. As scientists develop new techniques to leverage available observations and remotely sensed information there are opportunities to create products that identify the environmental conditions that stress agriculture and reduce food production.\nFEWS NET pioneered the development of the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with stations (CHIRPS) dataset, to estimate precipitation and monitor growing conditions throughout the world. These data are used to drive land surface models, hydrologic models and basic crop models among others. A new dataset estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) has been developed using inputs from the ERA-Interim GCM. This ET0 dataset stretches back to 1981, allowing for a long-term record, stretching many seasons and drought events. Combining the CHIRPS data to estimate water availability and the ET0 data to estimate evaporative demand, one can estimate the approximate water gap (surplus or deficit) over a specific time period. Normalizing this difference creates the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which presents these gaps in comparison to the historical record for a specific location and accumulation period.\nIn this study we evaluate the SPEI as a tool to estimate crop yields for different regions of Kenya. Identifying the critical time of analysis for the SPEI is the first step in building a relationship between the water gap and food production. Once this critical period is identified, we look at the predictability of food production using the SPEI, and assess the utility of it for monitoring food security, with the goal of incorporating the SPEI in the standard monitoring suite of FEWS NET tools.",

            "abstract": "The Mars upper atmosphere (~100-500 km), encompassing the thermosphere, ionosphere, and lower portion of the exosphere, constitutes the reservoir that regulates present day volatile escape processes from the planet (Bougher et al. 2014). One of the key strategies of the MAVEN primary mission, central to the exploration of this reservoir region, is to execute several Deep Dip campaigns. During each week-long campaign, periapsis is lowered from a nominal altitude of ~150-170 km down to ~120-135 km. This strategy allows direct in-situ sampling of the entire reservoir region, from the exosphere downward to near the homopause (Jakosky et al. 2015). This presentation focuses on the neutral thermospheric structure sampled during the first three Deep Dip campaigns #1 , #2 and #3, corresponding to dusk (mid-Northern latitudes), subsolar, and dawn (mid-Southern latitudes), locations respectively.\nThe primary MAVEN instrument for sampling neutral thermospheric structure is the NGIMS (Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. It measures the neutral composition of the major gas species (e.g. He, N, O, CO, N2, O2, NO, Ar and CO2) and their major isotopes, with a vertical resolution of ~5 km for targeted species and a target accuracy of <25% for most of these species (Mahaffy et al. 2014). Thermospheric temperatures are derived from the neutral scale heights.\nCorresponding Mars Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (MGITM) outputs are subsequently compared to NGIMS neutral composition and temperatures along the inbound legs of orbit tracks below 300 km. This MGITM model is primarily driven by solar EUV-UV forcing at thermospheric altitudes (Bougher et al. 2015). This solar forcing configuration is a useful baseline against which data vs. model comparisons of thermospheric densities and temperatures can be conducted with a view to determining the role played by solar forcing (only) in the maintenance and variability (e.g. seasonal and solar cycle trends) of NGIMS measured fields. Thusfar, these MAVEN Deep Dip measurements clearly indicate that the thermospheric neutral densities and temperatures also vary significantly from orbit-to-orbit (~4-5 hours).

            "abstract": "Surface wave dispersion data are routinely employed to model seismic velocities and anisotropy, which can be used to put constraints on the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). However, the choice of the proxy used to define the depth of the LAB can strongly affect the results. It can yield to inconsistent LAB depths and therefore affects our understanding of the nature of the LAB. In this study, we investigated how well constrained these different proxies are using a Bayesian approach. We applied a model space search technique to global fundamental mode surface wave phase velocity maps to determine posterior probability density functions for 3-D radial anisotropy and velocity models. This enables us to obtain quantitative uncertainties on the different proxies.\nIn oceanic regions, we find that the LAB depth defined as the largest negative vertical gradient in shear-wave velocity increases with the age of the ocean floor, consistent with a thermal origin of the LAB. However, vertical changes in radial anisotropy yield a LAB depth that is almost flat across oceans at around 80 km. We also note that the depth of the LAB obtained from horizontally polarized shear-waves is, however, deeper by a few tens of kilometers than that resulting from vertically polarized shear-waves. These results are consistent across different oceans. Similar results have been reported in previous studies, and some authors have suggested that radial anisotropy and velocities are sensitive to different physical and/or compositional properties of the upper mantle. The Bayesian approach we adopted here will provide statistics that will enable us determine whether the observed discrepancies in LAB depth are significant. Future work will also analyze the constraints provided by higher mode surface wave data and group velocities.",

Environmental issues in QMH include poor water quality, limited flux, and annual toxic algal blooms related to high nutrient loading. Natural and anthropogenic nitrogen compounds may enter QMH through a number of sources. Previous work found seasonally elevated groundwater and surface marine water concentration of nitrate ([NO3-]). We aimed to identify potential NO3- source(s) using N and O stable isotope values of NO3- in both freshwater and marine water samples. In October, 2014 we collected freshwater samples from three tributary streams to QMH, and a residential well adjacent to QMH. We also collected paired surface and deep ( ~1m above sediment) marine samples at 5 sites along an 8000m transect from the mouth of the inlet to the inner harbor. Each sample was analyzed for [NO3-], and δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 values. Possible NO3- sources that may have discreet δ15N and δ18O values include septic seepage, marine NO3-, and natural (terrestrial) NO3-.\nAll deep marine sample δ15NNO3 values were similarly low (~2 ‰), but the surface values increased by ~8 ‰ from the inlet mouth to inner harbor. Marine sample δ18ONO3 values were invariant (~1 ‰ range), except for one high surface value. The deep [NO3-] decreased slightly towards the inner harbor, and were consistently higher than paired surface concentration, which decreased dramatically. The uniformity of [NO3-] and isotopic values in deep marine samples may be explained by groundwater recharge. The isotopic values of NO3- in the creeks were not characteristic of a specific anthropogenic source, but one creek had a very high [NO3-]. The only isotopic evidence for an anthropogenic NO3- source (septic) was found in the two surface marine samples from the inner harbor, and the well water sample. Seasonal sampling and additional sites will yield a more complete understanding of the relative contributions of NO3- sources to QMH.",

Therefore, understanding the characteristics of the land surface contributing to the flux, the so-called footprint, is critical to upscale tower flux to the regional landscape. This is especially true for the towers locating in heterogeneous ecosystems such as mixed forests. Here we (1) estimated the seasonal footprints of a flux tower, the EMS-tower (US-Ha1) in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Harvard Forest, from 1992 to 2008 with a footprint climatology. The Harvard Forest is a temperate mixed-species ecosystem that is composed of deciduous stands (red oak and red maple) and evergreen coniferous stands (eastern hemlock and white pine). The heterogeneity of the landscape is primarily driven by the phenology of the deciduous stands which are not uniformly distributed over the forest and around the tower. The overall prevailing footprints are known to lie toward the southwest and northwest, but there were profound interannual variability in the extents and the orientations of the seasonal footprints. Furthermore we (2) examined whether vegetation density variation within the tower footprint in each season could adequately represent the vegetation density characteristics of moderate spatial resolution remote sensing estimates and ecosystem models (i.e. 1.0 km and 1.5 km). The footprints were found to cover enough area to be representative of the 1.0 km scale but not 1.5 km scale. Finally we (3) investigated the influence of the interannual variations in the land cover variability in the footprints on the seasonal flux measurements from 1999 to 2008, and found almost half of the interannual anomalies in the summertime GPP flux can be explained by the coniferous stand fraction within the footprint.",

The worm technique is therefore well-suited to analyses of crustal-scale stuctures that could be reactivated by tectonic stress or by fluid injection processes, providing new tools to analyze existing continental-scale data sets. Northeastern North America (US, Canada) hosts potentially damaging intraplate earthquakes, yet many of the Proterozoic structures are covered by thick sedimentary sequences or dense vegetation, and crustal structure is relatively poorly known.\nFor the purpose of extending basement structure beneath the Appalachian basin and establishing a consistent regional basis for comparison, we use worms to identify steeply dipping structures in compiled gravity and magnetic anomaly data sets. We compare results to intraplate earthquake locations to assess seismic hazards. Clearly, not all locations of lateral boundaries are faults, and we do not expect all faults to have shown activity in the ~50 years of seismic records available. However, proximity statistics between hypocenters and worms are of interest since they assist in the identification and location of a subset of potentially active faults. We compare structures of lateral mass-density or magnetization contrast with locations of earthquake hypocenters cataloged from the ISC, the NEIC, and the ANF from the EarthScope Transportable Array.\nWe develop a GIS based method for calculating hypocenter/worm proximity, and we will show statistics and maps from this method for the region at the meeting.",

We show that the heliopuse is subject to Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which add fine structure to the transition region. We demonstrate the heliopause structure allows magnetic connection of different regions inside it to either the SW or LISM, which may be an explanation of variations in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by Voyager. We investigate the magnetic field behavior near the heliopause in the directions of V1 and Voyager 2 (V2), and identify magnetic flux tubes which may be due to magnetic reconnection at some distance from the heliopause crossing points. Differences in the plasma and magnetic field distributions in the V1 and V2 directions are discussed and compared with Voyager observations. Numerical simulations are performed with the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS) using a new approach where pickup ions (PUIs) are treated as a separate fluid and special boundary conditions are implemented for PUIs at discontinuities. We show numerical results of PIC simulations of turbulence generated by PUIs in the outer heliosheath and discuss them in the context of V1 observations of the LISM turbulence spectrum.",

We analyzed a post-wildfire rainfall and runoff monitoring dataset for hazard studies in Southern California. VWC was measured with EC-5 sensors manufactured by Decagon Devices. Many traditional signal smoothing techniques such as moving averages, splines, and Loess smoothing exist. Unfortunately, when applied to our post-wildfire dataset, these techniques diminish maxima, introduce time shifts, and diminish signal details. A promising seasonal trend-decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) decomposes VWC time series into trend, seasonality, and remainder components. Unfortunately, STL with its default parameters produces similar results as previously mentioned smoothing methods.\n\nWe propose a novel method to optimize seasonal decomposition using STL with genetic algorithms. This method successfully reduces “noise” including diurnal variations while preserving maxima, minima, and signal detail. Better decomposition results for the post-wildfire VWC dataset were achieved by optimizing STL’s control parameters using genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithms minimize an additive objective function with three weighted terms: (i) root mean squared error (RMSE) of straight line relative to STL trend line; (ii) range of STL remainder; and (iii) variance of STL remainder. Our optimized STL method, combining trend and remainder, provides an improved representation of signal details by preserving maxima and minima as compared to the traditional smoothing techniques for the post-wildfire rainfall and runoff monitoring data. This method identifies short- and long-term VWC seasonality and provides trend and remainder data suitable for forecasting VWC in response to precipitation.",

It can also be used to date subduction metamorphism and to interpret the deformation and rheologic behavior of subducted oceanic crust and associated sediments. Yet, despite its great potential for providing information about subduction processes, little is known about the composition and zoning patterns of lawsonite, in part because lawsonite is rarely preserved unaltered in exhumed subduction complexes.\nFresh, unaltered lawsonite is preserved in blueschist and eclogite facies metabasaltic and metasedimentary rocks of the Sivrihisar Massif, Turkey. In this HP/LT complex, lawsonite was stable along the prograde path (inclusions in garnet), at the metamorphic peak (matrix grains), and along the retrograde path (lawsonite-rich veins), allowing for investigation of changes in lawsonite composition and microstructures as a function of P-T-fluid-deformation conditions.\nResults from studies of lawsonite major and trace element compositions and zoning patterns in a variety of rock types and textural and structural positions show that lawsonite displays a variety of REE patterns (flat REE or LREE-, MREE-, or HREE-enriched) as well as zoning patterns (core-to-rim, sector, oscillatory), particularly in the transition metals Fe, Ti, and Cr. Variations in REE patterns are strongly influenced by the coexisting mineral assemblage (presence or absence of garnet and other REE-rich phases during lawsonite growth), whereas variations in zoning patterns likely reflect both crystallographic and environmental controls. Lawsonite composition may also be affected by deformation: EBSD analysis shows that subgrain development is associated with compositional changes (e.g., Ti).",

Time-lapse footage from a thermal imaging camera at Halema‘uma‘u lake at Kilauea volcano, Hawaii was used to investigate the cooling rate of the lava lake’s surface. The data was then combined with an analytical model of lava flow cooling to constrain the porosity of the lava lake skin. The data was processed to account for the influence that the camera’s position relative to the lake had on the image geometry and the recorded temperature values. We examined lake cooling in two separate scenarios: First, we calculated the cooling rate of the skin immediately after large gas bubbles burst at the lake’s surface. Second, the temperature of the skin was measured as a function of distance from molten spreading centers (cracks) on the surface, and then converted to cooling as a function of the skin’s age using the local lake surface velocity. The resulting cooling time-series were compared against cooling curves produced by a model that simulates lava flow cooling based on a myriad of physical factors. We performed quantitative data analysis to determine the approximate porosity of the lava lake skin. Preliminary comparisons reveal that the calculated cooling rates most closely correspond to the cooling curves that were produced with a lava porosity value of at least 80%.",

            "abstract": "Future hydroclimate projections from state-of-the-art climate models show large uncertainty and model discrepancy, particularly over the monsoon regions. It is important to understand the different physical pathways by which greenhouse gases (GHGs) may impact regional hydroclimate and distinguish those from the uncertainty caused by low model skill. The response to rising GHGs can be through both direct radiative effect and indirect effect via sea surface temperature (SST) warming, the relative importance of the two may result in discrepancies in conclusions.\nWe assess the regional hydroclimate responses to greenhouse warming using output from coupled general circulation models (GCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 5 (CMIP5) and idealized experiments from the Atmosphere Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The direct radiative response to rising CO2 is quantified by quadrupling the CO2 concentration with prescribed SST, whereas the indirect response to SST warming is quantified by a 4K uniform warming of SST with fixed CO2 concentration. We show that over the monsoon regions, the summertime precipitation response associated with direct radiative forcing and that with indirect SST effect largely opposes each other. This competing effect may contribute to an overall weak response and model discrepancy in the CMIP5 coupled simulations.\nThe physical mechanisms causing the monsoon rainfall changes are examined using the moisture budget analysis. The mean moisture flux convergence term is separated into thermodynamic and dynamic components, involving changes in moisture and circulation, respectively. The differing monsoon rainfall response is mainly due to the opposing effect of the dynamic contribution to the mean moisture convergence, thus related to atmospheric circulation change. We further address possible changes in the seasonal cycle for the different monsoon regions.",

            "abstract": "Flow in the Earth’s mantle is driven by thermo-chemical convection in which the properties and geochemical signatures of rocks vary depending on their origin and composition. For example, tectonic plates are composed of compositionally-distinct layers of crust, residual lithosphere and fertile mantle, while in the lower-most mantle there are large compositionally distinct “piles” with thinner lenses of different material. Therefore, tracking of active or passive fields with distinct compositional, geochemical or rheologic properties is important for incorporating physical realism into mantle convection simulations, and for investigating the long term mixing properties of the mantle. The difficulty in numerically advecting fields arises because they are non-diffusive and have sharp boundaries, and therefore require different methods than usually used for temperature. Previous methods for tracking fields include the marker-chain, tracer particle, and field-correction (e.g., the Lenardic Filter) methods: each of these has different advantages or disadvantages, trading off computational speed with accuracy in tracking feature boundaries. Here we present a method for modeling active fields in mantle dynamics simulations using a new solver implemented in the deal.II package that underlies the ASPECT software. The new solver for the advection-diffusion equation uses a Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) algorithm, which combines features of both finite element and finite volume methods, and is particularly suitable for problems with a dominant first-order term and discontinuities. Furthermore, we have applied a post-processing technique to insure that the solution satisfies a global maximum/minimum. One potential drawback for the LDG method is that the total number of degrees of freedom is larger than the finite element method. To demonstrate the capabilities of this new method we present results for two benchmarks used previously: a falling cube with distinct buoyancy and viscosity, and a Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a compositionally buoyant layer. To evaluate the trade-offs in computational speed and solution accuracy we present results for these same benchmarks using the two field tracking methods available in ASPECT: active tracer particles and the entropy viscosity method.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Milbury_AGU2015_v2_2_final.pdf\nAs a result of NASA’s dual spacecraft Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission [Zuber et al., 2013; doi:10.1126/science.1231507], we now know that the lunar crust is highly porous and that the porosity varies laterally [Wieczorek et al., 2013; doi:10.1126/science.1231530] and vertically [Besserer et al., 2014; doi:10.1002/2014GL060240]. Analysis of complex craters located within the lunar highlands reveals that: 1) craters larger than diameter D~210 have positive Bouguer Anomalies (BAs), 2) craters with D ≲ 100 km have both positive and negative BAs that vary about the (near 0) mean by approximately ± 25 mGal, and, 3) D and BA are anticorrelated for craters with D ≲ 100 km [Soderblom et al., 2015; submitted]. Numerical modeling by Milbury et al. [2015, LPSC] shows that pre-impact porosity is the dominant influence on the gravity signature of complex craters with D ≲ 100 km, and mantle uplift dominates the gravity for those with D > 140 km. Phillips et al. [2015, LPSC] showed that complex craters located in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin tend to have more-negative BAs than similar craters in the highlands. By including (pre-impact) vertical porosity/density gradients in our impact simulations, we reproduce the observed anticorrelation between BA and D for D ≲ 100 km, and the observed difference between the BAs of SPA and highland craters. We use the iSALE hydrocode including pore space compaction [Wünnemann et al., 2006; doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2005.10.013] and dilatant bulking [Collins, 2014; doi:10.1002/2014JE004708] to understand how the gravity signature of impact craters develop. In this study we vary density/porosity with depth. We find that simulations that have constant porosity with depth have a lower BA for a given crater diameter than those with varying porosity. We used two different mean porosities (7% and 14%) and found that the BA increases with increasing porosity, similar to simulations with constant porosity. Larger impacts affect relatively deeper portions of the crust, and therefore “see” lower overall porosity, so the BA increases with D less strongly than the constant porosity simulations. Our results support the observation that SPA has lower overall porosity, but higher vertical gradients, giving craters within SPA more-negative BAs than those within the highlands crust.",

The MMT was developed via an agile methodology, taking into account inputs from GCMD’s science coordinators and other end-users. In its initial release, the MMT uses the Unified Metadata Model for Collections (UMM-C) to allow metadata providers to easily create and update collection records in the ISO-19115 format. Through a simplified UI experience, metadata curators can create and edit collections without full knowledge of the NASA Best Practices implementation of ISO-19115 format, while still generating compliant metadata. More experienced users are also able to access raw metadata to build more complex records as needed. In future releases, the MMT will build upon recent work done in the community to assess metadata quality and compliance with a variety of standards through application of metadata rubrics. The tool will provide users with clear guidance as to how to easily change their metadata in order to improve their quality and compliance. Through these features, the MMT allows data providers to create and maintain compliant and high quality metadata in a short amount of time.",

Successful archaeointensity data have been obtained from thirty seven potsherds using the Thellier-Coe protocol. Rock magnetic experiments including low-field magnetic susceptibility versus temperature (k-T) plots, Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves, as well as hysteresis loops and back-fields, have been performed in order to characterize the magnetic behavior of the samples and determine their main magnetic carriers. The Curie temperatures indicate the presence of at least two magnetic mineral phases (i.e. 560-5750C and 610-6200C), with predominant Curie temperatures typical of magnetite. The results of the magnetic grain size analyses suggest the presence of particles in the Pseudo-Single Domain (PSD) range, according to the distribution on the modified Day plots (Dunlop 2002 a and b) for magnetite. The successful absolute paleointensity determinations yielded archaeointensity values of 17.3 ± 0.5 μT for Guayas (Manteno Period), 29.13 ± 0.61 μT for Nido de Las Lechusas (Guangala Period), 35.45 ± 1.6 μT for Nido de Las Lechusas ((Panzaleo Period), 27.3 ± 1.0 μT for Santa Elena (Valdivia Period) and 25.82 ± 1.82 μT for Valdivia (Valdivia Period). The new results are in good correlation with archaeomagnetic data from the earlier published data from the coastal Valdiva in Ecuador. These new archaeointensity data from Ecuador for the last 4530-2030 BC years aim to enrich our knowledge of the geomagnetic field intensity variations in the south hemisphere, together with previously published data from South America.",

While the impacts of BC on health and climate have been studied for many years, studies about its deposition and impact on marine ecosystems are scares. This is rather surprising considering that a large fraction of atmospheric BC deposits on the surface of the ocean via dry or wet deposition. On a global scale, deposition on the ocean is about 45 Tg C per year, with higher fluxes in the northern hemisphere and in inter-tropical regions, following the occurrence of the hot-spots of concentration. In the present study conducted on shore, in Haiphong and Halong cities, North Vietnam, we measured the seasonal variations of atmospheric BC, OC and PAHs during a complete annual cycle. The presentation will discuss the atmospheric results in terms of seasonal variability and sources. Inputs to the marine system are higher during the dry season, concomitantly with the arrival of air masses enriched in BC coming from the North. However, the carbon fingerprint can significantly differ at shorter time periods depending on the air mass pathway and speed. Our work leads to the characterization and the determination of the relative contribution of more specific sources like local traffic, which includes tourism and fishing boats, coal dust emitted from the nearby mine, and long-range transported aerosols. This variable input of carbonaceous aerosols might have consequences for the cycling and the repartition of carbon and nutrients in the marine ecosystem of Halong Bay.",

This novel approach is based in part on results from recent experiment on-board FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP), which investigated various remote signatures related to oceanic whitecaps and SSA production. Specifically, a direct empirical relationship was obtained between the production rate of coarse SSA and the degree of polarization of ocean surface microwave emissivity, which has been known to be a sensitive indicator of the state of the ocean interface. This new project seeks to incorporate the new empirical relationship into an existing radiative model of the ocean surface, and thus add the SSA source term to the list of variables retrieved by satellite microwave radiometers, such as Windsat and GMI. Validation of the resulting global product (SSA production) is to be conducted within the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System, where the performance of the new source term, as well as the traditional wind speed based term will be tested against global aerosol observations.",

This research study aims to investigate the relationship between Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) and rainfall over West Africa during the boreal summer in the the state-of-the-art Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) type simulations performed by Atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) forced with prescribed Sea Surface Temperature (SST). It aims to determine the impact of MJO on rainfall and convection over West Africa and identify the dynamical processes which are involved in the state-of-the-art climate simulations.\nThe simulations show in general good skills in capturing its main characteristics as well as its influence on rainfall over West Africa. On the global scale, most models simulated an eastward spatio-temporal propagation of enhanced and suppressed convection similar to the observed. However, over West Africa the MJO signal is weak in few of the models although there is a good coherence in the eastward propagation. The influence on rainfall is well captured in both Sahel and Guinea regions thereby adequately producing the transition between positive and negative rainfall anomalies through the different phases as seen in the observation. Furthermore, the results show that strong active convective phase is clearly associated with the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) but the weak convective phase is associated with a much weaker AEJ particularly over coastal Ghana.\nIn assessing the mechanisms which are involved in the above impacts the convectively equatorial coupled waves (CCEW) are analysed separately. The analysis of the longitudinal propagation of zonal wind at 850hPa and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) shows that the CCEW are very weak and their extention are very limited beyong West African region. It was found that the westward coupled equatorial Rossby waves are needed to bring out the MJO-convection link over the region and this relationship is well reproduced by all the models. Results also confirmed that it may be possible to predict the anomalous convection over West Africa with a time lead of 15-20 day with regard to Indian Ocean and AMIP simulations performed well in this regard.",

            "abstract": "Carbon Monoxide is a key component in tropospheric chemistry. It plays an important role by affecting the oxidative capacity through its reaction with OH and being a precursor of tropospheric ozone. One year of multispectral retrievals of CO partial columns obtained from the MOPITT instrument have been assimilated into the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-Chem). The assimilation is carried out using an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter algorithm within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) package. Two assimilation experiments have been performed: 1) assimilation of meteorological observations and 2) joint assimilation of meteorological observations and MOPITT CO. We first evaluate the assimilation performance by investigating skill scores and other statistics for the two experiments, and comparing to independent CO datasets such as surface (WDCGG), aircraft (MOZAIC-IAGOS), and FTS (NDACC). Our results clearly demonstrate an overall improvement for spatio-temporal magnitude and variability in representing CO abundance in CAM-Chem. We then investigate the response of CAM-Chem to changes in CO fields (via CO assimilation) focusing mainly on the oxidative capacity (i.e., OH distribution, methane lifetime) and CO chemical production and loss (i.e., regional to global budget). This is carried out by analyzing the mean 6-hourly forecast adjustments as reflected between the two experiments. We show that changes in CO directly impact OH abundance, with subsequent non-linear responses in CO chemical production (CO from methane and VOCs) and CO loss. This is clearly evident in NOx-limited regions (e.g., Southern Hemisphere, remote sites). Such analysis has direct implications on the consistencies in inverse modeling estimates of CO sources through improved representation of chemical response (including full chemistry) in atmospheric chemistry models and through multi-species constraints.",

For this, we consider the system with end-members hcp Fe and the B2 phase of FeSi. Si and Fe enter both structures in substitution of one another. The system is characterized by an immiscibility gap, which according to our results widens with pressure. At core conditions about 5 wt.% Si can be dissolved into the hcp phase of Fe. Comparatively there is much more Fe that can enter the FeSi B2 phase.\nIn a second step we start with the hcp Fe-Si alloys and add the most probable light elements found in the core: H, C, O, and S. The light elements can enter the hcp structure either as interstitial impurities, in case of H, C, O, or in substitution of Fe, in case of S. We consider several insertion patterns with the light elements both adjacent and far apart. For each of these new phases we compute the elastic constants tensors and the seismic properties. Based on our theoretical results and the comparisons with PREM we discuss in detail the possible composition of the Earth’s inner core, we rule out certain light elements, like H, and we show that the distribution pattern is not important.\nThis is also the first time the elastic constants tensor is computed from lattice dynamics using the response function in the Planar Augmented Wavefunction approach of the Density Functional Theory [1].\n[1] A.

            "abstract": "Liverpool Land, at the southern tip of the Greenland Caledonides, exposes the small eclogite-facies, peridotite-bearing Tvaerdal complex tectonically juxtaposed against the mid-crustal, high-pressure granulite facies Jaettedal complex. Recent literature supports a Laurentian origin for the Jættedal complex, but the structurally lower Tværdal complex has been tentatively correlated with Baltica. Their juxtaposition raises the possibility of lower plate to upper plate terrane transfer during continental subduction. Pressure-temperature estimates from Tvaerdal eclogites indicate ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic conditions during recrystallization. Sm-Nd mineral isochrons from the eclogites indicate UHP recrystallization occured ≈400 millions years ago, the same time HP/UHP metamorphism occurred in the Western Gneiss Complex of the Scandinavian Caledonides. Almost half of detrital zircons collected from a modern stream channel within the Tvaerdal complex give LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages of 1.68 and 1.3-0.95 Ma ages, which are dates characteristic of both Baltic and Laurentia. However, none of the detrital zircons give the Archean or ≈1.8 Ga Proterozoic ages that are also characteristic of Laurentia. Most of the remaining detrital zircons from the Tvaerdal Complex give younger U-Pb ages that range between 411-375 Ma which contrast with the older 450-410 Ma ages obtained from the Jaettedal as well as from other gneiss terranes in the southern Greenland Caledonides. The different age patterns provide compelling evidence that the Tvaerdal Complex is indeed an orphaned Baltic Terrane. The Jaettedal complex took part in the lengthy evolution of a compressional continental arc complex along the eastern Laurentian margin during the closure of Iapetus while the Tvaerdal complex was a fragment of the approaching Baltic passive margin. Eclogite-facies metamorphism of the Tvaerdal Complex occurred when Iapetus closed and the edge of Baltica subducted to UHP mantle conditions beneath Laurentia. We propose that a fragment of the eclogitized, subducted Baltic continental crust was transferred to the base of the overriding Laurentian crust through trans-mantle wedge diapirism. A journey through the hot mantle wedge may explain the presence of abundant granitic intrusions within the Tvaerdal Complex.",

            "abstract": "The importance of atmospheric aerosol particles is clear. Numerical models of atmospheric aerosol are built around our best understanding of aerosol formation, mechanistic models attempting to account for the movement of compounds between the gaseous and condensed phases at a molecular level. How do we know our predictions of aerosol composition are accurate, the instruments used are sensitive enough or that our knowledge of key processes is adequate to enable accurate predictions? Despite a wealth of data from instruments as the aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), there are no direct methods to compare model-measurement output to inform us about sensitivity to key processes or components included, or not, in these models.\nIn short, can we take detailed speciated output from mechanistic models and predict the resultant EI mass spectra? To answer this, we must assess the applicability of algorithms to replicate a library of mass spectra from a range of compounds. This is the focus of a proof-of-concept study using a suite of supervised learning algorithms applied to output from the AMS. Supervised learning techniques represent not one but a number of different algorithms. The performance of any given method is sensitive to the 'signature' of molecular representations used as a basis for the training. By employing generic fingerprints used in clustering procedures to property predictive technique fragmentations, we probe the ability of a number of supervised learning methods to replicate measured EI mass spectra from a library of AMS measurements. Sensitivity to both under and over fitting are carried out along with predictions based on gas phase degradation mechanisms to illustrate the potential for refining future mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the timescales of magmatic differentiation is critical to understand the rate at which silicic plutonic and volcanic rocks form. However, directly dating this process is difficult because locations with both clear evidence for fractional crystallization and the accessory phases necessary for radiometric dating (e.g. zircon) are rare. This study focuses on the Dariv Igneous Complex in western Mongolia where early saturation of zircon in a suite of cogenetic, upper crustal (<0.5 GPa) igneous rocks ranging from biotite-bearing ultramafic cumulates through to evolved granitoids and late stage felsic dikes allows for dating of magmatic differentiation through U-Pb geochronology for the first time. Notably, zircon is an early crystallizing mineral in the Dariv Igneous Complex, first appearing in the ultramafic cumulates, likely due to the high-Zr contents and alkaline nature of the crystallizing parental melt. Detailed textural and petrographic observations confirm that zircon is magmatic in origin and crystallized either before or contemporaneously with the volumetrically dominant mineral phases. Indistinguishable crystallization ages from Th-corrected 206Pb/238U dates of zircons from 5 samples across the sequence indicate that fractionation from a basalt to high silica (>65 wt.% SiO2) melt occurred in ≤300 ka between 502-503 Ma. If crystallization rates in crustal intrusions are primarily a function of cooling, rates of fractionation will be strongly dependent on the size and depth of the magmatic system, as well as, the dynamics of magma chamber replenishment. Therefore, the Dariv Igneous Complex, which crystallized at relatively shallow, cool levels in the crust, represents an end-member constraint for timescales associated with fractional crystallization of a basaltic melt. Fractional crystallization of mantle-derived basalts in the lower crust may occur on more protracted timescales due to greater ambient temperatures at depth and repeated influx of hot basalts.",

Physical properties of snow such as high albedo, high insulation along with its ability to store moisture make it an integral component of mid- and high-latitude climates and it is therefore important that models capture these properties and associated processes. In this work we explore two items associated with snow and their role in the climate system. Firstly, a diagnostic measure of snow insulation that is rooted in the physics of heat transfer is introduced. Insulation of the ground during cold Arctic winters heavily influences the rate and depth of ground freezing (or thawing), which can then influence hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes. The ability of models to simulate snow insulation varies widely. Secondly, the role of snow upon seasonal forecasts is demonstrated within a currently operational modeling system. Due to model system biases, mass and longevity of snow can vary with forecasts. In turn, a longer lasting and greater moisture store can have impacts upon the surface temperature. These impacts can linger for over two months after all snow has melted. The cause of the biases is identified and a solution posed.",

Climate change projections predict warmer temperatures, higher evapotranspiration rates, and no foreseeable increase in precipitation. California, in particular, has supplemented their decreased surface water supplies by mining deep groundwater. However, this supply of groundwater is limited, especially with reduced recharge. These combined factors place California’s water-demanding society at dire risk. In an effort to quantify California’s risks, we present a fully integrated water cycle model that captures the dynamics of the subsurface, land surface, and atmospheric domains over the entire California basin. Our water cycle model combines HydroGeoSphere (HGS), a 3-D control-volume finite element model that accommodates variably-saturated subsurface and surface water flow with evapotranspiration processes to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a 3-D finite difference nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric simulator. The two-way coupling within our model, referred to as HGS-WRF, tightly integrates the water cycling processes by passing precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from WRF to HGS, while exchanging actual evapotranspiration and soil saturation data from HGS to WRF. Furthermore, HGS-WRF implements a flexible coupling method that allows each model to use a unique mesh while maintaining mass conservation within and between domains. Our simulation replicated field measured evapotranspiration fluxes and showed a strong correlation between the soil saturation (depth to groundwater table) and latent heat fluxes. Altogether, the HGS-WRF California basin model is currently the most complete water resource simulation framework as it combines groundwater, surface water, the unsaturated zone, and the atmosphere into one coupled system.",

            "abstract": "Intercalibration, validation, and data mining use cases require more efficient access to the massive volumes of observation data distributed across multiple agency data centers. The traditional paradigm of downloading large volumes of data to a centralized server or desktop computer for analysis is no longer viable. More analysis should be performed within the host data centers using server-side functions. Many comparative analysis tasks require far less than 1% of the available observation data. The Multi-Instrument Intercalibration (MIIC) Framework provides web services to find, match, filter, and aggregate multi-instrument observation data. Matching measurements from separate spacecraft in time, location, wavelength, and viewing geometry is a difficult task especially when data are distributed across multiple agency data centers. Event prediction services identify near coincident measurements with matched viewing geometries near orbit crossings using complex orbit propagation and spherical geometry calculations. The number and duration of event opportunities depend on orbit inclinations, altitude differences, and requested viewing conditions (e.g., day/night). Event observation information is passed to remote server-side functions to retrieve matched data. Data may be gridded, spatially convolved onto instantaneous field-of-views, or spectrally resampled or convolved. Narrowband instruments are routinely compared to hyperspectal instruments such as AIRS and CRIS using relative spectral response (RSR) functions. Spectral convolution within server-side functions significantly reduces the amount of hyperspectral data needed by the client. This combination of intelligent selection and server-side processing significantly reduces network traffic and data to process on local servers. OPeNDAP is a mature networking middleware already deployed at many of the Earth science data centers. Custom OPeNDAP server-side functions that provide filtering, histogram analysis (1D and 2D), spatial and spectral convolution deployed at NASA and NOAA facilities including LAADS, GES DISC, NCEI, and ASDC will enable efficient access to VIIRS, MODIS, AIRS, CRIS, CERES, and CALIPSO observation data in support of intercalibration, validation, and data mining studies.",

As a result of ocean acidification, marine organisms expend extra energy on modifying behaviors. The current rate of ocean acidification will deplete the marine food chain that much of the world relies on as their major food supply.\nThe purpose of this study was to understand whether and how ocean acidification affects the behavior of hermit crabs Clibanarius digueti. We hypothesized that an increase in carbonic acid would modify grazing and individual movement, because an increase in acidification alters the normal chemical composition of the water and potentially the niche occupancy of C. digueti.\nA model tidal pool experiment consisting of two tanks (control and treatment) inhabited with seven living C. digueti was set up in the Ocean Biome of Biosphere-2. Each tank was also provided with uninhabited shells: two Turbo fluctuosa and four Cerithium sp. Gaseous CO2 was dissolved into a treatment tank and measured as dissolved CO2 by using a sodium hydroxide titration method. Additionally, water conditions were characterized for UV- light and temperature. Two trials were run in this experiment with tanks and treatments interchanged in each trial. We assessed whether increased CO2 affected hermit crab shell change rate.\nWe found that shell changes only happened among C. digueti placed under increased CO2. The information from this analysis will allow us to assess whether ocean acidification affects basic behavior in hermit crabs, which could later affect population dynamics. Bringing together all of this information will allow us to measure the effects of climate change on the behavior of C.Digueti.",

            "abstract": "As the second largest river in China, the Pearl River discharges ∼7×107 tons of sediment annually to the South China Sea (SCS). About 80% of the sediment was deposited within the Pearl River Estuary; however, the compositional dynamics of organic carbon (OC) at this land-ocean interface is poorly known. This study aimed to delineate the sources, effect of the dam construction and the fate of sedimentary OC from the Feilaixia Dam to the Pearl River estuary and coastal SCS. Surface sediment was collected during a cruise in January 2012 for elemental, and stable carbon/nitrogen isotope analyses. Preliminary data showed that total OC increased from 0.6% at the Feilaixia Dam to 3.1% at Sihui city (100 km downstream from the dam), with the C/N ratio increasing from 10.4 to 18.9; the δ13C of OC, on the other hand, decreased from -20.57‰ to -29.04‰. From Sihui city to the edge of the Pearl River estuary (202 km from the dam), total OC (1.2± 0.6), C/N ratio (11.5 ± 1.0) and the δ13C of OC (-25.89 ± 0.69 ‰) all remained relatively constant. From the estuary towards the coastal SCS, the total OC decreased from 1.3 to 0.4%, with the C/N ratio also decreasing from 10.5 to 7.5; the δ13C of OC, on the other hand, increased from -26.24 to -21.20‰. These data indicate that the composition of riverine OC in general reflects terrestrial vascular plants (higher C/N ratio and more negative δ13C), which can be compounded by in situ primary production (lower C/N ratio and more positive δ13C) in the dam-created reservoir water body. The riverine organic matter, however, appears to regain its terrestrial signature before entering the estuary, which then is in balance with marine primary production (lower C/N ratio and more positive δ13C). The impact of soil and aquatic microbial processes on organic matter degradation also will be examined by analyzing their signature biomarkers and relationship to OC composition.",

            "abstract": "The need for efficient and effective communication of scientific ideas becomes more urgent each year.\nA growing number of societal and economic issues are tied to matters of science – e.g., climate change, natural resource availability, and public health. Societal and political debate should be grounded in a general understanding of scientific work in relevant fields. It is difficult for many participants in these debates to access science directly because the formal method for scientific documentation and dissemination is the journal paper, generally written for a highly technical and specialized audience. Journal papers are very effective and important for documentation of scientific results and are essential to the requirements of science to produce citable and repeatable results. However, journal papers are not effective at providing a quick and intuitive summary useful for public debate. \nJust as quantitative data are generally best viewed in graphic form, we propose that scientific studies also can benefit from visual summary and display. We explore the use of existing methods for diagramming logical connections and dependencies, such as Venn diagrams, mind maps, flow charts, etc., for rapidly and intuitively communicating the methods and results of scientific studies. We also discuss a method, specifically tailored to summarizing scientific papers that we introduced last year at AGU. Our method diagrams the relative importance and connections between data, methods/models, results/ideas, and implications/importance using a single-page format with connected elements in these four categories. Within each category (e.g., data) the spatial location of individual elements (e.g., seismic, topographic, gravity) indicates relative novelty (e.g., are these new data?) and importance (e.g., how critical are these data to the results of the paper?). The goal is to find ways to rapidly and intuitively share both the results and the process of science, both for communication between scientists and for communication more generally between scientists and other non-scientists.",

            "abstract": "Volcano infrasound provides a complementary view of volcanic processes to seismic waves, as the atmosphere exhibits contrasting wave propagation characteristics to the crust. Potential benefits include a more uniform velocity structure, shorter wavelengths enabling better spatial resolution, and lower attenuation improving remote monitoring capabilities. Recent work on volcano infrasound has employed kinematic source descriptions, in terms of such quantities as mass flux for a monopole point source. Such descriptions are quite useful for the inverse problem of inferring mass flux from infrasound data. In this study, we introduce a dynamic source model incorporating the physical processes that determine how the cloud of eruptive gas and ash expands outward to generate the infrasound signal. Our dynamic source model could ultimately be coupled to an unsteady conduit flow model, providing a means to infer more details of the eruption process from recorded infrasound signals.\nOur model describes a vulcanian eruption where mass is ejected into the atmosphere forming a cloud of gas and ash. Infrasonic acoustic waves are generated by the expansion of the cloud. The model goes beyond linear acoustics by accounting for nonlinear terms in the compressible Euler equations for the surrounding atmosphere. The model presently consists of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, expressing the balance of mass, momentum, and energy, that can be solved for the evolution of the radius of the cloud and pressure and temperature within it. Entrainment and heat exchange with the surrounding atmospheric air can be accounted for. Our analysis is inspired by similar models of underwater explosions (Gilmore, 1952) and seismic air-guns (Ziolkowski, 1970).\nWe aim to use the model to investigate how acoustic signals change when volcano properties, such as vent geometry, are varied. Our longer-term goal is to couple the atmospheric infrasound model presented here to an unsteady conduit flow model by mass, momentum, and energy conservation at the vent. The combined system will enable simulation of the complete suite of seismic-acoustic signals allowing the timing and development of eruptive source processes to be investigated in detail.",

            "abstract": "Solar energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions by an order of magnitude when substituted for fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the strategic deployment of solar energy—from single, rooftop modules to utility-scale solar energy power plants—can confer additional environmental co-benefits beyond its immediate use as a low carbon energy source. In this study, we identify a diverse portfolio of environmental co-benefit opportunities of solar energy technologies resulting from synergistic innovations in land, food, energy, and water systems. For each opportunity, we provide a demonstrative, quantitative framework for environmental co-benefit valuation—including, equations, models, or case studies for estimating carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and cost savings ($US) averted by environmental co-benefit opportunities of solar energy—and imminent research questions to improve certainty of valuations. As land-energy-food-water nexus issues are increasingly exigent in 21st century, we show that environmental co-benefit opportunities of solar energy are feasible in numerous environments and at a wide range of spatial scales thereby able to contribute to local and regional environmental goals and for the mitigation of climate change.",

            "abstract": "The hyperarid region of the Atacama Desert is considered one of the driest places on earth. Geomorphological studies suggest that this area has maintained a near-continuous hyperarid climate for at least the past 2 million years. Water-limited biological and geochemical processes have created a unique landscape with many similarities to Mars. While precipitation is rare in the Atacama Desert, coastal fog occurs regularly and microbial communities capable of utilizing fog and dew water are able to persist. Within this region, we found soils with lichen-dominated biological soil crusts living in association with physical sulfate crusts on the soil surface. Due to their high tolerance of desiccation and ability to utilize fog water, biologic soil crusts are able to exist in this hyperarid environment. We chose two sites ~30 km apart along a fog frequency transect which showed visible differences in the degree of biological coverage to study how shifts in fog water availability affect the biogeochemical processes occurring. Our previous radiocarbon dating and δ13C analysis of soil carbonates here indicates that soil in both locations has been accreting for over 15,000 years and confirmed that biological activity and rates of C cycling are greater at the higher fog frequency site. This study expands on that work to characterize the isotopic imprint of extreme aridity and evaporative processes in this environment, examining both organic and inorganic materials. A standard fatty acid extraction method was used and we were able to detect fatty acids in all soils analyzed, even those over 15,000 years old. Compound specific isotope analysis of these fatty acids clearly showed an enrichment of 2H at the drier site, with ~ 25 per mil difference between the surface samples. Similarly, analysis of δ18O of soil carbonates show ~10 per mil enrichment of 18O at the drier site. We attribute these differences to a prolonged and consistently greater evaporative stress at the eastern (drier) site, and note that this is one of the only studies to show an isotopic signature of evaporation in both organic and inorganic materials.",

This project is motivated by the need to densify and optimize the collection of high-quality seismic data relevant to key solid Earth and cryosphere science questions.\nThe GEOICE instruments and their power and other ancillary systems are being designed to require minimal installation time and logistical load (i.e., size and weight), while maximizing ease-of-use in the field. The system is capable of advanced data handling and telemetry while being able to withstand conditions associated with icy environments, including cold/wet conditions and high-latitude solar limitations.\nThe instrument capability will include a hybrid seismograph pool of broadband and intermediate elements for observation of both long-period signals (e.g, long-period surface waves and slow sources) and intermediate-to-short-period signals (e.g., teleseismic body waves, local seismicity, and impulsive or extended glaciogenic signals).\nKey features will include a design that integrates the seismometer and digitizer into a single, environmentally and mechanically robust housing; very low power requirements (~1 watt) for the intermediate-band systems; and advanced power systems that optimize battery capacity and operational limits. The envisioned ~100 element GEOICE instruments will nearly double the current polar inventory of stations and will be maintained and supported at the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center to ensure full and flexible peer-reviewed community use.\nPrototype instruments are currently deployed in Antarctica and Alaska, with a larger Antarctic deployment planned for the 2015-2016 season. The results of these field tests will help to refine instrumentation design and lead to the production of robust and capable next-generation seismic sensors.",

The potential for vast amounts of methane to be emitted from the seafloor into the atmosphere due to gas hydrate decomposition has been under scientific evaluation. However, despite the great extent of these geological reservoirs, much of the methane released from the seafloor in deep ocean environments does not reach the atmosphere. Once dissolved in ocean water, the emitted methane can be microbially converted to either carbon dioxide or assimilated to biomass. Here, we will present results from a research cruise to the Hudson Canyon, northern US Atlantic Margin, where we investigated changes in ocean water carbonate chemistry induced by the oxidation of methane released from gas seeps.

            "abstract": "The passive microwave mission SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) provides daily coverage of the polar regions and its data have been used to retrieve thin sea ice thickness up to about one meter. In addition, there has been an attempt to retrieve snow thickness over thick Arctic multi-year ice, which is a crucial parameter for the freeboard-based estimation of (thick) sea ice thickness from lidar and radar altimetry. SMOS provides measurements at a frequency of 1.4 GHz (L-band) at horizontal and vertical polarization for a range of incidence angles (0 to 60°). The retrieval of ice or snow parameters from SMOS measurements is based on an emission model that describes the 1.4 GHz brightness temperature of (snow-covered) sea ice as a function of the ice and snow thicknesses and the permittivities of these media, which are mainly determined by ice temperature and salinity and snow density, respectively. In the first attempts to retrieve snow thickness from SMOS data, these parameters were assumed to be constant in the emission model, and the resulting maps were compared with airborne ice and snow thickness measurements taken during NASA's Operation IceBridge mission in spring 2012.\nThe present approach to produce SMOS snow thickness maps is more elaborate. For example, available information on the ice surface temperature from MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images or from the IceBridge campaign itself are used, and the ice in the retrieval model is described by temperature and salinity profiles instead of using bulk values. As a first step we have produced (winter/spring) snow thickness maps of the Arctic, from 3-day-averages up to monthly means, using the available SMOS data from 2010 on. Here, we show how our spatial snow thickness distributions compare with IceBridge campaign data in the western Arctic from spring 2011 to 2015. In addition, we show how the temporal evolution of SMOS-retrieved snow thickness compares with snow buoy data. Although the results from these comparisons have to be interpreted cautiously, mainly due to the different spatial resolutions of SMOS (35-50 km footprint) and the smaller-scale airborne (and buoy) data, SMOS and IceBridge often agree as to where we find transitions from large-scale areas of very thin snow to areas predominantly covered by thicker snow.",

Specifically, flood events from cyclonic activity are the most common and widespread. Jamaica also experiences frequent flash floods, usually with insufficient lead time to enact efficient and targeted responses.\nOn average, there is at least one disastrous flood every four years in Jamaica, and from 1800 to 2003 fifty-four major floods took place, causing 273 fatalities and economic losses of over US$2 billion. Notably, the 1979 flood event in Western Jamaica caused 41 deaths and economic losses of US $27 Million, and which also has a 50 year return period.\nTo date, no Flood Warning System exists in Western Jamaica and there are limited rain and river gauges. Additionally, responses to climatic events within South-East Westmoreland communities are ad hoc, with little coordination. Many of the hazard responses have been reactive and some stakeholders have delayed to their detriment.[1] The use of Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS) to address such challenges is thus an option being considered by the community associations.\nThe Rio Cobre FEWS in the parish of St. Catherine serves as a best practice example of community driven flood warning systems in Jamaica. This is because of the collaborative approach to flood risk, strengthened by institutional arrangements between the Meteorological Service, Water Resources Authority, Office of Disaster Management, Scientists and residents of the surrounding communities. The Community Associations in South-East Westmoreland are thus desirous of implementing a FEWS similar to the Rio Cobre FEWS. This paper thus aims to analyse the implementation process in terms of key stakeholders involved, governance approach and the socio-economic impact of a collaborative approach on infrastructure and livelihoods, in the case of future flooding events.\n\n[1] (especially in the case of Hurricane Ivan 2004)",

            "abstract": "Floodwater resources control operation has an important role to reduce flood disaster, ease the contradiction between water supply and demand and improve flood resource utilization. Based on the basin safety and floodwater resources utilization with the maximum benefit for floodwater optimal scheduling, the optimal operation of multi-reservoir floodwater resources control model is established. There are two objectives of floodwater resources control operation in multi-reservoir system. The first one is floodwater control safety, the other one is floodwater resource utilization with the maximum benefit. For the floodwater control safety target, the maximal flood peak reduction criterion is selected as the objective function. The maximal flood peak reduction criterion means that choosing reducing most peak flow as the judgment standard of the flood control operations optimal solution. For the floodwater resource utilization, maximum benefit of floodwater utilization refers to make full use of multi-reservoir capacity, accumulate transit flood as much as possible. In the other word, it refers to take releasing water as least as possible as the target in the case of determining the flood process. The model is solved by the coupling optimal method of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO). GA-PSO uses the mutation for reference and takes PSO as a template, introduces the crossover and mutation into the search process of PSO in order to improve the search capabilities of particles. In order to make the particles have the characteristics of the current global best solution, crossover and mutation are used in the updated particles. Taking Shilianghe reservoir and Anfengshan reservoir in Jiangsu Province, China, for an case study, the results show that the optimal operation will reduce the floodwater resources control pressure, as well as keep nearly 81.11 million cubic meters floodwater resources accumulating in Longlianghe river and Anfengshan reservoir. The maximum discharging flow of Xinshuhe will reduce obviously, which will greatly relief the flood pressure of the downstream. The study of will provide effective protection for the safe floodwater utilization of Lianyungang City and provide a few of references for other cities.",

Balloon-borne x-ray detectors and satellites like SAMPEX have generally observed precipitation losses of three types, here characterized by their MLT distribution and related e-folding energy of the inferred precipitating electron energy spectrum, the third characterized by its burstiness and brief duration: soft (isotropic in MLT with e-folding for balloons between 50-100 keV, for SAMPEX between 100-300 keV), hard (concentrated in the dusk-to-midnight sector with e-folding for balloons > 200 keV, for SAMPEX > 400 keV), and microbursts (concentrated in the dawn-to-noon sector, bursty and very short temporal structure < 1s). Soft precipitation occurs much more often than the others, but has received less attention in the literature even though recent analysis of observed SAMPEX losses has shown that soft precipitation may account for the greatest electron loss from the quiet time radiation belts. The goal of this project is to compare/reconcile the different spectral characterizations of soft precipitation observed by BARREL and SAMPEX, and seek to understand the wave scattering mechanisms responsible for these losses.\nFor this work we will present the 2013/2014 observed BARREL precipitation events cataloged according to type, (soft, hard, microburst), MLT and L distribution, and geomagnetic/space weather conditions. In particular, we will use Van Allen Probe data to define the state of the belts and the position of the balloon relative to the plasmapause and trapping boundary before and after precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "Dhaka is a large growing megacity that depends on groundwater for mostly all kind of water needs. Consequently, overwhelming abstraction of groundwater has been causing a linear to exponential drop in groundwater level and substantial aquifer dewatering of the Dupi-Tila aquifer of Dhaka basin. Total water demand in Dhaka city varies from 2100 to 2300 Million Cubic Meter per Day (MCMD) with seasonal variation for a population of about 16 million. Analysis reveals that upper parts of the aquifer are already dewatered throughout the area, and the water level has dropped to 30 m below sea level in the south central part of the city, where the ground surface elevation is 5.7 m. Natural retention area and natural drainage areas are hindering by the unplanned and haphazard vertical and horizontal growth of the city which is ultimately fragmenting infiltration and aquifer recharge. This study uses MODFLOW-2005 to simulate three-dimensional, steady-state groundwater flow, while the inverse modeling approach of UCODE_2005 has been used for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, a through hydrogeological model has been constructed from 150 borehole lithological information for geological characterization of the aquifers. This study stresses the importance of the total water balance of the study area and how recharge and water pumping affect the total water balance. The calibrated model results exhibit the total water abstraction is about 2302 MCMD. The model results further reveals that, there is extreme decline of groundwater level in the extent of -37 meters below the mean sea level at the inner core of the city area and the trend of declining remains same over the years. The surrounding rivers play an important role to balance the water budget and there is stable connection between the rivers and aquifer. The outcome of the research will contribute to develop a rational and sustainable management approach for the groundwater resources management in future.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of REE between amphibole and silicate melt is important for understanding a variety of igneous processes involving amphibole. In general, amphibole-melt REE partition coefficients (DREE) depend on pressure (P), temperature (T), and compositions of amphibole and melt. A previous study parameterized the DREE in amphibole-melt solely as a function of melt composition [1]. Here, we use published REE partitioning data between amphibole and basaltic melt, the lattice strain model [2], and non-linear least squares regression method to parameterize key partitioning parameters in the lattice strain model (D0, r0, and E) as a function of P, T, and both amphibole and melt compositions. We focus on experimental data obtained by LA-ICP-MS and ion probe, and experiments close to equilibrium. Amphiboles and coexisting melts from the 38 experiments that we compiled span a wide range of compositions with the Mg# of amphibole and melt ranging from 36 to 100 and 15 to 99, respectively. Two models, which give nearly identical results, are explored in this study. In the first model, D0 is a function of T and amphibole composition: it negatively correlates with T and MgM1,2,3 content in amphibole, and positively correlates with TiM1,2,3 content in amphibole. In the second model, D0 is solely a function of the melt composition: it negatively correlates with the mole fraction of Ca in the melt. Interestingly, r0 and E are both constant and identical between the two models, suggesting D0 in the two models are equivalent. The latter allows us to develop a new thermometer for amphibole-melt equilibria. As an independent test, we compared model-derived temperatures with those reported in the phase equilibrium experiments. The predicted temperatures are within ±41°C on average of the reported temperatures, adding confidence to our parameterizations of D0. Our two parameterized lattice strain models can be used to model REE fractionation between amphibole and basaltic melts during igneous processes. Furthermore, our amphibole composition dependent model allows us to develop REE-in-amphibole-mineral thermobarometers in the future. [1] Tiepolo et al. (2007). RiMG 67(1), 417-452.

            "abstract": "The impact of interference between transient eddies and the climatological stationary eddies is examined with ERA-Interim Reanalysis data. Composite calculations show that constructive interference during winter occurs about one week after enhanced Warm Pool convection, and is followed by the excitation of the positive phase of the Pacific/North American teleconnection pattern, an increase in surface air temperature over much of the extratropical Northern Hemisphere, along with a reduction of sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas, a deceleration of the stratospheric polar vortex, and the excitation of the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This surface warming does occur without prior Warm Pool convection, but it is enhanced and prolonged when constructive interference occurs in concert with the convection. This suggests that climate extremes may be more likely to occur when particular processes, such as Warm Pool convection and constructive interference, occur together. Opposite features are observed when there is destructive interference.\nTo further investigate the influence of tropical convection, a series of idealized multi-level primitive equation model calculations is performed. The model’s heating profiles are determined from composite CMAP precipitation anomalies for La Niña and El Niño months, and for MJO phase 1 and phase 5. As in the atmosphere, the model calculations find extratropical 300-hPa geopotential height anomalies of opposite sign for MJO phase 1 and El Nino heating, even though the heating profiles closely resemble each other. (Analogous results were found for MJO phase 5 and La Nina.) The model was also run with individual heating anomalies in key geographic locations. The results suggest that the extratropical response to both ENSO and MJO convective heating anomalies can be understood as arising from the competing influences of Warm Pool and central Pacific tropical convection. These results allude to the possibility that the occurrence of climate extremes may be linked to the relative strength of convective precipitation anomalies in the Warm Pool and central tropical Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Local channel morphology is highly dependent on sediment supply from upstream reaches. Sediment pulses are introduced to channels during natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as landslides, dam removal, or gravel augmentation. Flume studies have shown that sediment pulses tend to evolve through some combination of translation and dispersion, but the relative importance of the sediment pulse size, the grain size of the pulse material, flow unsteadiness, and channel nonuniformity is poorly understood. Here we use a one-dimensional morphodynamic model to simulate the evolution of various sediment pulses in a straight, rectangular channel. The model is capable of determining transcritical flows, using the energy equation for subcritical nodes and a reduced momentum equation for supercritical nodes. Bed evolution and grain size sorting are handled with the mixed-grain-size Exner equation for sediment continuity. A stratigraphy submodel allows the vertical grain size distribution created during deposition to provide feedbacks on morphodynamic processes encountered during degradation. We explore how pulse characteristics such as total mass, feed timing, and grain size distribution affect pulse translation and dispersion. We also consider the influence of steady versus unsteady water discharge and the existence of background sediment feed. Finally, we examine the effect of variations in channel width by varying the amplitude and wavelength of downstream sinusoidal width undulations. Preliminary results suggest that smaller sediment pulses experience a greater degree of translation than larger pulses. Width variations, particularly those of larger amplitudes, were found to result in increased pulse dispersion. Our results suggest that morphodynamic models can facilitate understanding of what controls sediment pulse dynamics, and they may improve predictions and the potential effectiveness of river restoration techniques such as dam removal and gravel augmentation.",

Previous studies document declining bloom magnitude over decadal timescales in conjunction with decreasing sea-ice extent and duration in the Northern WAP, but less work has been to done explain the observed inter-annual variability in this region. Here we use a high-resolution in situ time series collected by the Palmer Station Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research program and satellite ocean color imagery to investigate the underlying mechanisms controlling phytoplankton bloom timing and magnitude near Palmer Station. We pair chlorophyll and CTD measurements collected twice per week during the austral summer, 1992—2003, with satellite ocean color and ice fractional cover data to examine bloom development and within-season trends in mixed layer depth. Initial results suggest a possible shift over time with spring/summer blooms occurring earlier in the growing season reflecting earlier sea-ice free conditions. Net phytoplankton accumulation rates are also computed and compared against growth estimates. Our results can be used to develop and validate models of coastal Antarctic primary production that better represent inter-annual primary production variability.",

At the same time, the strong spatial heterogeneity in snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) makes it challenging to evaluate gridded snow quantities using in situ point measurements. First, we have developed a new method to upscale point measurements into gridded datasets. This method is found to be superior to three other methods. It is then used to generate daily snow depth and SWE datasets for water years 2012-2014 at eight 2° X 2° areas using in situ measurements from the COOP and SNOTEL networks. These areas encompass a variety of terrain characteristics over North America.\nThese datasets are used to quantify the performance of daily snow depth and SWE initialization in the NCEP global forecasting models (GFS and CFS) and regional models (NAM and RAP). Model initializations which utilize AFWA snow depths (GFS, CFS, and NAM) are found to have a too shallow snow depth compared to our area averaged method. Across all areas and water years, our method averaged 0.58m (0.57m) of snow while the models averaged 0.18m (0.19m) with a mean absolute error of 0.42m (0.47m) for the global (regional) models utilizing AFWA data. These models also ended the snow season much too early on average (by more than a month). The RAP model, which cycles snow instead of initializing with AFWA snow depths, underestimates snow depth to a lesser degree and has a mean absolute error of 0.26m while ending the snow season about two weeks early on average. Compared with snow depth errors, SWE errors from GFS, CFS, and NAM are even larger because of their use of globally constant snow densities. Furthermore, we have evaluated the daily snow depth gridded data produced by the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), which has been utilized as the best available ground truth in multiple studies. It is found that the CMC product underestimates snow depth and has a mean absolute error of 0.40m on average across the eight areas and ended the snow season more than one month early on average. In other words, it is similar to the GFS, CFS, and NAM, but worse than RAP.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss these results, along with our current work on the development of a simple, physically based, snow density model for snow initialization.",

            "abstract": "We explore characteristics of energetic particles in the plasma sheet boundary layer associated with dipolarization events, based on simulations and observations. The simulations use the electromagnetic fields of an MHD simulation of magnetotail reconnection and flow bursts as basis for test particle tracing. They are complemented by self-consistent fully electrodynamic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The test particle simulations confirm that crescent shaped earthward flowing ion velocity distributions with strong perpendicular anisotropy can be generated as a consequence of near tail reconnection, associated with earthward flows and propagating magnetic field dipolarization fronts. Both PIC and test particle simulations show that the ion distribution in the outflow region close to the reconnection site also consist of a beam superposed on an undisturbed population; this beam, however, does not show strong perpendicular anisotropy. This suggests that the crescent shape is created by quasi-adiabatic deformation from ion motion along the magnetic field toward higher field strength. The simulation results compare favorably with ``Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\" (THEMIS) observations.",

At the theoretical level of resistive one-fluid MHD, the Sweet-Parker model leads to extremely low reconnection rates for virtually all space physics applications.\nKinetic plasma effects introduce new spatial and temporal scales into the theoretical description, which are expected to increase the reconnection rates. Within the theoretical framework of two-fluid MHD, we retain the effects of the Hall current and electron inertia and neglect dissipative effects such as viscosity and electric resistivity. This level of description brings two new spatial scales into play, namely, the ion and electron inertial scales. In absence of resistive dissipation, reconnection can only be attained by the action of electron inertia.\nWe performed 2.5D two-fluid simulations using a pseudo-spectral code which yields exact conservation (to round-off errors) of the ideal invariants. Our simulations show that when the effects of electron inertia are retained, magnetic reconnection takes place. In a stationary regime, the reconnection rate is simply proportional to the ion inertial length, as also emerges from a scaling law derived from dimensional arguments.",

In most cases those changes have, or are foreseen to have, marked impacts on water resources with implications for downstream population and ecosystems. One of the ways to assess climate change impacts on glacierized watersheds is to conduct appropriate statistical analyses on historical hydrometric data where long and accurate time series exist.\nIn the Yukon, Canada, a fair number of hydrometric time series are made accessible by institutions such as Environment Canada or the Yukon National Parks Organisation. Some of those time series have been studied previously at a regional scale in the territory. In the present study, focusing on the Duke River watershed area, we reanalyse these datasets based on a larger number of discharge characteristics and compare results with regional meteorological data analysis. We perform non-parametric trend analysis to assess long-term changes in watersheds response to climate-induced variability.\nEight watersheds with varying glacierized area were chosen for this study. Main glaciers in the region are situated in St. Elias Mountains and are characterised by ubiquitous mass loss (Arendt et al., 2002; Barrand and Sharp, 2010). Historical hydrometric data analysis shows two distinct hydrological regimes in the area: (i) – snow fed rivers with peak runoff following spring snowmelt, and (ii) – glacier fed rivers with peak runoff following glacier ablation in July. While total discharge during ablation season does not vary significantly between watersheds with different regimes, the difference in late summer runoff is close to 50%.\nMoreover, trend analysis provides evidence of changes in hydrological regimes in the area. As a response to ubiquitous temperature increase, hydrologically active period for highly glacieized watershed (with glacierized area of 30%) has shifted from the beginning of August to the beginning of July in the course of the last 39 years.\nResults of trend analysis also show increase in winter and early spring low flows for almost all watersheds. This can be attributed to changes of ground freezing/thawing timing, and thus reflects changes in ground water contribution to watershed runoff as a response to observed trends in climatic forcing.",

Most of the anthropogenic N is retained or removed by terrestrial and aquatic systems within watersheds, preventing this N from reaching the coast. Much research has focused on N removal in channelized stream reaches but recent studies have suggested that fluvial wetlands may play a larger role in the removal of anthropogenic N from aquatic ecosystems. We use the “Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization” (TASCC) method coupled with deployment of new in situ nitrate analyzer technology to conduct experiments in long residence time, wetland dominated stream reaches (e.g. beaver ponds, flood plains, natural wetlands). These sensor based TASCC experiments were performed in three headwater fluvial wetlands in the spring and early summer and repeated in the fall and early winter during the 2014 field season. Preliminary results from a beaver pond reach show that N removal (as a percentage of inputs) was greater than in similar length channelized streams in the same region, but that most of this was due to longer residence time rather than increased biological uptake rates. This suggests that increased abundance of fluvial wetlands due to beaver activity will enhance network-scale retention. Use of the in situ sensor allows us to capture fine-scale variability, allowing for a better understanding of different flow paths taken by water parcels traversing a wetland and providing a better estimate of N removal compared to the discrete grab sampling method.",

Resource assessment over large areas can be accelerated by using existing subsurface data collected for other purposes, such as petroleum industry bottom-hole temperature (BHT) datasets. BHT data are notoriously noisy but in many sedimentary basins their abundance offsets the potential low quality of an individual BHT measurement. Analysis requires description of conductivity stratigraphy, which for thousands of wells with BHT values is daunting. For regional assessment, a streamlined method is to approximate the thickness and conductivity of each formation using a set of standard columns rescaled to the sediment thickness at a location. Surface heat flow and related geothermal resource metrics are estimated from these and additional parameters. This study uses Monte Carlo techniques to compare the accuracy and precision of thermal predictions at single locations by the streamlined approach to well-specific conductivity stratigraphy. For 77 wells distributed across the Appalachian Basin of NY, PA, and WV, local geological experts made available detailed information on unit thicknesses . For the streamlined method we used the Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America (COSUNA) columns. For both data sets, we described thermal conductivity of the strata using generic values or values from the geologically similar Anadarko Basin. The well-specific surface heat flow and temperature-at-depth were evaluated using a one-dimensional conductive heat flow model. This research addresses the sensitivity of the estimated geothermal output to the model inputs (BHT, thermal conductivity) and the robustness of the approximate stratigraphic column assumptions when estimating the geothermal output. This research was conducted as part of the Dept. of Energy Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis program.",

Here we describe the resources that have been developed so that incoming data submitted by both citizen and professional scientists are reliable; these include training materials, such as a botanical primer and species profiles. We also describe a number of automated quality control processes applied to incoming data streams to optimize data output quality. Existing and planned quality control measures for output of raw and derived data include: (1) Validation of site locations, including latitude, longitude, and elevation; (2) Flagging of records that conflict for a given date for an individual plant; (3) Flagging where species occur outside known ranges; (4) Flagging of records when phenophases occur outside of the plausible order for a species; (5) Flagging of records when intensity measures do not follow a plausible progression for a phenophase; (6) Flagging of records when a phenophase occurs outside of the plausible season, and (7) Quantification of precision and uncertainty for estimation of phenological metrics.

Here we evaluate the skill of high-resolution simulations conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with coupled chemistry (WRF-Chem) in capturing spatio-temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE) by comparison with ground- and space- based remotely sensed observations. WRF-Chem is run over eastern North America at a resolution of 12 km for a year climatologically representative of typical meteorological and aerosol conditions. A small systematic positive bias in simulated AOD relative to observations is found (annual mean fractional bias MFB=0.17 and 0.39 when comparing with MODIS and AERONET respectively), whereas the spatial variability is well captured during most months. The spatial correlation of AOD shows a clear seasonal cycle with highest correlation during summer months (r=0.5-0.7) when the aerosol loading is large and more observations are available. AE is retrieved with higher uncertainty from the remote sensing observations, but the simulations present a negative bias (annual MFB =-0.10 for MODIS and -0.64 for AERONET), thus indicating the model is biased towards simulation of coarse mode aerosols, although the spatial correlation is 0.25-0.55 during most months. WRF-Chem also exhibits high skill in identifying areas of extreme and non-extreme aerosol loading, and its ability of correctly simulating the location and relative intensity of an extreme aerosol event (i.e. AOD>75th percentile) varies between 30 and 70% during winter and summer months respectively. Current work is directed to quantify the need for and benefits of regional downscaling and use of high-resolution global models by direct comparison with analogous runs at coarser resolution (60 km).",

These data may also be used by other agencies to monitor progress on damage repairs and restoration efforts by emergency responders and the public. Related requirements include repeatedly obtaining reference or baseline imagery before a major disaster occurs, as well as maintaining careful geodetic control on all imagery in a time series so that absolute georeferencing may be applied to the image stack through time. In addition, repeated post-event imagery acquisition is required, generally at a higher repetition rate soon after the event, then scaled back to less frequent acquisitions with time, to capture phenomena (such as fault afterslip) that are known to have rates that decrease rapidly with time. For example, lidar observations acquired before and after the South Napa earthquake of 2014, used in our extensive post-processing work that was funded primarily by FEMA, aided in the accurate forecasting of fault afterslip. Lidar was used to independently validate and verify the official USGS afterslip forecast. In order to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology, a development pipeline must be established and maintained to continually test and incorporate new sensors, while adapting these new components to the existing platform and linking them to the existing base software system, and then sequentially testing the system as it evolves. Improvements in system performance by incremental upgrades of system components and software are essential. Improving calibration parameters and thereby progressively eliminating artifacts requires ongoing testing, research and development. To improve the system, we have formed an interdisciplinary team with common interests and diverse sources of support. We share expertise and leverage funding while effectively and rapidly improving our system, which includes the sensor package and software for all steps in acquiring, processing and differencing repeat-pass lidar and electro-optical imagery, and the GRiD metadata and point cloud database standard, already used during disaster response surge events by other agencies (e.g., during Hurricane Sandy in 2012).",

In this presentation we will evaluate strategies for improving the resilience of rainfed agriculture in the region, particularly for the nearly 12 million hectares of sandy soil with low water holding capacity within Mato Grosso that has largely been converted to agricultural use. We will review land use change trajectories and present results from soil water balance modeling and carbon fluxes for a range of future scenarios, including continued agricultural extensification, potential strategies for agricultural intensification, and novel water and carbon management strategies including biochar use in sandy soils to improve soil water holding capacities and soil carbon sequestration. We will also consider the role that irrigation might play in the future in the Amazon for improving agricultural resilience to climate change and feedbacks between irrigation and land use change pressures, noting that groundwater resources in the region are presently among the least exploited on the planet.",

PANDA (Prydz Bay - Amery Ice shelf - Dome A) section is the key area of Chinese expedition in the Antarctic, and many scientific studies have been conducted here. In this research, SAR images including ERS-1/2, Envisat and ALOS were applied to estimate the ice velocity of PANDA Section using DInSAR and offset-tracking methods. Compared to MEaSUREs velocity (ice velocity map of the Antarctic released by National Snow and Ice Data Center) of 450 m resolution, our result with 200 m resolution achieved similar accuracy. Ice mass of PANDA section flows into the ocean mainly through Amery Ice Shelf and Polar Record Glacier. The ice velocity at the front edge of Amery Ice shelf is almost 1500 m/a, and the ice velocity of Polar Record Glacier can reach as high as 800 m/a. At most inner area of PANDA section, ice velocity is below 40 m/a. Due to the blocking of rocks and nunataks, ice flow feature in Grove Mountains area is quite complicated, which can help to demonstrate the meteorite concentration mechanism in this area.",

To provide a historical context for recent and expected experimentally-induced changes in the bog’s belowground carbon balance, we reconstructed historical carbon accumulation rates in peat using radiocarbon from 19 peat cores collected from randomly distributed SPRUCE plots. This unusually high number of cores allows us to assess spatial variability in age-depth profiles and accumulation rates across the SPRUCE study area within S1. This data, along with recent C flux measurements, show that the bog has been accumulating carbon for at least 12,0000 years and has continued to be a sink for atmospheric carbon of approximately 150 g C m-2 yr-1 in recent decades. Early Holocene accumulation rates are similar to those reported for other northern peatlands (approximately 25 g C m-2 yr-1), but apparent carbon accumulation decreased substantially around 3,000 years ago (to 5-15 g C m-2 yr-1) and stayed low until the last century. This decrease is considerably larger than that reported for other peatlands and is therefore unlikely to result only from cooling during the Holocene or bog succession. Although no charcoal has been found in peat at this site, evidence from a neighboring bog indicates a considerable amount of peat formed during this period was consumed by fire and it is possible that smoldering fires consumed peat, resulting in low apparent accumulation rates. Past droughts may have also contributed to observed trends by lowering the acrotelm/catotelm boundary, allowing for enhanced aerobic peat decomposition. This work provides important background information on spatial variability and carbon biogeochemistry that will aid in interpretation of climate change simulation experiments at S1.",

Key to understanding solar system formation and subsequent dynamical and chemical evolution is the origin and evolution of the giant planets and their atmospheres. Additionally, the atmospheres of the giant planets serve as laboratories to better understand the atmospheric chemistries, dynamics, processes, and climates on all planets in the solar system including Earth, offer a context and provide a ground truth for exoplanets and exoplanetary systems, and have long been thought to play a critical role in the development of potentially habitable planetary systems.\nRemote sensing observations are limited when used to study the bulk atmospheric composition of the giant planets of our solar system. A remarkable example of the value of in situ measurements is provided by measurements of Jupiter’s noble gas abundances and helium mixing ratio by the Galileo probe. In situ measurements provide direct access to atmospheric regions that are beyond the reach of remote sensing, enabling the dynamical, chemical and aerosol-forming processes at work from the thermosphere to the troposphere below the cloud decks to be studied.\nStudies for a newly proposed Saturn atmospheric entry probe mission named Hera is being prepared for the upcoming European Space Agency Medium Class (M5) mission announcement of opportunity. A solar powered mission, Hera will take approximately 8 years to reach Saturn and will carry instruments to measure the composition, structure, and dynamics of Saturn’s atmosphere.\nIn the context of giant planet science provided by the Galileo, Juno, and Cassini missions to Jupiter and Saturn, the Hera Saturn probe will provide critical measurements of composition, structure, and processes that are not accessible by remote sensing. The results of Hera will help test competing theories of solar system and giant planet origin, chemical, and dynamical evolution.",

As such, any predictions of future climate need to incorporate and quantify the sources of this uncertainty. One of the largest sources comes from the internal, chaotic, variability within the climate system itself. This variability has been approximated using the 30 ensemble members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble. Here we examine the wet and dry end members of this ensemble for cool-season precipitation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains with a set of high-resolution regional climate model simulations. We have used the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to simulate the periods 1990-2000, 2025-2035, and 2070-2080 on a 4km grid. These simulations show that the broad patterns of change depicted in CESM are inherited by the high-resolution simulations; however, the differences in the height and location of the mountains in the WRF simulation, relative to the CESM simulation, means that the location and magnitude of the precipitation changes are very different. We further show that high-resolution simulations with the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) predict a similar spatial pattern in the change signal as WRF for these ensemble members. We then use ICAR to examine the rest of the CESM Large Ensemble as well as the uncertainty in the regional climate model due to the choice of physics parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Low-temperature thermochronology has become an established tool for deciphering the time-temperature (t-T) histories of sedimentary units involved in basin burial and thrust-belt exhumation. However, thermochronologic datasets from detrital samples can be complex and difficult to interpret if these samples contain grains with different pre-depositional t-T histories that are only partially reset. Here, we present an approach for interpreting complex detrital zircon (U-TH)/He datasets to constrain the maximum foreland basin burial temperatures and timing of thrust-belt related exhumation in the Sevier belt of central Utah. Using forward modeling of t-T paths, we combine the radiation-damage based kinetic model for He diffusion in zircon with a series of pre-depositional He ages to construct “inheritance envelopes” that encompass a wide range of age variation. A forward model is successful if an inheritance envelope captures or bounds the observed age variation in a given dataset. We highlight this approach with two datasets collected from sedimentary units in the Oquirrh Mountains and Wasatch Range near Provo, UT. For the Oquirrh Mtns. dataset, large observed age variation is modeled using a maximum burial temperature of ~173 °C, and an initial Sevier-belt related exhumation event at 110 Ma. The Wasatch Range samples are more straight-forward, with a lack of partially reset ages but some observed variation caused by radiation damage effects. For these samples, our model results constrain a maximum burial temperature of ~230 °C, with a subsequent exhumation event at 100 Ma. Combined, these results suggest a steady eastward migration of exhumation in the Sevier belt during the Late Cretaceous and demonstrate that our inheritance envelope approach is most sensitive to maximum burial temperatures and the timing of initial exhumation.",

The fate and removal of DOM is a result of several complex conditions and processes, including photodegradation, sorption/desorption, dominant vascular plant sources, and microbial abundance. In order to better constrain factors affecting microbial degradation, laboratory incubations were performed using Sacramento River water for microbial inoculums and vascular plant leachates. Four vascular plant sources were chosen based on their dominance in the Sacramento River Valley: gymnosperm needles from Pinus sabiniana (foothill pine), angiosperm dicot leaves from Quercus douglassi (blue oak), angiosperm monocot mixed annual grasses, and angiosperm monocot mixed Schoenoplectus acutus (tule) and Typha spp. (cattails). Three concentrations of microbial inoculum were used for each plant material, ranging from 0.2% to 10%. Degradation was monitored as a function of time using dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV-Vis absorbance, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), and was compared across vascular plant type and inoculum concentration.",

Both plate and non-plate tectonic origin theories such as stacking of subducted slabs or multiple mantle plume underplating have been proposed to explain keel growth.\nEastern Canada is an ideal continental region to investigate cratonization processes and the onset of plate tectonics. It comprises part of the largest Archean craton in the world, the Superior Province, flanked by a ~1.1 Ga Himalayan-scale orogenic belt, the Grenville Province, and the 500-300 Ma old Appalachian orogenic province, following the same general SW-NE axial trend. The region is also cross-cut by the Great Meteor Hotspot track, providing an excellent opportunity to study the interaction of hotspot tectonism with progressively younger lithospheric domains.\nWe investigate the lithospheric structure of Precambrian Eastern Canada using teleseismic earthquake data recorded at permanent and temporary networks. We measure interstation dispersion curves of Rayleigh wave phase velocities between ~15 and 220 s, and compare the results to standard continental and cratonic reference models. We combine the dispersion curves via a tomographic inversion which solves for isotropic phase velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy across the region at a range of periods. The phase velocity maps indicate variations in lithospheric properties from the heart of the Superior craton to the SE Canadian coast.\nThe new regional-scale models will help to understand the processes that generated, stabilized and reworked the cratonic roots through their billion-year tectonic history. We investigate how surface tectonic boundaries relate to deeper lithospheric structural changes, and consider the effects of the multiple Wilson cycles that affected Laurentia.",

            "abstract": "The measurement of orthogonal polarization planes from laser light scattered by clouds and aerosols is a common technique to classify cloud conditions or aerosol types using lidar. Increasingly, polarization measurements are evolving from qualitative assessments of liquid-to-ice phase transitions in clouds to more precise quantitative measurements of mixed phase clouds, cloud particle orientation, and aerosol type classifications. Viewing polarization retrievals in a more quantitative way can enhance the information content related to cloud or aerosol particles but requires a precise understanding of system and scattering effects. Herein, measurements of multiple, non-orthogonal, planes of linear polarization are implemented to advance the use of quantitative assessment of lidar polarization methods for cloud and aerosol studies. Results from the Clouds Aerosols Polarization and Backscatter (CAPABL) Lidar, located at Summit Camp, Greenland (72035’N, 38025’W), will be presented to examine the advantages of using multiple planes of linear polarization. The advantages demonstrated are enhanced signal dynamic range, reduced system effects due to signal saturation, ability to independently measure horizontal orientation of ice crystals, and self-calibration of retrievals. Data from the recently upgraded system will be presented to demonstrate these advantages, which allow CAPABL to adjust and increase signal dynamic range by approximately an order of magnitude while simplifying calibration and reducing systematic errors. These enhancements facilitate a more quantitative retrieval to describe mixed phase clouds and horizontally oriented ice crystals, both, of which, have important implications to Greenland’s mass and energy budgets by modulating cloud scattering properties.",

Managing these uncertainties will require that regional water utilities identify regionally coordinated, scarcity-mitigating strategies that trigger the appropriate actions needed to avoid water shortages and financial instabilities. This research focuses on the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, seeking to engage the water utilities within Raleigh, Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill in cooperative and robust regional water portfolio planning. Prior analysis of this region through the year 2025 has identified significant regional vulnerabilities to volumetric shortfalls and financial losses. Moreover, efforts to maximize the individual robustness of any of the mentioned utilities also have the potential to strongly degrade the robustness of the others. This research advances a multi-stakeholder Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) framework to better account for deeply uncertain factors when identifying cooperative management strategies. Results show that the sampling of deeply uncertain factors in the computational search phase of MORDM can aid in the discovery of management actions that substantially improve the robustness of individual utilities as well as of the overall region to water scarcity.

            "abstract": "As tropical glaciers rapidly recede in response to climate change, the storage and discharge of groundwater will play an increasing role in regulating river baseflow, particularly during the dry season, when stream flow is currently sustained predominantly by glacial melt. Little is understood regarding the hydrogeologic processes controlling base flow characteristics of low-gradient proglacial valleys of the Cordillera Blanca in Northwestern Peru, which has the world's highest density of tropical glaciers. To better understand the processes of groundwater storage and discharge in proglacial meadows, we completed seismic refraction surveys in three representative valleys of the Cordillera Blanca range: the Quilcayhuanca, Yanamarey, and Pachacoto valleys. The locations of survey transects were chosen based on locations of previous sediment core sampling, GPR lines, and quantification of groundwater-surface water interaction derived from dye and temperature tracing experiments. The seismic surveys consisted of 48 vertical component geophones with 2.5 m spacing. Across the three representative valleys a total of 15 surveys were conducted, covering a distance of 1800 m in cross, down, and oblique-valley directions. Preliminary interpretation of the seismic refraction data indicates a maximum imaging depth of 16 m below land surface, and a transition from glacio-lacustrine sediments to buried saturated talus at a depth of 6 m in the Quilcayhuanca valley. The organic-rich glacio-lacustrine sediments in the Yanamarey valley have seismic velocities ranging from 300 to 800 m/s and are >16 m in thickness at mid- valley. Weathered metasedimentary bedrock in the Pachacoto valley was imaged at ~5 m below the valley surface, exhibiting a p-wave velocity of 3400 m/s. The knowledge of hydrogeologic structure derived from seismic refraction surveys will provide crucial boundary conditions for future groundwater models of the valleys of the Cordillera Blanca.",

            "abstract": "The Regional Seismic Travel Time (RSTT) tomography model has been developed to improve travel time predictions for regional phases (Pn, Sn, Pg, Lg) in order to increase seismic location accuracy. The RSTT model is specifically designed to exploit regional phases for location, especially when combined with teleseismic arrivals. The latest RSTT model (version 201404) has been released (http://www.sandia.gov/rstt). Travel time uncertainty estimates for RSTT are determined using one-dimensional (1D), distance-dependent error models, that have the benefit of being very fast to use in standard location algorithms, but do not account for path-dependent variations in error, and structural inadequacy of the RSTTT model (e.g., model error). Although global in extent, the RSTT tomography model is only defined in areas where data exist. A simple 1D error model does not accurately model areas where RSTT has not been calibrated. We are developing and investigating a new covariance matrix for RSTT phase arrivals by mathematically deriving this multivariate error model directly from a unified model of RSTT embedded into a statistical random effects model that captures distance, path and model error effects. An initial method developed is a two-dimensional path-distributed method using residuals. Other methods include a complete random-effects model and the calculation of the full model covariance matrix from the RSTT tomographic inversion. The goals for any RSTT uncertainty method are for it to be both readily useful for the standard RSTT user as well as improve travel time uncertainty estimates for location.",

Investigations of stratigraphy at two sites on Matua Island reveal 16-19 deposits in 3,300 years and as many as 34-36 deposits at one site on Simushir Island in 2,350 years. Average tsunami recurrence intervals on Matua are on the order of ~150 years between events, and ~65 years on Simushir. While these intervals are short, they are comparable to other parts of the Japan-Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone. All survey locations show shortening recurrence intervals toward the present, especially in the last 600 years when tsunami recurrence averages 55-75 years on Matua and 45 years on Simushir. The shorter recurrence intervals may due in part to preservation bias, but shorter rates in the same time interval have not been observed on the rest of the subduction zone.\nRecent tsunamis in 2006 and 2007 from Mw 8.4 and 8.1 earthquakes with 5-20 m runup and 100-400 m inundation provide a test case to compare paleotsunami inundation. Shoreline reconstructions were calculated using tephra deposition on prograding beach ridge plains. On Simushir, tsunamis at least 11 m higher than the 2006 and 2007 tsunamis occurred every ~300 years. Tsunamis on Matua with slightly farther inundation than 2006 and 2007 occurred every ~215 years while those that inundated at least 100 m farther every ~750 yrs.",

            "abstract": "Operations such as CO2 geologic storage, enhanced geothermal systems, and wastewater injection are rendering fluid injection as important as fluid extraction. In particular, injecting fluid colder than the original fluid causes thermal contraction and ensuing decreases in stresses, which yield an effect opposite of what volume expansion driven by the fluid injection imposes. In this study, we conduct numerical simulations to investigate pore-pressure buildup, thermal diffusion, and stress changes for two conditions: (1) constant rate, and (2) stepwise injection of cold fluid. The numerical-simulation method—which combines fluid flow, poroelasticity, thermal diffusion, and thermal stress—is based on the single-phase flow condition to simplify a computation model and thus facilitate a focus on mechanical responses. We also examine temporal evolutions of stress states and mobilized friction angles across base, injection-zone, and caprock layers for two different stress regimes: normal-faulting and reverse-faulting. Under the normal-faulting stress regime, the maximum mobilized friction angle occurs inside of the injection zone, which may act to improve the stability of the caprock. Special attention is required, however, because the location of the maximum mobilized friction angle is close to interfaces with the caprock and base layers. The hypothetical stepwise injection of cold fluid is shown to improve the stability of the injection zone to some extent. Under the reverse-faulting stress regime, the maximum mobilized friction angle occurs near the middle of the injection zone; stability in the injection zone is enhanced while that in the caprock/base is aggravated with time. The hypothetical stepwise injection not only helps improve the stability of the injection zone but also delays the moment when the maximum friction angle is mobilized. Finally, we suggest using dimensionless parameters to determine a prevalence of the thermal-stress effect in the injection zone.",

            "abstract": "Tilt transients are common at active volcanoes and potentially mark magma and gas movements in a frequency band between GPS and typical broadband seismometers. Tiltmeters record such signals, but for optimal sensitivity, require a borehole installation, which especially restricts their use in remote or culturally sensitive areas. The summit of Kīlauea Volcano hosts a network of 4 tiltmeters within 5 km of the summit vent, but none within 2 km because of the culturally sensitive nature of Kīlauea Caldera. The almost equidistant configuration of the tilt network limits the ability to resolve the depth of the source of tilting, and the distance from the source limits the resolution of near-surface events, such as those associated with processes affecting the lava lake. There is, however, an 11 station broadband seismometer network within 5 km of the summit vent, with 5 stations within 2 km. Data from these seismometers can be converted to tilt to augment the existing tiltmeter network. This improved network of tiltmeters and seismometers has the potential to support detailed modeling of processes operating on the timescale of hours to a day. We develop a set of parameters to enable the transform of velocity to tilt in near-real-time for use in volcano monitoring and rapid modeling. We also investigate the use of recursive filtering to rapidly and efficiently transform a streaming broadband signal to tilt and enable its near-real time interpretive utility.\nWe look at a variety of signals, including crater rim collapses, very long period earthquakes, long period earthquake swarms and lava lake overflows in order to better understand the sensitivity of the broadband seismometers to different frequencies of tilt. To validate the transform from velocity to tilt, especially the amplitude, we examine two collocated tiltmeter-broadband seismometer stations. In general, the broadband seismometer network has more sensitivity to minor tilt transients because of its proximity to the tilt source.",

Combining LIDAR, SODAR, RADAR, and sonic anemometer data, provides a means to analyse time-scales from 0.02 seconds to 15 years! and heights from 10m to 8km! Understanding and modelling the properties of the atmosphere over these immense ranges of space and time scales with a unique model is only possible through the scales. Moreover, the complex relationships between space and time-scales in the boundary- layer means symmetries differ greatly from classical turbulence theory. Small-temporal scale analysis (<15 minutes) of the velocity fluctuations shows (now) classical models for turbulence are respected over all measurement locations; classical in the sense that a Kolmogorov turbulence model with a significant intermittency correction is respected. Above these time-scales the stability of the atmosphere plays a key role. As such the time-scaling of the velocity is much more complex and classical space-time symmetries aren’t respected. Using empirically estimated spectral energies and simple scaling and symmetry arguments we propose a model for the atmospheric boundary-layer that predicts only two possible profiles for the vertical transfer of energy. We discuss the space-time scaling properties of this model and the consequences thereof for the velocity fluctuations.",

Based on a local emission inventory, a control simulation (CTRL) was performed for the period 28/01-02/02/2014, during a summer season characterized by intense solar radiation and temperature positive anomalies, which resulted in high pollutant concentration. Sensitivity tests were performed using different vehicular emission scenarios and CTRL. In scenario A), emissions were removed from a region which encompasses almost the entire urban area of the SPMA, only roads in the outskirts had regular emissions. Comparing scenario A) to CTRL, sharp decreases in CO, NO and NO2 were observed inside the SPMA. Ozone decreased slighlty during the day, probably due to the significant absence of precursor emissions which form ozone during the day in the presence of sunlight. On the other hand, ozone concentrations increased at night, influenced by the absence of ozone-consuming precursors inside the densely urbanized SPMA, in the absence of sunlight. In scenario B), we removed emissions from a smaller area, corresponding roughly to an expanded downtown area (where a few traffic restriction laws operate). The goal of this scenario was to observe possible impacts if more strict traffic restriction laws were implemented. In scenario C), emissions were decreased by 50% in the same area, in an attempt to characterize concentrations in an urban toll scenario. Results from scenarios B) and C) showed a decrease in NO, NO2 and CO, but less intense than in scenario A). On the other hand, a higher increase in ozone was detected both during the day and at night compared to the CTRL and scenario A). These results suggests that, along with lower concentrations of precursor gases and CO, higher ozone concentrations are likely to be expected in downtown Sao Paulo if more severe traffic restriction laws should be implemented. This is concerning because ozone exceeds air quality standards more often than primary gaseous pollutants in the SPMA, especially during periods with favourable atmospheric conditions. These simulations are part of the partial results of the PhD thesis of the author; further experiments are planned to improve the accuracy and spatial representativeness of the simulations.",

At ~5.6ºN, the subducting plate has a 240-km east-west offset associated with a slab tear, called the Caldas tear, that separates the northern and southern segments. Our study seeks to better define the slab geometry and deformation in the southern segment, which has a high rate of intermediate-depth earthquakes (50-300 km) between 3.6ºN and 5.2ºN in the Cauca cluster. From Jan 2010 to Mar 2014, 228 intermediate-depth earthquakes in the Cauca cluster with local magnitude Ml 2.5-4.7 were recorded by 65 seismic stations of the Colombian National Seismic Network. We review and, if necessary, adjust the catalog P and S wave arrival picks. We use the travel times to relocate the earthquakes using a double difference relocation method. For earthquakes with Ml ≥3.8, we also use waveform modeling to compute moment tensors . The distribution of earthquake relocations shows an ~15-km-thick slab dipping to the SE. The dip angle increases from 20º at the northern edge of the cluster to 38º at the southern edge. Two concentrated groups of earthquakes extend ~40 km vertically above the general downdip trend, with a 20 km quiet gap between them at ~100 km depth. The earthquakes in the general downdip seismic zone have downdip compressional axes, while earthquakes close to the quiet gap and in the concentrated groups have an oblique component. The general decrease in slab dip angle to the north may be caused by mantle flow through the Caldas tear. The seismicity gap in the slab may be associated with an active deformation zone and the concentrated groups of earthquakes with oblique focal mechanisms could be due to a slab fold.",

            "abstract": "The upper plate of the Costa Rica subduction zone is dissected by hundreds of normal faults that cut through the uppermost 500 – 1000m of slope sediment cover sequences within the upper slope and outer shelf of the Costa Rica margin. These faults are typically spaced 10s to 100s of m apart and have only small offsets of < 30 m. We have mapped more than 100 of these faults by tracing them along the inline, crossline and horizontal slices through a 3D seismic reflection data volume. These data were acquired on the R/V Langseth in 2011 using a 3,300 in3airgun source and a 6,000 m streamer with inline and crossline spacing of 18.75 m and 12.5 m respectively. Two primary populations of normal faults have conjugate sets that can be mapped across the upper slope and the outer shelf. The first set strikes slightly west of north and rotates systematically from 345° at the northern edge of the survey, which is located midway between the shelf break and the shoreline, to an orientation of 325° beneath the upper slope. We interpret this set as a result of WNW-ESE extension, which has been hypothesized to be a result of the collision between the Cocos Ridge (~75 km to the SE) and the Costa Rica margin (La Femina, et al., 2009). The second set of normal faults strikes east with an azimuth of 85°. This set of faults has a consistent orientation across the shelf and upper slope. This orientation is roughly parallel to the orientation of the subducting basement ridges (78°), which form horst and graben structures on the down going plate. These faults may be a result of uplift and extension as subducting ridges pass underneath. However, beneath the upper slope additional fault populations emerge with dominant azimuths primarily oriented at 5° and 65°. These faults appear to mark the localized extension caused by growth and uplift in the underlying margin wedge. Further, recent movement on shallow thrust faults indicates active shortening of the upper plate. We speculate that the contrast in the variability of fault populations beneath the upper slope and shelf is a result of a change in the competence of upper plate that allows more stress localization within the margin wedge beneath the slope than beneath the shelf.\nLaFemina, et al.

However, new stratigraphical, structural, geochemical and geochronological data indicate that the Imbert Fm constitutes a coarsening-upward tectono-stratigraphic sequence that records the transition of the sedimentation from a pre-collisional forearc to a syn-collisional piggy-back basin during the Caribbean island arc-North America continent collision.\nThe Imbert Fm unconformably overlies different structural levels of the Caribbean subduction-accretionary prism, including a supra-subduction zone ophiolite (the Puerto Plata complex) and a serpentinite subduction channel (the Río San Juan complex), and consists of three laterally discontinuous units that record the exhumation of the underlying basement. The distal turbiditic lower unit includes the latest volcanic activity of the Caribbean island arc; the more proximal turbiditic intermediate unit is moderately affected by syn-sedimentary faulting; and the upper unit is a (chaotic) olistostromic unit, composed of serpentinite-rich polymictic breccias, conglomerates and sandstones, strongly deformed by syn-sedimentary faulting, slumping and sliding processes. The Imbert Fm is followed by subsidence and turbiditic deposition of the overlying El Mamey Group.\nThe 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase plateau ages obtained in gabbroic rocks from the Puerto Plata ophiolitic complex indicate its exhumation at ~45-40 Ma (lower-to-middle Eocene), contemporaneously to the sedimentation of the overlying Imbert Fm. These cooling ages imply the uplift to the surface and submarine erosion of the complex to be the source of the ophiolitic fragments in the Imbert Fm, during of shortly after the emplacement of the intra-oceanic Caribbean island-arc onto the North America southern continental margin.",

The 1988 (M4.6) and 1990 (M5.2) Upland earthquakes have been attributed to this fault and it has been suggested that it is capable of producing a magnitude M6.0-6.5 earthquake. Sections of the fault are considered to run through the campus of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona as inferred from a 2001 geotechnical engineering report (Geocon, 2001). As it cuts across the campus, the geotechnical engineering report concluded that it has a reverse component of motion. Ascertaining the precise location of the San Jose fault traces on campus is crucial as the university plans its future buildings. Resistivity surveys were conducted across several suggested traces of the fault. The surveys consisted of 24 electrodes in a Wenner electrode configuration with an electrode spacing that varies between 1-5m. An IRIS Instruments Syscal KID switcher unit provided the power source and data recording hardware. The data was processed using IRIS Prosys II software suite before using Geotomo’s Res2Dinv software to obtain 2D images of subsurface resistivity for these profiles. A total of 23 surveys were conducted throughout the campus. Surveys were performed before and after rainfall to compensate for the variation of water content and its effect on resistivity. Preliminary results indicate shallow, north-dipping contrasts in resistivity across many of the areas where the fault was previously identified in the Geocon 2001 report. More data will be analyzed to present an enhanced understanding of the San Jose fault in the vicinity of the Cal Poly Pomona campus at AGU.",

While short-term flood warning systems are improving in number and sophistication, forecasting systems on the order of months to seasons are a rarity, yet may lead to further disaster preparedness. In this study, prospects of season-ahead flood forecasts are investigated by examining inter-annual climate variability on seasonal maximum floods, particularly how ENSO and other large-scale phenomena may modulate discharge and flood severity. Predictability of main seasonal floods is also assessed globally using PCR-GLOBWB simulations with large- and local- climate drivers, and validated with GRDC streamflow. Skillful prediction can lead to season-ahead flood probabilities, flood extent, estimated damages, and eventually integrate into early warning systems for informed advanced planning and management. This is especially attractive for regions with limited observations and/or little capacity to develop early warning flood systems.",

            "abstract": "Evidence from the joint interpretation of proxy data as well as geodynamical and biogeochemical modeling results point to complex interactions between sea level drawdown, volcanic degassing, and atmospheric CO2 that hampered the climate system’s decent into the last ice age. Ice core data shows that atmospheric CO2 dropped abruptly into glacial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4 at ~71 ka, while Antarctic temperatures display a more gradual decline between ~85 ka to ~71 ka across the MIS 5/4 transition. Based on 2D and 3D geodynamical simulations, we show that a ~60-100 m sea level drop associated with the MIS 5/4 transition led to a significant increase in magma and possibly CO2 flux at mid-ocean ridges (MOR) and oceanic hotspot volcanoes. The MOR signal is assessed with 2D thermomechanical models that account for mantle melting and resolve the flux of incompatible carbon dioxide. These models have been run at different spreading rates and integrated with the global distribution of opening rates to compute global variations in magma and CO2 flux across the MIS 5/4 transition. 3D plume models have been used to quantify the impact of a dropping sea level on oceanic hotspot melting and CO2 release. Here a wide range of simulations with differing plume fluxes, lithospheric thicknesses as well as speeds, and plume excess temperatures have been integrated with data from ~40 hotspots in order to compute a global signal. Biogeochemical carbon cycle modeling shows that the predicted increase in volcanic emissions is likely to have raised atmospheric CO2 by up to 15 ppmv, sufficient to explain the bulk of the decoupling between temperature and atmospheric CO2 during the global change to pronounced glacial conditions across the MIS 5/4 transition.",

            "abstract": "The Southeastern United States includes some of the most intensively managed forests worldwide and conversion from natural forests to pine plantations is projected to increase. Currently, natural and unmanaged forests are being replaced with young, fast growing loblolly pine plantations to cope with an increasing demand for timber. These large scale land cover/management changes can impact key features of the hydrological cycle such as the generation of convective rainfall (i.e. thermodynamic precipitation). The role of stand age in regulating land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms is here investigated by the combined use of field observations and modeling. We use simple analytical solutions to describe the diurnal evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the lifting condensation level so as to derive relations for cloudy/cloudless conditions (a proxy for the predisposition of the system to trigger convective rainfall) as a function of soil water content (SWC) and free atmosphere (FA) conditions. Results from four study sites suggest that young pine plantations maximize soil water depletion while minimizing rainfall suppression, thereby reducing the risk of water stress. In contrast, mature pine stands are more tolerant to drought, and cloud formation becomes nearly independent of the soil conditions. Our findings suggest that the impact of land cover, and therefore management practices, on ABL processes is encoded in the non-linear response of the Bowen ratio to changes in the SWC. Given the observed FA conditions in the Southeastern US, age-related changes in the surface energy fluxes can modify cloud cover and rainfall recycling mechanisms.",

Validation of snow characteristics is performed by comparing simulations against available observations from MODIS, ISCCP and CMC. Results show that the model is able to represent the main spatial distribution of snow characteristics with some overestimation in snow mass and snow depth over the Canadian high Arctic. Some overestimation in surface albedo is also noted for the boreal region which is believed to be related to the snow unloading parameterization, as well as the overestimation of snow albedo. SAF is assessed both in seasonal and climate change contexts when possible. The strength of SAF is quantified as the amount of additional net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere as surface albedo decreases in association with a 1°C increase in surface temperature. Following Qu and Hall (2007), this is expressed as the product of the variation in planetary albedo with surface albedo and the change in surface albedo for 1°C change in surface air temperature during the season, which in turn is determined by the strength of the snow cover and snowpack metamorphosis feedback loops. Analysis of the latter term in the seasonal cycle suggests that for CRCM5 simulations, the snow cover feedback loop is more dominant compared to the snowpack metamorphosis feedback loop, whereas for MODIS, the two feedback loops have more or less similar strength. Moreover, the SAF strength in the climate change context appears to be weaker than in the seasonal cycle and is sensitive to the driving GCM and the RCP scenario.",

It is an ambient-temperature Schottky diode based all solid-state heterodyne spectrometer designed to extend the limb sounding technique employed by Microwave Limb Sounder for density/temperature/wind measurements by measuring the Doppler line shape of atomic oxygen (OI) fine structure emission at 2.06THz. This atomic oxygen line emission is very bright and distributed nearly uniformly globally (at all latitudes including high latitude aurora particle precipitation regions) and temporally (at all local times during both day and night), thus ideal for thermospheric remote sensing.

            "abstract": "Denitrification results in a significant loss of plant-available nitrogen from agricultural systems and contributes to climate change, due to the emissions of both the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and environmentally benign dinitrogen (N2). However total quantities of the gases emitted and the ratio of N2:N2O are often not clearly understood, because N2 emissions cannot be directly measured in the field because of the high background level of N2 in the atmosphere. While variability in soil conditions across landscapes, especially water content and aeration, is believed to greatly impact both total denitrification rates and N2:N2O, the measurement limitations have prevented a clear understanding of landscape-scale emissions of denitrification products. The Cary Institute has developed an approach where soil core are maintained in a sealed system with an N2-free airstream, allowing emitted N2 and N2O emissions to be measured without interference from atmospheric N2. Emissions of the gases are measured under a range of oxygen concentrations and soil water contents. Laboratory responses can then be correlated with measured field conditions at the sampling points and resulting emission estimates extrapolated to the field-scale.

            "abstract": "The opening of pore space by weathering near Earth’s surface influences a broad array of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, including water storage, surface-groundwater interactions, and nutrient cycling. Understanding how porosity is generated by physical and chemical processes is therefore a fundamental challenge in critical zone science. However, the relative importance and spatial variability of mechanisms that generate porosity remain poorly understood, because the subsurface is hidden from direct observation except by drilling and geophysical measurements. Here we use observations from both drilling and geophysics to quantify the relative importance of volumetric strain and chemical mass loss in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. Our results from cores of saprolite show that porosity decreases with depth from 0.65 to 0.35 in the top 11 meters of saprolite. Although seismic refraction surveys reveal velocities that correctly predict the porosity variations, they cannot distinguish between volumetric strain and chemical mass losses. To overcome this limitation, we quantified bulk density and immobile element concentrations in our samples of saprolite. We found that volumetric strain decreases with depth from 1.1 to 0.3. Conversely, the overall mass loss due to chemical weathering shows no trend with depth. Together these results suggest that the changes in porosity are due to physical rather than chemical processes in the upper 11 meters. However neither bioturbation nor frost cracking are likely to extend so deep. Moreover, the paucity of hydrous minerals in the bedrock implies that mineral expansion cannot explain the high volumetric strain in the saprolite. Our results are consistent with porosity generated by the opening of fractures due to the release of confining stress during exhumation of bedrock.",

A novel method was developed in partnership with Shimadzu for simultaneous quantification of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in environmental gas samples. Gas bulbs were used to make custom standard mixtures by injecting small volumes of pure analyte into the nitrogen-filled bulb. Resulting calibration curves were validated using a certified gas standard. The use of GC/MS systems to perform this analysis has the potential to move the analysis of greenhouse gasses from expensive, custom GC systems to standard single-quadrupole GC/MS systems that are available in most laboratories, which wide variety of applications beyond greenhouse gas analysis. Additionally, use of mass spectrometry can provide confirmation of identity of target analytes, and will assist in the identification of unknown peaks should they be present in the chromatogram.",

            "abstract": "One way that humans impact aquatic ecosystems is by adding nutrients and contaminants, which can propagate up the food web and cause blooms and die-offs, respectively. Often, these chemicals are attached to fine sediments, and thus where sediments go, so do these anthropogenic influences. Vertical motion of sediments is important for sinking and burial, and also for indirect effects on horizontal transport. The dynamics of sinking sediment (often in aggregates) are complex, thus we need field data to test and validate existing models.\nSan Francisco Bay is well studied and is often used as a test case for new measurement and model techniques (Barnard et al. 2013). Settling velocities for aggregates vary between 4*10-5 to 1.6*10-2 m/s along the estuary backbone (Manning and Schoellhamer 2013). Model results from South San Francisco Bay shoals suggest two populations of settling particles, one fast (ws of 9 to 5.8*10-4 m/s) and one slow (ws of < 1*10-7 to 1.4*10-5 m/s) (Brand et al. 2015).\nWhile the open waters of San Francisco Bay and other estuaries are well studied and modeled, sediment and contaminants often originate from the margin regions, and the margins remain poorly characterized. We conducted a 24 hour field experiment in a channel slough of South San Francisco Bay, and measured settling velocity, turbulence and flow, and suspended sediment concentration. At this margin location, we found average settling velocities of 4-5*10-5 m/s, and saw settling velocities decrease with decreasing suspended sediment concentration. These results are consistent with, though at the low end of, those seen along the estuary center, and they suggest that the two population model that has been successful along the shoals may also apply in the margins.",

During October 2009 a high-resolution survey was carried out in the transition zone off the northern Baja California coast to investigate the role of the mesoscale features on the circulation. We found that mesoscale eddies dominated the circulation, an eddy pair in particular. In this study, the water mass characteristics of the anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies are analyzed. The anticyclonic eddy had neither surface thermal expression nor mapped sea surface height anomaly signature. It was a subthermocline eddy. In contrast, the cyclonic eddy had a mapped sea height anomaly signature. The mapping of depth, Conservative Temperature, Absolute Salinity, and oxygen concentration on the 26.6 isopycnal surface revealed that the water mass of the core of the anticyclonic eddy is similar to the water mass of the California Undercurrent (warm, saline and with low oxygen concentration) and the water mass of the core of the cyclonic eddy is similar to the water mass of the California Current (cold, fresh and with high oxygen concentration). Based on shipboard measurements, the kinematics and the dynamics of the eddy pair are also analyzed. The radius of the anticyclonic was 27 km and the radius of the cyclonic was 32 km. The cyclonic eddy was larger than the anticyclonic eddy. The oceanographic vessel bisected both eddies which enabled to analyze cross-sections of potential energy, kinetic energy, relative vorticity, and potential vorticity of each eddy.",

In particular, models that attempt to explore the coupling between microbial metabolic activity and hydrology at larger scales need an accurate representation of their underlying biogeochemical systems. These systems tend to be very complicated, and they result in large nonlinear systems that have to be coupled with flow and transport algorithms in reactive transport codes. The complexity inherent in implementing a robust treatment of biogeochemistry is a significant obstacle in the development of new codes. Alquimia is an open-source software library intended to help developers of these codes overcome this obstacle by exposing tried-and-true biogeochemical capabilities in existing software. It provides an interface through which a reactive transport code can access and evolve a chemical system, using one of several supported geochemical “engines.\" We will describe Alquimia’s current capabilities, and how they can be used for benchmarking reactive transport codes. We will also discuss upcoming features that will facilitate the coupling of biogeochemistry to other processes in new codes.",

We extend Broutman et al. (2014) to three dimensions by simulating the propagation of linearized internal waves in the atmosphere with horizontal background winds. Our goal is to investigate how the vertical variation of the angle between the background wind and the boundary forcing affects the previous two-dimensional results and in particular how much energy reaches the lower ionosphere. We examine propagation through an idealized wind jet at a fixed angle to the tsunami direction of propagation, through a wind spiral, and through a realistic atmospheric profile corresponding to the 2004 Sumatra Tsunami.\nIn the first case, wave propagation follows a similar pattern to that of the two-dimensional problem, although the transmission and reflection coefficients are affected by the horizontal wavenumber in the y-direction. In the second case, the wind spiral affects the number and the height of turning points greatly and the overall propagation is quite different. The realistic tsunami case is more complex and differs substantially from the two-dimensional results.",

We found that the contribution of plasma-sheet bubbles for moderate and intense storms on average accounts for 50%~60% of the ring current energy. In this paper, we will present an RCM-E simulation of the June 1, 2013 storm, with a similar approach to setting up the boundary conditions, and compare the results with the Van Allen Probes observations. We will also investigate the difference in the spatial and temporal development of the ring current distribution between RCM-E simulations with and without bubble injections. Through detailed data-model comparison, we will quantify the agreement and disagreement and discuss how to further improve the ring current simulations with the RCM/RCM-E.",

Impulsive reconnection in the vicinity of the null point between the magnetic fluxes inside and outside the dome launches the jet along the loop. Wyper & Pontin 2014 showed that the 3D current layers that facilitate such reconnection are explosively unstable to tearing, generating complex flux-rope structures. Utilizing the adaptive mesh capabilities of the Adaptively Refined Magnetohydrodynamics Solver, we investigate the generation of such fine-scale structure in high-resolution simulations of active-region jets. We observe the formation of multiple flux-rope structures forming across the fan separatrix surface and discuss the photospheric signatures of these flux ropes and the associated local topology change. We also introduce a new way of identifying such flux ropes in the magnetic field, based on structures observed in the magnetic squashing factor calculated on the photosphere. By tracking the position and number of new null points produced by the fragmentation, we also show that the formation of flux ropes can occur away from the main null region on the flanks of the separatrix dome and that the jet curtain has a highly complex magnetic structure.

            "abstract": "From the pace of the ice ages to how the carbon cycle has changed through time, much of what we know about earth history and climate dynamics is based on chemical signatures locked within minerals. Recorded as trace element anomalies or as isotopic shifts, these chemical signatures reflect how mass and energy move across the planet, as well as the response of biological systems to these changes. When viewed at the sub-micron to nano-scale however, chemical composition rarely follows a simple relationship with environmental conditions. This is especially true for the preserved CaCO3 skeletons of marine organisms, which often exhibit systematic patterns of high magnitude chemical variability at the sub-micron scale. While this biologically-driven variability can complicate the interpretation of climate records, it also represents a rich and largely untapped signal. Major advances in our understanding of both biomineralization and paleoproxies hinge on new techniques that can isolate small signals from this complexity.\nTo probe the mechanisms controlling biomineralization and sub-micron compositional variability, we use a suite of high spatial resolution tools: NanoSIMS, ToF-SIMS, and Atom Probe Tomography (APT), together with stable isotope labels and biomineral culture. In planktonic foraminifera we conducted modified pulse chase experiments using isotope tracers to measure ion transport rates during biomineralization. By varying elemental concentrations in the surrounding seawater during these pulse chase experiments, we induced systematic shifts in the ion transport rate. The magnitude of these shifts indirectly measure the elemental composition of the calcifying microenvironment, a key and previously unmeasured parameter affecting skeletal chemistry and paleoproxy systematics. Complementary isotope tracer experiments in coral and related experiments applying APT to the organic-mineral interface in foraminifera uncovered the response of calcification to ocean acidification and aspects of the organic templating process during skeletal nucleation, respectively. Collectively these experiments can help explain small-scale proxy heterogeneity, upscale this variability to bulk composition, and more accurately resolve specific environmental signals from the geochemical record.",

These observatories consist of a variety of node locations cabled back to shore for continuous power and communication to instruments via high bandwidth internet access. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) maintains two hydrate sites at Barkley Canyon and Clayoquot Slope off Vancouver Island, and the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array connects to Hydrate Ridge off the Oregon coast.\nTogether, these installations comprise a diverse suite of different experiments. For example, a seafloor crawler, operated by Jacobs University in Bremen, travels around the Barkley hydrate mounds on a daily basis and carries out a suite of measurements such as determining the rate of change of the benthic community composition. Another example is from several years of hourly sonar data showing gas bubbles rising from the seafloor near the Bullseye Vent with varying intensities, allowing statistically sound correlations with other seafloor parameters such as ground shaking, temperature and pressure variations and currents, where tidal pressure appearing as the main driver. The Southern Hydrate Ridge is now equipped with the world's first long-term seafloor mass spectrometer, co-located with a camera and lights, hydrophone, current meters, pressure sensor, autonomous dissolved oxygen and fluid samplers, and is surrounded by a seismometer array for local seismicity.\nIn the future, long-term data will be continuously captured and made available throughout the year covering the full range of variations of the dynamic hydrate system, and expect additional experiments to be connected to the observatories from the broader research community.",

The challenge increases for modeling the landscapes where vertical processes dominate horizontal processes, leading to high uncertainties in modelled state variables, vertical fluxes and hence parameter estimates. Such behavior is common in modeling the prairie region of the Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB, our case study), Canada, where hydrologic connectivity and vertical fluxes are mainly controlled by surface and sub-surface water storage.\nTo address this challenge, we developed a novel multi-criteria framework that utilizes total column water storage derived from the GRACE satellite, in addition to streamflows. We used a multi-objective optimization algorithm (Borg) and a recently-developed global sensitivity analysis approach (VARS) to effectively identify the model parameters and characterize their significance in model performance. We applied this framework in the calibration of a Land Surface Scheme-Hydrology model, MESH (Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology) to a sub-watershed of SaskRB.\nResults showed that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration to streamflows. The new framework allowed us to find optimal solutions that effectively constrain the posterior parameter space and are representative of storage and streamflow performance criteria, yielding more credible prediction with reduced uncertainty of modeled storage and evaporation.",

            "abstract": "Although the effects of aerosol on clouds and precipitation have been shown extensively, whether we can detect them on climate and continental scale, especially on convective life cycle, and how can we isolate such effect from the influences of meteorological conditions, are still unclear. To address these challenges, we are analyzing both GoAmazon/CHUVA data and a large suite of instantaneously collocated geostationary and polar orbit satellite datasets over Amazon. The results show consistent increases of rainrate, number of convective cores, and radius of the mesoscale convective systems associated with the aerosols for relatively low and moderate vertical wind shears for various lower tropospheric relative humidity conditions. Our results also suggest that, while the vertical wind shear and lower tropospheric relative humidity dominate the variations of convective system radius and number of convective cores, especially during the growing and mature stage of the convective systems, aerosols dominate the reduction of small hydrometeors, the increase of large hydrometeors, and reduction of convective anvils, especially during the mature and decaying phase of the convective systems. These results derived from a large suite of independent measurements support the hypothesis that aerosols can reduce small hydrometeors and increase hydrometeors, and invigorate convective systems, as shown by their dominant effect during the mature and decay phase of the convection. The meteorological conditions dominate the size and number of convective cores of the convective systems, especially during the growing phase of the convection.\nWe analyze the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility (AMF) GoAmazon and Brazil led CHUVA field campaign data to evaluate these results from satellite data. Multiple regression analysis of the GoAmazon data generally suggest that aerosols have a comparable influence on cloud ice to those of the lower tropospheric relative humidity and vertical wind shear when the convections are in developing or steady stages in terms of convective top height. The influences also depend on the planetary boundary layer height. We will also report our comparison of the influence of aerosols on deep convection to those on convective congestus and shallow clouds.",

            "abstract": "Through the Late Cretaceous (100-66 Ma), proxy reconstructions suggest a global cooling trend in concert with changes in ocean circulation. Uncertainty remains about the cause, scale, and importance of these changes in ocean circulation. Here, we explore the role of paleogeography and CO2 in Late Cretaceous ocean circulation changes using NCAR's CESM model, which comprises CAM4, POP2, CICE4, and CLM4 with dynamic vegetation. Our simulations use detailed paleogeographic reconstructions of the Campanian (83-72 Ma) and Maastrichtian (72-66 Ma) with appropriately lowered solar constants and either 560 or 1120 ppm CO2. Preliminary model results do not show large differences in global-scale ocean circulation due to changes in paleogeography; both Campanian and Maastrichtian paleogeographies only form deep water in the Southern Ocean under 1120 ppm CO2. However, these relatively small changes in paleogeography do produce regional differences in ocean temperature of several degrees Celsius, which highlight the need for good sample spatial coverage when making claims about global climate change through the Late Cretaceous. In contrast, simulating a reduction in CO2 from 1120 to 560 ppm with Maastrichtian paleogeography triggers the formation of deep water in the North Pacific and increases northward ocean heat transport. As a result, the North Pacific warms by ~2°C despite lower CO2 while the Southern Ocean cools by ~3°C. Globally, neither changes in geography nor a halving of CO2 can fully explain the more than 4°C cooling proposed by proxy reconstructions across the Late Cretaceous.",

            "abstract": "The equilibrium isotope fractionation factor α is a fundamental parameter in stable isotope geochemistry. Although equilibrium α can be determined by theoretical calculation or by measurement of natural samples, direct laboratory experiments are ultimately required to verify those results. The attainment of a true exchange equilibrium in experiments is often difficult, but three methods have been devised and used to ensure that an equilibrium α has been obtained in an isotope exchange experiment. These are the two-directional method, partial-exchange method, and three-isotope method. Of these, the three-isotope method is thought to be the most rigorous. Using water-water exchange as a basic unit, we have developed a set of complex exchange models to study when and why the three-isotope method may work well or not. We found that the method cannot promise to lead to an equilibrium α before the kinetic complexity of the specific exchange experiment is known. An equilibrium point in δ17O-δ18O space can be reached only when all of the isotope exchange pathways are fully reversible, i.e. there is no mass loss at any instant, and the forward and backward reactions share the same pathway. If the exchange pathways are not fully reversible, steady state may be reached, but a steady state α can be very different from the equilibrium α. Our results validated the earlier warning that the trajectory for three-isotope evolution in δ17O-δ18O space may be a distinctly curved line or contain more than one straight line due to the non-fully reversible isotope exchange reactions. The three-isotope method for equilibrium α determination is not as rigorous or as promising as it may seem. Instead, the trajectory of three-isotope evolution provides detailed insights into the kinetics of isotope exchange between compounds. If multiple components exist in the exchange system, the δ17O-δ18O evolving trajectory would be more complex.",

However, estimates of fluxes from the land sector are less precise compared to other sectors because of the large sources of uncertainty in quantifying the carbon pools, emissions, and removals associated with anthropogenic (land use) and natural changes in the US forestlands. As part of the NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System, we developed a methodology based on a combination of ground inventory and space observations to develop spatially refined carbon pools and fluxes including the gross emissions and sequestration of carbon at each 1-ha land unit across the forestlands in the continental United States (CONUS) for the period of 2006-2010. Here, we provide the magnitude and uncertainty of multiple pools and fluxes of the US forestlands and outline the observational requirements to reduce the uncertainties for developing national climate mitigation policies based on the carbon sequestration capacity of the US forest lands.\nKeywords: forests, carbon pools, greenhouse gas, land use, attribution",

            "abstract": "Altered snowmelt regimes from regional warming threaten mountain ecosystems with greater water stress and increased the likelihood of disturbance. The sensitivity of vegetation to changing snowpack regimes is strongly mediated by soil water storage, yet a comprehensive framework to identify areas sensitive to changing snowpack regimes is lacking. In this study we ask two questions: 1) What climatic predictors explain inter-annual variability in the duration of soil water stress (DWS) and length of non-water stress season (NWSS)? and 2) What site characteristics increase the sensitivity of DWS and NWSS to changes in snowmelt dynamics? We compiled soil moisture at 10, 20 and 50 cm depths from 62 SNOTEL stations with >5 years of records. Soil water stress occurred when soil moisture was below the measured wilting point and NWSS was the number of days without water stress after snowmelt began. The day of snow disappearance (DSD) consistently explained the greatest variability in DWS across all site-years and at individual sites. On average, a one day earlier snow disappearance lead to 0.7 days greater DWS, but individual sites ranged from 0.2 to 1.8 days (36 of 62 sites had significant relationships between DSD and DWS). Despite earlier DSD leading to greater DWS at all sites, earlier DSD led to both significant increases (5 of 62) and decreases (7 of 62) in the length of the NWSS. Satellite-derived vegetation greenness confirmed that earlier DSD caused both lower and higher peak annual greenness depending on the site. A simple soil moisture model indicated that areas with finer soil texture, greater potential evapotranspiration, and longer NWSS were most sensitive to reduced NWSS from changing snowpack dynamics. These findings suggest a divergent response across snow-covered forests to earlier snowmelt timing independent of changing precipitation patterns: 1) historically water-stressed sites are most at risk for reduced vegetation productivity and 2) sites with low historical water stress may see enhanced vegetation productivity. These results have important implications for future alterations to the location and magnitude of vegetation-mediated hydrologic fluxes from altered snowpack regimes.",

In addition, they are vital sources and sinks of carbon and contribute to the rate of climate change. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has been collecting and presenting data on global forest resources and forest cover since 1948. This paper builds on data from FAO's 2015 Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) and presents information on growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, wood removals, and changes of forest area primarily designated for production and multiple use of the world's forests. Between 1990 and 2015, the total growing stock volume has increased in East Asia, Caribbean, Western and Central Asia, North America, Europe (including the Russian Federation), and Oceania with the highest relative increase in East Asia and the Caribbean. In all other subregions the total growing stock volume decreased. North and Central America, Europe and Asia report forest C stock increases while South America and Africa report strong decreases and Oceania reports stable forest C stocks. The annual rate of decrease of forest C stock weakened between 1990 and 2015. The total volume of annual wood removals including wood fuel removals increased between 1990 and 2011, but shows a remarkable decline during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Forest areas designated for production purposes differ considerably between subregions. The percentage of production area out of total forest area ranges between 16 percent in South America and 53 percent in Europe. Globally about one quarter of the forest area is designated to multiple use forestry. The balance between biomass growth and removals shows considerable sub-regional differences and related implications for the sustainable use of forests.",

            "abstract": "The crustal magnetic anomaly pattern for the high Arctic is dominated by a 1.3 x 106 km2 roughly oval domain of magnetic high, the High Arctic Magnetic High (HAMH) that includes numerous linear and curvi-linear shorter wavelength magnetic highs and lows with no single overall trend. Previous workers (including us) have associated this magnetic domain with the intrusive and extrusive mafic rocks of the High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP). The HAMH shows the HALIP to be roughly the same size as other more well-known LIPs such as the Deccan Traps. The broad crustal magnetic character of LIPs is similar (and distinctive from non-LIP regions) worldwide.\nWe identify 5 general subdomains and further distinguish 2 or 3 sections within each subdomain. We examine matched filter magnetic anomaly depth slices and the bathymetric and gravimetric expression of each sub-domain. Subdomains I and II associated respectively with the Mendeleev and Alpha Ridges have the deepest crustal roots. Subdomain III spans most of the central HAMH between I and II and has a distinctly less magnetic core. Subdomain IV on the Canadian margin side appears transitional to the relatively non-magnetic deep Canada Basin. Subdomain V is a zone of parallel magnetic highs at 90 degrees to the trend of the adjacent Lomonosov Ridge.\nSubdomains I and II may represent the deep cores of two smaller mantle plume heads that contributed to the overall HALIP. The presence of two plumes might serve to explain the two separate clusters of age dates (80 - 90 Ma and 120 - 130 Ma) found on igneous rocks surrounding and dredged from the HALIP region, and two stratigraphic sequence boundaries and extinction events associated with those time ranges. The boundaries between the magnetic subdomains might coincide with tectonic zones related to the post-LIP complex tectonic history of the Amerasian basin. A linear, through-going boundary that bisects the HAMH and runs perpendicular to the trend of the Lomonosov ridge may have served as a transform for at least a portion of the Canada basin extension.",

            "abstract": "Mantle dynamics on the Hadean and Archean Earth, particularly whether plate tectonics was in operation or not, is hotly debated. One important constraint comes from evidence for long mantle mixing timescales in the early Earth based on observations of early-formed geochemical heterogeneities. Specifically, 142Nd anomalies recorded in 3.8 to 3.4 Ga rocks from southwest Greenland [e.g. 1] and 2.7 Ga rocks from the Superior Province (Canada) [2] indicate that chemically heterogeneous reservoirs, formed during the first ~ 10-100 million years of Earths’ history, survived their remixing into the mantle for over 1 Gyr. Such a long mantle mixing time is difficult to explain with a traditional model of plate tectonics, where plate speeds increase significantly in the past due to a hotter mantle, thus prompting appeals to stagnant lid convection on the early Earth [e.g. 2]. However, a new model for generating plate tectonics from mantle convection based on grainsize reduction (called grain-damage) proposes that plate speeds may have decreased with increasing mantle temperature. Higher mantle temperatures lead to higher grain-growth rates that inhibit the formation of weak lithospheric shear zones. As a result, plate boundaries are more viscous and provide a stronger resistance to plate motions, and thus mantle-mixing times in the mobile lid regime may still be long even at Hadean or Archean mantle temperatures. We use new numerical models of convection with grain-damage to constrain mantle-mixing times for the early Earth with the effects of grainsize variation included. We find that mantle mixing times for mobile lid convection remain long as mantle temperature increases because of faster grain-growth rates in the mantle and lithosphere. Therefore the preservation of chemical heterogeneities for over 1 Gyr in the Hadean-Archean mantle is not inconsistent with the operation of mobile lid convection and subduction at this time. Early Earth subduction may still have differed significantly from modern day plate tectonics, but our results show that stagnant lid convection is not necessary to explain the geochemical observations.\n[1] Rizo et al., 2013, EPSL.

As such, Mexico, Central America and Caribbean countries depend on the information issued by the NHC related to the characteristics of a particular tropical cyclone and associated watch and warning areas. Despite waves and storm surge are important hazards for marine operations and coastal dwellings, their forecast is not part of the NHC responsibilities. This work presents a rapid wave and storm surge warning system based on 3100 synthetic tropical cyclones doing landfall in Mexico. Hydrodynamic and wave models were driven by the synthetic events to create a robust database composed of maximum envelops of wind speed, significant wave height and storm surge for each event. The results were incorporated into a forecast system that uses the NHC advisory to locate the synthetic events passing inside specified radiuses for the present and forecast position of the real event. Using limited computer resources, the system displays the information meeting the search criteria, and the forecaster can select specific events to generate the desired hazard map (i.e. wind, waves, and storm surge) based on the maximum envelop maps. This system was developed in a limited time frame to be operational in 2015 by the National Hurricane and Severe Storms Unit of the Mexican National Weather Service, and represents a pilot project for other countries in the region not covered by detailed storm surge and waves forecasts.",

Here, it is shown that extended observation of the broad scale hydrography by Argo provides a path to improved estimates of regional turbulent transport rates. Results from a 20 year ocean state estimate produced with the ECCO v4 non-linear inverse modeling framework provide supporting evidence. Turbulent transport parameter maps are estimated under the constraints of fitting the extensive collection of Argo profiles collected through 2011. The adjusted parameters dramatically reduce misfits to in situ profiles as compared with earlier ECCO solutions. They also yield a clear reduction in the model drift away from observations over multi-century long simulations, both for assimilated variables (temperature and salinity) and independent variables (bio-geochemical tracers). Despite the minimal constraints imposed specifically on the estimated parameters, their geography is physically plausible and exhibits close connections with the upper ocean ocean stratification as observed by Argo. The estimated parameter adjustments furthermore have first order impacts on upper-ocean stratification and mixed layer depths over 20 years. These results identify the constraint of fitting Argo profiles as an effective observational basis for regional turbulent transport rates. Uncertainties and further improvements of the method are discussed.",

The effective thermal conductivity in completely dry and fully saturated porous media is an integrated quantity representing the complex behavior of two conducting phases, i.e., pore fluid (either air or water) and solid matrix. Under partially saturated conditions, however, the effective thermal conductivity becomes even more complicated since three phases (air, water, and solid matrix) conduct heat simultaneously. In this study, we invoke an upscaling treatment called percolation-based effective-medium approximation to model the effective thermal conductivity in fully and partially saturated porous media. Our theoretical porosity- and saturation-dependent models contain endmember properties, such as air, solid matrix, and saturating fluid thermal conductivities, a percolation exponent t, and a percolation threshold. Comparing our theory with 216 porosity-dependent thermal conductivity measurements and 25 saturation-dependent thermal conductivity datasets indicate excellent match between theory and experiments. Our results show that the effective thermal conductivity under fully and partially saturated conditions follows nonuniversal behavior. This means the value of t changes from medium to medium and depends not only on topological and geometrical properties of the medium but also characteristics of the saturating fluid.",

            "abstract": "The mountain snowpack is an essential resource for both the environment as well as society. Observational and energy balance modeling work have shown that dust on snow (DOS) in western U.S. (WUS) is a major contributor to snow processes, including snowmelt timing and runoff amount in regions like the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). In order to accurately estimate the impact of DOS to the hydrologic cycle and water resources, now and under a changing climate, we need to be able to (1) adequately simulate the snowpack (accumulation), and (2) realistically represent DOS processes in models. Energy balance models do not capture the impact on a broader local or regional scale, nor the land-atmosphere feedbacks, while GCM studies cannot resolve orographic-related precipitation processes, and therefore snowpack accumulation, owing to coarse spatial resolution and smoother terrain. All this implies the impacts of dust on snow on the mountain snowpack and other hydrologic processes are likely not well captured in current modeling studies.\nRecent increase in computing power allows for RCMs to be used at higher spatial resolutions, while recent in situ observations of dust in snow properties can help constrain modeling simulations. Therefore, in the work presented here, we take advantage of these latest resources to address the some of the challenges outlined above. We employ the newly enhanced WRF/SSiB regional climate model at 4 km horizontal resolution. This scale has been shown by others to be adequate in capturing orographic processes over WUS. We also constrain the magnitude of dust deposition provided by a global chemistry and transport model, with in situ measurements taken at sites in the UCRB. Furthermore, we adjust the dust absorptive properties based on observed values at these sites, as opposed to generic global ones. This study aims to improve simulation of the impact of dust in snow on the hydrologic cycle and related water resources.",

            "abstract": "Sargent Beach is characterized by a wave-cut platform and bluff that exemplifies beaches with the highest rates of coastline retreat in Texas. This shoreline topography is being cut into a substrate of weak, Holocene mudstone associated with the nearby coastal river. The mudstone is composed of horizontal beds, centimeters to decimeters in thickness. Its compressive strength ranges from immeasurably small when submerged and water saturated, to 206 kPa when moist, and 412 kPa when dry. Retreat rates for the face of the 1.5-m-high bluff are estimated using repeat aerial images collected from 2010 – 2014; these rates are 9.39 m/yr, 4.63 m/yr, and 3.73 m/yr. Retreat rates are also measured monthly using erosion pins; monthly rates are 0.009 m/month and 0.053 m/month. Extrapolated over one year these rates equal 0.114 m/yr and 0.644 m/yr. The platform has a characteristic basinward dip between 1 and 1.5 degrees. Depending on the location, the platform may include centimeter – decimeter steps associated with discrete beds of varying strength in the mudstone or slope-parallel runnels with 0.05 – 0.10 m spacing and 0.03 – 0.05 m relief. All of these morphologies are produced by shell hash and concretion tools that abrade the mudstone within the zone of swash and backwash. Focused abrasion by shell and sediment tools leads to undercutting and ultimately failure of the bluff. It also produces the runnels and grinds small potholes. These erosional processes are shut off when sections of the beach become covered with a layer of sand of sufficient thickness; its aerial coverage varies from month to month. We will examine how the widely variable rates of shoreline retreat and mudstone erosion are jointly controlled by changes in sand coverage and wave intensity associated with storms and cold fronts.",

            "abstract": "How tropical cyclones respond to large-scale changes in climate is an important and complex question. Here we study the question using the response to the climate forcing of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Utilizing two detecting and tracking algorithms of tropical cyclones (TC), we assess the sensitivity of the genesis and frequency of TCs in a 1° x 1° simulation of a global climate model (CCSM), a limited-area simulation (western north Pacific; WNP) of the higher resolution WRF model (36 km horizontal resolution), and the statistical downscaling approach developed by Emanuel. We assess how changes between the LGM and 20th century climatology of TCs are related to changes in the large-scale environmental variables known to be important to TCs (e.g. vorticity, wind shear, and available moisture).\nSeveral facets of the TC climatology at the LGM are similar across all three modeling techniques: regions that spawn TCs and their seasonal cycle at the LGM is similar to the present-day distribution, while the total counts are slightly reduced at the LGM. The average intensity in the WRF model (which features resolution high enough to resolve strong storms) is similar between the two climates, though the distribution of intensity is more concentrated at the LGM (there are fewer weak events and fewer of the strongest events at the LGM). Conditions are similarly favorable in much of the deep tropics at the LGM compared to the 20th century, particularly in the central and western Pacific, but conditions become more hostile at the subtropical margins. We compare the resulting climatology with the underlying changes in environmental factors, and empirically derive a genesis index to identify the best fit between changes in the factors and climatology of events.",

Permafrost temperature and active layer thickness (ALT) are key climatic variables for monitoring permafrost conditions. Active layer thickness is the depth that the top layer of ground above the permafrost thaws each summer season and permafrost temperature is the temperature of the frozen permafrost under this active layer. Knowing permafrost conditions is key for those individuals working and living in Alaska and the Arctic. The results of climate models predict vast changes and potential permafrost degradation across Alaska and the Arctic.\nNOAA is working to implement its 2014 Arctic Action Plan and permafrost forecasting is a missing piece of this plan.

During this listening session the National Weather Service (NWS) and key permafrost researchers explained what is possible in the realm of permafrost forecasting and participants had the opportunity to discuss and share with the group (NWS, researchers, other stakeholders) what is needed for usable permafrost forecasting.\nThis listening session aimed to answer the questions:\nIs permafrost forecasting needed?\nIf so, what spatial scale is needed by stakeholders?\nWhat temporal scales do stakeholders need/want?\nAre there key times (winter, fall freeze-up, etc.) or locations (North Slope, key oil development areas, etc.) where forecasting would be most applicable and useful?\nAre there other considerations or priority needs we haven’t thought of regarding permafrost forecasting?\nThis presentation will present the results of that listening session.",

In middle latitude, it’s generally believed that sporadic E layers occur in vertical ion convergent areas driven by horizontal neutral wind shear. The sporadic E layers appear characteristic of abundant metallic ion species (i.e., Fe+, Mg+, Na+), that lifetime are longer than molecular ions by a factor of several orders, have been demonstrated by rocket-borne mass spectrometric measurements. On the basic of the GPS Radio Occultation (RO), using the scintillations of the GPS signal-to-noise ratio and intense fluctuation of excess phase, the global and seasonal sporadic E layers occurrence rates could be retrieved. In our previous study we found there is averaged 10 kilometers shift in height between the COSMIC-retrieved sporadic E layer occurrence rate and the sporadic E occurrence rate modeled from considering the convergence/divergence of Fe+ vertical flux. There are many reasons that maybe result in the altitude differences, e.g., tidal wind with phase shift, electric field driven force, iron species distributions. In this research, the quantitative analyses for electric field drives Es layers translations in vertical direction are presented. The tidal wind driven sporadic E layers have been simulating by modeling several nonmetallic ions (O+(4S), O+(2D), O+(2p), N+, N2+, O2+, NO+) and metallic ions (Fe+, FeO2+, FeN2+, FeO+) with wind shear transportation. The simulation result shows the Fe+ particles accumulate at zonal wind shear convergent regions and form the thin sporadic E layers. With the electric field taking into account, the whole shape of sporadic E layers vertical shift 2~5 km that depending on what magnitude and direction of electric field is added.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns, both laterally across landscapes and vertically within soil profiles. These patterns of soil moisture can have strong influences on runoff generation, especially in catchments having large capacities for soil water storage and transmission. The body of literature on runoff generation is expansive, yet we still have a great deal to learn about how the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture influences catchment-scale hydrologic responses to storm events. With this in mind, we investigated soil moisture responses to storm events across several landscape positions in a steep, forested headwater catchment. We measured volumetric water content (VWC) continuously for two years at 45 points representing different combinations of landscape position and soil depth within a 13 ha catchment at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. We also monitored shallow groundwater levels at six locations within the catchment along with runoff at the catchment outlet. To investigate soil moisture response during events, we assessed absolute change in magnitude of VWC (Δs) and lag time (Δt) between peak VWC and peak precipitation for 39 events during the two-year study period. Our results showed that storm depth and antecedent moisture explained some of the spatiotemporal patterns of Δs; however, the explanatory power varied with the hillslope and season. Furthermore, we did not detect topographic control of Δs or Δt at most of the locations monitored. By evaluating the sequence of Δt, groundwater response, and runoff response for each storm, we characterized the hydrologic behavior of the study hillslopes for the 39 storm events.The characterization of hydrologic behavior reveals interrelationships between soil moisture and shallow groundwater, and their combined influence on runoff at the catchment outlet. This work provides new insights on links between the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture and runoff response in headwater catchments.",

The resulting series have more than 3500 points and an average sample step of 0.04 Myr, which currently constitutes the highest-resolution series for this time interval. The long-term trend in the d18O series shows three warming events in the Jurassic linked to the activity of three major volcanic provinces, but no significant cycle has been observed in the series. Unlikely, the d13C series shows a prominent cycle of 9.1 Myr, having an amplitude of 1-2‰ on the d13C throughout the whole time interval. This cycle is attributed to a Myr-eccentricity forcing, already identified in the Cenozoic, the late Cretaceous and the Triassic. In addition, the d13C series also displays a minor-amplitude cycle at 1.9 Myr, which can be related to the 2.4-Myr eccentricity. The fluctuations of the d13C at the 9.1-Myr time scale follows the 2nd-order eustatic changes and we suggest that Myr-eccentricity cycles, by controlling humid-arid cycles in the tropical realms and sea-level changes, modulated the continental and oceanic primary productivity, storage of organic matter, carbonate platform production which triggered the observed fluctuations in the d13C.",

Earth System Models (EaSMs) are being used increasingly to explore these coupled dynamics from watershed to global scales. However, many EaSMs do not adequately represent landscape-scale spatial heterogeneity that influences land surface response, as relatively coarse resolution simulations are necessitated by computational limitations. Research is needed to understand which types of spatial heterogeneity, over which biomes and climate types, should be represented such that an EaSM accurately captures the aggregate land surface response to a changing climate.\n Spatial heterogeneity in a landscape arises due to differences in model forcings; in underlying soil, vegetation, and topographic properties that control moisture, energy and nutrient fluxes; and in land surface responses that arise due to spatially-organized connections. While our long-term goal is to understand how each of these sources should be represented in an EaSM, in this study we focus first on parameter heterogeneity. We apply the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), a distributed process-based model that was originally developed for catchment-scale applications. We explore the functional form of the hydrologic response of a RHESSys “patch” (a 200-400 m element with homogenous landscape parameters) to an invoked change. According to scale transition theory, a linear response makes it is possible to upscale (or aggregate) the model resolution without biasing the model response.\n We perform RHESSys simulations for more than 500 individual catchments within the Willamette and Yakima River basins in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. Each catchment was imposed with incremental perturbations of temperature and precipitation. The response curves for hydrologic variables such as evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff are tested for linearity using the Pearson correlation coefficient. A cluster analysis is conducted and compared to biome and climate classifications to identify landscapes where upscaling is possible without biasing the aggregate hydrologic response.",

            "abstract": "Winter snow in the northeastern United States has changed over the last several decades, resulting in shallower snow packs, fewer days of snow cover and increasing precipitation falling as rain in the winter. In addition to these changes which cause reductions in surface albedo, increasing winter temperatures also lead to more rapid snow grain growth, resulting in decreased snow reflectivity. We present in-situ measurements and analyses to test the sensitivity of seasonal snow albedo to varying weather conditions at sites in New England. In particular, we investigate the impact of temperature on snow albedo through melt and grain growth, the impact of precipitation event frequency on albedo through snow “freshening,” and the impact of storm path on snow structure and snow albedo. Over three winter seasons between 2013 and 2015, in-situ snow characterization measurements were made at three non-forested sites across New Hampshire. These near-daily measurements include spectrally resolved albedo, snow optical grain size determined through contact spectroscopy, snow depth, snow density and local meteorological parameters. Combining this information with storm tracks derived from HYSPLIT modeling, we quantify the current sensitivity of northeastern US snow albedo to temperature as well as precipitation type, frequency and path. Our analysis shows that southerly winter storms result in snow with a significantly lower albedo than storms which come from across the continental US or the Atlantic Ocean. Interannual variability in temperature and statewide spatial variability in snowfall rates at our sites show the relative importance of snowfall amount and temperatures in albedo evolution over the course of the winter.",

The intended use for this interface is to provide a standard access mechanism for existing holdings of Heliophysics data from NASA missions. Furthermore, the interface is not intended to target any particular tool, but is intended as low-level infrastructure allowing any tool to use a single interface to access the digital content of all Heliophysics timeseries data. The interface addresses only data access, not data discovery. The query structure itself is very simple, taking only a few inputs: dataset name, time range, parameter list, and output format. The result of the query is a stream of data that is independent of the storage format on the server. Currently, most data centers offer some type of computer-to-computer access mechanism, but each has unique features and usage patterns (some give files in a specific format, some stream data, etc.) so that they all require different client code to extract data. A single, simple, lowest common denominator solution is clearly still needed. We present a prototype implementation of a service implementing our basic interface, and discuss similarities and differences between our interface and other similar existing data access mechanisms, including the web services at CDAWeb, OPeNDAP, the Das2Server mechanism of Autoplot, and options based on the VOTable mechanism from the astronomy community.\nURL: http://datashop.elasticbeanstalk.com/",

            "abstract": "This study investigates an interconnected system of climate change – land cover – water resources for a watershed in humid subtropical climate from 1970 to 2009. A 0.7°C increase in temperature and a 16.3% increase in precipitation were observed in our study area where temperature had no obvious increase trend and precipitation showed definite increasing trend compared to previous studies. The main trend of land-cover change was conversion of vegetation and barren lands to developed and crop lands affected by human intervention, and forest and grass to bush/shrub which considered to be caused by natural climate system. Precipitation contribution to the other hydrologic parameters for a humid subtropical basin is estimated to be 51.9% of evapotranspiration, 16.3% of surface runoff, 0.9% of groundwater discharge, 19.3% of soil water content, and 11.6% of water storage. It shows little higher evapotranspiration and considerably lower surface runoff compare to other humid climate area due to vegetation dominance of land cover. Hydrologic responses to climate and land cover changes are increases of surface runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration by 15.0%, 2.7%, and 20.1%, respectively, and decrease of groundwater discharge decreased by 9.2%. Surface runoff is relatively stable with precipitation while groundwater discharge and soil water content are sensitive to land cover changes especially human intervention. If temperature is relatively stable, it is considered to be land cover plays important role in evapotranspiration. Citation: Heo, J., J. Yu, J. R. Giardino, and H.

            "abstract": "Large shallow rhyolitic magma systems like the one underlying the Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field (LdM) atop the Southern Andes, Chile, that comprises the largest concentration of rhyolitic lava and tephra younger than 20 ka at earth's surface, are capable of producing modest to very large explosive eruptions. Moreover, LdM is currently exhibiting magma migration, reservoir growth, and crustal deformation at rates higher than any volcano that is not actively erupting. The long-term build-up of a large silicic magmatic system toward an eruption has yet to be monitored, therefore, precursory phenomena are poorly understood. In January of 2015, 12 broadband, 3-component seismometers were installed at LdM to detect local microearthquakes and tele-seismic events with the goals of determining the migration paths of fluids as well as the boundaries of the magma chamber beneath LdM. These stations complement the 6 permanent stations installed by the Southern Andes Volcano Observatory in 2011. Focal mechanisms were calculated using FOCMEC (Snoke et al., 1984) and P-wave first motions for local events occurring between January and March of 2015 using these 18 broadband stations. Results from six of the largest local events indicate a mixture of normal and reverse faulting at shallow (<10 km) depths surrounding the lake. This may be associated with the opening of fractures to accommodate rising magma in the subsurface and/or stresses induced by the rapid deformation. Two of these events occurred near the center of maximum deformation where seismic swarms have previously been identified. Focal mechanisms from smaller magnitude events will be calculated to better delineate subsurface structure. Source mechanisms will be refined using P-S amplitude ratios and full waveform inversion.",

            "abstract": "We present the first long (~1.2 Ma) benthic oxygen isotope record from the eastern Mediterranean, based on ODP Sites 967 and 968, which clearly reflects the behavior of global climate on a glacial-interglacial scale. The age model for our record is based on tuning the elemental ratio of titanium versus aluminum (Ti/Al) against insolation. The Ti/Al record is dominated by the precession-related changes in northern African climate, i.e. monsoonal forcing, and hence largely independent of glacial-interglacial variability. We found the largest offset between our chronology and that of the widely applied, open ocean stacked record LR04 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) for TVII (~624 ka), which occurred ~9 kyr earlier according to our estimates, though in agreement with the AICC2012 δDice chronology of EPICA Dome C (Bazin et al., 2013). Spectral cross-correlation analysis between our benthic δ18O record and 65°N summer insolation reveals significant amounts of power in the obliquity and precession range, with an average lag of 5.5±0.8 kyr for obliquity, and 6.0±1.0 kyr for precession. In addition, our results show that the obliquity-related time lag was smaller (3.0±3.3 kyr) prior to ~900 ka than after (5.7±1.1 kyr), suggesting that on average the glacial response time to obliquity forcing increased during the mid-Pleistocene transition, much later than assumed by Lisiecki and Raymo (2005). Finally, we found that almost all glacial terminations have a consistent phase relationship of ~45±45 degrees with respect to the precession and obliquity-driven increases in 65°N summer insolation, consistent with the general consensus that both obliquity and precession are important for deglaciation during the Late Pleistocene. Exceptions are glacial terminations TIIIb, T36 and potentially T32 (and TVII T24 and T34), which show this consistent phase relationship only with precession (only with obliquity). Our findings point towards an early (>1200 ka) onset of the Mid Pleistocene Transition. Vice versa, the timing of TVII, which can only be explained as a response to obliquity forcing, indicates that the transition lasted until at least after MIS 15.",

The crux of the new methodology is to infer possible problems and biases in parameterization by comparing observed and modeled cloud properties.\nTo this end we created a multi-year long database, which combines collocated cloud and precipitation observations from CloudSat, CALIPSO and MODIS data collocated with meterological fields from the (MERRA) Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications. Our work focuses on the tropical and subtropical marine atmosphere and the transitions between cloud regimes. The cloud cases were simulated with our unified stochastic multi-plume parameterization (Suselj et al., 2012) in the framework of single-column-model inititalized and forced by the MERRA meterolology. The model results were compared to the observations as a function of thermodynamic and circulation regimes.

            "abstract": "The full understanding and modeling of earthquake physics remains a challenging task. Presently, there are several approaches to model the earthquake dynamics. They include the full elasto-dynamic simulation of rupture propagation and initiation. The stochastic approach employs the forward and inverse analysis of various point process models. Another approach assumes that the fault can be modeled by an array of blocks which interact with the loading plate and between each other. These approaches were successful in reproducing some aspects of observed seismicity.\nIn this work, we analyze the slider-block model where we introduce a nonlinear visco-elastic interaction between blocks and the tectonic loading plate, which mimics the rheology of the fault system. This approach preserves the full inertial effects in the system that are generally neglected in cellular automaton version of this model.\nThe slider-block model consists of N elements which are governed by non-linear differential equations. The fault zone is modelled by an array of N interacting elements, driven by tectonic loading force. The frictional force is also applied between the elements and the substrate. Earthquakes in this system are realized as slipping events with different sizes. The model is characterized by a set of tuning parameters with clear physical significance: the elasticity, the viscosity, the shear rate exponent which controls the nonlinearity. The properties of the model, including the motion pattern, the interevent time statistics, the frequency-size distributions are examined. By tuning the parameter sets, one can easily explore the phase space of the model, and determine the factors that control various aspects of the system behaviour, providing more insight into real earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Ooids are subspherical chemical sand grains composed of concentric layers of CaCO₃ surrounding a central nucleus. These grains represent a common mode of carbonate sedimentation, making them potentially powerful proxies for paleoenvironmental conditions, provided a mechanistic understanding of the physical, chemical, and perhaps biological conditions necessary for their formation. At a basic level, growth of an ooid reflects that precipitation has outpaced abrasion over the ooid’s lifetime. We can describe change in ooid size over time (net growth rate) mechanistically as the sum of a growth rate (the rate of carbonate precipitation on the ooid surface) and an abrasion rate (the rate of removal of material through grain-grain and grain-bed collisions). Previous studies have addressed the growth rate, investigating the extent to which microbial activity affects and/or controls carbonate precipitation on ooid surfaces, and the net growth rate, using stepwise acid digestion and radiocarbon dating to determine the ages of cortical layers. We focused on the abrasion rate and designed an experimental study to measure abrasion rates of ooids as a function of grain size and sediment transport stage. Preliminary experiments with medium-sand-sized ooids at a Rouse number of ~1.2 yielded an abrasion rate of 0.04 g/hr (or ~40 ng/ooid/hr), which is four orders of magnitude greater than the fastest net growth rates reported in the recent high resolution ooid cortex radiocarbon dating study by Beaupre et al. (2015). This result requires that either: 1) ooids are essentially not moving and therefore not being abraded or 2) precipitation rates are also much more rapid than the net growth rates estimated by incremental radiocarbon dating. The former constraint is inconsistent with field observations that most marine ooids occur in high energy shoal environments, both in modern examples and in the rock record. Precipitation rates must therefore also be relatively rapid compared with net growth rates in order to offset the effects of abrasion. This disparity in magnitude between abrasion/precipitation rates and net growth rate implies that ooids spend much of their lifetime near a dynamic equilibrium in ooid size, perhaps explaining why ooid populations tend to be unimodal with relatively narrow distributions of grain size.",

            "abstract": "The EJB pluton intruded into Paleozoic sandstone during the Jurassic leaving a well-exposed aureole. Quartzite was collected from the contact outward to investigate the response of Ti in sedimentary quartz to varying grades of metamorphism using EPMA and CL imaging. TitaniQ and Zr in rutile thermobarometers were applied to rutile bearing quartzite at 225, 500, and 1540 meters from the contact. Comparison CL images, including those of Harkless sandstone collected 15 km away and Harkless quartzite in the aureole reveal significant Ti mobility and a general smoothing of the Ti distribution in the quartzite.\nThe CL images also reveal that the redistribution of Ti in the quartzite was incomplete. Discounting this, TitaniQ was applied using a Ti activity of 1.0 and a pressure of 2.75 kbars based on previous studies. In an effort to establish possible peak conditions, Ti was measured in the brightest CL quartz grain interiors, and the Zr was measured in surrounding rutile grains. The temperature calculations are inconsistent. At 225 meters, the Zr in rutile resulted in a temperature range from 662-762 °C (n=31) compared to a maximum temperature of 595 °C based on Ti in quartz. At 500 meters, rutile resulted in a range from 635-720 °C (n=44) compared to quartz at 525 °C. At 1540 meters, the rutile ranged from 650-710 °C (n=55) compared to quartz at 547 °C.\nThe thermometric results may suggest that the aureole was extensively heated to above 500 °C even at 1.5 km from the pluton contact. This is supported by previous studies using other thermometers, thermal modeling, quartz deformation fabrics, and evidence of partial melting-type textures. In all likelihood though, the thermometric results in this study reflect components of inheritance of the original grains, lack of complete Ti re-equilibration due to sluggish diffusion of Ti during metamorphism, and the varying effects of water availability as related to the formation of distinct deformation textures.",

            "abstract": "Models of increasing atmospheric CO2 predict an intensification of the hydrological cycle coupled with warming, possibly amplifying effects of orbitally-forced fluctuations. While there is some Pleistocene evidence of this, CO2 concentrations were much lower than projected for the future. For the potentially more relevant Early Mesozoic, with CO2 >1000 ppm, we observe that both the soil carbonate and stomatal proxies for CO2 strongly and positively correlate with climatic-precession variance in correlative continental and marine strata of both eastern North America and Europe with temporal correlation robustly supported by magneto-, astro-, and U-Pb zircon geochronology. Eastern North American lacustrine and paleosol strata are generally characterized by >3000 ppm CO2 over most of the Norian (228-207 Ma) dropping to ~1000-3000 ppm during the succeeding latest Norian to late Rhaetian (207 to 201.6 Ma) correlative with a dramatic drop in the amplitude of the response to orbital forcing. This is followed by an extraordinary doubling to nearly tripling of CO2 (~2000-5000 ppm) in the latest Rhaetian to Early Jurassic (201.6 to 200.6 Ma) and a concurrent profound increase in the amplitude of the apparent climatic-precession variance during the eruption of the massive Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. Decreasing CO2 (~1000-2000 ppm) afterward is tracked by decreasing amplitude in the orbitally-paced cyclicity. Likewise, in the UK, high amplitude cyclicity in the lacustrine to paralic Twyning Md. Fm. gives way upward into the paralic Blue Anchor and marine Rhaetian Westbury fms in which lithological cyclicity is muted. Again, the amplitude of the orbitially-paced lithological cyclicity dramatically increases into the paralic to marine late Rhaetian Lilstock Fm. and marine latest Rhaetian to Early Jurassic Blue Lias. Parallel and correlative transitions are seen in at least western Germany. The agreement between the continental eastern US and paralic to marine European records on two continents and in different paleoclimate belts over a timespan greater than the Neogene, strongly supports the hypothesis that atmospheric CO2 modulates the hydrological cycle on very large spatial and temporal scales with high CO2 tending to amplify the hydrological response to orbital forcing.

About four times as much magma is estimated to be trapped at depth below the central TVZ than is erupted, feeding heat, volatiles and chemicals into 23 geothermal systems with a total of ca. 4.2 GW thermal energy release. We present here a combined study linking melt, hypersaline and dilute fluid inclusion chemistry, surface and reservoir fluid chemistry and whole rock lithochemistry and discuss the magmatic-hydrothermal chemical zoning in large silicic systems.\nNew dataset of full lithogeochemistry in active geothermal systems of the TVZ refine the zoned chemical footprint left by both dilute meteoric-dominated and magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. Altered whole rock trace elements content (including precious metals and volatiles) shows major variation with depth, due to the influence of past hydrothermal activity, magmatic degassing, natural variability of the reservoir rocks, and current active fluid-rock interactions. The concentrations of Li, Cs, Tl, Bi, Sn, Ag, Se, Te, as well as Au, generally increase upward toward the paleosurface, where they are 10-100 times greater than near known or potentially ‘active’ intrusions. New direct in–situ analyses of trapped fluid inclusions in phenocrysts and hydrothermal veins associated with magmatic subsolidus crystallization are compared with liquid-dominated dilute fluid inclusions and geothermal fluids Li, Cs, B, Na, Cl, K content (and precious metals) providing a unique direct assessment of the role of each component (magma, rock, fluids) in New Zealand’s world known geothermal systems.",

LASE is an active remote sensor that employs the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique to measure range resolved profiles of water vapor and aerosols above and below the aircraft. The DC-8 conducted nine local science flights from June 30- July 14 where LASE sampled water vapor and aerosol fields in support of the PECAN primary science objectives relating to better understanding nocturnal Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs), Convective Initiation (CI), the Low Level Jet (LLJ), bores, and to compare different airborne and ground based measurements. LASE observed large spatial and temporal variability in water vapor and aerosol distributions in advance of nocturnal MCSs, across bores resulting from MCS outflow boundaries, and across the LLJ associated with the development of MCSs and CI. An overview of the LASE data collected during the PECAN field experiment will be presented where emphasis will be placed on variability of water vapor profiles in the vicinity of severe storms and intense convection in the central and southern plains. Preliminary comparisons show good agreement between coincident LASE and radiosonde water vapor profiles. In addition, an advanced water vapor DIAL system being developed at NASA Langley will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) from the tropics to the poles is important both radiatively and chemically. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas, and increases in water vapor concentrations in the UTLS lead to cooling at these levels and induce warming at the surface [Forster and Shine, 1999; 2002;Solomon et al., 2010]. Water vapor is also integral to stratospheric chemistry. It is the dominant source of OH in the lower stratosphere [\n Hanisco et al.\n , 2001\n], and increases in water vapor concentrations promote stratospheric ozone loss by raising the reactivity of several key heterogeneous reactions as well as by promoting the growth of reactive surface area [Anderson et al., 2012; Carslaw et al., 1995; Carslaw et al., 1997; Drdla and Muller , 2012; Kirk-Davidoff et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2001]. However, the processes that control the distribution and phase of water in this region of the atmosphere are not well understood. This is especially true at mid-latitudes where several different dynamical mechanisms are capable of influencing UTLS water vapor concentrations. The contribution by deep convective storm systems that penetrate into the lower stratosphere is the least well understood and the least well represented in global models because of the small spatial scales and short time scales over which convection occurs. To address this issue, we have begun a modeling study to investigate the convective injection of water vapor from the troposphere into the stratosphere in the mid-latitudes. Fine-scale models have been previously used to simulate convection from the troposphere to the stratosphere [e.g., Homeyer et al., 2014]. Here we employ the Advanced Research Weather and Research Forecasting model (ARW) at 3-km resolution to resolve convection over the eastern United States during August of 2007 and August of 2013. We conduct a comparison of MERRA, the reanalysis used to initialize ARW, and the model output to assess the dependence of ARW on boundary conditions and its independence as a climate model. We also observe structured trapped gravity wave phenomena near the tropopause.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, two extreme droughts experienced by the Amazon rainforest led to a perturbation of carbon cycle dynamics and forest structure, partly through an increase in tree mortality. While there is a relatively strong consensus in CMIP5 projections for an increase in both frequency and intensity of droughts across the Amazon, the potential for forest die-off constitutes a large uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon cycle feedbacks.\nTwo long-term through fall exclusion experiments (TFE) provided novel observations of Amazonian ecosystem responses under drought. These experiments also provided a great opportunity to evaluate and improve models' behavior under drought by comparing simulations and observations.\nWhile current DGVM use a wide array of algorithms to represent mortality, most are associated with large uncertainty for representing drought-induced mortality, and require updating to include current information of physiological processes. During very strong droughts, the leaves desiccate and stems may undergo catastrophic embolism. However, even before that point, stomata close, to minimize excessive water loss and risk of hydraulic failure, which reduces carbon assimilation. To maintain respiration and other functions, plants may eventually deplete stored non-structural carbon compounds (NSC), which may have negative impacts on plant and eventually increase the probability of mortality.\nHere, we describe a new parameterization of the mortality process induced by drought using the ORCHIDEE-CAN dynamic vegetation model and test it using the two TFE results. We first updated and evaluated both the representation of hydraulic architecture and the NSC pool dynamics using in situ data. We implemented a direct climate effect on mortality through catastrophic stem embolism, based on hydraulic vulnerability curves. In addition, we explored the role of NSC on hydraulic failure and mortality by coupling in the model NSC content and vulnerability curves, following the idea that stored NSC serves a critical osmotic function.\nOur results suggest that models have the capacity to represent individual mortality from a mechanistic perspective, providing a framework for informing future experiments and data collection for model development.",

Glacier hypsometry can exert significant control on mass balance sensitivity, particularly if the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is in a broad area of low surface slope. In this study, we explore the spatial variability in glacier response to future climate forcings on the basis of hypsometry. We first derive mass balance sensitivities (30–70 m ELA / 1° C and 40–90 m ELA / 50% decrease in snow accumulation) from the ~50-year USGS Benchmark glaciers mass balance record. We subsequently assess mean climate fields in 2090–2100 derived from the IPCC AR5/CMIP5 RCP 6.0 5-model mean. Over glaciers in Alaska, we find 2–4° C warming and 10–20% increase in precipitation relative to 2006–2015, but a corresponding 0–50% decrease in snow accumulation due to rising temperatures. We assess changes in accumulation area ratios (AAR) to a rising ELA using binned individual glacier hypsometries. For an ELA increase of 150 m, the mean statewide AAR drops by 0.45, representing a 70% reduction in accumulation area on an individual glacier basis. Small, interior glaciers are the primary drivers of this reduction and for nearly 25% of all glaciers, the new ELA exceeds the glacier’s maximum elevation, portending eventual loss. The loss of small glaciers, particularly in the drier interior of Alaska will significantly modify streamflow properties (flashy hydrographs, earlier and reduced peak flows, increased interannual variability, warmer temperatures) with poorly understood downstream ecosystem and oceanographic impacts.",

Hence, their error due to imprecise knowledge of a crustal model is the major source of uncertainty of the inferred earthquake source parameters. Strategies how to incorporate the modeling error (uncertainty) of the GFs in waveform inversions have been recently introduced (Yagi and Fukahata, 2011; Duputel et al., 2014). They rely on statistical description of the GFs uncertainty by means of the covariance matrix.\nThis study is devoted to estimation of covariance matrix of full wavefield GFs, describing the effect of velocity model uncertainty. By means of Monte Carlo simulations in randomly perturbed 1D velocity models we analyze the dependence of the covariances on the strength of the perturbations, receiver-source distances, and frequency ranges. Since the covariance matrix estimation is numerically very expensive and thus hardly applicable in practice, we propose simplified approaches. The first simplification uses the „Approximate covariance function“ based on GFs in the mean velocity model. The second possible simplification „Stacionarized covariance function“ (i.e. averaged over time) leads to a simple analytical formula for covariance function. The both simplifications exhibit very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations, and may be easily implemented in currently existing inversion techniques.\n",

Attributing the causes of the rapid decline in land ice requires separation of mass change processes, i.e. accumulation of precipitation, meltwater runoff, and solid ice discharge. Here we examine a 30 year record of Landsat imagery to determine trends in glacier velocity at a global scale in an attempt to identify anomalies in glacier flow that are contributing to changes in land ice mass. The Landsat archive represents a treasure trove of information with hundreds of thousands of images acquired over glaciers and ice sheets during the past 30 years. Gleaning useful and consistent surface displacement information from a multiple sensor archive that is heavily contaminated by cloud, saturated images, poorly resolved sensor geometry, and data gaps has proved challenging. Temporal stacking of displacement fields (Dehecq et al., 2015) and correcting for unresolved topography (Roseanau et al., 2012) have been shown to greatly improve derived velocities. Here we present results from a global processing of the complete Landsat archive for information on glacier surface displacements. We highlight patterns of coherent regional change as well as well as rapid basin-scale changes in glacier flow.",

            "abstract": "The Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center (NE CSC) is part of a federal network of eight Climate Science Centers created to provide scientific information and tools that managers and other parties interested in land, water, wildlife, and cultural resources can use to anticipate, monitor, and adapt to climate change. The NE CSC partners with other federal agencies, universities, and NGOs to facilitate stakeholder interaction and delivery of scientific products. For example, NE CSC researchers have partnered with the National Park Service to help managers at Acadia National Park adapt their infrastructure, operations, and ecosystems to rising seas and more extreme events. In collaboration with the tribal College of Menominee Nation and Michigan State University, the NE CSC is working with indigenous communities in Michigan and Wisconsin to co-develop knowledge of how to preserve their natural and cultural values in the face of climate change. Recently, in its largest collaborative initiative to date, the NE CSC led a cross-institutional effort to produce a comprehensive synthesis of climate change, its impacts on wildlife and their habitats, and available adaptation strategies across the entire Northeast and Midwest region; the resulting document was used by wildlife managers in 22 states to revise their Wildlife Action Plans (WAPs). Additionally, the NE CSC is working with the Wildlife Conservation Society to help inform moose conservation management. Other research efforts include hydrological modeling to inform culvert sizing under greater rainfall intensity, forest and landscape modeling to inform tree planting that mitigates the spread of invasive species, species and habitat modeling to help identify suitable locations for wildlife refugia. In addition, experimental research is being conducted to improve our understanding of how species such as brook trout are responding to climate change. Interacting with stakeholders during all phases of these projects ensures that the science produced meets their specific needs and allows them to make informed decisions to better adapt to our changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Over the 21st century, anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase the occurrence of extreme droughts, leading to significant socio-economic impacts in many regions of the world. The precursors of drought are diverse and still poorly understood. Climate models provide useful tools for studying the physical links between precursor “drought-conducive” climatic states and the characteristics of drought, such as severity, duration, spatial extent and frequency. There are, however, still large uncertainties in model portrayal of the physical processes governing drought behavior. Reducing these uncertainties is a necessary but not sufficient condition for enhancing confidence in model projections of 21st century changes in drought.\nHere, we analyze a large (1300-member) perturbed physics ensemble performed with the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM4) to gain insights into causes of the 1998-2002 North American drought. The ensemble was constructed by varying the values of input parameters related to clouds, precipitation, convection, and the boundary layer over allowable ranges of uncertainty. Changes in these parameters can alter the width of the Hadley circulation, strengthen deep convection, and perturb land-atmospheric coupling, leading to different predictions of temperature, precipitation and soil moisture, and, in turn, very different simulations of drought properties. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters influencing drought-related metrics. Using observations and a Bayesian statistical framework, we identify parameter values that yield a better fit to data, thereby identifying configurations that may be more successful in simulating key features of observed drought behavior.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, and is released as LLNL-ABS675834.

Indeed, this flow is known to play a pivotal role in the dynamo mechanism that sustains the Earth magnetic field, and in the drift of its magnetic north pole. Our experiment reproduces the interplay in between magnetic, rotating and buoyant forces inside a transparent conducting liquid confined in an Earth like geometry, in an hemisphere heated up on the inside cooled down on the outside, filled up with sulphuric acid and spinning in a high magnetic field. This way, a flow governed by the MAC balance is visualised using Particle Image Velocimetry for the first time, whilst thermocouple measurements provide access to heat transfer between the heating core and the modelled Core Mantle Boundary (CMB). The apparatus was operated at Ekman number (ratio of the viscous force over the Coriolis force) of the order of 10^(-4) to 10^(-5) as well as Elsasser number (ratio of the Lorentz force over the Coriolis force) of the order of 0.1 to 1 and Rayleigh number (ratio of the buoyancy over the conductivities) up to 20 times critical. Without magnetic field, we recovered well-established scalings for the onset of plane convection in rotation, and scalings for the thermal wind associated to convection. Under the influence of the magnetic field, i.e. for Elsasser number larger than 0, we were able to show that convective plumes evolve to wider structures extending higher towards the pole, and that heat transfer from the solid core to the CMB are significantly enhanced as a result. An example of results obtain throughout our experiment is given by figure 1. It corresponds to a side view of the setup. The outside of the dome is colled by running water. The inside of the dome is filled by sulphuric acid and warmed up at its centered by a heater. Thanks to PIV measurement, we can observed convective plumes along the Earth Tangent Cylinder. These findings are supported by scalings for the Nusselt number against the Elsasser number and Rayleigh number.",

            "abstract": "The primary goal of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is to provide timely information on current and expected crop supply and demand estimates. Inter-annual variability in crop condition and crop productivity is largely controlled by the amount of available water to the plants. Thus, knowledge of the root-zone soil moisture is critical for the USDA’s crop analysts. This information is currently provided by the modified Palmer model (PM). The PM is a two-layer, water balance-based hydrologic model that is driven by daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum temperature observations based on ground meteorological station measurements from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and gridded weather data from the U.S. Air Force 557th Weather Wing (former U.S. Air Force Agency, AFWA). A data assimilation (DA) unit was added to the model to allow the integration of satellite-based soil moisture observations. The DA system was initially developed using retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), where the AMSR-E soil moisture estimates were ingested into the PM using a 1-D Ensemble Kalman Filter Approach. After the failure of AMSR-E the system was updated and it is currently set to ingest Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS)-based retrievals. Operational delivery of the SMOS-based soil moisture product for USDA FAS began in spring, 2014. This talk will demonstrate the added value of assimilating satellite-based data and focus on work that is being done in preparation for updating the system by ingesting soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Soil moisture estimates derived using data obtained from SMOS and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) instrument on MetOp have been used as a proxy for the SMAP radiometer and radar products, respectively. The performance of this dual assimilation system would be assessed by examining the lagged rank cross correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the PM soil moisture estimates acquired before and after the assimilation.",

            "abstract": "The CDC reports that over 15 million US households use private wells. These wells are vulnerable to contamination. One of the most common contaminants in private wells is nitrate. Nitrate has a health standard of 10 mg/L. This standard is set to prevent methemaglobinemia, or “blue baby” syndrome, in infants. In extreme cases it can affect breathing and heart function, and even lead to death. Elevated nitrate concentrations have also been associated with increased risk of thyroid disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Unlike municipal wells, there is no mandatory testing of private wells. It is the responsibility of users to have their well water tested.\nThe objective of this research was to identify the most useful chemical tracers for determining sources of nitrate in private water supplies. Chemical characteristics, such as mobility in groundwater and water solubility, as well as frequency of use, were considered when choosing source indicators. Fourteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products unique to human use were chosen to identify wells impacted by septic waste. A bovine antibiotic and five pesticide metabolites were used to identify contamination from agricultural sources.\nEighteen private wells were selected in a suburban area with septic systems and adjacent agricultural land. The wells were sampled five times and analyzed to provide a temporal profile of nitrate and the tracers. The artificial sweetener sucralose was found in >70% of private wells. Wells with sucralose detected had nitrate concentrations between 5-15 mg/L. The herbicide metabolite metolachlor ESA was detected in 50% of the wells. These wells typically had the highest nitrate concentrations, often >10 mg/L. The common use and frequent detection of these two compounds made them the most reliable indicators of nitrate sources evaluated in this study. This information will help well owners determine appropriate treatment and remediation options and could direct future subdivision planning and resource management.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_Makedonska.pdf\nAperture variability within individual fractures is usually neglected in modeling flow and transport through fractured media. Typically, individual fractures are assumed to be homogeneous. However, in reality, individual fractures are heterogeneous, which may affect flow and transport in fractured media. The relative importance of including in-fracture variability in flow and transport modeling has been under debate for a long time. Previous studies have shown flow channeling on an individual fracture with internal variability, where the fracture is considered isolated from the rest of the fracture network. Although these studies yield some clear insights into the process, the boundary conditions are impractical for field-scale networks, where the realistic boundary conditions are determined by fracture connections in the network. Therefore, flow in a single fracture is controlled not only by in-fracture variability but also by boundary conditions.\nIn order to address the question of the importance of in-fracture variability, the internal heterogeneity of every individual fracture is incorporated into a three-dimensional fracture network, represented by a composition of intersecting fractures. The new DFN simulation capability, dfnWorks, is used to generate a kilometer scale DFNs similar to the Forsmark, Sweden site. In our DFN model, the in-fracture aperture variability is scattered over each cell of the computational mesh along the fracture, representing by a stationary Gaussian random field with various correlation lengths. The Lagrangian particle tracking is conducted in multiple DFN realizations and the flow-dependent Lagrangian parameters, non-reacting travel time, τ, and cumulative reactivity parameter, β, are obtained along particles streamlines. It is shown that early particle travel times are more sensitive to in-fracture aperture variability than tails of travel time distributions, where no significant effect of the aperture variations and spatial correlation length is observed.",

Almost no seismicity occurs at shallow depths between ~1 and ~3 km which is likely caused by the predominance of velocity strengthening friction. As confining pressure increases with depth within the seismogenic zone, the rate of seismicity changes because the macroscopic behavior of crustal rocks becomes more ductile. At the base the seismogenic zone, where ductile behavior and velocity strengthening co-exist, the rate of decay of seismicity reflects changes in thickness of the brittle-ductile transition zone.\nSecond, to image the rheology of the brittle-ductile transition, we also analyze focal mechanisms of adjacent earthquakes that may exhibit a decrease in the internal friction angle as pressure increases with depth, near the bottom of the seismogenic zone. We search for such a weak zone in the lower crust using the horizontal moment tensor element of focal mechanisms to map decreasing horizontal shear tractions at the base of the seismogenic zone, especially beneath major Principal Slip Zones (PSZs).\nWe interpret our results in the context of the previously determined regional velocity structure, crustal thickness, proximity to major PSZs as well as geophysical parameters of the crust such as heat flow and tectonic strain rate. The new interpretation provides an image of the seismogenic thickness and brittle-transition zone rheology as they vary from one crustal block to the next and in the vicinity of major PSZs. In particular, the absence of significant stress field rotations within the brittle ductile transition zone beneath southern California suggests that the lower crust appears stronger than the lower crust beneath the Bay Area in northern California.",

            "abstract": "Modeling flow and solute transport in large-scale heterogeneous porous media involves substantial computational burdens. A common approach to alleviate this complexity is to utilize upscaling methods. These processes generate upscaled models with less complexity while attempting to preserve the hydrogeological properties comparable to the original fine-scale model. We use Wavelet Transformations (WT) of the spatial distribution of aquifer's property to upscale the hydrogeological models and consequently transport processes. In particular, we apply the technique to a porous formation with broadly distributed and correlated transmissivity to verify the performance of the WT. First, transmissivity fields are coarsened using WT in such a way that the high transmissivity zones, in which more important information is embedded, mostly remain the same, while the low transmissivity zones are averaged out since they contain less information about the hydrogeological formation. Next, flow and non-reactive transport are simulated in both fine-scale and upscaled models to predict both the concentration breakthrough curves at a control location and the large-scale spreading of the plume around its centroid.\nThe results reveal that the WT of the fields generates non-uniform grids with an average of 2.1% of the number of grid blocks in the original fine-scale models, which eventually leads to a significant reduction in the computational costs. We show that the upscaled model obtained through the WT reconstructs the concentration breakthrough curves and the spreading of the plume at different times accurately. Furthermore, the impacts of the Hurst coefficient, size of the flow domain and the orders of magnitude difference in transmissivity values on the results have been investigated. It is observed that as the heterogeneity and the size of the domain increase, better agreement between the results of fine-scale and upscaled models can be achieved. Having this framework at hand aids hydrogeologists to make decisions based on the upscaled models with affordable computational cost while maintaining the accuracy of the predictions.",

            "abstract": "The Lower Cretaceous depositional systems of southwestern Oaxaquia, in south-central Mexico, were controlled by tectonic processes related to the instauration of a continental arc and the accretion of the Guerrero arc to mainland Mexico. The Atzompa Formation refers to a succession of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and limestone that crop out in southwestern Mexico with Early Cretaceous fauna and detrital zircon maximum depositional ages. The sedimentary record shows a transition from early fluvial/alluvial to shallow marine depositional environments. The first stage corresponds to juvenile fluvial/alluvial setting followed by a deep lacustrine depositional environment, suggesting the early stages of an extensional basin. The second stage is characterized by anabranched deposits of axial fluvial systems flowing to the NE-SE, showing deposition during a period of rapid subsidence. The third and final stage is made of tidal deposits followed, in turn, by abrupt marine flooding of the basin and development of a Barremian-Aptian carbonate ramp. We interpret the Tentzo basin as a response to crustal extension in a back-arc setting, with high rates of sedimentation in the early stages of the basin (3-4 mm/m.y), slower rates during the development of starved fluvial to tidal systems and carbonate ramps, and at the top of the Atzompa Formation an abrupt deepening of the basin due to flexural subsidence related to terrane docking and attendant thrusting to the west. These events were recorded in the back-arc region of a continental convergent margin (Zicapa arc) where syn-sedimentary magmatism is indicated by Early Cretaceous detrital and volcanic clasts from alluvial fan facies west of the basin. Finally, and as a response to the accretion of the Guerrero superterrane to Oaxaquia during the Aptian, a carbonate platform facing toward the Gulf of Mexico was established in central to eastern Oaxaquia.",

Since the arrival of the MAVEN spacecraft at Mars, a large number of solar flares and a few major coronal mass ejections (CMEs) erupted from the Sun. The SEPs are accelerated by the related shock in the solar corona or by the propagating interplanetary shock ahead of the CME ejecta. Mixed in with these SEPs are particles accelerated by the shocks of corotating streams, some of which have recurred for several solar cycles due to the persistent coronal hole sources. The SEP events are analyzed together with the upstream solar wind observations from the MAVEN Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) and magnetometer (MAG). The sources of the SEP events are determined from Earth-based solar imagery and the MAVEN Extreme Ultra-violet Monitor (EUVM) together with numerical simulations of the inner heliospheric conditions. A comparison with the radiation dose rate measurements from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) reveals a lack of ground signatures during the onset of the highest energy SEPs for the events observed by MAVEN, indicating that the SEPs fully deposit their energies into the Martian atmosphere. Using measurements made from the ensemble of instruments onboard MAVEN, we investigate the consequences of SEPs at Mars for a number of events observed during the primary science mapping phase of the MAVEN mission.",

With their unique structures, BMGs are at the cutting edge of materials study for both commercial applications and fundamental studies. In the light of engineering applications, some metal-metal alloy BMGs are stronger than steels but able to be shaped and molded like plastics. As a new member of glass family, metallic glasses are also good models for studies of fundamental problems in condensed matter physics.\nPressure-induced polyamorphism in Ce-based bulk metallic glasses have attracted interest in recent years. Ultrasonic measurements of the compressional and shear wave velocities not only provide critical information about their interatomic forces, but also offer a unique approach for precise determination of mass densities under pressure that are quite difficult to access by other methods. In this study, the acoustic velocities of La32Ce32Al16Ni5Cu15 bulk metallic glass were measured up to 12.3 GPa using ultrasonic interferometry in a multi-anvil apparatus at room temperature. Both compressional and shear waves exhibited softening behaviors at 0-4 GPa, followed by a continuous increase (stiffening) with pressures. Measurements under decompression exhibit a hysteretic behavior compared to that on compression. The mass density as a function of pressure revealed three different amorphous states and the transition pressures were accompanied by distinct changes in the pressure derivatives of elastic moduli. The interpretation of the residual densification and the softening/stiffening across the polyamorphic transition can be sought via the topological rearrangement of the solute-centered clusters in medium-range order and the possibility of 4f electron localization/delocalization in Ce.",

It is widely believed that the polarization electric field is responsible for the conjugacy. However, observed conjugate disturbances so far are mostly in plasma density and TEC, and there is almost no report of observations of polarization electric fields associated with TIDs. We present the C/NOFS measurements of TID-like disturbances in the plasma density and drift velocity. The plasma drift perpendicular to the geomagnetic field is manifestation of the polarization electric field. Plasma flow parallel to the geomagnetic field is highly correlated with the polarization electric field and is consistent with the prediction of TID theories, confirming that the polarization electric field is caused by TIDs. Surprisingly, the polarization electric field is observed not only at night but also during daytime, implying that the polarization electric field is not shorted out by the dayside E layers. The satellite data are compared with the Jicamarca radar data when C/NOFS is 20 degrees away from the radar but nearly at the same magnetic latitude (along the same field lines). This may be the first observation of polarization electric field associated with TIDs and verifies that the polarization electric field can be indeed transmitted thousands of kilometers along the geomagnetic field lines. The observations provide direct evidence for justifying the mechanism for the generation of similar ionospheric disturbances in the conjugate hemispheres.",

            "abstract": "Whether landscapes respond to climatic and tectonic perturbations through steady, continuous adjustment or by short-lived, transiently unstable acceleration of erosion rates is fundamental to understanding landscape dynamics and the impact that land-use change may have on watershed sediment budgets. We document the geomorphic response of catchments in the Northern Gabilan Mesa (NGM), where it appears that over geomorphic timescales, well-developed soils may provide more resistance to incision than the mudstones from which they were derived. While measures of tensile strength reveal that intact mudstone is stronger than overlying soils, slaking removes the internal strength of these mudstones. This produces materials in the critical zone that are weaker than the overlying soils. This local configuration appears to impact large-scale landscape dynamics in the NGM, in that once the cohesive soils are locally removed, gullies that incise into the underlying, weaker slaked rock undermine the cohesive soil mantle and propagate headward as a series of arroyos predominantly hosted on south-facing slopes. These arroyos are more frequent in landscapes underlain by shallow marine mudstones and sandstones than sandstones and conglomerates. On the walls of arroyos, the development of relief and the exposure of rapidly disintegrating bedrock is accompanied by the dominance of transport by granular flows. Finally, arroyos often extend farther upslope than do channels without bedrock exposures, ultimately causing an increase in drainage density. Therefore in a situation where cohesive soils overlie a zone of weaker weathered material, incision through the cohesive layer represents a threshold that initiates a transient wave of incision that rapidly undermines and removes large volumes of bedrock and soil. This conceptual model is affirmed by simple one-dimensional geomorphic models that explore the conditions under which such features may be produced.",

            "abstract": "The Martian North Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD) are thought to contain a record of the planet’s paleoclimate for the Late Amazonian period. Specifically, the variable dust content within the many sub-parallel layers of ice that make up the NPLD is thought to contain a climate signal related to the recent hydrologic cycle of Mars. Internal reflections in radar sounding data from the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) are presumably caused by this variation in dust content. Using these reflections, it is possible to estimate the dielectric properties of NPLD layers, and thus bring us a step closer to determining the dust concentration as a function of depth (age) in the NPLD. This relationship would provide much needed constraints for climate models as well as models of NPLD construction.\nAlthough SHARAD has previously helped constrain the bulk dielectric properties of the NPLD, leading to an estimate of 5% overall dust fraction, discrete layers have not yet been analyzed in detail. Using the simple plane wave model put forward by Lauro et al. (2012) it is possible to use the ratio of the surface reflection power to the subsurface reflection power to estimate the reflectivity of the subsurface interface. Combined with a thin layer reflection model, this reflectivity leads to estimates of reflector dielectric constants, and thus dust content. Using this technique we have mapped the reflectivity of multiple reflectors in the Saddle Region of the NPLD, and used these reflectivities to place constraints on the dust content at each reflector interface. Preliminary results favor the hypothesis that reflectors are caused by small fluctuations in dust fraction within an ice matrix, rather than by lag deposits of nearly pure dust material left behind during ablation.",

            "abstract": "Historically aseismic Harper and Sumner counties in Southern Kansas experienced a dramatic increase in seismicity beginning in early 2014, coincident with the development of new oil production in the Mississippi Lime Play. In order to better understand the potential relationships between seismicity and oil development, the USGS installed a real-time telemetered seismic network in cooperation with the Kansas Geological Survey, the Kansas Corporation Commission, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, Harper County, and the Oklahoma Geological Survey. The network began operation in March 2014 with an initial deployment of 5 NetQuakes accelerometers and by July 2014 had expanded to include 10 broadband sites. The network currently has 14 stations, all with accelerometers and 12 with broadband seismometers. The network has interstation spacing of 15 – 25 km and typical azimuthal gap of 80 for well-located events. Data are continuously streamed to IRIS at 200 samples per second from most sites. Earthquake locations are augmented with additional stations from the USGS National Network, Oklahoma Geological Survey Seismic Network, Kansas Seismic Monitoring Network and the Enid Oklahoma Network. Since the spring of 2014 over 7500 earthquakes have been identified with data from this network, 1400 of which have been manually timed and cataloged. Focal depths for earthquakes typically range between 2 and 7 km. The catalog is available at earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ under network code ‘Ismpkansas’. The network recorded the largest known earthquake in Harper County, Mw 4.3, on October 2, 2014 and in Sumner County, Mw 4.9, on November 12, 2014. Recorded ground motions at the epicenter of the October earthquake were 0.70 g (PGA) and 12 cm/s (PGV). These high ground motion values agree with near-source recordings made by other USGS temporary deployments in the U. S. midcontinent, indicating a significant shaking hazard from such shallow, moderate-magnitude earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) aims to improve our understanding of the Alpine Fault Zone, a tectonically active mature fault system in New Zealand known to rupture in large events, by deep scientific drilling. The borehole DFDP-2B approached the Alpine Fault at depth, reaching a final depth of 892 m (820 m true vertical depth). Online gas analysis (OLGA) while drilling tracked changes in the composition of gases extracted from the circulating drill mud. The composition of fluids from fault zones can provide information about their origins, flow rates and -paths, fluid-rock interactions along these paths, and the permeability structure of the faulted rock mass.\nApart from an atmospheric input, the gases in drilling mud derive from the pore space of rock, crushed at the drill bit, and from permeable layers intersected by the borehole. The rapid formation of mud wall cake seals the borehole from further fluid inflow, hence formation-derived gases enter mostly at the depth of the drill bit. OLGA analyses N2, O2, Ar, CO2, CH4, He, and H2 on a mass spectrometer, hydrocarbons CH4, C2H6, C3H8, i-C4H10, and n-C4H10 on a gas chromatograph, and Rn using a lucas-cell detector. Gas was sampled for offline analyses on noble gas and stable isotopes to complement the OLGA dataset.\nThe principle formation-derived gases found in drilling mud during drilling of DFDP-2 were CO2 and CH4, with smaller component of H2 and He2. High radon activity is interpreted to reflect intervals of active fluid flow through highly fractured and faulted rock. 3He/4He values in many samples were extremely air-contaminated, i.e. there was almost no excess of non-atmospheric He. The 3He/4He values measured at 236 m and 610 m, which are the only analyses with uncertainties <100%, are very similar to those measured in hot springs along the Alpine Fault, e.g. Fox River (0.64 Ra), Copland (0.42 Ra), Lower Wanganui (0.81 Ra). We will compare these data to those gathered using OLGA and discuss the implications. ",

            "abstract": "Meltwater refreezing and storage in the supraglacial snowpack can reduce and delay meltwater runoff on temperate alpine glaciers, but models of glacier runoff that are used to examine mass balance and glacier water resources do not generally account for this storage. Past studies on Haig Glacier in the Canadian Rocky Mountains show a consistent over-estimate of the amount of summer runoff from the glacier, based on modeled melt vs. measured discharge. We hypothesized that much of the 'missing runoff' was associated with overnight refreezing of meltwater that is ponded on the glacier surface and stored in pore space of the seasonal snowpack. Additional energy is required to melt this refrozen water each day, such that a large fraction of the meltwater that is generated on the glacier is 'recycled' water.\nTo test this idea, we measured the temperature and meltwater content in the upper 40 cm of the supraglacial snowpack of Haig Glacier in spring and summer 2015. Thermistors and TDR probes were installed at 10-cm intervals at two sites in the glacier accumulation area. A Denoth meter was used to make point measurements for comparison with the TDR inferences of snowpack dielectric properties. These data are supplemented by automatic weather station data, used to calculate surface melt rates, and discharge measurements in the glacier outlet stream. We observed a strong diurnal cycle in snow water content, with the snowpack drying out overnight, but contrary to what we expected, there was negligible subsurface meltwater refreezing during our study. Overnight refreezing was restricted to a thin surface layer of the snowpack, while overnight drying was likely due to meltwater drainage to the snow-ice interface. We use our observations to calibrate and test a model of meltwater runoff from the glacier from summer 2015.",

With no central user interface, theme, or mechanism for accessing that data, interrelated systems are confusing and potentially disruptive in users’ searches for EOSDIS data holdings. In an effort to bring consistency across these systems, an effort was undertaken to develop Earthdata 3.0: a complete information architecture overhaul of the Earthdata website, a significant update to the Earthdata user experience and user interface, and an increased focus on searching across EOSDIS data holdings, including those housed and made available through DAAC websites.\nAs part of this effort, and in a desire to unify the user experience across related websites, the Earthdata User Interface (EUI) was developed. The EUI is a collection of responsive design components and layouts geared toward creating websites and applications within the Earthdata ecosystem. Each component and layout has been designed specifically for Earth science-related projects which eliminates some of the complexities of building a website or application from the ground up. Its adoption will ensure both consistent markup and a unified look and feel for end users, thereby increasing usability and accessibility.\nAdditionally, through the user of a Google Search Appliance, custom Clojure code, and in cooperation with DAACs, Earthdata 3.0 presents a variety of search results upon a user’s keyword(s) entry. These results are not just textual links, but also direct links to downloadable datasets, visualizations of datasets and collections of data, and related articles and videos for further research.\nThe end result of the development of the EUI and the enhanced multi-response type search is a consistent and usable platform for Earth scientists and users to navigate and locate data to further their research.",

            "abstract": "Treating non-point source pollution is one of our greatest challenges in environmental hydrology. Previous efforts in agricultural or urban settings have focused on removing sources or implementing distributed best management practices (BMPs) throughout a watershed. However, for stream pollution, the most efficient point of treatment would be within the stream itself, which integrates flows from the entire watershed. Engineered streambed modifications in urban or agricultural streams and constructed channels have the potential to mitigate nonpoint source pollution. Geomedia designed to treat water pollutants and achieve an optimal residence time via hydraulic conductivity modifications are termed biohydrochemical enhancement structures for stream water treatment (BEST). BEST modules can efficiently drive interchange, attenuating nutrients and pathogens (and can be designed to remove other pollutants such as phosphorus, metals or trace organics). Numerical models, combined with data from bench-top and 2D experiments, demonstrate effective contaminant removal potential for practical applications. Nitrogen and pathogens could be attenuated within a series of BEST on the order of 50 m of stream length, and at a favorable cost compared to traditional BMPs, suggesting that BEST could be an effective best management practice for constructed stormwater channels (particularly outlets of detention ponds) or channels carrying irrigation return flows. New results from a constructed stream demonstrate the real-world applicability of the BEST system.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes the detection of interdecadal climate signals in a newly reconstructed precipitation data from 1850-present. Examples are on precipitation signatures of East Asian Monsoon (EAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations (AMO). The new reconstruction dataset is an enhanced edition of a suite of global precipitation products reconstructed by Spectral Optimal Gridding of Precipitation Version 1.0 (SOGP 1.0). The maximum temporal coverage is 1850-present and the spatial coverage is quasi-global (75S, 75N). This enhanced version has three different temporal resolutions (5-day, monthly, and annual) and two different spatial resolutions (2.5 deg and 5.0 deg). It also has a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nSOGP uses a multivariate regression method using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) expansion. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation data from 1981-20010 are used to calculate the EOFs. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) gridded data are used to calculate the regression coefficients for reconstructions. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are analyzed according to the number of EOF modes used in the reconstruction. Our reconstructed 1900-2011 time series of the global average annual precipitation shows a 0.024 (mm/day)/100a trend, which is very close to the trend derived from the mean of 25 models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). Our reconstruction has been validated by GPCP data after 1979. Our reconstruction successfully displays the 1877 El Nino (see the attached figure), which is considered a validation before 1900.\nOur precipitation products are publically available online, including digital data, precipitation animations, computer codes, readme files, and the user manual.

            "abstract": "There are multiple approaches to quantify quick flow components of streamflow. Physical hydrograph separations of quick flow using recession analysis (RA) are objective, reproducible, and easily calculated for long-duration streamflow records (years to decades). However, this approach has rarely been validated to have a physical basis for interpretation. In contrast, isotopic hydrograph separation (IHS) and end member mixing analysis using multiple solutes (EMMA) have been used to identify flow components and flowpath routing through catchment soils. Nonetheless, these two approaches are limited by data from limited and isolated periods (hours to weeks) during which more-intensive grab samples were analyzed. These limitations oftentimes make IHS and EMMA difficult to generalize beyond brief windows of time. At the Sleepers River Research Watershed (SRRW) in northern Vermont, USA, we have data from multiple snowmelt events over a two decade period and from multiple nested catchments to assess relationships among RA, IHS, and EMMA. Quick flow separations were highly correlated among the three techniques, which shows links among metrics of quick flow, water sources, and flow path routing in a small (41 ha), forested catchment (W-9) The similarity in responses validates a physical interpretation for a particular RA approach (the Ekhardt recursive RA filter). This validation provides a new tool to estimate new water inputs and flowpath routing for more and longer periods when chemical or isotopic tracers may not have been measured. At three other SRRW catchments, we found similar strong correlations among the three techniques. Consistent responses across four catchments provide evidence to support other research at the SRRW that shows that runoff generation mechanisms are similar despite differences in catchment sizes and land covers.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the ability of regional climate models (RCMs) to simulate very heavy daily precipitation and supporting processes for both contemporary and future-scenario simulations during summer (JJA). RCM output comes from North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) simulations, which are all run at a spatial resolution of 50 km. Analysis focuses on the upper Mississippi basin for summer, between 1982-1998 for the contemporary climate, and 2052-2068 during the scenario climate. We also compare simulated precipitation and supporting processes with those obtained from observed precipitation and reanalysis atmospheric states. Precipitation observations are from the University of Washington (UW) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded dataset. Utilizing two observational datasets helps determine if any uncertainties arise from differences in precipitation gridding schemes. Reanalysis fields come from the North American Regional Reanalysis.\nThe NARCCAP models generally reproduce well the precipitation-vs.-intensity spectrum seen in observations, while producing overly strong precipitation at high intensity thresholds. In the future-scenario climate, there is a decrease in frequency for light to moderate precipitation intensities, while an increase in frequency is seen for the higher intensity events. Further analysis focuses on precipitation events exceeding the 99.5 percentile that occur simultaneously at several points in the region, yielding so-called “widespread events”. For widespread events, we analyze local and large scale environmental parameters, such as 2-m temperature and specific humidity, 500-hPa geopotential heights, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), vertically integrated moisture flux convergence, among others, to compare atmospheric states and processes leading to such events in the models and observations. The results suggest that an analysis of atmospheric states supporting very heavy precipitation events is a more fruitful path for understanding and detecting changes than simply looking at precipitation itself.",

Understanding these mechanisms controlling surface ozone concentrations is an essential component for designing effective control measures. However, determining the magnitude of these processes contributing to the total ozone budget generally comes with high uncertainties resulting from the diversity of data required.\nMost ground site measurements are insufficient to quantify the influence of long range transported or residual layer ozone on surface concentrations, as information above the boundary layer is difficult to obtain. On the other hand, aircraft observations often lack either the essential surface information, sufficient sampling repetition over the site, or a full range of chemical measurements. The data set collected during the Colorado FRAPPE/DISCOVER-AQ initiative is very rich, as several ground sites were equipped with a suite of chemical and meteorological measurements and multiple aircraft sampled the column above up to three times a day over a whole month.\nHere we combine data from the ground sites and aircraft to calculate the full boundary layer ozone budget to quantify the relative importance of the different budget terms. In the Colorado Front Range both long range transported ozone and local sources likely play important roles. In addition, a similar budget analysis performed for a 3-D WRF-Chem simulation offers insight into whether WRF-modeled data agrees with the measurements as to each budget term’s importance in controlling surface ozone concentrations.",

However, some early investigations employed transmitters of opportunity to measure TIDs, a method which has been re-visited from time to time with varying levels of sophistication. At one extreme is early work focussed on field strength variations; at the other are reconstructions of propagating corrugations on the bottomside of the ionosphere [Beley et al., Radio Science, vol. 30, p. 1739-1752, 1995]. Recently this technique has be revived exploiting three spaced receivers in the northeastern United States, measuring Doppler shifts of AM radio signals in the medium frequeny (MF) band and detecting TIDs with 40-minute period [Chilcote et al., Radio Science, DOI:10.1002/2014RS005617, 2015]. A follow-up multi-instrument campaign including monitoring multiple MF transmitters of opportunity at four sites took place in April, 2015. The technique has limitations, such as restriction to nighttime in the case of MF transmitters of opportunity, but may prove useful by providing complementary information to existing methods and because its low cost may allow large numbers of sensors to be incorporated into future measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Lilesville “gravels” are discontinuous Neogene cobble, sand and silt deposits exposed in gravel quarries in an area covering ~100 km2 where the Pee Dee River crosses the Fall Line of North Carolina. These deposits unconformably overlie the western edge of the Inner Coastal Plain, and parts of the saprolitized Paleozoic Lilesville pluton, and are interpreted as strath terrace deposits.\nIn the Bonsal quarry, the Lilesville “gravels” comprise channel fills, channel bars, pebble lags, trough cross bedding, mud clasts, and mud drapes. These features define several facies including: 1) an imbricated clast-supported conglomerate with a medium- to coarse-grained lithic arenite matrix; 2) a lenticular silt- to medium-grained lithic arenite partly interbedded with the conglomerate; 3) a pebbly cross-bedded medium- to coarse-grained lithic arenite; and 4) a mottled medium- to coarse-grained lithic arenite. Paleoflow indicators suggest southerly transport, parallel to the modern Pee Dee River. GPR profiles and 3D models document facies boundaries on the quarry face and behind the high-wall. The tops of the Lilesville “gravels” are commonly marked by a pebble lag (deflation) horizon disconformably overlain by a medium- to coarse-grained, well-sorted quartz arenite interpreted as an aeolian deposit (Pinehurst Fm?). C14 dates from charcoal in the aeolian sand are 1638 +/- 46 calendar years BP (or 312 AD +/- 46).\nThe age of the Lilesville “gravels” remains uncertain. However, by using regional curves for ages of terrace deposits relative to their heights above river level (Mills 2000), it is suggested here that the Lilesville gravels are 7 to 12 Ma (Upper Miocene).\nIt is likely that the Lilesville “gravels” were deposited by the ancestral Pee Dee River when it was a braided stream flowing in a southerly direction. This suggests that a combination of regional uplift and a wetter paleoclimate in the Late Miocene may have been responsible for a larger discharge and coarser bedload than currently exist.",

The radar returns are classified as head echoes, the plasma surrounding the meteoroids, and trails, the expanding plasma column left in the meteoroid’s wake. In addition, plasma trails are categorized by the angle between the meteoroid’s trajectory and the radar beam. One type is the specular trail, which occurs when the meteoroid travels quasi-perpendicular to the beam. The second type, non-specular trail, is independent of trajectory but, according to our current understanding, the radar beam must be perpendicular to the Earth’s magnetic field in order to reflect from field-aligned irregularities (FAI) after the onset of plasma turbulence.",

Using 2602 tie-points, spanning 9.82 years, 26 October 2004 to 20 August 2014.we have obtained a number of rotation models, with various levels of complexity and quality of fit to the data.\nOur simplest model has a fixed orientation spin pole, and a fixed rate of rotation. The spin pole right ascension is (39.35034 0.0031) degree, declination is (83.43825 0.00036) degree, and the mean period of rotation is (15.94547727 ) day. The residual variance of misfit is 1.235 km2.\nIt has long been understood that the rotation of Titan is synchronized to its orbital motion about Saturn, but with the Cassini radar data, we now see that the rate of rotation is not quite uniform. The current time span of the tie-point data is almost exactly 1/3 of Saturn’s heliocentric orbital period. We have fitted a series of additional models to the data, each of which has a fixed spin pole, and a rotation rate which is represented by a finite length Fourier series in time. The residual variance drops, with increasing harmonic degree, up to N=8, and then remains nearly constant.\nThe model with 8 cycles in the observation time span has a residual variance of 0.774 km2, or 62% of the uniform rotation case. The maximum deviation of the rotation angle, from the uniform case, amounts to 0.08 degree, or 3.6 km displacement, on the equator.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable water management typically emphasizes water resource quantity, with focus directed at availability and use practices. When attention is placed on sustainable water quality management, the holistic, cross-sector perspective inherent to sustainability is often lost. Proper water quality management is a critical component of sustainable development practices. However, sustainable development definitions and metrics related to water quality resilience and management are often not well defined; water quality is often buried in large indicator sets used for analysis, and the policy regulating management practices create sector specific burdens for ensuring adequate water quality. In this research, we investigated the methods by which water quality is evaluated through internationally applied indicators and incorporated into the larger idea of “sustainability.” We also dissect policy’s role in the distribution of responsibility with regard to water quality management in the United States through evaluation of three broad sectors: urban, agriculture, and environmental water quality. Our research concludes that despite a growing intention to use a single system approach for urban, agricultural, and environmental water quality management, one does not yet exist and is even hindered by our current policies and regulations. As policy continues to lead in determining water quality and defining contamination limits, new regulation must reconcile the disparity in requirements for the contaminators and those performing end-of-pipe treatment. Just as the sustainable development indicators we researched tried to integrate environmental, economic, and social aspects without skewing focus to one of these three categories, policy cannot continue to regulate a single sector of society without considering impacts to the entire watershed and/or region. Unequal distribution of the water pollution burden creates disjointed economic growth, infrastructure development, and policy enactment across the sectors preventing a holistic approach to water quality management and, thus, rendering our system unsustainable.",

            "abstract": "The SIPSMetGen utility, developed for the NASA EOSDIS project, under the EED contract, simplified the creation of file level metadata for the ECS System. The utility has been enhanced for ease of use, efficiency, speed and increased flexibility. The SIPSMetGen utility was originally created as a means of generating file level spatial metadata for Operation IceBridge. The first version created only ODL metadata, specific for ingest into ECS. The core strength of the utility was, and continues to be, its ability to take complex shapes and patterns of data collection point clouds from aircraft flights and simplify them to a relatively simple concave hull geo-polygon. It has been found to be a useful and easy to use tool for creating file level metadata for many other missions, both aircraft and satellite.\nWhile the original version was useful it had its limitations. In 2014 Raytheon was tasked to make enhancements to SIPSMetGen, this resulted a new version of SIPSMetGen which can create ISO Compliant XML metadata; provides optimization and streamlining of the algorithm for creating the spatial metadata; a quicker runtime with more consistent results; a utility that can be configured to run multi-threaded on systems with multiple processors. The utility comes with a java based graphical user interface to aid in configuration and running of the utility.\nThe enhanced SIPSMetGen allows more diverse data sets to be archived with file level metadata. The advantage of archiving data with file level metadata is that it makes it easier for data users, and scientists to find relevant data. File level metadata unlocks the power of existing archives and metadata repositories such as ECS and CMR and search and discovery utilities like Reverb and Earth Data Search. Current missions now using SIPSMetGen include: Aquarius, Measures, ARISE, and Nimbus.",

            "abstract": "A system-level approach to Antarctic science may be on the horizon. This talk will outline some of the required activities, and discuss ways the polar science community can marshal resources to achieve them. Advances in remote sensing, earth science, and modeling have set the stage for leaps in our understanding of the ice sheet and sea ice, and their connections to the atmosphere, ocean, and solid earth. Two seemingly opposed activities are now needed to capitalize on these advances: intense, challenging field campaigns—especially at the ice-ocean interface—and routine in situ measurements across the region to improve our knowledge of cryptic, important phenomena such as surface mass balance. Satellite observations have revealed significant on-going changes in the Antarctic cryosphere, including increases in sea-ice cover, outlet-glacier retreat, sub-glacial water activity, and ice-shelf fracture. The processes that drive these changes, however, are partly understood at best and field campaigns and routine measurements throughout the region are required. Remote sensing observations have offered a range of new insights into the ice-ocean interface, and models of the ice sheet and ocean have dramatically improved. But in situ data to constrain them is sorely lacking. Intense field campaigns with installed instrumentation are needed. Similarly, knowledge of the surface mass balance of land and sea ice is also needed to constrain ice sheet mass balance and sea ice evolution. Atmospheric reanalyses of satellite data may help characterize these phenomena by providing a comprehensive view of the climate system. But they require validation data, such as precipitation rates, and improved process knowledge, such as improved characterizations of clouds and blowing snow. These require in situ measurements, especially routine measurements at challenging locations throughout the region.",

Mapping of the sediment-buried bedrock surface using 2D and 3D data clearly reveals that the trace of the Shoreline fault zone bifurcates at Souza Rock. The eastern strand is a reverse fault that trends toward the east-southeast, connecting with the Oceano fault zone onshore. The Shoreline fault is a vertical dextral fault with a very linear geometry that continues south to near the Santa Maria river mouth, and may intersect the Casmalia fault onshore. Both of these fault strands are crossed by Pleistocene low-stand paleochannels eroded into bedrock, and are buried by marine and non-marine sediment.\nThe 3D data show that both the Oceano and Shoreline faults are narrow, well defined fault zones. The reverse slip rate for the Oceano fault (~0.1 mm/y.) falls within published slip rate estimates for the Oceano fault onshore (0.01–0.20 mm/y). The dextral slip rate for the Shoreline fault southeast of Souza Rock is estimated to be 0.06 mm/y. Souza Rock is located on the hanging wall of the Oceano Fault, north of the point of intersection between the Shoreline and Oceano faults. Water depths shoal from 60 m on the surrounding seafloor to 5 m on top of Souza Rock. This structure is interpreted as a structural popup in a restraining bend where the N65°W-trending Oceano fault intersects the N25°W-trending Shoreline fault. The structural geometry near the point of intersection has several minor secondary fault strands, but is remarkably simple.",

Concomitant opportunities exist to improve reanalyses themselves through collection of new data and observations for validation and model improvement. With growing Arctic mandates, federal agencies are required to both understand and forecast change. Challenging not just researchers, but also regulatory and operational agencies are the paucity of current and historic observations; the lack of knowledge of the physical processes driving change; and the poor understanding of the Arctic as a system within itself that also has global connections. Recognizing that advances in reanalyses may assist federal agencies, the Office of Science and Technology Policy recently established an interagency collaboration team called Systematic Improvements to Reanalyses of The Arctic (SIRTA) under the aegis of the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee. SIRTA’s terms of reference are to 1) Evaluate the state, utilization, limitations and potential utility of the current Arctic reanalyses; 2) Inventory and assess the currently planned operational and experimental observations of the Arctic system to improve reanalyses; and 3) Examine reanalyses products and forecast models for potential improvement. This talk will cover SIRTA’s terms of reference, the emerging uses of reanalyses, and the mechanisms to improve them. Challenges to be discussed are characterizing the high priority physical processes, ensuring all available data streams are included in the reanalyses, discussing mechanisms to obtain validation data, and delivering reanalyses outputs in formats appropriate to users.",

            "abstract": "The Inner California Borderlands (ICB) is situated off the coast of southern California and northern Baja. The structural and geomorphic characteristics of the area record a middle Oligocene transition from subduction to microplate capture along the California coast. Marine stratigraphic evidence shows large-scale extension and rotation overprinted by modern strike-slip deformation. Geodetic and geologic observations indicate that approximately 6-8 mm/yr of Pacific-North American relative plate motion is accommodated by offshore strike-slip faulting in the ICB.\nThe farthest inshore fault system, the Newport-Inglewood Rose Canyon (NIRC) fault complex is a dextral strike-slip system that extends primarily offshore approximately 120 km from San Diego to the San Joaquin Hills near Newport Beach, California. Based on trenching and well data, the NIRC fault system Holocene slip rate is 1.5-2.0 mm/yr to the south and 0.5-1.0 mm/yr along its northern extent. An earthquake rupturing the entire length of the system could produce an Mw 7.0 earthquake or larger.\nWest of the main segments of the NIRC fault complex are the San Mateo and San Onofre fault trends along the continental slope. Previous work concluded that these were part of a strike-slip system that eventually merged with the NIRC complex. Others have interpreted these trends as deformation associated with the Oceanside Blind Thrust fault purported to underlie most of the region.\nIn late 2013, we acquired the first high-resolution 3D P-Cable seismic surveys (3.125 m bin resolution) of the San Mateo and San Onofre trends as part of the Southern California Regional Fault Mapping project aboard the R/V New Horizon. Analysis of these volumes provides important new insights and constraints on the fault segmentation and transfer of deformation. Based on the new 3D sparker seismic data, our preferred interpretation for the San Mateo and San Onofre fault trends is they are transpressional features associated with westward jogs along right lateral fault strands splaying off the NIRC fault. Such a scenario also is consistent with observations from the 3D boomer volume along the shelf and upper slope that images westward stepping faults splaying off the NIRC system.",

            "abstract": "We present ~1300 new isotopic measurements (δ18O and δ2H) from a network of snowpack sites in the Rocky Mountains (IRMS) that have been sampled since 1993. The network includes 177 locations where depth-integrated snow samples are collected each spring near peak accumulation. At 57 of these locations snowpack samples were obtained for 10 to 21 years and their isotopic measurements provide unprecedented spatial and temporal documentation of snowpack isotope values at mid-latitudes. For environments where snowfall accounts for the majority of annual precipitation, snowmelt is likely to have the strongest influence on isotope values retained in proxy archives. In this first presentation of the dataset we (1) describe the basic features of the isotope values in relation to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), (2) evaluate space for time substitutions traditionally used to establish δ18O-temperature relations, (3) evaluate site-to-site similarities across the network and identify those that are the most regionally representative, (4) examine atmospheric circulation patterns for several years with spatially coherent isotope patterns, and (5) provide examples of the implications this new dataset has for interpreting paleoclimate records (Bison Lake, Colorado and Minnetonka Cave, Idaho). Results indicate that snowpack δ18O is rarely a simple proxy of temperature. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variance that reflect additional processes such as vapor transport and post-depositional modification. Despite these complexities we identify consistent climate-isotope patterns and regionally representative locations that serve to better define Holocene hydroclimate estimates and their uncertainty. Climate change has and will affect western U.S. snowpack and we suggest these changes can be better understood and anticipated by hydrogen and oxygen isotope-based reconstructions of Holocene hydroclimate using a process-based understanding of the controls on snowpack isotope ratios.",

            "abstract": "The determination of earthquake locations are dependent on the velocity model selected. Consequently, the refinement and updating of the velocity models used at the local and regional network level is a critical component for network efficiency through location accuracy. With the expansion of broadband instruments within the Puerto Rico -Virgin Islands region, updating the velocity model is a current long term goal of the Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN). As a first step to this long term goal, receiver functions of ~20 broadband stations with data between 2010 and 2015 were calculated using iterative time domain deconvolution. The receiver function analysis not only provides insight into the crustal velocity structure but also leads to a better understanding of the region's larger tectonic structure. Preliminary results of the receiver function analysis exhibit evidence of a “slab signal”; the receiver function backazimuth sweeps for some stations particularly on the northern side of the island contain a strong P to S conversion at approximately 7 seconds which likely corresponds to the top of the slab beneath Puerto Rico. This strong slab signal implies that simple 1-D analyses of the data (e.g. H-K stacking) may lead to misleading results. To further understand the crustal structure of PRVI, we employ a 3D common-conversion-point analysis. This analysis yields a Moho beneath the island between 32-42km and a possible southward dipping slab structure between 60-80km depth. Further analysis is needed to determine the 2D or 3D velocity structure of Puerto Rico and the surrounding environs such as waveform modeling. Given the current geometry of the available array, detailed imaging of the slab and mantle wedge beneath Puerto Rico is limited. PRSN is currently seeking to install denser temporary networks to improve local imaging that will help understand the nature of the crust, mantle wedge and slab structure beneath the island as well as the structure's influence on the regional tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Although the light elements in the Earth’s core are still enigmatic, hydrogen has recently been receiving much attention. Planetary formation theory suggested that a large amount of water, much more than is in the oceans, could have been brought to the Earth during its accretion. Hydrogen is a strong siderophile element and could be incorporated into the core as a consequence of a reaction between water and molten iron in a magma ocean [Okuchi, 1997 Science]. Nevertheless, the effect of hydrogen on the property of iron is not well known so far. Here, we have experimentally examined the compression behavior of hcp Fe0.88Si0.12Hx (6.5 wt.% Si) at two different hydrogen concentrations (x = 0.7 and 0.9). Fe0.88Si0.12 foil was loaded into a diamond-anvil cell, and then liquid hydrogen was introduced to a sample chamber below 20 K. Hydrogenation occurred upon thermal annealing below 1500 K at 25–62 GPa, and hcp Fe0.88Si0.12Hx was obtained as a single phase. Unlike the Fe-H alloy, hydrogen did not fully occupy the octahedral sites even under hydrogen-saturated conditions. Two compression curves, one from 25 to 136 GPa, and the other from 62 to 128 GPa, were obtained at room temperature. While the effect of hydrogen on the compressibility of iron has been controversial in earlier experimental studies [Hirao et al., 2004 GRL; Pépin et al., 2014 PRL], our data indicate that the compressibility of Fe0.88Si0.12Hx alloy does not change with changing hydrogen content from x = 0 to 0.9. Such compression behavior observed is consistent with the recent ab initio calculations for hcp Fe-H alloys by Caracas[2015 GRL]. The extrapolation of present data to the outer core pressure and temperature range, assuming thermal expansivity is the same as that for iron and there is no density difference between solid and liquid, shows that the density of Fe0.88Si0.12H0.3 matches the PREM in the whole outer core within 1%.",

Assessing and interpreting the root of systematic cloud biases is exacerbated by the interplay of a wide range of physical and dynamical processes. The goal of this study is to use forecast-mode global simulations to analyze cloud biases that develop in short-term simulations in which the large scale dynamics are still constrained by the initial conditions. We use multiple configurations of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) prototype AM4 models to produce 3 day forecasts starting from each day of July 2013, initialized with NCEP Reanalysis. Comparing the top of atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave radiation (RSW) from each model against Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations for the same period, we find the models have different regional bias patterns that do not vary substantially with forecast lead, and which are surprisingly consistent across every day of July 2013. Relative to CERES, we find the GFS models broadly simulate too little low cloud across a wide swath of the globe, with an offshore region in the southeast Pacific with too much cloud, contributing to a net TOA radiation bias on the order of 10 W m-2. The GFDL models tend to simulate too much high cloud in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and too little coastal stratocumulus. Using the TOA radiation biases as a guide, we identify two regions to further compare vertically resolved cloud fields: the GPCI transect, and the mid-latitude NE Pacific. The mid-latitudes in particular are a region where the GFS and GFDL models show opposite OLR and RSW biases from each other when compared against CERES. Our next step is to use these cloud biases diagnosed in forecast-mode simulations to guide model development.",

Sea ice forecasts are generated for 6 hours to 9 days using the Marginal Ice Zone Modelling and Assimilation System (MIZMAS) and 6 hourly forecasts of atmospheric forcing variables from the NOAA Climate Forecast System (CFSv2). Forecast sea ice drift speed is compared to observations from drifting buoys and other observation platforms. Forecast buoy positions are compared with observed positions at 24 hours to 9 days from the initial forecast. Forecast skill is assessed relative to forecasts made using an ice velocity climatology generated from multi-year integrations of the same model. RMS errors for ice speed are found in the order of 5 km/day for 24 h to 48 h using the sea ice model vs. 12 km/day using climatology. Following adjustments in the sea ice model to remove systematic biases in direction and speed, predicted buoy position RMS errors are improved from 8 km 6.5 km for 24 hour forecasts and 15 km after 72 hours. Using the forecast model increases the probability of tracking a target drifting in sea ice with a 10x10 km sized image to 95% vs. 50% using climatology. The results are generated in the context of planning and scheduling the acquisition of high resolution images which need to follow buoys or research platforms for scientific research but additional applications such as navigation in the Arctic waters may benefit from this accuracy assessment. Ideas for future improvement of short term sea ice forecasts and relevance for longer term predictions are explored.",

However, predicting how fuel treatments may affect future wildfire risk and associated ecosystem services, such as forest water availability and streamflow, remains a challenge. This challenge is in part due to the large range of conditions under which fuel treatments may be implemented, as response is likely to vary with species type, rates of vegetation regrowth, meteorological conditions and physiographic properties of the treated site. It is also due to insufficient understanding of how social factors such as political pressure, public demands and economic constraints affect fuel management decisions. To examine the feedbacks between ecological and social dimensions of fuel treatments, we present an integrated model that links a biophysical model that simulates vegetation and hydrology (RHESSys), a fire spread model (WMFire) and an empirical fuel treatment model that accounts for agency decision-making. We use this model to investigate how management decisions affect landscape fuel loads, which in turn affect fire severity and ecosystem services, which feedback to management decisions on fuel treatments. We hypothesize that this latter effect will be driven by salience theory, which predicts that fuel treatments are more likely to occur following major wildfire events. The integrated model provides a flexible framework for answering novel questions about fuel treatments that span social and ecological domains, areas that have previously been treated separately.",

These protocols have been piloted in several workshops and implemented in schools. Data collected have been used for several secondary, undergraduate and graduate student research studies. Over this past year, 2015, these protocols have been synthesized into one protocol that will be made available to the world-wide community through the GLOBE website (\nwww.globe.gov\n). This new protocol is designed to be flexible in the mosquito species that can be collected and the types of environments sampled (e.g., containers in and around the house, ponds, irrigation ditches in a rice paddy field). Plans are underway to enable web-based data entry and mobile apps for data collection and submission. Once everything is finalized, a GLOBE field campaign will be initiated for citizen scientists to collect meaningful data on where different types of mosquito larvae are found and how the abundance and distribution is changing seasonally. To assist in the standardization of data collection and quality control, training slides are being developed and will be made available in early 2016. This will enable a wider participation of citizen scientists to participate in this effort to collect mosquito data by making it easier to become part of the GLOBE community. As with mosquito larvae, training slides are being created for hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and pedosphere GLOBE measurement protocols. The development of the mosquito protocol and the training slides are in direct response to the GLOBE community’s desire to increase citizen science participation beyond primary and secondary schools, in observing and measuring environmental change.",

Recently the precipitable water vapour content (PW) is estimated using the zenith wet delay (ZWD) derived from ground-based GNSS data.\nThis study introduces a new global model for the conversion of zenith wet delays (ZWD) obtained from GNSS observations to precipitable water vapour (PW). The model was developed using a monthly mean ERA-Interim global numerical weather model datasets of 14 years between 2001-2014. The 1°×1° global grids of 37 pressure levels of temperature, relative humidity and the geopotential were collected from the ECMWF and the ZWD and PW values as well as the mean temperature of the water vapour (Tm) were calculated for each gridpoint.\nAfterwards a direct and an indirect method was used to derive the global grids of the parameters used for the computation of the conversion factor between ZWD and PW. In the indirect method the conversion factor is computed as a function of the mean temperature of water vapour, where Tm is estimated as an empirical function of the surface temperature. The direct method models the conversion factor as a polynomial function of the surface temperature. The global grids of the model parameters were derived for both of the approaches.\nThe results show that the global climate strongly affects the parameters of the conversion formulae. It is well known that the most widely used conversion formulae were derived from North American and European radiosonde observations only. Our results show that the relative differences in terms of the conversion factors reach the level of 10%, which can lead a similar relative error in PW estimation.\nThe ZWD2PW model is also validated by a global set of radiosonde observations and the results show that it can be efficiently used for the conversion of ZWD to PW globally, especially for places where the availability of radiosonde observations are limited, thus local conversion models can not be derived from such datasets.",

            "abstract": "Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes recorded by both the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) are compared with three-dimensional lightning mapping observations from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (OKLMA) and storm chaser video recorded of the 31 May 2013 El Reno tornadic supercell. The El Reno Survey Project (El-Reno-Survey.net) was created to crowd-source the abundance of storm chaser video from this event and provide open-access to the scientific community of the data. An initial comparison of CG lightning flashes captured on these videos with CG data from NLDN revealed a disagreement on the total number of flashes, with NLDN recording many negative CG flashes at lower peak amplitude not apparent in any of the videos. For this study, the area of the comparison was expanded to include the entire storm and data from both the ENTLN and LMA were added to compare the observations from each network in terms of timestamp, location detection, peak current, and polarity of each flash in the period 2230-2330 UTC. An initial comparison of 557 matched NLDN and ENLTN CG flashes, indicated predominately negative polairy CG flashes (58% NLDN/77% ENI) throughout the storm during this period. However, after a 15 kA peak current filter was applied, the NLDN indicated primarily positive polarity (84% +CG) while ENTLN still indicated primarily negative polarity (77% -CG) for the 264 remaining matched flashes. Before the filter was applied, the average distance between the two networks for the same flash was more than 2 km, but improved to approximately 1 km after the 15 kA filter was applied, likely removing some misidentified cloud flashes of uncertain location. This misclassification of IC flashes as CG at low peak current amplitudes for both networks is further evident when compared to video and the OKLMA data. Additionally, the charge analysis of OKLMA flashes revealed the NLDN-determined positive-polarity as correct every time the NLDN and ENTLN disagreed. For the 2013 El Reno supercell storm, there appears to be a major flaw in the ENTLN’s ability to determine the polarity of CG flashes despite having roughly similar peak current magnitudes and location for most CG flash occurrences as the NLDN.",

            "abstract": "Continental dust plays an important role in climate forcing, by interacting with incoming solar and outgoing long wave radiation and by impacting albedo when deposited on bright surfaces such as fresh snow. Continental dust may also play an important role in ocean fertilization and carbon sequestration. Because the lifetime of dust aerosol in the atmosphere is only on the order of days to weeks, spatial and temporal variability in concentrations and fluxes is high and understanding of recent and long term changes is limited. Therefore, understanding of natural variations and climate drivers of continental dust, and potential climate feedbacks on longer timescales is critical.\nHere we present and discuss continuous, high depth resolution measurements of a range of dust proxies in high latitude ice cores from the Arctic and Antarctic. Sub-annually resolved measurements provide insights into the temporal variations in dust deposition. Included are traditional proxies such as non-sea-salt (nss) calcium and insoluble particle number and size distribution as well as less traditional proxies such as rare earth elements which together provide important insights into how dust sources and transport may have changed in the past. We compare these detailed dust records with climate and land use proxies to investigate drivers of dustiness during the last three millennium.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the CERES FluxByCldTyp data product has been developed. This product sorts the CERES top-of-atmosphere (TOA) outgoing shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) fluxes by region and cloud type. Here, the cloud types are defined by optical depth and cloud top pressure, with bins similar to those of ISCCP. This observational product has the potential to be a powerful tool to evaluate the clouds produced in climate models by helping to identify physical parameterizations that are problematic (e.g., convective clouds, boundary-layer parameterizations, or processes that involve surface albedo). Also, when the flux-by-cloud type and frequency of cloud types are simultaneously used to evaluate a model, the results can determine whether an unrealistically large or small occurrence of a given cloud type has an important radiative impact for a given region. Here, a simulator of the flux-by-cloud type product is applied to three-hourly data from the UK Met Office’s HadGEM2-A model using the Langley Fu-Liou radiative transfer model to obtain TOA SW and LW fluxes. For the simulator, a cloud generator with a maximum-random overlap assumption is applied to each grid cell that has an Aqua overpass within 1.5 hours, generating 1000 individual subcolumns with binary (0 or 1) cloud fraction. Many of the subcolumns are identical to one another, reducing the number of radiative transfer calculations required by over 90%. When the simulator is applied to the Southeast Pacific, Equatorial Pacific, and Southern Great Plains, it produces TOA fluxes similar to the grid-mean fluxes produced by HadGEM2-A, although the simulator’s LW fluxes are somewhat lower than those from the model. The HadGEM2-A TOA SW albedo over the Southeast Pacific (0.184) is close to that observed (0.193). However, when the simulator output is compared to the CERES flux-by-cloud type and frequency of cloud types in the Southeast Pacific region, we find that the HadGEM2-A albedos are slightly lower than observed for most cloud types, but for clouds with the highest optical depths, albedos are higher than observed.",

            "abstract": "Alkaline basalts occur in many subduction-related volcanic settings, including the Sunda, Izu-Bonin, Honshu, Aeolian, and Aleutian arcs, yet their origin continues to be debated. Recent studies have suggested that buoyant material (mélange) from the slab-wedge interface may rise into the hot corner of the mantle wedge as low-density plumes or diapirs, where it will melt or induce mantle melting due to dehydration. High-pressure mélange rocks represent a mixture of mafic, ultramafic, and sedimentary components, and are often dominated by chlorite. Mélange rocks are also enriched in accessory phases such as monazite, zircon, and rutile, which host a variety of trace elements. We present results from experimental melting of chlorite-rich mélange material at mantle wedge conditions that reproduce many of the compositional features of subduction-related lavas.\nPiston cylinder experiments were performed at conditions appropriate for mantle wedge diapirs (1030–1280 °C, 1.5–2.5 GPa) using natural mélange rocks from Syros, Greece. Experimental melts derived from omphacite-epidote-phengite bearing chlorite schists range in composition from basaltic trachyandesites to trachydacites to more alkaline melt compositions (50.7–60.73 wt% SiO2, 7.48–12.93 wt% Na2O+K2O). All of the experimental melts are characterized by high alumina contents (16.79–21.36 wt% Al2O3). Minerals coexisting with these melts include clinopyroxene, amphibole (at lower T) or olivine (at higher T), garnet (at higher P), ilmenite and/or rutile, and zircon.\nTrace element patterns in our experimentally produced melts are similar to those from arc volcanoes worldwide. Experimental melts are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (Cs, Rb, Ba, K, Pb, Sr) and depleted in high field strength elements (Nb, Ta, and Ti). Zirconium and Hf are enriched relative to the rare earth elements (REE), which show flat to heavy REE depleted patterns depending on the presence of residual garnet. Thorium is fractionated from U, suggesting the presence of a light REE-rich accessory phase rich in Th. Similarity of the major and trace elements of experimental melts with those found in arcs suggests that many of the geochemical features unique to volcanic arcs can potentially be explained by melting of chlorite-rich mélange rocks in mantle wedge plumes or diapirs.",

This model does not simulate a permanent Pliocene El Niño, but instead shows ENSO variability which is reasonably similar to the modern. However, the model suggests the structure of El Niño was different in the Pliocene with El Niño temperature anomalies shifted towards the central Pacific and more strongly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Here we will consider how this different structure would appear in oxygen isotopes measured in proxy data at locations throughout the Pacific. We will show that there could be different ways of interpreting proxy data from this time and will highlight regions where the model suggests the interpretation of the proxy data is more robust.",

We focus our analysis on 8-10 such intervals spanning different values of plasma beta and angles between the local magnetic field and the radial Sun-Earth direction.\nWe discuss the careful analysis process of characterizing and removing the different instrumental effects and noise sources affecting the electric and magnetic field data at those scales, above 0.1 Hz or so, above the breakpoint marking the start of the so-called dissipation range of solar wind turbulence.\nWe compute parameters such as the electric to magnetic field ratio, the magnetic compressibility, magnetic helicity, and other relevant quantities in order to diagnose the nature of the fluctuations at those scales between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies, extracting information on the dominant modes composing the fluctuations. We also discuss the presence and role of coherent structures in the measured fluctuations. The nature of the fluctuations in the dissipation or dispersive scales of solar wind turbulence is still debated.

            "abstract": "The Tropically Excited Arctic Warming (TEAM) mechanism ascribes Arctic surface warming to tropical convection, which excites poleward propagating Rossby wave trains that transport water vapor and heat into the Arctic. A crucial component of the TEAM mechanism is the increase in downward infrared radiation (IR) that precedes the Arctic warming. Previous studies have examined the downward IR associated with the TEAM mechanism with reanalysis data. To corroborate previous findings, we examine the linkage between tropical convection, Rossby wave trains, and downward IR with Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) downward IR station data. The physical processes that drive changes in the downward IR are also investigated by regressing 300-hPa geopotential height, outgoing longwave radiation, water vapor flux, ERA-Interim downward IR, and other key variables, against the BSRN downward IR at Barrow, Alaska and Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen.\nBoth the Barrow and the Ny-Alesund station downward IR anomalies are preceded by anomalous tropical convection and poleward propagating Rossby wave trains. The wave train associated with Barrow resembles the Pacific/North American teleconnection pattern and that for Ny-Alesund corresponds to a northwest Atlantic wave train. It is found that both wave trains promote warm and moist advection from the midlatitudes into the Arctic. The resulting water vapor flux convergence, multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization, closely resembles the regressed ERA-Interim downward IR. These results suggest that the combination of warm advection, latent heat release, and increased cloudiness all contribute toward an increase in downward IR.",

            "abstract": "The 2012 Wharton Basin earthquakes (Mw=8.6 and Mw=8.2) were the largest intra-plate strike-slip earthquakes ever recorded. Based on seismological and geodetic studies, different, and partly contradictory, models have been proposed for the fault geometry requiring a complex faulting mechanism with several faults, oblique to one-another. These earthquakes occurred in the Wharton Basin, which is considered to be a broad diffuse zone of intra-plate deformation with deformation taking place along re-activated N5ºE striking fracture zones, which was inconsistent with most of the seismology or geodesy based rupture models. In May-June 2015, we acquired 13 high-resolution seismic reflection profiles and more than 8500 km2 of bathymetric data to the south and southwest of the main N-S segment of the Mw=8.6 earthquake rupture and across the Mw=8.2 earthquake rupture zone. We find that the epicenter of the Mw=8.2 earthquake lies on a re-activated fracture zone, expressed as a ~50-km wide region with four N5ºE striking left-lateral sub-faults. The easternmost sub-fault is most active and might be the master fault, where the maximum deformation might be taking place. The deformation along the other sub-faults becomes more diffuse moving westward. We also imaged a set of N110ºE trending 2-km wide right-lateral shear zones, which might act as transfer zones between the re-activated N5ºE striking fracture zones, and have orientations in agreement with aftershock focal mechanisms. We suggest that the 2012 great Wharton Basin earthquakes ruptured N5ºE re-activated fractures. Furthermore, the rupture of the Mw=8.6 event proceeded in en échelon fashion with this suite of N110ºE striking shear zones connecting the re-activated fracture zone imaged in this study with another N5ºE trending re-activated fracture zone on the Ninety East Ridge. Our model explains the discrepancy between direct observations on the seafloor and distant seismological and geodetic results.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Erosion Process Importance Poster.pdf\nSheet/rill erosion, dust displacement, and vehicle induced splash are the primary sediment transport processes on off-highway vehicle (OHV) trails in the Ouachita Mountains of the central United States. The relative importance of these three processes is assessed by comparing the area affected and the sediment connectivity of each process to affected streams using field data from the Wolf Pen Gap Trail Complex. The occurrence and areal extent of erosion processes were assessed using systematic transect measurements, feature inventories, and visual observation over representative trail segments.\n<span\"> Sheet/rill erosion affects the entire denunded surface of the trail system, an area of 2,820 m2 km-1 of trail. Distinct erosion features created by sheet/rill erosion occur 16.3 times per km. Dust transport extends a mean travel distance of 3.7 m off-trail. Dust transport affects both the entire trail area and an additional 6,640 m2 km-1 of off-trail area. In contrast, splash transport was restricted to trail dips, and extends 1.6 m off-trail. Splash transport affects 60 m2 km-1of off-trail area.\n<span\">The impact of trail erosion increases where sediment sources are connected to drainageways. Of 480 sheet/rill erosion features rated, 69.4% had high to very high connectivity to channels. All sampled dips were directly connected to drainage ways. Dust transport affected 99% of dips on one trail side and 90% on both sides. About 80% of the dips had splash transport on one trail side and 42% on both sides.\n<span\">Sheet/rill, dust, and splash transport processes are all important in the Trail Complex, but for different reasons. Sheet/rill erosion affects the entire trail surface, is well connected to area drainageways, but only occurs after rainfall. Dust transport affects the largest area and occurs most often throughout the year, but the sediment is deposited diffusely, and the ratio delivered to the drainage network is relatively low. Splash affects the smallest area and is limited to short periods following rainfall, but is highly connected to the drainage network and the sediment delivery ratio is relatively high.",

            "abstract": "The active tectonics of the southern San Andreas transform plate boundary system respond to and contribute to the 4 D stress field throughout the region. We investigate the nature of this stress field in Southern California, with particular focus near the major strain-accumulating San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, by creating a forward model that incorporates observations from seismology, geodesy, gravity, topography, and earthquake rupture history.\nThe forward model consists of three independent crustal stress field components: (1) a plate driving force of undetermined magnitude and orientation; (2) a heterogeneous fault loading stress accumulation along locked fault segments; and (3) spatial variations in crustal stress due to differences in topography. The forward model is then compared to the in situ stress field orientation inferred from earthquake focal mechanisms.\nWe estimate the magnitude of the in situ stress field as that required to maintain its orientation in the presence of topography, which tends to resist the motion of strike-slip faults. Our results indicate that differential stress at seismogenic depth must exceed 40 MPa. To assess the orientation of the plate driving stress, we consider twelve independent segments of the San Andreas Fault System from Imperial Valley through Parkfield. We determine that along much of the central San Andreas fault, the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) is oriented north-south (~0ºEofN), but that from Coachella to Imperial SHmax is rotated clockwise, oriented ~12ºEofN. Furthermore, SHmax along the San Jacinto and Superstition Hills segments gradually rotates clockwise from ~3ºWofN in the south to ~8ºEofN in the north.\nWith these results, we are able to match the in situ stress orientation of most (≥85%) of the near-fault strike-slip areas to within 15º, comparable to the errors associated with focal mechanism determination. Creating a forward model consistent with so many different types of observations corroborates the credibility of the individual model components and reinforces the robustness of the inferred stress rotations. The underlying physical cause of these rotations may be related to differences in segment locking depth, earthquake cycle maturity, fault friction and strength, or the nature of the connecting segments.",

Here the two major cities of Augusta and Siracusa are found. In particular, the Augusta bay hosts one of the largest petrochemical poles in the Mediterranean, and Siracusa is listed among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2005. This area was hit by at least seven tsunamis in the approximate time interval from 1600 BC to present, the most famous being the 365, 1169, 1693 and 1908 tsunamis. The choice of this area as one of the sites for the testing of innovative methods for tsunami hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment and reduction is then fully justified. This is being developed in the frame of the EU Project called ASTARTE - Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe (Grant 603839, 7th FP, ENV.2013.6.4-3). We assess the tsunami hazard for the Augusta-Siracusa area through the worst-case credible scenario technique, which can be schematically divided into the following steps: 1) Selection of five main source areas, both in the near- and in the far-field (Hyblaean-Malta escarpment, Messina Straits, Ionian subduction zone, Calabria offshore, western Hellenic Trench); 2) Choice of potential and credible tsunamigenic faults in each area: 38 faults were selected, with properly assigned magnitude, geometry and focal mechanism; 3) Computation of the maximum tsunami wave elevations along the eastern Sicily coast on a coarse grid (by means of the in-house code UBO-TSUFD) and extraction of the 9 scenarios that produce the largest effects in the target areas of Augusta and Siracusa; 4) For each of the 9 scenarios we run numerical UBO-TSUFD simulations over a set of five nested grids, with grid cells size decreasing from 3 km in the open Ionian sea to 40 m in the target areas of Augusta and Siracusa. The simulation results consist of fields of maximum water elevation, of maximum water column, of maximum velocity and of maximum momentum flux. The main findings for each single scenario and for the aggregate scenario are presented and discussed.",

The lake is permanently covered with ice, is partly bounded by glacier ice and has a mean annual air temperature of -10°C. In contrast to other Antarctic lakes the dominating physical process controlling ice-cover dynamics is low summer temperatures and high wind speeds resulting in sublimation rather than melting as the main mass-loss process. The ice-cover of the lake is composed of lake-water ice formed during freeze-up and rafted glacial ice derived from the Anuchin Glacier. The mix of these two fractions impacts the energy balance of the lake, which directly affects ice-cover thickness. Ice-cover is important if one is to understand the physical, chemical, and biological linkages within these unique, physically driven ecosystems.\n We have analyzed δ2H, δ18O, and δ17O from samples of lake and glacier ice collected at Lake Untersee in Dec 2014. Using these data we seek to answer two specific questions: Are we able to determine the origin and history of the lake ice, discriminating between rafted glacial ice and lake water? Can isotopic gradients in the surface ice indicate the ablation (sublimation) rate of the surface ice?\nThe triple isotope water analyzer developed by Los Gatos Research (LGR 912-0032) uses LGR’s patented Off-Axis ICOS (Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy) technology and incorporates proprietary internal thermal control for high sensitivity and optimal instrument stability. This analyzer measures δ2H, δ18O, and δ17O from water, as well as the calculated d-excess and 17O-excess. The laboratory precision in high performance mode for both δ17O and δ18O is 0.03 ‰, and for δ2H is 0.2 ‰.\nMethodology and isotope data from Lake Untersee samples are presented.\nFigure: Ice samples were collected across Lake Untersee from both glacial and lake ice regions for this study.",

Precise experimental determination of these properties at such extreme conditions is very challenging. Therefore, ab initio calculations play an essential role in this context, but at the cost of great computational effort and memory use. Setting up a widely accessible and versatile mineral physics database can relax unnecessary repetition of such computationally intensive calculations. Access to such data facilitates transactional interaction across fields and can advance more quickly insights about deep Earth processes. Hosted by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, the Virtual Laboratory for Earth and Planetary Materials (VLab) was designed to develop and promote the theory of planetary materials using distributed, high-throughput quantum calculations. VLab hosts an interactive database of thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties or minerals computed by ab initio. Such properties can be obtained according to user’s preference. The database is accompanied by interactive visualization tools, allowing users to repeat and build upon previously published results. Using VLab2015, we have evaluated thermoelastic properties, such as elastic coefficients (Cij), Voigt, Reuss, and Voigt-Reuss-Hill aggregate averages for bulk (K) and shear modulus (G), shear wave velocity (VS), longitudinal wave velocity (Vp), and bulk sound velocity (V0) for several important minerals. Developed web services are general and can be used for crystals of any symmetry. Results can be tabulated, plotted, or downloaded from the VLab website according to user’s preference.",

The terrane was primarily deformed during the Late Ordovician Cherokee orogeny, that reached greenschist facies metamorphism. The Albemarle arc, a younger component of the Carolina terrane, contains volcanogenic metasedimentary rocks with intercalated mainly rhyolitic volcanic rocks. Regional inclined to overturned folds with axial planar cleavage verge southeast. At mesoscopic scales (exposures of a few square meters), folds sympathetic with regional folds are attenuated or truncated by ductile shear zones or contractional faults. Shear and fault zones are most abundant near highly silicified strataform zones in metagraywacke of the Tillery Formation; these zones are also auriferous. GPR profiles were collected across strike of two silicified, gold-bearing zones and enclosing metagraywacke to characterize the scale and extent of folding in the vicinity of ore horizons. Several GSSI SIR-3000 / 100 MHz monostatic GPR profiles were collected in profiles up to 260 meters long. In pre-migration lines processed for time zero and background removal, several clusters of shallow, rolling sigmoidal reflectors appeared separated by sets of parallel, northwest-dipping reflective discontinuities. These features are inferred to be reverse faults carrying contractional folds. After migration with an average velocity of 0.105 m/ns, vertical heights of the inferred folds became attenuated but not removed, and contractional fault reflections remained prominent. After migration, a highly convex-up cluster of reflections initially assumed to be a fold culmination resolved to an elliptical patch of high amplitudes. The patch is likely an undisclosed shaft or covered trench left by earlier gold prospecting. In this survey, useful detail appeared to a depth of 7.5 meters, and only a few gently inclined, laterally extensive reflectors are present inside the noise blanket. Also, convex-up planar reflectors greater than about 8 meters deep and tens of meters long suggest fold culminations much longer in wavelength than the shallow imaged folds. For these metasedimentary rocks GPR provides a valuable tool for imaging sub-surface structure.",

Here we explore the relationship between elevation and arc lava compositions in island and continental arcs. We show, using globally compiled major and trace element data for active subaerial volcanic arcs and a series of digital elevation models, that lavas become, on average, more evolved with increasing elevation. This corroborates work relating crustal thickness to melt evolution, since elevation scales with crustal thickness and can be measured with greater certainty. At low elevations, lava compositions range from basalt to rhyolite, and as elevation increases, lavas become more andesitic to dacitic on average, with fewer basalts. Trace elements also show systematic behavior with changes in elevation. Incompatible element concentrations generally increase with elevation while compatible element concentrations simultaneously decrease. In particular, we note that the average Mn, Y, Sc, and Yb content in lavas decreases with increasing elevation while La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios increase. This trend is suggestive of garnet and/or amphibole fractionation at depth, given that the above elements are highly compatible in both minerals and both phases are stable at high pressures. Thus, we suggest that evolved magmas may be produced in elevated arcs due to more extensive differentiation in thick crust or as a result of the formation of garnet or amphibole-bearing cumulates at depth.",

The nitrogen challenge is to maximize the food production benefits of Nr, while minimizing losses to the environment.\nThe first nitrogen footprint tool was created in 2012 to help consumers learn about the Nr losses to the environment that result from an individual’s lifestyle choices. The nitrogen lost during food production was estimated with virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs) that quantify the amount of nitrogen lost to the environment per unit nitrogen consumed. Alternative agricultural systems, such as USDA certified organic farms, utilize practices that diverge from conventional production. In order to evaluate the potential sustainability of these alternative agricultural systems, our team calculated VNFs that reflect organic production.\nInitial data indicate that VNFs for organic grains and organic starchy roots are comparable to, but slightly higher than conventional (+10% and +20% respectively). In contrast, the VNF for organic vegetables is significantly higher (+90%) and the VNF for organic legumes is significantly lower (-90%). Initial data on organic meat production shows that organic poultry and organic pigmeat are comparable to conventional production (both <5% difference), but that the organic beef VNF is significantly higher (+30%).\nThese data show that in some cases organic and conventional production are comparable in terms of nitrogen efficiency. However, since conventional production relies heavily on the creation of new reactive nitrogen (Haber-Bosch, biological nitrogen fixation) and organic production primarily utilizes already existing reactive nitrogen (manure, crop residue, compost), the data also show that organic production contributes less new reactive nitrogen to the environment than conventional production (approximately 70% less).\nTherefore, we conclude that on a local scale, nitrogen losses from organic production are comparable to conventional production, but that organic production introduces less new reactive nitrogen to the global pool.",

Microbial activity increases as growing temperatures cause permafrost warming and subsequent thaw, leading to a greater resource of soil nutrients enabling shrub growth. Increased carbon inputs from shrubs is predicted to result in faster carbon turnover by microbial decomposition. Further understanding of microbial activity underneath shrubs could uncover how microbes and soil processes interact to promote shrub expansion and carbon cycling. To address how higher soil carbon input from shrubs influences decomposition, soil samples were taken across a heath, shrub, and forest ecotone gradient at two sites near Abikso, Sweden. Samples were analyzed for soluble carbon and nitrogen, microbial abundance, and microbial activity of chitinase, glucosidase, and phosphatase to reflect organic matter decomposition and availability of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphate respectively. Chitinase activity positively correlated with shrub cover, suggesting microbial demands for nitrogen increase with higher shrub cover. Glucosidase activity negatively correlated with shrub cover and soluble carbon, suggesting decreased microbial demand for carbon as shrub cover and carbon stores increase. Lower glucosidase activity in areas with high carbon input from shrubs implies that microbes are decomposing carbon less readily than carbon is being put into the soil. Increasing soil carbon stores in shrub covered areas can lead to shrubs becoming a net carbon sink and a negative feedback to changing climate.",

Strong lightning patterns associated with ocean currents are demonstrated with a study of the Gulf Stream. We located all major lightning producing storms, using a clustering algorithm on 10 years of World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data to reduce the influence of rapidly increasing lightning network detection efficiency on temporal studies. The clustered storms are used to study the variations and patterns of global and regional lightning activity. WWLLN and Earth Networks lightning detection networks have been used to show the energy per flash of lightning over the oceans is higher than over land, and the sharp contrast at the coasts will be examined.",

            "abstract": "In active tectonic settings, the presence of helium in aqueous fluids with 3He/4He ratios greater than in-situ production values (~0.05 RA where RA = air He or 1.4 x 10-6) indicates the contribution of mantle-derived volatiles to the total volatile inventory. This is an indicative of the presence of mantle-derived melts, which act to transfer volatiles from the solid Earth towards the surface. Thus, He has the potential to map regions of the underlying mantle which are undergoing partial melting – a phenomenon which should also be evident in the seismic record. Reports of high 3He/4He in hot springs in Baja California (BC) has prompted us to initiate a survey of the region to assess relationship(s) between He isotopes and geophysical images of the underlying mantle.\nPrevious studies report 3He/4He ratios of 0.54 RA for submarine hot springs (Punta Banda 108oC; Vidal, 1982) and 1.3 RA for spring waters (81oC) at Bahia Concepcion (Forrest et al.,2005). Our new survey of hot springs in northern BC has revealed that all 6 localities sampled to date, show the presence of mantle He with the highest ratio being 1.74RA (21% mantle-derived) at Puertecitos on the Gulf coast. He ratios are generally lower on the Pacific coast with the minimum mantle He contribution being 5% at Sierra Juárez (0.11RA). Thus, preliminary trends are of a west-to-east increase in the mantle He signal across the peninsula.\nHe results presented in this study correlate well with high resolution Rayleigh wave tomography images by Forsythe et al. (2007). Shear velocity variations in the BC crust and upper mantle have been interpreted as low velocity anomalies associated with dynamic upwelling and active melt production. More extensive sampling throughout BC coupled with analysis of other geochemical indicators of mantle degassing (e.g. CO2) will allow more detailed characterization of the extent and distribution of mantle melts in the region, facilitating assessment of the region’s geothermal potential.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic origin of the Isabella high-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath California’s southern Great Valley is unclear. Previous low-resolution seismic imaging studies of the region have been unable to identify the structural connection between this upper mantle anomaly and the overlying lithosphere. The two dominant hypotheses attribute the Isabella anomaly to a fossil slab or the foundered lithospheric root of the Sierra Nevada batholith. The Central California Seismic Experiment (CCSE) is designed to distinguish between these hypotheses. We present results from the CCSE, which consists of 44 broadband seismometers currently deployed in a quasi-linear array spanning from the Pacific coast, across the Great Valley, to the Sierra Nevada foothills, at an approximate latitude of 36°N. Forward modeling of the 2D structure of the crust is performed using local earthquakes recorded by the CCSE and a finite-difference algorithm to provide constraints on the geometry and velocity of the seismic structure of the Great Valley. This sedimentary basin is suggested to be filled with very low velocity material at shallow depths and partially underlain by a high-velocity ophiolite body. Hence, a well-constrained basin structure will be important in correcting surface wave tomography and receiver function images. The impact of the Great Valley basin structure on body waves is evident by an observed delay in P-wave arrival times on the radial component relative to the vertical component for stations located within the basin. Surface waves along the CCSE array also show a distinct slowing by the valley at periods <10 sec. Data from teleseismic events recorded by the CCSE reveal scattered waves arriving tens of seconds after the S-wave, which we will interpret in terms of the lithospheric structure of the region by identifying the source location(s) of the scatterer(s). We may also gain insights into the structural connection between the Isabella anomaly and the overlying lithosphere with this analysis.",

The course covers the major response themes of adaptation, mitigation and communication. In the spring of 2015 the course was oriented around Arctic and Antarctic case studies. Each week a different theme is addressed, such as the physical setting, changing ecosystems, governance issues, perspectives of residents and indigenous peoples, geoengineering, commercial interests, security, and health and developmental issues. Frequent guest lectures from thematic experts keep the course grounded in realities and present the students with cutting edge issues. Activities match the weekly theme, for example during the week on Arctic development, students engage with the marine spatial planning simulation Arctic SMARTIC (Strategic Management of Resources in Times of Change) based on research on Arctic sea ice trends and projections coupled with current and projected developmental interests of stakeholders. Created under the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership (thepolarhub.org), a complete set of SMARTIC resources is available on line for use by others (\nhttp://www.camelclimatechange.org/view/article/175297/\n).\nThe Responding to Climate Change course is designed to be current and respond to events. For the Arctic case study, students developed proposals for the US State Department as the upcoming Chair of the Arctic Council. Student evaluations indicated that they appreciated the opportunity to connect science with policy and presentation of preliminary proposals in a workshop format was valued as a way to develop and hone their ideas. An additional finding was that students were surprisingly tolerant of technical issues when guest lecturers were linked in via Skype, allowing interaction with thematic experts across the US. Students commented positively on this exposure to outside expertise and role modeling regarding career trajectories. Also, it was surprising how many of our colleagues welcomed the opportunity to address students and engage in discussion with them. This is helpful for those wishing to incorporate a wide range of current topics in their curriculum.",

            "abstract": "Context\nEngineering works in the subsurface often requires ground water ingress through fractures in the rock to be minimised. Traditionally cement based grouts have been used for this purpose, however chemical and alternative grouts are increasingly used. A promising alternative grout utilises bacteria to rapidly initiate the precipitation of calcium carbonate in a process termed microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP). Advantages of this process over conventional grouts are very low viscosity and small particle size allowing penetration into small aperture fractures, low toxicity and low associated carbon footprint. The use of MICP for soil stabilisation has been demonstrated and small scale fractures have been sealed in the lab, yet where the CaCO3 precipitates within large fractures is poorly understood.\nAim\nThe aim of this project was to assess the feasibility of MICP for large scale fracture sealing and to identify the optimum injection strategy that would allow controllable precipitation of CaCO3 over a large area and hence create a long-lasting reduction in fracture transmissivity.\nA 3m2 artificial fracture consisting of a rough-cut granite lower surface and transparent polycarbonate upper surface with a central injection well was created (Figure 1) and sealed twice with MICP: the first experiment to determine the transmissivity reduction achievable and the second experiment to optimise where CaCO3 precipitation occurred. The sealing process was then simulated in a model developed with CFD software OpenFOAM.\nResults\nThe transmissivity of the 300μm hydraulic aperture fracture was reduced from 1.7x10-5 to 8.8x10-9m2/s with 12 injections in the first experiment. A similar transmissivity reduction was achieved with only five injections in the second optimised experiment. Through the transparent upper fracture surface, CaCO3 precipitation was visible over the entire 3m2 fracture and attachment to both the top and bottom surfaces was very strong. This study has shown that when and where CaCO3 precipitates can be controlled and that the MICP process may be an attractive alternative to cement based grouts for certain fracture sealing applications.",

            "abstract": "Because the reported age of an analyzed sample is dependent on the age of the co-irradiated monitor standard(s), Ar/Ar dating is a relative dating technique. There is disagreement at the 1% scale in the age of commonly used monitor standards, and there is a great need to improve the inter-laboratory calibrations. Additionally, new approaches and insights are needed to meet the challenge of bringing the Ar/Ar chronometer to the highest possible precision and accuracy. In this spirit, we present a conceptual framework for Ar/Ar dating that does not depend on the age of monitor standards, but only on the K content of a solid standard. The concept is demonstrated by introducing a re-expressed irradiation parameter (JK) that depends on the ratio of 39ArK to 40Ar* rather than the 40Ar*/39ArK ratio. JK is equivalent to the traditional irradiation parameter J and is defined as JK = (39Ar/40K) • (λ/λe). The ultimate precision and accuracy of the method will depend on how precisely and accurately the 39Ar and 40K can be estimated, and will require isotope dilution measurements of both from the same aliquot. We are testing the workability of our technique at the 1% level by measuring weighed and irradiated hornblende and biotite monitor standards using GLO-1 glauconite to define a calibration curve for argon signals versus abundance.",

On the magnetospheric side, the plasma density can change by several orders of magnitude (0.1cm-3 to 50cm-3). The current study investigates the role of dense magnetospheric plasma in the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause boundary.

A detailed suite of samples from the 1987 expedition were analyzed for helium isotopes, and similar detailed helium measurements were completed by the WHOI helium laboratory in 2013 at the same sample locations. This has allowed us to make a detailed comparison with the earlier 1987 work and assess the evolution of the extensive EPR 3He plume over the intervening 26 years. Additional information concerning the time scale for evolution of the plume comes from 1987 RAFOS float tracks, which show that the average westward transport in the core of the plume is about 0.3 cm/s. This translates to about 30 years for the hydrothermal helium from the EPR to reach the distal part of the plume at 150⁰W. While the δ3He profiles out at 150⁰W are essentially unchanged over 26 years, profiles closer to the EPR axis show significant changes. These differences may be due to oceanographic effects, or may reflect temporal changes in the hydrothermal input on the EPR axis.",

            "abstract": "In typical reflection processing, PdP phases (P wave reflected from a depth d) for several shot- receiver pairs, with the same midpoint, are stacked after applying moveout corrections (adjustments that move the PdP phases to the correctzero offset delay time). Moveout corrections are dependent on the average velocity to the given depth. The correct average velocity is considered that which produces largest stacked amplitude for the given phase. For three component reflection data, reflected P-to-S converted (PdS) phases are also stacked. Stacking the PdS phases requires estimates of the Vp/Vs ratio to a given depth; again by determining the value that results in the largest stacked amplitude. This method finds the average velocities over a large areas but fails to model small near surface velocity anomalies. These variations in velocity are replaced with shot and receiver static corrections, which are time delays at the shot and receiver to correct for slow velocities in a variable “weathered layer”.Methods to estimate the static corrections due to topography and for P-phases are well developed, but methods to compute static corrections for PdS phases can be problematic. We have adapted the receiver function (RF) method typically used to estimate Vp/Vs ratio and depth to the Moho from Moho Pds phases. As with RFs, we are using deconvolution of the radial component of the reflected seismogram by the vertical component seismogram (that contains mostly PdP phases) to isolate weathered layer converted phases and reverberations (PdPwS, PdPSwS, and PdPPwS phases, where w is the depth of the weathered layer). Similarly, we deconvolve the vertical component seismograms by the radial to isolate weathered layer phases from the PdS phase ending in P (PdSwP, PdSSwP and PdSPwP). These phases are weak in individual seismograms, but we can stack all the RFs computed for a common receiver gather (data from all shots recorded at one receiver) to enhance these phases.",

Groundwater has been shown to sustain tree growth and transpiration in arid and semi-arid ecosystems during drought, yet this relationship has yet to be extensively explored in mesic environments. This research aims to investigate groundwater-tree interactions in a north temperate forest in northern Wisconsin with attention to drought stress. We question if trees in areas of shallow groundwater with lower inter-annual variability will have higher and more consistent tree growth rates during drought conditions. Historic water table measurements monitored in the Trout Lake watershed include a decline in groundwater levels by ~1 m caused by a prolonged drought from 2006-2013. Within the watershed, we examined tree growth response between wet and dry years across sites covering a 1-9 m depth to groundwater gradient over the past 30 years. Combined with remotely sensed vegetation indices and tree core chronologies, we show regions and individual trees influenced by groundwater depth variability, respectively. Generally, vegetation indices and tree growth rates were higher during years of shallower spring and summer groundwater. By exploring the influences of shallow groundwater on tree growth in temperate forests, groundwater conferred drought resistance may be mapped for sustainable management.",

            "abstract": "Andean deformation and basin evolution in the Malargüe fold-thrust belt of western Argentina (34–36°S) has been dominated by basement faults influenced by pre-existing Mesozoic rift structures of the hydrocarbon-rich Neuquen basin. However, the basement structures diverge from classic inversion structures, and the associated retroarc basin system shows a complex Mesozoic-Cenozoic history of mixed extension and contraction, along with an enigmatic early Cenozoic stratigraphic hiatus. New results from balanced structural cross sections (supported by industry seismic, well data, and surface maps), U-Pb geochronology, and foreland deposystem analyses provide improved resolution to examine the duration and kinematic evolution of Andean mixed-mode deformation. The basement structures form large anticlines with steep forelimbs and up to >5 km of structural relief. Once the propagating tips of the deeper basement faults reached cover strata, they fed slip to shallow thrust systems that were transported in piggyback fashion by newly formed basement structures, producing complex structural relationships. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages for the 5–7 km-thick basin fill succession reveal shifts in sedimentation pathways and accumulation rates consistent with (1) local basement sources during Early–Middle Jurassic back-arc extension, (2) variable cratonic and magmatic arc sources during Late Jurassic–Cretaceous postrift thermal subsidence, and (3) Andean arc and thrust-belt sources during irregular Late Cretaceous–Cenozoic shortening. Although pulses of flexural subsidence can be attributed to periods of fault reactivation (inversion) and geometrically linked thin-skinned thrusting, fully developed foreland basin conditions were only achieved in Late Cretaceous and Neogene time. Separating these two contractional episodes is an Eocene–lower Miocene (roughly 40–20 Ma) depositional hiatus within the Cenozoic succession, potentially signifying forebulge passage or neutral to extensional conditions during a transient retreating-slab configuration along the southwestern margin of South America.",

            "abstract": "Climate change research has largely focused on the biophysical, economic, and political aspects of the phenomenon, its projected impacts, and the possibilities for adaptation (Carey et al. 2014; Castree et al. 2014). In the classroom, too, climate change is generally presented as a scientific, technological, political, and economic challenge. However, defining climate change as physical challenge, divorced from its cultural causes and responses, forecloses some pathways of inquiry and limits the possibilities for adaptation (Adger et al. 2013). Recent perspectives by the environmental historian Mark Carey and colleagues (2014) and by the geographer Noel Castree and colleagues (2014) contend that ethnographic, narrative, social scientific, and humanistic insights are necessary additions to the climate change policy process and can contribute to deliberate, resilient responses to climate change. Among the humanistic insights needed are strategies and practices to maintain fortitude and persistence in the midst of dispiriting ecological trends. Students facing the “gloom and doom” of climate change data in environmental studies courses can experience negative states of mind such as denial, despair, burnout, and grief. Emerging research, however, demonstrates how contemplative practice can shift consciousness and promote resilience. Contemplative practices are those that consciously direct calm, focused attention. Such practices can build internal resilience, by promoting a greater sense of calm and well-being, decreasing stress, and sharpening focus and concentration. In addition, contemplative practices improve relationships with other people, through increasing compassion and flexibility in thinking. They also strengthen relationships with the surrounding world by increasing our ability to question, explore, and cope with rapid change and complexity. This presentation provides a context for incorporating contemplative practices, including mindfulness exercises, creative expression, and meditation, into the environmental studies classroom, and discusses how these practices can cultivate well-being and resilience in the face of climate change.",

            "abstract": "We are facing an unprecedented challenge in securing America's energy future. To address this challenge, increased biofuel crop production is needed. Second-generation biofuels are made from the by-products of intensive agriculture or from less-intensive agriculture on more marginal lands. The Southwestern U.S. Cotton Belt can play a significant role in this effort through a change from more conventional crops (like continuous cotton) to second-generation biofuel feedstocks (biomass sorghum and perennial grasses). We have established eddy covariance flux towers in producer fields in the Southern High Plains region. Among the four land uses compared, the net carbon uptake was the highest for the biomass sorghum field. During the year 2014, the biomass sorghum field gained approximately 672 gC m-2y-1. The next highest carbon uptake was recorded for the Old World Bluestem grass field, which was approximately 301 gC m-2y-1. The dominant land use in the region is cotton. While the forage sorghum and grass fields acted as net carbon sinks, the irrigated cotton field acted as a net carbon source to the atmosphere during the same period. The irrigated cotton field exhibited a net carbon loss of approximately 246 gC m-2y-1. In contrast, the dryland cotton field acted as a net carbon sink, with a total uptake of approximately 58 g C m-2y-1. The net primary production of the irrigated cotton field was higher than that of the dryland cotton field, yet the irrigated field was a significant carbon source to the atmosphere. This was due to conventional tillage practices combined with irrigation which enhanced the ecosystem respiration significantly compared to the dryland field. In 2014, an early spring cold front caused poor germination of seeds in the majority of the cotton fields in the region, including the eddy covariance site. This site was re-planted on 9 June, which shortened the growing season for cotton. This was also a contributing factor to this field being a net carbon source. When only seasonal data were considered (i.e, from planting to harvest), the biomass sorghum field was the largest net C sink (-668 g C m-2y-1) followed by the grassland field (-298 g C m-2y-1). Among the two cotton fields, the irrigated cotton field remained a net carbon source (38 g C m-2y-1), while the dryland field was a net carbon sink (-127 g C m-2y-1).",

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), currently under construction across the U.S., represents the most ambitious such effort to characterize ecology at the continental scale. When completed in 2017, NEON will begin a 30-year program to monitor the state of North American ecosystems at scores of independent sites by employing a combination of terrestrial and aquatic sensors, organismal, biogeochemical, and hydrological sampling conducted by field staff, and airborne remote-sensing imaging and spectroscopy. Simply building and bringing such complex, long-term monitoring networks online is, however, insufficient to produce a useful result: the science team must also confirm that the system fulfills its essential mission to generate accurate and uniform data from all sites over time. This is the role of Science Commissioning, the process which completes the construction stage by confirming that the system operates as designed before entering full operations. Ideally, Science Commissioning involves simply testing the completed system against all applicable science requirements. In the real world of large, complex networks, planners of Science Commissioning must grapple with several key questions: How can we verify that the measurements from a given subsystem reflect “truth”? How can we ensure that similar subsystems at different sites return equivalent results? How can we confirm that data from the same site remain comparable over long periods of time? How can we conduct meaningful tests on a large system in a reasonable amount of time and effort? We describe the specific strategies NEON is developing to meet these challenges and the implications for other large ecological monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of plate tectonics is enigmatic because of the lack of observations in the early Archean as well as the challenge of understanding how plates form. The damage theory of lithospheric weakening by grain-reduction provides a physical framework for plate generation. This model builds on grain-scale physics to describe planetary-scale processes, and is consistent with lab and field observations of polycrystalline rocks and lithospheric mylonites. Grain-damage accounts for the evolution of damage and healing by grain growth, hence predicts plate boundary formation and longevity, and how they depend on surface conditions. The establishment of global plate tectonics likely started between >4Ga and 2.7Ga, and may have taken over a billion years to develop. Under Earth-like conditions, grain-damage combined with intermittent Archean protosubduction produces persistent weak zones that accumulate into well developed plates by 3Ga. However, Venus' hotter surface promotes healing, suppresses damage and inhibits weak zone accumulation, which suggests why plate tectonics failed to spread on our sister planet. New work posits that interface damage is possibly suppressed at moderate grain-size; this induces a hysteresis loop wherein three equilibrium deformation branches coexist. These branches include a stable large-grain, weakly-deforming state in dislocation creep, a stable small-grain rapidly-deforming state in diffusion creep analogous to mylonites, and an unstable intermediate-grain state. At the right conditions, a lithosphere can acquire two stable deformation states characteristic of plate tectonics; i.e., both slowly deforming plate interiors and rapidly deforming plate boundaries can co-exist. Earth currently sits inside the hysteresis loop and can have coexisting deformation states, while Venus sits at the end of the loop where only the weakly deforming branch dominates. The hot post-Hadean Earth might have had peak deformation only on the weakly-deforming branch. However, with surface cooling, diffuse deformation zones could be de-stabilized toward the mylonitic, rapidly-deforming branch and thus transform into localized plate-boundaries. Thus the Earth’s initial surface cooling may itself have facilitated a bifurcation to a plate-tectonic state.",

It's not a mere profession for them; it's an obsession and way of life. By definition; they are scientists of earth, they care about earth as they have fallen in love with it. It wasn't just a feeling that rushed through their veins for an hour then dissipated; they decided to pursue their own lives for the sake of maintaining that of earth. Who share those attributes with geoscientists: lawyers; businessmen; retired brass? The MRW for this argument is: \"taking care of earth and its inhabitants\" plus all required skills to accomplish that.\nIndividuals with the mere skill of understanding and drafting laws, negotiating deals, making profits and accumulating money, and discipline don't have that characteristic as well. All those classes have certain attributes that qualify them to have great insight about how politics should be formulated, but none of them have the attributes geoscientists have embedded in their own nature. Lawyers, businessmen, and retired brass, as with all other professions, should be in the position to provide consultancy to the geoscientist politicians who take final decisions; they should not be the ones to make them.",

            "abstract": "Reanalysis datasets are potentially very valuable for otherwise data-sparse regions such as Africa and the Middle East. They are potentially useful for long-term climate and hydrologic analyses and, given their availability in real-time, they are particularity attractive for real-time hydrologic monitoring purposes (e.g. to monitor flood and drought events). Generally in data-sparse regions, reanalysis variables such as precipitation, temperature, radiation and humidity are used in conjunction with in-situ and/or satellite-based datasets to generate long-term gridded atmospheric forcing datasets. These atmospheric forcing datasets are used to drive offline land surface models and simulate soil moisture and runoff, which are natural indicators of hydrologic conditions. Therefore, any uncertainty or bias in the reanalysis datasets contributes to uncertainties in hydrologic monitoring estimates. In this presentation, we report on a comprehensive analysis that evaluates several modern-day reanalysis products (such as NASA’s MERRA-1 and -2, ECMWF’s ERA-Interim and NCEP’s CFS Reanalysis) over Africa and the Middle East region. We compare the precipitation and temperature from the reanalysis products with other independent gridded datasets such as GPCC, CRU, and USGS/UCSB’s CHIRPS precipitation datasets, and CRU’s temperature datasets. The evaluations are conducted at a monthly time scale, since some of these independent datasets are only available at this temporal resolution. The evaluations range from the comparison of the monthly mean climatology to inter-annual variability and long-term changes. Finally, we also present the results of inter-comparisons of radiation and humidity variables from the different reanalysis datasets.",

            "abstract": "The development of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) and its floodplain for navigation and flood control has been ongoing since the 18th century, with the most concerted efforts occurring as a result of the Flood Control Act (FCA) of 1928 following the Great Flood of 1927. The Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) Project that was spawned from the FCA of 1928 has produced a massive, comprehensive system for flood control and channel stabilization that includes levees, channel improvements, and floodways, as well as tributary reservoirs and other basin improvements. Additionally, the development of the river for safe and dependable navigation has generated a substantial engineering effort involving river training structures, meander cutoffs, and dredging. The historical, and present-day morphology of the LMR reflects an integration of all these engineering interventions (and the process-responses they have triggered in the fluvial system), combined with natural drivers of channel change and evolution, including floods and droughts, hurricanes, neotectonic activity, geologic outcrops, climate change, and relative sea-level rise. In response to the complex requirements in navigation, flood risk reduction, and environmental restoration, all with multiple stakeholders, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created the Mississippi River Geomorphology & Potamology (MRG&P) Program. The goals of the MRG&P are to advance the knowledge of the geomorphology of the LMR and to transfer this technology to improve and sustain long-term management of the system. The results presented herein come from several MRG&P studies. The historical river morphology, and particularly the sources and delivery of sediments have changed dramatically over the past two centuries. In this presentation, the changes in sediment sources, and the manner in which this sediment is delivered through the channel system from the early 1800s to present-day is described.",

            "abstract": "Blast fishing (using explosives to catch fish) causes extensive damage to coral reefs, especially in the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia. Subsistence fishermen and larger consortiums, often with criminal links, throw an explosive into a school of fish, killing all sea life within range. This unsustainable practice is becoming more prevalent, and threatens the protein supply of as many as a billion people. Ending blast fishing will require combined technical and societal methods aimed at both deterring the practice, and catching those responsible.\nOur work aims to significantly improve enforcement. We are re-purposing SST’s ShotSpotter gunshot detection system, (trusted and valued by police around the world), substituting hydrophones for the present microphones. Using multilateration and trained human reviewers, the system can give prompt blast alerts, location data, and acoustic waveforms to law enforcement officials.\nWe hope to establish a prototype system in Malaysia in 2015, and have already secured governmental approvals for installation and tests with local law enforcement. The Scubazoo media firm in Malaysia is working with resorts, dive operations, and celebrity sponsors, and is planning to produce videos to illustrate the severity of the problem to both governments and the public.\nBecause there is little hard data concerning the prevalence of blast fishing in either marine protected areas or open waters, the system can also indicate to the world the actual blast rates and patterns of use. The Teng Hoi environmental NGO in Hong Kong showed in 2004 that acoustic waves from typical bombs propagate on the order of 20 km, so an underwater locator system with a small number of sensors can feasibly cover a sizable coral region. Our present plans are to mount sensors on piers, buoys, and boats, but if possible we would also like to integrate with other existing acoustic arrays to strengthen the fight against blast fishing.",

            "abstract": "Rising temperatures in the subarctic are accelerating permafrost thaw and increasing methane (CH4) emissions from subarctic peatlands. Methanotrophs in these peatlands can consume/oxidize CH4, potentially mitigating CH4 emissions in these peatlands. Oxidation rates can exceed 90% of CH4 production in some settings, depending on O2 and CH4 availability and environmental conditions. Malhotra and Roulet identified 10 thaw stages in Stordalen Mire near Abisko, Sweden (68°21'N,18°49'E ) with variable vegetation, environmental conditions, and associated CH4 emissions. We investigated potential methane oxidation rates across these thaw stages. Peat cores were extracted from two depths at each stage and incubated in 350ml glass jars at in situ temperatures and CH4 concentrations. Headspace samples were collected from each incubation jar over a 48-hour period and analyzed for CH4 concentration using flame ionization detection gas chromatography (GC-FID). Oxidation rates ranged from <0.1 to 17 μg of CH4 per gram of dry biomass per day. Water table depth and pore water pH were the strongest environmental correlates of oxidation (sample size = 56, p < 0.001). The highest potential oxidation rates were observed in collapsing palsa sites and recently collapsed sedge-dominated open water sites near palsa mounds. Our results suggest that permafrost thaw induces high CH4 oxidation rates by creating conditions ideal for both methanogenic and methanotrophic microbial communities. Our results also reinforce the importance of incorporating transitional thaw stages in landscape level carbon budgets of thawing peatlands emphasized by Malhotra and Roulet. Forthcoming microbial analysis and stable isotope analysis will further elucidate the factors controlling methane oxidation rates at Stordalen Mire.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the amount of magmatism and occurrence of serpentinised mantle at rifted margins and oceanic ridges fundamentally depends on spreading rate and mantle potential temperature. Here we show that during continental extension the lower crustal strength exerts an additional fundamental control on the onset and amount of melting and serpentinisation and therefore the type of oceanization. Furthermore, using numerical modeling constrained by multi-channel seismic reflection and wide-angle data from the magma-poor margins of Brazil and Africa, we also show that it is possible to associate margin architectural styles to types of ocean-continent transitions. Observed margin architectural styles can be explained by a combination of extensional modes: core-complex, wide and narrow (Buck, 1991), with a fourth mode, sequential faulting, that accounts for conjugate margin asymmetry (Ranero & Perez-Gussinye, 2010, Brune et al., 2014). The prevalence of any of these modes during extension, which depends on lower crustal strength, controls mantle uplift velocity and hence the relative amounts and timing of melting and serpentinisation, and the character of the ocean-continent transition.",

            "abstract": "As the global climate warms, the height of the 0°C isotherm – aka the freezing level height (FLH) – rises, especially over mountainous regions. Over the past few decades, FLH in the tropical Andes Mountains of South America has been rising at a rate that is 2 to 3 times faster than would be expected considering the zonally-averaged upper troposphere temperature trends and the recent cooling of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures. Rising FLH could have devastating impacts in this region where most of the dry season runoff comes from seasonal snow melt and glacial melt. Yet, is unclear why FLH is rising so rapidly in this particular area and what the quantitative implications will be for tropical Andean water resources. Reanalysis products tend to disagree on the spatial pattern and strength of FLH changes which confounds the issue by making it difficult to uncover the driving mechanisms of these local changes in FLH. Indeed, there are several possible factors that may be contributing to the unprecedented rise in FLH over the Andes (above and beyond the normally expected effects of greenhouse gases) of which the most likely actors are: changes in the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean, changes in sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, shifts in the Hadley cell, indirect effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and recent recovery, and local thermodynamic land-atmosphere feedbacks. To better understand the changes in FLH, which will ultimately contribute to the effort to predict effects on Andean water resources, we analyze FLH in several forcing-separated integrations of the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOSCCM). By separating out the various forcings (greenhouse gases, sea surface temperatures, ozone depleting substances, volcanic eruptions, and solar fluctuations), we are able to develop hypotheses for mechanistic drivers of FLH changes which can be rigorously tested. These efforts will contribute to the understanding of climate change over the tropical Andes Mountains, and over South America more generally, while developing techniques and hypotheses that can be applied to the study of cryosphere environments in other mountainous regions.",

With limited efficacy of vaccines, it is important to device alternate methods to determine environmental conditions favorable for diarrheal diseases. Several vibrios (V. cholerae., V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus) have characteristic signatures that are associated with large scale climatic processes. The interactions of vibrios with humans eventually lead to outbreak of diseases. Here, using cholera as one of the signature diarrheal disease, we present a framework coupling social, hydrological and microbiological understanding with satellite remote sensing data to predict environmental conditions associated with outbreak of disease in several regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Hydroclimatic processes, primarily precipitation and temperature are found to be strongly associated with epidemic and episodic outbreak of cholera. We will present an algorithm to classify regions susceptible to risks of outbreak cholera using profile method in five epidemic regions of Mozambique, Central African Republic, Cameroon, South Sudan and Rwanda. Conditions for occurrence of cholera were detectable at least one month in advance. Using spatial land surface temperature (LST) data from satellites along with water accessibility data and population data, the implementation of the algorithm aid in classification of cholera risk regions.",

Such an infrastructure, as exemplified in EOSDIS, GEOSS, and NSF EarthCube, will provide a complete lifecycle of environmental data and ensures that data will smoothly flow among different phases of collection, preservation, integration, and analysis. Data archival centers, as the data integration units closest to data providers, serve as the source power to compile and integrate heterogeneous environmental data into this global infrastructure. This presentation discusses the interoperability challenges and practices of geosciences from the aspect of data archival centers, based on the operational experiences of the NASA-sponsored Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) and related environmental data management activities. Specifically, we will discuss the challenges to 1) encourage and help scientists to more actively share data with the broader scientific community, so that valuable environmental data, especially those dark data collected by individual scientists in small independent projects, can be shared and integrated into the infrastructure to tackle big science questions; 2) curate heterogeneous multi-disciplinary data, focusing on the key aspects of identification, format, metadata, data quality, and semantics to make them ready to be plugged into a global data infrastructure. We will highlight data curation practices at the ORNL DAAC for global campaigns such as BOREAS, LBA, SAFARI 2000; and 3) enhance the capabilities to more effectively and efficiently expose and deliver “big” environmental data to broad range of users and systems. Experiences and challenges with integrating large data sets via the ORNL DAAC’s data discovery and delivery Web services will be discussed.",

Basement deformation must be inferred based on the resulting surface observables. Geologic map patterns, thermochronometer cooling signals, and synorogenic sediment distribution in the northern Bolivian Andes strongly argue for displacement on large-scale basement thrust sheets. To show the relationship between basement deformation and surface observables such as mapped geology and thermochronometer cooling ages, we link a forward modeled balanced cross section to a 2-D thermokinematic model to compare predicted to measured cooling ages. Applying isostasy and erosion to sequentially deformed balanced cross sections links the growth of hinterland structures to the developing foreland basins and highlights subsurface controls on surface geology. The cross section kinematics become velocity vectors by assigning ages to displacement amounts. A range of potential velocity vectors is then used to calculate heat transport, erosion, and rock cooling. Predicted cooling ages highlight that large basement ramps impart a significant and tractable cooling signal. This signal is the most visible in the across strike pattern of cooling ages for each system (zircon fission track, apatite fission track and apatite (U-Th)/ He). The pronounced, predicted cooling age pattern generated by large basement thrust sheets match measured ages across the northern Bolivian Andes strongly suggesting basement deformation similar to that show in balanced cross sections.",

Low-frequency spectral level, corner frequency, and the high-frequency spectral slope are often measured and combined to make inferences about physical parameters such as stress drop and radiated energy. Based on theoretical models (e.g., Brune, 1970), some quantitative, but model-dependent, relations have been established between far-field spectra and such physical parameters. Numerical simulations of dynamic rupture, of either artificial fixed rupture speed (Madariaga,1976, Kaneko and Shearer, 2014) or physically spontaneous models, have extended the scope of available models.\nRupture processes based upon rate and state frictional laws with dynamic weakening have been found from simulations to exhibit two different modes: expanding crack and self-healing rupture, which result in distinctly different shapes for the slip velocity function. In the expanding crack mode, a fault keeps slipping everywhere within the rupture zone until arrested by a strong stopping phase coming from the unbroken edges of the fault. Strong high-frequency energy can be radiated from such a stopping phase. However in the self-healing mode, rupture occurs as a slip pulse controlled by the local frictional stress rather than by rupture cessation signals.\nModels with spontaneous propagation and stopping of rupture, both in expanding crack or self-healing modes, may improve our understanding of the relationship between spectral parameters and the physical parameters of rupture. We use a simplified model of rupture propagating and stopping spontaneously, in expanding crack and self-healing modes, to investigate the relationship of spectral slope and corner frequency to rupture properties. We find that the self-healing rupture mode may induce double corner frequency spectral shapes and increase the spherically averaged corner frequency.",

It is to determine key features of the host rocks, mineralogical changes and alteration zones related to this mineralization. Halilar area is located about 25-30 km NE of Edremit in Balikseir district (NW Turkey). This area contains Halilar group that overlies pre-Late Triassic metamorphic rocks and Permian limestone in the surrounding areas. This Halilar group consists of Bagcagiz and Sakarkaya Formations; later intruded by Duztarla granitic rocks. The base metal deposits at study area represent locally Cu-Pb with some Zn vein type deposits. These deposits restricted to fault gouge zone directed NE-SW as well as occurred at the lower boundary of Bagcagiz and Duztarla granite. It also closely associated with intense hydrothermal alteration within brecciation, and quartz stockwork veining. The mineral assemblage includes chalcopyrite, galena, and some sphalerite, with covellite, and goethite in an abundant gangue of quartz and pyrite. Paragenetic relationships reveal three stages of mineralization; pre-ore, ore, and supergene. Wall-rock hydrothermal alteration includes pervasive silicification, sulfidation, carbonatization, and selective chloritization, sericitization and muscovitization.\nThe geochemical studies refer to the altered samples have high CIA relative to the least altered rocks. The relationship between Na2O and K2O with the Ishikawa alteration index refers to the data plot close to chlorite/sericite. Also, based on alteration box plotting (Ishikawa alteration index vs. chlorite-carbonate-pyrite index), they mostly plotted in the field of the hydrothermal alteration close to chlorite and pyrite minerals with more hydrothermal trends; Intense sericite-chlorite ± pyrite alteration, chlorite ± sericite ± pyrite alteration, and sericite-carbonate alteration.",

            "abstract": "Recent discoveries of emissions at four and five times the electron cyclotron frequency in aurora occuring under daylit conditions motivated the modification of radio receivers at South Pole Station, Antarctica, to measure fine structure of such emissions during two consecutive austral summers, 2013-4 and 2014-5. The experiment recorded 347 emission events over 376 days of observation. The seasonal distribution of these events revealed that successively higher harmonics require higher solar zenith angles for occurrence, as expected if they are generated at locations where the upper hybrid frequency matches the cyclotron harmonic, which for higher harmonics requires higher electron densities which are associated with higher solar zenith angles. Detailed examination of 21 cases in which two harmonics occur simultaneously showed that only rarely, about ten percent of the time, are the frequencies of the fine structures of the emissions in exact integer ratio (e.g., 3:2, 4:3, or 5:4 depending on which combination of harmonics is observed). In the remaining approximately ninety percent of the cases, the higher harmonic occurred at a lower ratio than the appropriate integer ratio, as expected if the harmonics are generated independently at their separate matching conditions in the bottomside ionosphere, where the upper hybrid frequency increases with altitude while the gyroharmonics decrease with altitude. (The bottomside is the most likely source of the emissions, since from there the mode converted Z-modes have access to ground-level.) Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant mechanism for the higher harmonics is independent generation at locations where the upper hybrid frequency matches each harmonic, i.e., at a separate source altitude for each harmonic. Generation of higher harmonics through coalescence of lower harmonic waves explains at most a small minority of events.",

The Multiscale Finite Volume method (MsFV) is employed to approximate the microscale concentration field defined in terms of macroscopic or global degrees of freedom, together with local interpolator and corrector functions capturing microscopic spatial variability. The macroscopic mass balance relations for the MsFV global degrees of freedom are coupled with the macroscopic model, resulting in a global problem for the simultaneous time-stepping of all macroscopic degrees of freedom throughout the domain. We employ a hybrid time-stepping scheme stemming from the local-global decomposition, for which the global time-stepping problem is solved using a larger time-step than the local interpolator and corrector problems.\nThe hybrid coupling is formulated by applying both micro and macroscale models over overlapping subdomains of the simulation domain, with the overlap denoted as the handshake subdomain Ωhs, over which continuity of concentration and transport fluxes between models is enforced. Continuity of concentration is enforced by posing a restriction relation between models over Ωhs. Continuity of fluxes is enforced by prolongating the macroscopic model fluxes across the boundary ∂Ωhs to microscopic resolution.\nWe illustrate the proposed hybrid MsFV scheme by solving a contaminant transport problem in fractured media with highly localized homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.",

            "abstract": "One significant way that climate influences orogenic evolution is by modulating glacial erosion. At mid-latitudes it is hypothesized that this climate-tectonic interplay is so strong that a “glacial buzzsaw” acting throughout the Quaternary outpaced tectonic uplift in most mountain belts and concentrated topography in a zone defined by the bounds of ELA fluctuation. Less attention has been paid to how the buzzsaw might manifest itself at low latitudes, where many mountain belts are just high enough to have been glaciated at the LGM but today sit well below the ELA. We have focused on the glacial history of Costa Rica and Taiwan, where we find evidence of ice cap erosion coincident with low-relief landscapes near the LGM ELA. Previous attempts to understand the formation of these perched, low-relief landscapes has mostly concerned interactions between fluvial erosion and geodynamics. Our work aims instead to describe the role that glacial erosion played in the evolution of these landscapes, and how they fit in the buzzsaw paradigm.\nAt Cerro Chirripó in Costa Rica we use 10-Be surface exposure age dating of moraine boulders and scoured bedrock, field mapping, and remote sensing to constrain the timing, areal extent, and pattern of glacial erosion. We made similar observations of ice extent at Nanhudashan in Taiwan, where surface exposure age dating has previously been applied to glacial landforms (e.g. Hebenstreit et al., 2011; Siame et al., 2007). In Costa Rica, our 10-Be dates from scoured bedrock near the highest peak and terminal/lateral moraines show signs of ice-cap erosion until 22 ka. Similar arguments for LGM ice cap erosion have been made for Nanhudashan. Regional climate simulations (WRF) further constrain the timing and spatial extent of glaciation in these places, and the combination of field data and climate modeling will inform estimates of the magnitude of glacial erosion on perched landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Observed changes in the surface elevation of the Greenland ice sheet are caused by ice dynamics, basal elevation change, surface mass balance (SMB) variability, and by compaction of the overlying firn. The latter two contributions are quantified here using a firn model that includes compaction, meltwater percolation, and refreezing. The model is forced with surface mass fluxes and temperature from a regional climate model for the period 1960-2014. The model results agree with observations of surface density, density profiles from 62 firn cores, and altimetric observations from regions where ice-dynamical surface height changes are likely small. We find that the firn layer in the high interior is generally thickening slowly (1-5 cm y-1). In the percolation and ablation areas, firn and SMB processes account for a surface elevation lowering of up to 20-50 cm y-1. Most of this firn-induced marginal thinning is caused by an increase in melt since the mid-1990s, and partly compensated by an increase in the accumulation of fresh snow around most of the ice sheet. The total firn and ice volume change between 1980 and 2013 is estimated at -3900 ± 1030 km3 due to firn and SMB, corresponding to an ice-sheet average thinning of 2.32 ± 0.61 m. Most of this volume decrease occurred after 1995. The computed changes in surface elevation can be used to partition altimetrically observed volume change into surface mass balance and ice-dynamically related mass changes.",

Despite the consistency in the projected surface warming rate relative to the globe, significant inter-model spread is found in the overall magnitude of Arctic surface temperature change, which leads to large inter-model spread in the simulation of surface radiative properties. The goal of this presentation is to determine the biases in the representation of the Arctic surface radiation budget seasonal cycle and discover the physical processes that explain the significant spread in projected Arctic warming. First, biases in the simulated Arctic surface radiation budget seasonal cycle within several CMIP5 climate models participating in the Historical forcing scenario are evaluated with respect to the CERES-SFC-EBAF and C3M data products. Next, the equations for longwave and shortwave cloud radiative forcing are decomposed using an independent column approximation (ICA) to identify which factors are driving changes to the annual cycle of cloud radiative forcing as well as what terms are contributing to the inter-model spread in the simulation of the surface energy budget. A multiple linear regression methodology is applied to the results of the ICA analysis using four atmospheric state variables as predictors: surface pressure, lower tropospheric stability, sea-ice concentration, and surface temperature. The impact of thermodynamics, atmospheric dynamics, and cloud-sea ice interactions on the annual cycle of cloud radiative effect will be determined.",

Migration and transport of silicate melts in the earth’s crust and at its surface generally occur at sub-liquidus temperature regimes where they are subject to non-isothermal and non-equilibrium crystallization. To date, rheological data at sub-liquidus temperatures are scarce. In such dynamic situations heat capacities, latent heats of phase changes, viscous heating, thermal advection and thermal inertia of the apparatus are all potential factors in determining the thermal regime. Yet thermal characterisation of non- equilibrium conditions are absent, hampered by the inconvenience of recording in situ sample temperature during dynamic rheological measurements.\nHere we present a new experimental setup for in situ sample temperature monitoring in high temperature rheometry. We overcome the limitation of hardwired thermocouples during sample deformation by employing wireless data transmitters directly mounted onto the rotating spindle, immersed in the sample. This adaptation enables in situ, real-time, observations of the thermal regime of crystallising, deforming lava samples under the transient and non-equilibrium crystallization conditions expected in lava flows in nature. We present the apparatus calibration procedure, assess the experimental uncertainty in viscosity measurements and discuss experimental data investigating the dynamic, rheologic and thermal evolution of lavas in both temperature step and continuous cooling experiments.",

            "abstract": "Many studies of microbially mediated aerobic methane oxidation in oceanic environments have examined the many different factors that control the rates of oxidation. However, there is debate on how quickly methane is oxidized once a microbial population is established and what factor(s) are limiting in these types of environments. These factors include the availability of CH4, O2, trace metals, nutrients, and the density of cell population. Limits to these factors can also control the temporal aspects of a methane oxidation event. In order to look at this process in its entirety and with higher temporal resolution, a mesocosm incubation system was developed with a Dissolved Gas Analyzer System (DGAS) coupled with a set of analytical tools to monitor aerobic methane oxidation in real time. With the addition of newer laser spectroscopy techniques (cavity ringdown spectroscopy), stable isotope fractionation caused by microbial processes can also be examined on a real time and automated basis. Cell counting, trace metal, nutrient, and DNA community analyses have also been carried out in conjunction with these mesocosm samples to provide a clear understanding of the biology in methane oxidation dynamics. This poster will detail the techniques involved to provide insights into the chemical and isotopic kinetics controlling aerobic methane oxidation. Proof of concept applications will be presented from seep sites in the Hudson Canyon and the Sleeping Dragon seep field, Mississippi Canyon 118 (MC 118). This system was used to conduct mesocosm experiments to examine methane consumption, O2 consumption, nutrient consumption, and biomass production. ",

Although higher resolution can be achieved using regional climate models for dynamical downscaling, further downscaling is often required. The final resolution gap is often closed with a combination of spatial interpolation and bias correction, which constitutes a form of statistical downscaling. We use this technique to downscale regional climate model data and evaluate its skill in reproducing extreme events.\nWe downscale output from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) dataset from its native 50-km spatial resolution to the 4-km resolution of University of Idaho's METDATA gridded surface meterological dataset, which derives from the PRISM and NLDAS-2 observational datasets. We operate on the major variables used in impacts analysis at a daily timescale: daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity, pressure, solar radiation, and winds.\nTo interpolate the data, we use the patch recovery method from the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) regridding package. We then bias correct the data using Kernel Density Distribution Mapping (KDDM), which has been shown to exhibit superior overall performance across multiple metrics.\nFinally, we evaluate the skill of this technique in reproducing extreme events by comparing raw and downscaled output with meterological station data in different bioclimatic regions according to the the skill scores defined by Perkins et al in 2013 for evaluation of AR4 climate models.\nWe also investigate techniques for improving bias correction of values in the tails of the distributions. These techniques include binned kernel density estimation, logspline kernel density estimation, and transfer functions constructed by fitting the tails with a generalized pareto distribution.",

            "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges that face Earth scientists is the resource discovery, access, and sharing in a desired fashion. EarthCube is targeted to enable geoscientists to address the challenges by fostering community-governed efforts that develop a common cyberinfrastructure for the purpose of collecting, accessing, analyzing, sharing and visualizing all forms of data and related resources, through the use of advanced technological and computational capabilities. Here we design an Enterprise Architecture (EA) for EarthCube to facilitate the knowledge management, communication and human collaboration in pursuit of the unprecedented data sharing across the geosciences. The design results will provide EarthCube a reference framework for developing geoscience cyberinfrastructure collaborated by different stakeholders, and identifying topics which should invoke high interest in the community. The development of this EarthCube EA framework leverages popular frameworks, such as Zachman, Gartner, DoDAF, and FEAF. The science driver of this design is the needs from EarthCube community, including the analyzed user requirements from EarthCube End User Workshop reports and EarthCube working group roadmaps, and feedbacks or comments from scientists obtained by organizing workshops. The final product of this Enterprise Architecture is a four-volume reference document: 1) Volume one is this document and comprises an executive summary of the EarthCube architecture, serving as an overview in the initial phases of architecture development; 2) Volume two is the major body of the design product. It outlines all the architectural design components or viewpoints; 3) Volume three provides taxonomy of the EarthCube enterprise augmented with semantics relations; 4) Volume four describes an example of utilizing this architecture for a geoscience project.",

A good understanding of temperature changes across the land-air boundary is of great importance to our understanding of the transportation and storage of the earth system energy and the interaction between land thermal environment and boundary layer development. It is also critical to the approach to climate reconstruction based on borehole temperatures. However, there are very few reports on long-term simultaneous observation of temperature changes across air, ground surface, soil, and rock. A unique observatory, the Land-Air Thermal Environmental Observatory of the Xi’an Jiaotong University (LATEOX) in central China, has been constructed to fill this observational data gap. From top down, it consists of two rooftop meteorological masts 25 m and 50 m above ground surface respectively, a standard ground based meteorological station, four 5-m multi-layer soil temperature/moisture sensor arrays, and more specially, a 500-m deep observation borehole. Since its commencement in June 2012, the observatory has been measuring air temperature, soil temperature, rock temperature, air humidity, air pressure, precipitation, radiation, wind speed and direction, daylight duration, net radiation, soil moisture, carbon dioxide concentration, and atmospheric electricity at a 6-second data sampling rate in a typical university campus environment. The temperature of the 500m borehole is logged on a two-week basis. Preliminary analysis of the LATEOX data shows a clear signal of urban heat island effect and seasonal variabilities in the soil thermal diffusivity and energy flux.",

This is a >100 factor reduction in sample size over conventional methods, four times over more common Delta series instruments. We investigated in triplicate 115 samples of submarine MORB glasses ranging from water-poor (0.1-0.2wt%) to water-rich (1.2-1.5wt%). These samples were previously investigated for major and trace elements, radiogenic isotopes; a large subset of these samples coming from the FAZAR expedition were studied previously by FTIR for water concentration. We also ran samples previously studied by the conventional off-line technique: MORB glass including those from the Easter Platform and the Alvin 526-1 standard (0.2wt% H2O). We observe excellent 1:1 correspondence (1.02x+0.02, R2=0.94) of wt% water by FTIR and TCEA suggesting complete extraction of water and no dependence on water concentration. We measure 51‰ total range in D/H that correlates with all other chemical and isotopic indicators of mantle enrichment, with the heaviest values occurring in the most enriched samples. When used uncorrected values of H2 gas run against H2 gas of known composition, this range agrees nicely with previous D/H range for MORB (-30 to -90‰), measured for samples run conventionally. Uncorrected analyses of Alvin glass 526-1 gives -66‰. When run against SMOW, SLAP and -41‰ water sealed in silver cups, the range is shifted by -15‰; when standardization is done by with three commonly used mica standards as is done most commonly in different labs, the range is shifted downward by -30-32‰. There are no isotopic offsets related to total water or D/H range requiring different slope or non-linear correction. The NBS30 mica standard has been recently shown to be heavier and more heterogeneous than previously thought, and older conventional methods that relied on Pt reduction unreliable. Based on these new TCEA results, the D/H values of MORB and mantle samples may need to be revised to lighter values by 15‰.",

To address this challenge we propose a new approach, a separate fjord model using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, or FDG. The goal of this project is to build a separate, high-resolution module for use in Earth System Models (ESMs) to realistically represent the fjord bathymetry, coastlines, exchanges with the outside ocean, circulation and fine-scale processes occurring within the fjord and interactions at the ice shelf interface.\nFDG is currently at the first stage of development. The DG method provides FDG with high-order accuracy as well as geometrical flexibility, including the capacity to handle non-conforming adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the processes occurring near the ice-sheet/ocean interface without introducing prohibitive computational costs. Another benefit of this method is its excellent performance on multi- and many-core architectures, which allows for utilizing modern high performance computing systems for high-resolution simulations. The non-hydrostatic model of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation will account for the stationary ice-shelf with sub-shelf ocean interaction, basal melting and subglacial meltwater influx and with boundary conditions at the surface to account for floating sea ice. The boundary conditions will be provided to FDG via a flux coupler to emulate the integration with an ESM.\nInitially, FDG will be tested for the Sermilik Fjord settings, using real bathymetry, boundary and initial conditions, and evaluated against available observations and other model results for this fjord. The overarching goal of the project is to be able to resolve the ice-sheet/ocean interactions around the entire coast of Greenland and two-way coupling with regional and global climate models such as the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), Community Earth System Model (CESM) or Advanced Climate Model for Energy (ACME).",

            "abstract": "Chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) results from non-photochemical quenching during plant photosynthesis under excessive radiation. We explore the relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and CF using a process ecosystem model, which separates a vegetation canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups and simulates the total canopy GPP as the sum of sunlit and shaded leaf GPP. Using GOME-2 and GOSAT data acquired in 2010 over the global land surface, we found that measured CF signals gridded in 1 degree resolution are well correlated with simulated total GPP and its sunlit and shaded components, but the correlation coefficients (R) are largest for the sunlit GPP and smallest for shaded GPP. The seasonal R2 values vary from 0.57 to 0.74, 0.58 to 0.71, and 0.48 to 0.56 for sunlit, total and shaded GPP, respectively. The significance levels for these correlations are all greater than p<0.01. Averaged over the globe, the total simulated shaded GPP is 39% of the total GPP. Theoretically, CF from vegetation comes mostly from sunlit leaves. The significant correlation between measured canopy-level CF and the shaded GPP is likely due to the correlation between shaded and sunlit GPP as both increase with leaf area index. Our simulation confirms the validity of using canopy-level CF measurements to assess the total GPP as the first approximation, although these measurements are a consistently better indicator of sunlit GPP than total GPP. In previous studies, the R2 values for the correlation between CF and total GPP were found to range from 0.76 to 0.88, 0.56 to 0.78, and 0.57 to 0.77 for MPI-BGC, MODIS and CASA model results, respectively. These values are similar or larger than those for sunlit GPP simulated in our study, but are considerably larger than those for total GPP in our study because the correlation for total GPP is contaminated by the inclusion of shaded GPP. All these three models use canopy total light use efficiency without considering the differences between sunlit and shaded leaves, and therefore they mostly capture spatio-temporal variations in sunlit GPP. We therefore argue that solar-induced CF measured from vegetation is a better proxy of sunlit GPP than the total GPP, and the use of CF data for assessing the terrestrial carbon cycle can be improved when sunlit and shaded GPP are modelled separately.",

            "abstract": "Barnes Ice Cap is a modern remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered much of North America during the Last Glacial Maximum. Moraine chronology shows that Barnes reached a quasi-equilibrium state about 1000 years ago and has been relatively stable since. The flat and low-elevation bedrock topography under Barnes implies that the accumulation area owes its existence to the ice cap itself. As a “self-sustaining” ice mass, Barnes is expected to be sensitive to climate and/or dynamical changes given the surface-elevation / mass-balance feedback. In this study, we combine historical observations (1960-1980) with new satellite and air-borne data (1995-2010) to drive a mass-balance model coupled to a transient full-Stokes thermo-mechanical model with an adaptive mesh geometry. The model is used to characterize the current state of the ice cap and to investigate its stability as a function of climate and internal ice dynamics. Thermo-mechanically coupled simulations show zones of locally enhanced ice flow that imprint themselves on the shape of the ice-cap. These simulations suggest that an additional heat source, such as refreezing of water at the base of the ice cap, is required to maintain temperate conditions where sliding is known to occur. Modelled dynamics highlight the influence of contrasting viscosities between Pleistocene and Holocene ice that affect the form and flow of the ice cap. On millennial timescales, the internal dynamics of the ice cap may lead to divergent evolution pathways even for a constant climate. Sensitivity experiments reveal that Barnes was in a delicate equilibrium with pre-industrial climate. An increase in air temperature of less than 0.2K or a decrease precipitation of less than 15%, relative to this climate, is enough to push the ice cap into an unstable regime. Based on recent observations of the equilibrium line altitude, Barnes is expected to disappear even with no additional warming.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and precise calibration of the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (GPTS) in absolute time is critical for resolving rates of geological and biological processes which in turn help constrain the underlying causes of those processes. Numerical calibration of the GPTS was traditionally carried out by interpolation between a limited number of 40Ar/39Ar dated volcanic ash deposits from superpositional sequences with well-defined magnetostratigraphies. More recently, the Neogene part of the GPTS has been calibrated using high-resolution astrochronological methods, however the application of these approaches to pre-Neogene parts of the timescale is controversial given the uncertainties in relevant orbital parameters this far back in time and differing interpretations of local cyclostratigraphic records. The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary interval is a good example, where various astronomical and 40Ar/39Ar calibrations have been proposed with varying degrees of agreement. The Denver Basin (Colorado, USA) contains one of the most complete stratigraphic sequences across the K/Pg boundary in the world, preserving evidence of bolide impact as well as biotic extinction and recovery in a thick stratigraphic package that is accessible by both core and outcrop. We present a series of high-precision U-Pb age determinations from interbedded volcanic ash deposits within a tightly constrained magnetobiostratigraphic framework across the K/Pg boundary in the Denver Basin. This new timeline provides a precise absolute age for the K/Pg boundary, constrains the ages of magnetic polarity Chrons C28 to C30, and provides a direct and independent test of early Paleogene astronomical and 40Ar/39Ar based timescales. Temporal calibration of fossil pollen evidence of the “fern spike” in the Denver Basin shows that plant extinctions peaked within ~50-500 years of the bolide impact and primary productivity recovered ~500-5000 years after the impact.",

            "abstract": "Shallow fault slip (< ~1km) during and immediately following earthquakes is poorly understood, largely because of challenges measuring deformation near a surface rupture. The need for better measurement is further motivated by an apparent deficit of shallow slip in regional source models of strike-slip earthquakes and by the suggestion that near-surface frictional heterogeneity over spatial scales of 100s of meters can control shallow fault slip. Here, we use a nascent mobile laser scanning technique to quantify with unprecedented detail the coseismic surface rupture and rapid post-seismic deformation from the 24 August, 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake. We infer shallow fault slip and find that both co- and post-seismic slip at depths of ~3-25 m significantly exceeds traditional measurements of surface displacements. There is no deficit in shallow slip: near-surface slip values are greater than maximum reported co-seismic fault slip values at depth. By ~ 1 month, afterslip along the southern portion of the fault accounted for as much shallow slip potency as the shallow co-seismic rupture on the northern portion. Further, we show that the afterslipping portion of the fault cuts across a ~3000 m thick sedimentary basin whereas the co-seismically ruptured portion does not. A rate and state friction model is consistent with the basin thickness, afterslip, and rock-sample mechanical measurements and strongly suggests that near-surface frictional heterogeneity controlled the distribution of coseismic and post-seismic shallow slip. In the future, we suggest that combining existing basin thickness data with active fault maps could provide more precise estimates of where surface rupture and/or afterslip may occur, both before, and in rapid response to, damaging earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "In Mexico, there are only two proxy records that provide information about the last interglacial. Lack of longer registers is a hindrance in understanding the effect of modern era global warming on the arid ecosystem of northern Mexico. We present a new orbital-scale record of hydrological changes occurred since the MIS 5 from the southern part of subtropical Mexico. This record is obtained from geochemistry of a 10 m long sediment core collected from central part of the Santiaguillo Basin. The age model is created with radiocarbon dates of sediments deposited over the last 27 cal ka and it incorporates a uniform sedimentation rate (calculated for the last 27 cal ka) for lower part of the core. Variation of runoff is reconstructed from Ti concentration and salinity of the water column is inferred from the abundance authigenic carbonates. Over the last 27 cal ka, this new record shows similar variations as that of our previous work done in sediment profiles collected from the littoral parts of the basin. We observe a first order positive correlation between the proxy records of runoff and lake water salinity with insolation values for the interpolated as well as the extrapolated parts of age model. The runoff record has orbital-scale similarities with autumn (September) insolation and variations in lake water salinity are comparable to summer (June) insolation. Santiaguillo Basin received more runoff (i.e. precipitation) during the intervals of higher autumn insolation and more carbonate deposition occurred (i.e. drought) during the intervals of higher summer insolation. During MIS 5, the hydrological variations were controlled by the insolation values. In general, MIS 4 and MIS 2 were intervals of more runoff and more carbonate deposition occurred during MIS 3. Comparison with other regional records suggests different geographic influences of NAM and Tropical Cyclones in orbital-scales.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a fundamental role in the chemistry of atmospheric oxidation and affect air quality and climate. Recent experiments have shown that formation of organic nitrates is a more important immediate sink of NOx than nitric acid in the rural continental locations. In particular, in regions with high emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), isoprene and monoterpene derived organic nitrates can be expected to control the fate of nitrogen oxides, and consequently the ozone production efficiency. Thus understanding of the complex production and loss processes of organic nitrates are required for determining the lifetime of NOx in the present day and in preindustrial times. Using the chemical transport model WRF-Chem, we investigate impacts of organic nitrate chemistry on the NOx and ozone budgets of the southeastern United States. We evaluate changes to the NOx budget in response to decreases in anthropogenic NOx emissions. The model has been updated with recent advances in representation of BVOC oxidation chemistry and deposition rates, including a detailed representation of organic nitrates. We compared simulations to measurements from the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) campaign in central Alabama in summer 2013 and examine the sensitivity to emission rates.",

Given the existence of operational weather and environmental prediction models and assimilation systems at Environment Canada, it makes sense to use these tools for greenhouse gas simulations. In this work, we describe the adaptations needed to reasonably simulate CO2 with a weather forecast model. The main challenges were the implementation of a mass conserving advection scheme, and the careful implementation of a mixing ratio defined with respect to dry air. The transport of tracers through convection was also added, and the vertical mixing through the boundary layer was slightly modified. With all these changes, the model conserves CO2 mass well on the annual time scale, and the high resolution (0.9 degree grid spacing) permits a good description of synoptic scale transport. The use of a coupled meteorological/tracer transport model also permits an assessment of approximations needed in offline transport model approaches, such as the neglect of water vapour mass when computing a tracer mixing ratio with respect to dry air.",

            "abstract": "Rain-induced flash floods are common events in regions close to the southern Andes, in north and central Chile. Rapid urban development combined to the changing climate and ENSO effects have resulted in an alarming proximity of flood-prone streams to densely populated areas in the Andean foothills, increasing the risk for cities and infrastructure. Simulations of rapid floods in these complex watersheds are particularly challenging, especially if there is insufficient geomorphological and hydrometeorological data.\n In the Quebrada de Ramón, an Andean stream that passes through a highly populated area in the east part of Santiago, Chile, previous events have demonstrated that sediment concentration, flow resistance, and the characteristic temporal and spatial scales of the hydrograph, are important variables to predict the arrival time of the peak discharge, flow velocities and the extension of inundated areas. The objective of this investigation is to improve our understanding of the dynamics of flash floods in the Quebrada de Ramón, quantifying the effects of these factors on the flood propagation.\nWe implement a two-dimensional model based on the shallow water equations (Guerra et al. 2014) modified to account for hyperconcentrated flows over natural topography. We evaluate events of specific return periods and sediment concentrations, using different methodologies to quantify the flow resistance in the channel and floodplains.\nThrough this work we provide a framework for future studies aimed at improving hazard assessment, urban planning, and early warning systems in urban areas near mountain streams with limited data, and affected by rapid flood events.\nWork supported by Fondecyt grant 1130940 and CONICYT/FONDAP grant 15110017.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate models (RCMs) are the primary source of high-resolution climate projections and it is of crucial importance to evaluate their ability to simulate extreme events under current climate conditions. Many extreme events are influenced by circulation features that occur outside, or on the edges of, RCM domains. Thus it is of interest to know\nwhether such dynamically controlled aspects of extremes are well represented by RCMs. This study assesses the relationship between upstream blocking and cold temperature extremes over North America in observations, reanalysis products (ERA-Interim, NARR) and RCMs (CanRCM4, CRCM5, HIRHAM5, RCA4).\nGeneralized extreme value distributions were fitted to winter minimum temperature (TNn) incorporating blocking frequency (BF) as a covariate, which has a significant influence on TNn. The magnitude of blocking influence in the RCMs is consistent with observations but the spatial extent varies. CRCM5 and HIRHAM5 reproduce the pattern of influence best compared to observations. CanRCM4 and RCA4 capture the influence of blocking in British Columbia and the northeastern United States but the extension of influence that is seen in observations and reanalysis, into the southern United States is not evident. The difference in the 20-year return value (20RV) of TNn between high and low BF indicates that\nblocking is associated with a decrease of up to 15°C in the 20RV over the majority of the United States and in western Canada. In northern North America the difference in the 20RV is positive as blocking is associated with warmer temperatures. The 20RVs are generally simulated well by the RCMs.",

Previous analysis has been performed, using Phobos 2 and Mars Global Surveyor, observations to determine the average location of the Martian bow shock and the magnetic pileup boundary (MPB). However, analysis of individual orbits shows that the location of these boundaries can be highly variable in response to the changing heliospheric environment, implying that an average boundary may not be as representative as finite thickness boundary layers. MAVEN has been in orbit and producing science observations since November 2014 providing a large number of orbits, approximately 5 per day, for the spacecraft to cross the induced boundaries during a wide range of heliospheric conditions. Using data from the Particle and Fields Package onboard the MAVEN spacecraft, we are able to determine the location and thickness of the bow shock and the MPB, during each orbit. Additionally, MAVEN’s orbit precesses such that we observe boundary crossings over a wide range of latitude and longitudes, important if there is any influence on the variability of the boundaries from the Martian crustal fields. Here we present a new model for the boundaries of the Martian magnetosphere, with a finite thickness to capture the variability of their location due to the changing solar wind environment.",

Europe may have become initially populated during the EPR when, possibly for the first time in the Pleistocene, vast and exploitable ecosystems were generated along the Danube-Po Gateway in the Balkan peninsula and northern Italy. These newly formed settings, characterized by low-lands with open grasslands and reduced woody cover during glacial/interglacial transitions, represented the closest analogues to the savanna environment to which several large mammals linked with hominins in a common food web were adapted and could use as a migratory corridor. We acknowledge that lack of evidence may not be a compelling argument, but the absence of the Jaramillo and out-of-sequence cosmogenic nuclide dates with wide error margins in key sections preclude the use of such evidence to substantiate the presence of humans (and presumably associated biostratigraphic markers) prior to the Jaramillo, and thus logically deny applying such conclusions to other systems.",

It is ideally co-produced by scientists and decision makers and creates rigorous and accessible products to meet the needs of stakeholders. (Report to the Secretary of the Interior, Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Science (ACCCNRS), March 30, 2015)\nDuring one 17 month period ending in 2013, three major reports on sea level rise from three highly respected science providers produced three divergent estimates of sea level rise. These reports collectively flummoxed the lay reader seeking direction for adaptation planning. Guidance documents soon emerged from state entities which caused further confusion. The City and County of San Francisco began developing \"Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning\" in 2013 at the direction of San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee (http://onesanfrancisco.org/staff-resources/sea-level-rise-guidance/). The first task in developing this Guidance was to convert these highly technical reports into \"actionable science.\" This required extensive expert elicitation to tease out their meaning and use value for decision making. This process, which resulted in detailed guidance on the use of SLR science in planning, is increasingly being called \"co-production.\"\nCo-production requires both scientist and decision-maker to hear the other’s perspective, reflect upon the decision-maker’s precise needs, and translate peer review science into lay language and practical advice for decision making. The co-production dynamic was the subject of extensive discussion in the federal Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Science. The ACCCNRS recommendations (https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/acccnrs) include not only the new definition of Actionable Science cited above, but also a \"How-To-Guide\" that outlines principles for successfully creating a co-production environment and case studies highlighting where this has worked to date.\nThis talk will summarize our state of understanding of \"actionable science\" and this new \"co-production\" dynamic within climate change science and planning, with focused reference on recent case studies, particularly San Francisco.\n ",

            "abstract": "We report the observation of two unusual positron density enhancements made inside an active thunderstorm by the Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) onboard a Gulfstream V aircraft in August 2009. ADELE recorded two count rate enhancements of 511 keV annihilation gamma rays, 35 seconds apart, that lasted approximately 0.2 seconds each. The enhancements were about a factor of 12 above background and had energy spectra consistent with clouds of positrons, approximately 1 km across, briefly surrounding the aircraft. A flat-plate antenna on the underside of the aircraft also recorded electrical activity during the positron enhancements. It is not clear how the positron clouds were created within the thunderstorm or whether the presence of the aircraft played a role in their production. In this presentation, we will show the ADELE data along with model fits of the positron spectra. We shall also discuss possible sources of the positron excesses.",

There is a vital need for forecasts to inform decision makers, both local and regional, and to help formulate the region’s climate change adaptation strategies. Here, we present a suite of different seasonal forecast models, both statistical and dynamical, for the EA region. Objective regionalization is performed for EA on the basis of interannual variability in precipitation in both observations and models. This regionalization is applied as the basis for calculating a number of standard skill scores to evaluate each model’s forecast accuracy. A dynamically linked Land Surface Model (LSM) is then applied to determine forecasted flows, which drive the Sudanese Hydroeconomic Optimization Model (SHOM). SHOM combines hydrologic, agronomic and economic inputs to determine the optimal decisions that maximize economic benefits along the Sudanese Blue Nile. This modeling sequence is designed to derive the potential added value of information of each forecasting model to agriculture and hydropower management. A rank of each model’s forecasting skill score along with its added value of information is analyzed in order compare the performance of each forecast. This research aims to improve understanding of how characteristics of accuracy, lead time, and uncertainty of seasonal forecasts influence their utility to water resources decision makers who utilize them.",

In order to truly understand these effects, a long, stable, and well-calibrated data record is required. Since 2000 and 2002, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites together with the e-Deep Blue aerosol retrieval algorithm have been providing such a data record.\nAfter a multi-year development effort, the production of both Aqua and Terra MODIS Collection 6 (C6) atmosphere products successfully completed earlier this year and the data was released to the public shortly thereafter. The C6 Deep Blue products (now enhanced Deep Blue or e-Deep Blue) have been significantly improved over the previous Collection 5.1 version.\nIn this poster we provide an overview of the latest C6 e-Deep Blue products and the improvements implemented since the previous collection including coverage over dark surfaces and updates to the Terra calibration. Validation results utilizing Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data are also summarized. We then use the C6 e-Deep Blue products from both Aqua and Terra to explore the spatial characteristics in addition to the seasonal and inter-annual variability of aerosols on both regional and global scales. We also use this as an opportunity to compare these results and investigate any differences found between the two instruments.",

            "abstract": "The causes of widespread magmatism and extension that affected the Pacific Northwest during the Eocene “Challis Event” are poorly understood. Two models that have been advanced to explain this activity are passage of a slab window (e.g., Haeussler et al., 2011) and rollback of the subducting Farallon slab following accretion of Siletzia (Schmandt and Humphreys, 2011). Both scenarios would have resulted in widespread magmatism but with different temporal patterns. Based on reconstructed plate motion vectors magmatism related to a slab window should produce a younging-to-the-NW pattern whereas magmatism associated with slab rollback should young to the S or SW. Existing dates on Eocene igneous units in NE Washington appear to show an overall younging to the SW, consistent with the slab rollback model. However, many of these dates (mainly K-Ar) have large uncertainties so we are conducting a U-Pb dating and geochemical survey of Eocene plutons across the region.\nAn initial set of zircon U-Pb ages (by LA-MC-ICP-MS) from five intrusions in east-central WA range from 50.7 – 46.7 Ma and young to the SW, a trend similar to that observed among Eocene rocks in the Idaho Batholith (Gaschnig et al., 2013). To further investigate this pattern we are dating an additional ten plutonic units that define a ~100 km SW-NE transect through NE WA. From NE to SW the units in this transect are (with dates from WA DNR mapping) as follows: Sheppard granite (undated), Herron Creek intrusion (51.4 +/- 1.9 Ma), Mt. Bonaparte pluton (52.8 +/- 2.6 Ma), Daisy Trail granite (49.9 +/- 0.3 Ma), Swimptkin Creek pluton (48.2 +/- 1.2 Ma), Moses pluton (48.6 +/- 1.2 Ma), Keller Butte granite (52.9 +/- 0.4 Ma), Johnny George plutonic complex (49.9 +/- 0.45 Ma), Manilla Creek (undated), and Swawilla Basin pluton (58.8 +/- 2.2 Ma). Results of this study should lead to a better understanding of the cause(s) of Challis magmatism and specifically its relationship to the ~50-48 Ma accretion of Siletzia.",

            "abstract": "Solid fuel cookstoves are used heavily in rural China for both residential cooking and heating purposes. Their use contributes significantly to regional emissions of several key pollutants, including carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and aerosol particles. The residential sector was responsible for approximately 36%, 46% and 81% of China’s total primary PM2.5, BC and OC emissions respectively in 2005 (Lei et al., 2011). These emissions have serious consequences for household air pollution, ambient air quality, tropospheric ozone formation, and the resulting population health and climate impacts.\nThis paper presents initial findings from the modeling component of a multi-disciplinary energy intervention study currently being conducted in Sichuan, China. The purpose of this effort is to quantify the impact of residential cooking and heating emissions on regional air quality and human health. Simulations with varying levels of residential emissions have been carried out for the whole of 2014 using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), a fully-coupled, “online” regional chemical transport model. Model output is evaluated against surface air quality measurements across China and compared with seasonal (winter and summer) ambient air pollution measurements conducted at the Sichuan study site in 2014. The model output is applied to available exposure—response relationships between PM2.5 and cardiopulmonary health outcomes. The sensitivity in different regions across China to the different cookstove emission scenarios and seasonality of impacts are presented. By estimating the mortality and disease burden risk attributable to residential emissions we demonstrate the potential benefits from large-scale energy interventions.\nLei Y, Zhang Q, He KB, Streets DG. 2011.

            "abstract": "In this study, we compare the aluminum and boron coordination of glass samples recovered from piston-cylinder experiments carried out at 1 to 3 GPa and near to their ambient glass transition temperature (Tg), which we have found gives a more accurate picture of high pressure structural changes than experiments involving quenching from above the liquidus, as large pressure drops can occur in the latter. Aluminoborosilicate glasses with excess modifier (Ca, La and Y- aluminoborosilicate) quenched from melts at 1-3 GPa were studied with B-11 and Al-27 MAS NMR to assess relative effects on two different network cations. Structural changes in the Y-aluminoborosilicate are dramatic, going from mostly AlO4 at low pressure to mostly AlO5 and AlO6 at 3 GPa. Large increases in BO4 (vs. BO3) are also seen. Mg-aluminosilicate glasses, both tectosilicate (Mg2Al4Si6O20) and with excess modifier composition (Mg3Al2Si6O18) quenched from melts at 1-3 GPa pressure were studied with Al-27 MAS NMR. In contrast to our previous study (Bista et al., Am. Min., in press) of jadeite glass, where only 0.5% of fivefold aluminum was seen in glass recovered from 3 GPa, five and six fold aluminum species increase significantly with increasing pressure in both Mg aluminosilicate glass compositions studied here. We observe that the tectosilicate Mg aluminosilicate glass has more higher coordinated aluminum than the excess modifier containing composition in the pressure range in our study. In the previous study (Bista et al., in press) of jadeite and calcium aluminosilicate (Ca3Al2Si6O18) glasses, 6-8% densification was observed in glasses recovered from 3 GPa. In this study of Mg aluminosilicate glasses, we observe 12% densification in glasses recovered from 3 GPa. Both types of observation confirm that structural and density changes with pressure are enhanced by higher field strength modifier cations, and will be especially important in Mg- and Fe-rich mantle melts.\n ",

            "abstract": "We often demand information and data to be accessible over the web at no cost, and no longer do we expect to spend time labouriously compiling data from myriad sources with frustratingly-different formats. Instead, we increasingly expect convenience and consolidation. Recent advances in web-enabled technologies and cyberinfrastructure are answering those calls by providing data tools and resources that can transform undergraduate education. By freeing up valuable classroom time, students can focus upon gaining deeper insights and understanding from real-world data.\nGeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org) is a map-based data discovery and visualisation tool developed at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. GeoMapApp promotes U-Learning by working across all major computer platforms and functioning anywhere with internet connectivity, by lowering socio-economic barriers (it is free), by seamlessly integrating thousands of built-in research-grade data sets under intuitive menus, and by being adaptable to a range of learning environments – from lab sessions, group projects, and homework assignments to in-class pop-ups.\nGeoMapApp caters to casual and specialist users alike. Contours, artificial illumination, 3-D displays, data point manipulations, cross-sectional profiles, and other display techniques help students better grasp the content and geospatial context of data. Layering capabilities allow easy data set comparisons. The core functionality also applies to imported data sets: Student-collected data can thus be imported and analysed using the same techniques.\nA new Save Session function allows educators to preserve a pre-loaded state of GeoMapApp. When shared with a class, the saved file allows every student to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same starting point from which to begin their data explorations. Examples of built-in data sets include seafloor crustal age, earthquake locations and focal mechanisms, analytical geochemistry, ocean water physical properties, US and international geological maps, and satellite imagery. Student-generated data sets can be imported in Excel, ASCII, shapefile, and gridded format. Base maps can be saved for posters and publications. A wide range of undergraduate enquiry-driven education modules for GeoMapApp is already available at SERC.",

Challenges arise when meteorological stations are sparsely distributed such as in much of the tropics including cerrado Brazil—one of the largest agriculturally-important areas in the tropics. Currently available gridded climate datasets are coarse (i.e. 2.5º to 0.5º), heavily-interpolated and hence not adequate for regional/local scale assessments of agricultural impacts from climate. In this context, we aim to develop a new method for gridded standard retrieval of a number of agriculturally-relevant near-surface air temperature indicators. We employ Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived land surface temperature, vertical temperature profile, meteorological station data, and other biophysical data. We will contrast the accuracy of different air temperature derivation approaches including multiple linear regression, machine learning, the use of vegetation indices to proxy for air temperature variation, and physical approaches based on surface energy balance parametrizations. Our method aims to control for potential biases in surface temperatures due to differences in land cover types, changes in vegetation cover, and variation in plant growth. Satellite-derived near-surface air temperature datasets can support enhanced analysis of climate impacts and climate change adaptation in tropical agriculture.",

            "abstract": "The magmatic and tectonic systems at Kīlauea Volcano are intimately connected; both magma movement and fault slip change the stress field in the surrounding crust and are themselves sensitive to these changes. An example of this occurred during the 2007 Father’s Day eruption, when a dike intrusion induced an expected slow slip event on the décollement. As a result, fault motion stimulated further dike emplacement. Here, we examine stress change on Kīlauea’s faults due to a series of magmatic events in April-May, 2015. In particular, we look at the effect on the Koa`e fault system, a series of north-facing normal faults south of the caldera, extending from the upper East Rift Zone (ERZ) to the Southwest Rift Zone, that produces both earthquakes and fault creep. The April-May sequence began with inflation near Halema`uma`u (HMM) Crater over a few weeks, followed by HMM deflation coincident with inflation of a source in the south caldera over a few days. The initial inflation period was marked by a rise in the level of the lava lake hosted within an eruptive vent in HMM Crater, to the point where it overflowed onto the crater floor. This was accompanied by elevated rates of seismicity in the upper ERZ and south caldera. In the later phase, the lava level dropped and upper ERZ seismicity declined, but south caldera seismicity intensified. We use the Coulomb 3 software to calculate stress changes from a source model that is based on high-rate data from a volcano-wide network of tiltmeters and GPS stations, as well as several independent interferograms from multiple satellites. While the complexity of the April-May event in both space and time represents a significant challenge for constructing a source model, our aim is to understand the how various approaches might affect stress transfer onto nearby fault systems, and thereby improve our understanding of the potential interplay between intrusive events such as this and fault slip.",

            "abstract": "Thawing permafrost and marine methane hydrate destabilization in the Arctic and elsewhere have been proposed as large sources of methane to the atmosphere in the future warming world. To evaluate this hypothesis it is useful to ask whether such methane releases happened during past warming events. The two major abrupt warming events of the last deglaciation, Oldest Dryas – Bølling (OD–B, ≈ 14,500 years ago) and Younger Dryas – Preboreal (YD-PB; ≈11,600 years ago), were associated with large (up to 50%) increases in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations. The sources of these large warming-driven CH4 increases remain incompletely understood, with possible contributions from tropical and boreal wetlands, thawing permafrost as well as marine CH4 hydrates.\nWe present a record of 14C of paleoatmospheric CH4 over the YD-PB transition from ancient ice outcropping at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. 14C can unambiguously identify CH4 emissions from old, 14C-depleted sources, such as permafrost and CH4 hydrates. The only prior study of paleoatmospheric 14CH4 (from Greenland ice) suggested that wetlands were the main driver of the YD-PB CH4 increase, but the results were weakened by an unexpected and poorly understood 14CH4 component from in situ cosmogenic production directly in near-surface ice.\nIn this new study, we have been able to accurately characterize and correct for the cosmogenic 14CH4 component. All samples from before, during and after the abrupt warming and associated CH4 increase yielded 14CH4 values that are consistent with 14C of atmospheric CO2 at that time, indicating a purely contemporaneous methane source. These measurements rule out the possibility of large CH4 releases to the atmosphere from methane hydrates or old permafrost carbon in response to the large and rapid YD-PB warming. To the extent that the characteristics of the YD-PB warming are comparable to those of the current anthropogenic warming, our measurements suggest that large future atmospheric methane increases from old carbon sources in the Arctic are unlikely. Instead, our measurements indicate that global wetlands will likely respond to the warming with increased methane emissions.\nAnalysis and interpretation of 14CH4 for the abrupt OD – B transition is in progress and these results will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "For a given quantity of precipitation, its form (snow or rain) will affect the magnitude and timing of streamflow, with consequences for both water resource and flood management. Using 20 streamflow gaging stations along a gradient of snow persistence and elevation, we identify annual peak flow sources (snowmelt, rainfall, mixed) from a gridded snow accumulation and melt model. We then relate these peak flow sources to annual average January-June snow persistence (SP), evaluate whether peak flow sources have changed over time, and examine how peak flow magnitude and timing differ with flow source. Results show that watersheds with SP<0.3 (low snow, mean elevation <2000 m) have experienced only rainfall-runoff annual peak flows in the period of record, and watersheds with SP>0.7 (persistent snow, mean elevation >3100 m) have mostly snowmelt-runoff peak flows, with mixed sources between these thresholds. At all elevations, rainfall may produce the annual peak flow, but the likelihood of rainfall-runoff peaks declines with increasing SP. Regional Kendall trend tests show that the contributions of snowmelt to peak flows and total annual inputs have declined in the mixed zone but not in the snowmelt-dominated zone, where SP is still high enough for peak flows to remain snowmelt-dominated. While rainfall runoff has produced some of the highest unit area peak flows in the region, on average snowmelt runoff produces higher unit discharge and more attenuated hydrographs than rainfall runoff. This example illustrates how peak flow sources are most sensitive to loss of snow in elevations where snow transitions from persistent to intermittent, whereas high elevations still have long enough snow persistence that they have remained snowmelt-dominated.",

On the other hand in the tenuous plasma the floating potential of the spacecraft is anti-correlated with the flux of the ambient electrons, and therefore provides a qualitative and sensitive indication of variations in the ambient plasma. The advantage of this measurement is that the obtained density yields the overall ambient plasma density irrespective of the particle energy range and sensitive to low-density plasma. Langmuir Probe sensors onboard two spacecraft (Phobos-2 and Rosetta) have identified the plasma regions around Mars magnetosphere using the LP measured spacecraft potentials. However, the examples of such observation are few. A set of Langmuir Probe onboard MAVEN makes possible to monitor the spacecraft potentials around Martian magnetosphere statistically. In most of the cases MAVEN/LPW identifies sharp density jumps near the location previously reported as the magnetic pile-up boundary. We will show the electron density characteristics and its comparison to the characteristics of thermal electron/ion as well as the magnetic field activities and discuss their relation to the Solar wind conditions and Martian magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Rapid characterization of earthquake rupture is important during a disaster because it establishes which fault ruptured and the extent and amount of fault slip. These key parameters, in turn, can augment in situ seismic sensors for identifying disruption to lifelines as well as localized damage along the fault break. Differential GNSS station positioning, along with imagery differencing, are important methods for augmenting seismic sensors. During response to recent earthquakes (1989 Loma Prieta, 1992 Landers, 1994 Northridge, 1999 Hector Mine, 2010 El Mayor – Cucapah, 2012 Brawley Swarm and 2014 South Napa earthquakes), GNSS co-seismic and post-seismic observations proved to be essential for rapid earthquake source characterization. Often, we find that GNSS results indicate key aspects of the earthquake source that would not have been known in the absence of GNSS data. Seismic, geologic, and imagery data alone, without GNSS, would miss important details of the earthquake source. That is, GNSS results provide important additional insight into the earthquake source properties, which in turn help understand the relationship between shaking and damage patterns. GNSS also adds to understanding of the distribution of slip along strike and with depth on a fault, which can help determine possible lifeline damage due to fault offset, as well as the vertical deformation and tilt that are vitally important for gravitationally driven water systems. The GNSS processing work flow that took more than one week 25 years ago now takes less than one second. Formerly, portable receivers needed to be set up at a site, operated for many hours, then data retrieved, processed and modeled by a series of manual steps. The establishment of continuously telemetered, continuously operating high-rate GNSS stations and the robust automation of all aspects of data retrieval and processing, has led to sub-second overall system latency. Within the past few years, the final challenges of standardization and adaptation to the existing framework of the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system have been met, such that real-time GNSS processing and input to ShakeAlert is now routine and in use. Ongoing adaptation and testing of algorithms remain the last step towards fully operational incorporation of GNSS into ShakeAlert by USGS and its partners.",

            "abstract": "Arctic winter precipitation is projected to increase globally over the next decades, spatial variability encompassing areas with increases and decreases in winter snow. Changes in winter precipitation strongly affect C dynamics in Arctic systems and may lead to major positive climate forcing feedbacks. However, impacts of predicted changes in snowfall and accumulation on the rate and form of C fluxes (CO2 and CH4) and associated forcing feedbacks from Arctic tundra remain uncertain. We investigated how changes in winter precipitation affect net ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes and budgets of moist acidic tundra in an 18-yrs snow fence experiment over a complete growing season at Toolik Lake, AK. Arctic tundra under ambient winter precipitation (CTL) was a net source of CO2 and CH4, yielding net C losses over the growing season. Reduced snow (–15-30% snow depth; RS) switched the system to a net CO2 sink mostly by limiting SOC decomposition within colder soils. Snow additions progressively reduced net ecosystem CO2 losses compared to CTL, switching the system into a weaker net CO2 source with medium additions (+20-45% snow depth; MS) and into a small net CO2 sink with high additions (+70-100% snow depth; HS). Increasingly wetter soils with snow additions constrained the temperature sensitivity of aerobic decomposition and favored the anaerobic metabolism, buffering ecosystem CO2 losses despite substantial soil warming. Accordingly, Arctic tundra switched from a sustained CH4 sink at RS site to an increasingly stronger CH4 source with snow additions. Accounting for both CO2 and CH4, the RS site became a net C sink over the growing season, overall reducing the global warming potential (CO2 equiv.; GWP) of the system relative to CTL. Snow additions progressively reduced net C losses at the MS site compared to CTL and the system transitioned into a net C sink at HS plots, partly due to the slower metabolism of anaerobic decomposition. However, given the greater radiative forcing of CH4, GWP was similar in MS and CTL sites, whereas it was higher in HS than in CTL sites. Our study suggests that changes in snowfall and accumulation are a critical forcing element in future climate scenarios.",

These B-based proxies rely on a fundamental assumption that boron incorporation into carbonates occur via B(OH)4- adsorption with little isotopic fractionation, which is based on key results from the classic inorganic experiments performed in the late 1990s (e.g., Hemming et al., 1995, GCA, v59, 371-379; Sanyal et al., 2000, GCA, v64, 1551-1555).\nHowever, a collection of new experimental data published in recent years consistently suggests a more complicated picture for fluid-crystal element and isotope partitioning of B into inorganic carbonates. For instance, we performed novel inorganic calcite precipitation experiments by systematically adjusting solution pH as well as total B, total DIC and Ca concentrations (Uchikawa et al., 2015, GCA, v150, 171-191), and the results showcased apparent kinetic effects related to precipitation rate on B/Ca. Moreover, the results also indicated a dependence of B/Ca on the concentration ratio of total B to total DIC, which was interpreted as indirect evidence for potential B(OH)3 incorporation into synthetic calcite. Notably, relatively simple solutions of NaCl-CaCl2-B(OH)3 system were used for our previous experiments. This presentation features our latest results from similar experiments but using artificial seawater in order to close the gap between simplified experimental conditions to in-situ marine settings. Our preliminary results reveal a precipitation rate control even when artificial seawater is used for the experiments, making a strong case that kinetic effects on B/Ca are universal in inorganic carbonates. With the aid of new isotopic results, we also attempt to discuss possible scenarios of B incorporation pathway in inorganic systems.",

            "abstract": "Most colloidal particles including asbestos fibers form aggregates in water, when solution chemistry provides favorable conditions. To date, the growth of colloidal aggregates has been observed in many model systems under optical and scanning electron microscopy; however, all of these studies have used near-spherical particles. The highly elongated nature of asbestos fibers may cause anomalous aggregate growth and morphology, but this has never been examined. Although the exposure pathway of concern for asbestos is through the air, asbestos particles typically reside in soil that is at least partially saturated, and aggregates formed in the aqueous phase may influence the mobility of particles in the environment. Here we study solution-phase aggregation kinetics of asbestos fibers using a liquid-cell by in situ microscopy, over micron to centimeter length scales and from a tenth of a second to hours. We employ an elliptical particle tracking technique to determine particle trajectories and to quantify diffusivity. Experiments reveal that diffusing fibers join by cross linking, but that such linking is sometimes reversible. The resulting aggregates are very sparse and non-compact, with a fractal dimension that is lower than any previously reported value. Their morphology, growth rate and particle size distribution exhibit non-classical behavior that deviates significantly from observations of aggregates composed of near-spherical particles. We also perform experiments using synthetic colloidal particles, and compare these to asbestos in order to separate the controls of particle shape vs. material properties. This direct method for quantitatively observing aggregate growth is a first step toward predicting asbestos fiber aggregate size distributions in the environment. Moreover, many emerging environmental contaminants – such as carbon nanotubes – are elongated colloids, and our work suggests that theories for aggregate growth may need to be modified in order to model these particles.",

            "abstract": "Repeat, high-resolution multibeam bathymetric surveys were conducted in March and July 2015 along a reach of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon near the Diamond Creek gage (362 km downstream of Lees Ferry, AZ) to characterize the migration of sand dunes. The surveys were collected as part of a study designed to quantify the relative importance of bedload and suspended sediment transport and develop a predictive relationship for bedload transport. Concurrent measurements of suspended-sediment concentrations, bed-sediment grain size, and water velocity were also collected.\nThe study site is approximately 350 m long and 50 m wide; water depths are 7 to 10 m during normal flows; and a field of sand dunes form along its entire length with negligible coarse material at the bed surface. Full swath coverage of the site required about 6 to 10 minutes to complete with two passes of the survey vessel. Mapping occurred continuously during several survey periods. For each survey period, time-series of bathymetric maps were constructed from each pair of survey lines. In March, surveys were collected over durations of 2, 3, 9, and 11 hours, at discharges of 339 to 382 m3/s. In July, surveys were collected over durations of 4, 4, and 13 hours, at discharges ranging from 481 to 595 ft3/s.\nThese surveys capture the migration of sand dunes over a wide range of discharge with an unprecedented temporal resolution. The dunes in March were between 30 and 50 cm in height, 5 m in length, and migrating downstream at about 1 m per hour. In July, dunes were between 75 and 130 cm in height and 10-15 m in length, and were migrating downstream at rates of 5 to 2 m per hour. The surveys also reveal that the dune migration is spatially and temporally variable, with fast-migrating small dunes variably superimposed on slower-moving larger dunes. The dunes also refract around shoreline talus piles and other flow constrictions collectively causing a large degree of dune deformation as they migrate.",

            "abstract": "Road salt impairment may threaten future potability of urban water resources and stress aquatic life throughout snowy temperate watersheds. We contrast scenarios to project chloride flux, storage, and impairment throughout the Merrimack R. watershed, NH/MA, USA using the river-network scale Non-point Anthropogenic Chloride Loading (NACL) model, built within the Framework for Aquatic Modeling of the Earth System (FrAMES). NACL simulates five chloride sources and represents long-term subsurface storage as mobile-immobile exchange at the catchment (grid-cell) scale. Tested scenarios that contrast major drivers include: road salt application rates (current recommendations versus recent inventories); groundwater storage uncertainty (low versus high storage effect); development (dispersed versus urban infilling) and future climate (low [B1] versus high [A1FI] carbon emission scenarios). Simulations that reduce road salt application rates to recommended levels significantly reduce threshold-dependent impaired river length from 20 to 5% within a few years, driven by flushing from headwater catchments. Concentrations downstream, however, decrease modestly and lag the change in loading because of chloride released slowly from groundwater storage. The scenarios suggest best practices and urban infill can mitigate legacy chloride contamination over a few decades. Conversely, dispersed development increases the near-term extent of threshold impaired river length, but downstream concentrations rise slowly as chloride concentrations increase in previously pristine groundwater pools. A warming climate plays a small role until late in the century when reduced snowfall from high emissions scenarios requires less road salting. Reducing road salt use is necessary to mitigate chloride impairment, but expectations and monitoring programs should acknowledge that achieving reasonable water quality goals will take years.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Feigin_poster_agu_2015.pdf\nEmpirical approach to modeling and forecasting complex dynamical systems becomes more and more popular in climate science because of two reasons: (i) not confidence reproducing and forecasting some of key climate modes by existing global climate models, and (ii) increasing number and duration of climatic time series which can be considered as a source of information about dynamical laws underlying observational variability. Such an approach is aimed to construction of prognostic models by way of direct analysis of data without involving any detailed physical equations. We developed a method for empirical modeling basing on reconstruction of prognostic evolution operator in a form of random dynamical system [1] – stochastic mapping the current state of the system to the next one. The most crucial point in application of the method to the analysis of real climatic data is the construction of proper embedding: the optimal set of variables – “principal modes” – determining the phase space the model works in. This task is non-trivial due to huge dimension of time series of typical space-distributed climatic fields. We outline two main features these modes should have to capture the main dynamical properties of the system: (i) capturing teleconnections in the atmosphere-ocean system by taking into account time-lagged couplings in data and (ii) reflecting the nonlinear interactions between the time series at different grid points. In this report we present the methodology of empirical forecasting which includes the construction of an embedding on the basis of the above principals: multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) together with nonlinear principal component analysis (NPCA) are used for phase space construction from data. The proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure fields. Capabilities to predict various indices of climate (such as SOI, PDO, NAO, NTA, etc.) is demonstrated.\nThis research was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Agreement No. 14.Z50.31.0033 with Institute of Applied Physics RAS)\n1.

Furthermore, many conclusions about the impact of P-J encroachment on streamflow are limited to several studies in the southwestern U.S. Our objectives are to: a) assess how western juniper will impact above-ground hydrological processes, b) assess how western juniper will alter below-ground hydrological processes, c) assess how changes in P-J cover alters deep drainage across diverse climates of the western U.S. To accomplish these objectives we used a combination of continuous lysimeter and soil moisture measurements, periodic snow surveys, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys, simulations with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model and broad, spatially-coarse simulations with the atmosphere-vegetation-soil component of the HBV model. Juniper trees by both intercepting snow and increasing below-canopy snow melt caused tree wells to form throughout the winter. These tree wells increased snow redistribution to the base of the trees. Soil moisture in the interspace dominated by sagebrush, forbes, and grasses drops early in the season, but late season soil moisture changes are moderated by juniper. There is evidence that junipers continue to transpire soil moisture both late into the summer and at up to 3 meters deep. HBV simulations revealed that the potential for increases in deep drainage with a change from P-J to grass cover is principally controlled by the timing instead of the total precipitation. Simulations confirm previous empirical studies that landscapes in monsoon-dominated climates of the southwestern U.S. show negligible potential for increases in deep drainage. Conversely, landscapes in the northern Great Basin show greater potential for increases in deep drainage with P-J removal. This information will continue to inform land managers how changes in vegetation cover change can alter hydrological processes.",

            "abstract": "Hot flow anomalies (HFA’s) upstream of the Earth’s bow shock show typically strong nonadiabatic heated plasma and a significant deflection of the plasma velocity compared to the unperturbed solar wind. This deflection can be sufficient that the actual plasma velocity has a sunward component. For particular electric field conditions, hybrid simulations have shown that such structures can be generated by the interaction of solar wind current sheets (tangential discontinuities) with the bow shock. However, recent observations indicate that a large fraction of HFA’s are not associated with measurable current sheets or have the wrong motional electric field compared to the proposed mechanism. This presentation demonstrates that typical properties of HFA’s including the non-adiabatic heating and the large velocity change are easily obtained by the interaction of transient strong density depletions with a fast shock such as the bow shock. A transient depletion of the solar wind density requires different shock conditions compared to the original solar wind. During the interaction, the fast shock is traveling very rapidly (several 100 km/s) sunward and conditions behind this shock are highly reminiscent to those of HFA’s including strong nonadiabatic heating and a strong decelaration and deflection of the plasma velocity. For density depletions to a quarter or less of the original solar wind density, the plasma behind the sunward moving shock has a sunward velocity component. We present analytic solutions of this interaction which are complemented by one- and two-dimensional MHD simulations to demonstrate consistency and the spatial evolution of the HFA-like structure.",

Although we know that many ‘natural’ processes influence large-scale delta morphology, we do not yet know the relative importance of anthropogenic influences (e.g., climate and land-use change) in shaping modern deltas. In particular, the processes and feedbacks that shape delta morphology over large space and timescales (i.e. timescales of multiple river avulsions and the evolution of multiple delta lobes) are not well understood. To explore the long-term combined effects of sea-level rise, subsidence and anthropogenic manipulations, we have developed a new morphodynamic delta model that links fluvial, floodplain, and deltaic dynamics over large space and timescales. Using the framework and tools of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System, we couple a new river and floodplain module to the Coastline Evolution Model (CEM, Ashton and Murray, 2001). In the fluvial module, cell width is assumed to be larger than the channel belt width (including natural levees that are maintained at a bankfull channel-depth above the riverbed elevation). The river course is determined using a steepest-descent methodology, and erosion and deposition along the course is modeled as a linear diffusive process. An avulsion occurs when the riverbed becomes super-elevated above the surrounding floodplain, and the new steepest-descent path to sea level is shorter than the previous course. Floodplain deposition is modeled by blanket (uniform) deposition and crevasse splay deposition (after a ‘failed’ avulsion; if the riverbed is super-elevated, but the new steepest path to sea level is longer than the prior path). Preliminary results indicate that anthropogenic manipulations of the river (e.g., levees) can propagate hundreds of kilometers upstream. The CEM distributes the sediment flux from the river mouth along the coastline using alongshore sediment transport gradients. The new medium-detail model will be expanded by further model couplings, including Sedflux 3D (Hutton and Syvitski, 2008), as well as vegetation, marsh, and human dynamics modules.",

            "abstract": "The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is one of the most important features of the tropics, supplying large amounts of latent heat to the atmosphere and driving the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation. Although there have been many studies defining the climatological location of the ITCZ and the strength of general tropical precipitation, there has been less work quantifying the extent and intensity of ITCZ convection. These characteristics of the ITCZ are extremely important as recent work suggests a remote influence of subtropical moisture on the ITCZ. Many recent studies of general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit the “rich-get-richer” mechanism, with tropical precipitation increasing and subtropical precipitation decreasing. As a first step in studying feedbacks between the tropics and subtropics using observations, an automated, objective ITCZ identification and characterization algorithm is developed and applied to ECMWF Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) variables, and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) rain rates (RRs) to create 15- and 36-year climatologies in the tropical Pacific ocean. Characteristics derived from the algorithm include ITCZ latitude, northern and southern ITCZ convection boundaries, ITCZ extents, and precipitation intensity. Preliminary results show a climatological ITCZ location consistent with previous studies (8°N), while long-term trends in the width and ITCZ precipitation intensity show narrowing and intensification, especially in the central Pacific. The intensification is much stronger near the center of the ITCZ, so a census of precipitation features (PFs) across the ITCZ is also planned using the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) PF database. PFs will be analyzed over the entire ITCZ, in the center, and along ITCZ edges to determine how changes in the characteristics of convection drive the observed changes in ITCZ precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Delta morphology reflects the interplay of various environmental parameters, though these relationships have only been tested on small datasets with 30-50 deltas. These datasets are biased toward the largest deltas, which typically have compound morphologies, form on passive margins, and may not be representative of the full breadth in delta morphology. With the goal of building more robust predictions of delta morphology to enhance hazard mitigation and resiliency planning, we have developed a truly global delta database including every delta on the world’s marine coastlines. Using Google Earth imagery, we first identified all fluvial river mouths (≥ 50 m wide) connected to an upstream catchment. Deltas are defined geomorphically as river mouths that split into two or more active or relict distributary channels, end in a depositional protrusion from the shoreline, or do both. In our database we identified 5,801 river mouths, and 1,426 of those coastal rivers (~25%) have a geomorphic delta. ~75% of deltas exhibit an active or relict distributary network, while the remaining ~25% are single channel deltas with a basinward protrusion. Preliminary morphometric analysis (ratio of shore-parallel width, W, to shore-perpendicular length, L) on a subset of 159 deltas suggests W:L values range from 0.52 (elongate) to 23.6 (broad/cuspate). The median W:L value is 2.68, suggesting the majority of deltas are roughly semi-circular (W:L = 2), and the distribution is heavily skewed to the broad/cuspate deltas (~28% are >4 times wider than they are long). Preliminary comparison to downstream significant wave height data shows that the ‘wider’ deltas relate to higher wave heights (R2 = 0.42), though the data are scattered. Ultimately, the database will include additional measured morphometrics, including number of channel mouths and delta area, and morphodynamic data derived from serial Landsat imagery.",

            "abstract": "Large volumes of crystal poor, near-liquidus rhyolites are erupted worldwide as tuffs and lavas in rift and hot spots more common previously on early earth, creating temporally very high magma production rates. In this contribution we combine results of IDTIMS dating of zircons with numerical modeling of zircon crystallization. New investigation of zircons in major Yellowstone tuffs: Huckleberry Ridge (Members A,B,C), Mesa Falls, and Lava Creek (A,B) tuffs was done by a combination of in situ measurements of oxygen isotopes followed by ID-TIMS U-Pb dating, Hf isotopes and trace elemental investigation of single crystals. We discover that nearly all zircons are of eruption age, but display significant isotope (O,Hf) diversity and often show decoupled O and Hf isotope systematics. This record rapid (~103yrs) double or triple remelting and sequestration from diverse Archean crust and hydrothermally altered shallow-crustal rocks from previous eruptive cycles, followed by effective mixing of co-existing magma reservoirs with diverse zircons prior to eruptions. Similar results characterize other studied Snake River Plain rhyolites in pre-Yellowstone Heise complex. These results collectively suggest that zircons crystallize after reheating above saturation rejuvenation in isotopically-diverse areas of the crust in the magma plumbing system. Modeling of zircon and quartz dissolution and crystallization trajectories outline conditions of survival (inheritance) vs complete dissolution on conductive timescales, and when combined with a phase diagram, magma T-t paths can be computed. Zircon rejuvenation requires hot, >770-800°C peak temperatures lasting 10-102yrs. We speculate that near liquidus hot and dry Yellowstone rhyolites are kept alive in a multi-batch state by a series of interconnected pods and sills that can rapidly get thermomechanically assembled into large, shallow and eruptable supervolcanoic magma bodies. We suggest that overpressure and roof dynamics and rheology plays a more important role than magma buyoncy. The runaway batch assembly process creates temporally very high magma production rates, orders of magnitude higher than for arc volcanoes. Such views have implication for the state of the magma chamber under Yellowstone and similar supervolcanoes elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "An increase in intensity and frequency of extreme events resulting from climate change is expected to result in extreme precipitation events on both regional and local scales. Extreme precipitation events have the potential to mobilize large volumes of mercury (Hg) mine tailings in watersheds where tailings reside in the floodplain downstream from historic Hg mines. The California Hg mineral belt produced one third of the worlds Hg from over 100 mines from the 1850’s to 1972. In the absence of environmental regulations, tailings were disposed of into streams adjacent to the mines in order to have them transported from the mine site during storm events. Thus most of the tailings no longer reside at the mine site. Addition of tailings to the streams resulted in stream aggradation, increased over-bank flow, and deposition of tailings in the floodplain for up to 25 kms downstream from the mines. After cessation of mining, the decrease in tailings entering the streams resulted in degradation, incision of the streams into the floodplain, and inability of the streams to access the floodplain. Thus Hg tailings have remained stored in the floodplain since cessation of mining. Hg phases in these tailings consist of cinnabar, metacinnabar and montroydite based on EXAFS analysis. Size analysis indicates that Hg phases are fine grained, less than 1 um. The last regional scale extreme precipitation events to effect the entire area of the California Hg mineral belt were the ARkStorm events of 1861-1862 that occurred prior to large scale Hg mining. Extreme regional ARkStorm precipitation events as well as local summer storms, such as the July 2006 flood in the Clear Creek Hg mining district, are expected to increase in frequency and have the potential to remobilize the large volume of tailings stored in floodplain deposits. Although Hg mine remediation has decreased Hg release from mine sites in a period of benign climate, no remediation efforts have addressed the large source of Hg residing in floodplain deposits. This Hg source in a period of climate change poses a significant environmental risk to aquatic systems downstream from Hg mine-impacted watersheds. An extreme ARkStorm event is estimated to potentially remobilize an amount of Hg equivalent to that released in the past during the peak period of unregulated Hg mining in California.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the magnitude and frequency of floods relies on instrumental measurements of flood stage and discharge, however instrumental observations prior to the late-nineteenth century are rare. Using paleoproxies such as tree rings to study floods that occurred before the instrumental record, can help provide context for the modern flood record especially the variability of flood recurrence patterns. Riparian trees growing on flooded sites often record flood events as inter- and intra-annual variability in size, shape and arrangement of vessels in the annual xylem growth increment. In this study, we used anomalous anatomical features as well as a modified measure of earlywood (EW) vessel width of oak (Quercus sp.) annual tree rings to identify large-magnitude spring-season flood events at three locations in the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) basin for the past ~300 years. We compared the flood-ring anomaly and EW chronologies with daily river stage height data at several locations and these comparisons indicate that our new flood ring records can individually and jointly explain significant amounts of the variance in both stage height and number of days in flood during spring flood events. Our analyses indicate that our chronologies are recording nearly all large observed LMR floods in the 20th century, and provide a new record of similar events in the 18th and 19th centuries. These results suggest that tree-rings can be effectively used to develop and improve pre-instrumental flood records throughout the LMW region and potentially other similar systems.",

            "abstract": "Low energy (up to 100-200 keV) electron fluxes are very important to specify when hazardous satellite surface charging phenomena are considered. These electrons are the seed population, being further accelerated to MeV energies by various processes in the Earth’s radiation belts. Accurate modeling and forecasting of low energy electrons is very challengable, since the electron flux at the keV energies is largely determined by convective and substorm-associated electric fields and varies significantly with geomagnetic activity driven by the solar wind on the time scales on tens of minutes. We present the model for low energy (< 200 keV) electrons in the inner magnetosphere, which is the version of the Inner Magnetosphere Particle Transport and Acceleration model (IMPTAM) for electrons. This model has been operating online since March 2013 (http://fp7-spacecast.eu and imptam.fmi.fi). The model is driven by the real time solar wind and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) parameters with 1 hour time shift for propagation to the Earth’s magnetopause, and by the real time Dst index. The presented model provides the low energy electron flux at all L-shells and at all satellite orbits, when necessary. We present the model performance analysis (accumulated model output compared to GOES MAGED data) and demonstrate the model's forecasting abilities on several real space weather events. We discuss the recent advances we achieved for model's inputs such as solar wind-driven boundary conditions in the plasma sheet (based on THEMIS data) and introducing the electron lifetimes due to interactions with chorus and hiss waves. We show that the IMPTAM model for electrons provides very good forecast of keV-electrons in the inner magnetosphere.",

Here we use the tidal response of the water level in a deep well (~4 km) in the near field of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, western China, to investigate how large earthquakes may disrupt groundwater systems in the near field. The well is located near the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and 21 km from the ruptured fault of the Wenchuan earthquake, and is the only well we have found that is in the near field of a large earthquake and showed clear tidal signals before and after the earthquake. The well is open to a Triassic medium-grained sandstone aquifer confined by thick layers of shales on both sides. We show from tidal analysis of the water level in the well that large earthquakes can change not only the permeability but also the poroelastic properties of a groundwater system in an unexpected way. Using the lithologic well logs and experimental data for rock physical properties we interpret this change to reflect the breaching of aquitards of the groundwater system to depths of several km. Such disruption may connect previously isolated groundwater domains to impact groundwater supply, safety of underground waste repository, and hydrocarbon production. The method demonstrated here holds promise for monitoring the breaching of aquitards by hydraulic fracturing of shales during hydrocarbon production and deep injection of waste water.",

Furthermore, there is large discrepancy between numerical models and observations. This work attempts to address these issues by using a new cloud parcel model that accounts explicitly for entrainment-mixing processes and bin microphysics. The combined effects of entrainment rate, mixing mechanisms, updraft velocity and pre-cloud/entrained aerosol properties (aerosol concentration, mean radius, aerosol standard deviation, and chemical composition) on cloud microphysical properties (e.g., droplet concentration, liquid water content, effective radius, and relative dispersion) will be examined by a suite of numerical simulations considering clouds as an open system. The simulations will be compared against aircraft measurements from shallow cumulus clouds in the context of understanding the impacts of entrainment-mixing processes on clouds and their parameterization in climate models.",

These formats include two forms of schema-less XML and a custom binary format accompanied by metadata in a spreadsheet. The authors report on efforts to use existing standards to make this data more discoverable and more useful beyond their initial use in detecting tsunamis. An initial review of data formats for sea level data around the globe revealed heterogeneity in presentation and content. In the absence of a widely-used domain-specific format, we adopted the general model for structuring data and metadata expressed by the Network Common Data Form (netCDF). netCDF has been endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium and has the advantages of small size when compared to equivalent plain text representation and provides a standard way of embedding metadata in the same file. We followed the orthogonal time-series profile of the Climate and Forecast discrete sampling geometries as the convention for structuring the data and describing metadata relevant for use. We adhered to the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery for capturing metadata to support user search. Beyond making it possible to structure data and metadata in a standard way, netCDF is supported by multiple software tools in providing programmatic cataloging, access, subsetting, and transformation to other formats. We will describe our successes and failures in adhering to existing standards and provide requirements for either augmenting existing conventions or developing new ones.

However, on longer timescales, knowledge of natural variations in BC emissions and climate drivers of regional-scale biomass burning is limited.\nHere we present the first high-resolution 14,000-year record of BC aerosol deposition in Antarctica. The two ice cores analyzed were the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WD) core from 14,000 years before 1950 (yr BP) to 2,475 yr BP and the East Antarctic B40 core from 2,485 yr BP to present. BC and a wide range of trace elements were analyzed via a continuous melter system allowing for sub-annual resolution in both cores. For BC concentration determinations, a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2; Droplet Measurement Technologies) was used.\nBC fluxes in the WD and B40 Holocene composite more than doubled from <25 μg m-2 yr-1 at the end of the last glacial termination (14 kyr BP) to >50 μg m-2 yr-1 in the mid-Holocene (~7.5 kyr BP), and then declined to <20 μg m-2 yr-1 in the late Holocene, with lowest BC fluxes observed during the Little Ice Age.

            "abstract": "Nonlinear dynamical systems are frequently used to model physical processes including the fluid dynamics, weather and climate. Uncertainty in the observations makes identification of the exact state impossible for a chaotic nonlinear system, this suggests forecasts based on an ensemble of initial conditions to reflect the inescapable uncertainty in the observations. In general, when forecasting real systems the model class from which the particular model equations are drawn does not contain a process that is able to generate trajectories consistent with the data. Multi-model ensembles have become popular tools to account for uncertainties due to observational noise and structural model error in weather and climate simulation-based predictions on time scales from days to seasons and centuries. There have been some promising results suggesting that the multi-model ensemble forecasts outperform the single model forecasts. The current multi-model ensemble forecasts are focused on combining single model ensemble forecasts by means of statistical post-processing. Assuming each model is developed independently, every single model is likely to contain different local dynamical information from that of other models. Using statistical post-processing, such information is only carried by the simulations under a single model ensemble: no advantage is taken to influence simulations under the other models. A novel methodology, named Multi-model Cross Pollination in Time, is proposed for multi-model ensemble scheme with the aim of integrating the dynamical information from each individual model operationally in time. The proposed method generates model states in time via applying advanced nonlinear data assimilation scheme(s) over the multi-model forecasts. The proposed approach is demonstrated to outperform the traditional statistically post-processing in the 40-dimensional Lorenz96 flow. It is suggested that this illustration could form the basis for more general results which in turn could potentially be deployed in operational forecasting.",

The drivers and controls of rates and magnitude of hyporheic greenhouse gas (GHG) production remain poorly understood. Recent research has hypothesised that nitrous oxide emissions resulting from incomplete denitrification in nutrient rich agricultural streams may contribute substantially to GHG emissions.\nThis paper reports on a controlled microcosm incubation experiment that has been set up to quantify the sensitivity of hyporheic zone GHG production to temperature and nutrient concentrations. Experiments were conducted with sediment from two contrasting UK lowland rivers (sandstone and chalk). Adopting a gradient approach, sediments with different organic matter and carbon content were analysed from both rivers.\nOur analytical approach integrated several novel methods, such as push-pull application of the Resazurin/Resorufin smart tracer system for estimation of sediment microbial metabolic activity, high-resolution gas sampling and analysis of methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, coupled with and high precision in-situ dissolved oxygen measurements.\nOur results indicate strong temperature controls of GHG production rates, overlapping with the observed impacts of different sediment types. Experimental findings indicate that increased hyporheic temperatures during increasing baseflow and drought conditions may enhance substantially sediment respiration and thus, GHG emissions from the streambed interface. The presented results integrated with field experiments of respiration and GHG emission rates under different treatments. This research advances understanding of scale dependent drivers and controls of whole stream carbon and nitrogen budgets and the role of streambed interfaces in GHG emissions.",

            "abstract": "On 26 March 2015, catastrophic floods occurred over the Northern Chilean regions of Atacama, Antofagasta and Coquimbo, all located in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest regions on Earth.\nPreliminary investigations using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data suggest the weakening of the high pressure system (HPS) that usually presents over Northern Chile during austral summer is responsible, allowing a cut-off low (COL) pressure system over the subtropical southeast Pacific to move unusually further north–east, toward the Atacama Desert. The presence of Andes on the East and a ridge of HPS developing south-southwest of the area caused the COL to trap in the proximity of the central Chilean coastline. This, combined with northwesterly winds advecting moist air generated by a prior rapid warming of the eastern tropical Pacific, led to the record-breaking rainfall over the desert. In 3 days the precipitation over Copiapo and other areas was equivalent to the amount over several years.\nTo further study the dynamical and thermo-dynamical features of this unique event, high resolution (3km grid) numerical simulations with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were conducted. A possible blocking influence of the Andes on the COL’s lifecycle was investigated. WRF model capabilities in properly representing air flow and precipitation patterns over this challenging topography (the mountain height rises from sea level to more than 6km within 230km) were investigated.\nDifferent physical options, including several microphysics and cumulus parameterization schemes, are tested to find the optimal model set-up that might be used as the backbone of a future flood warning system. In this regard, surface distribution of precipitation was analyzed in detail for the case of Río Salado watershed, an almost unmonitored basin in high altitude complex terrain and one of the most severely damaged areas by the flood.\nResearch funded by ND-PUC Seed Fund, and Cigiden, Conicyt/Fondap Grant 15110017",

            "abstract": "There is compelling evidence of increasing mass loss of the ice sheets using a diverse set of observations, including increased thinning rates measured from both airborne and satellite altimeters, elevated mass fluxes resulting from the acceleration of outlet glaciers, and mass changes measured directly from satellite gravimetry. A dominant characteristic of observed change in Greenland outlet glaciers is that it is locally random. Numerous studies have revealed a high degree of spatial and temporal variability of outlet glacier mass change. Modeling studies suggest that increased ocean temperatures may be responsible for the observed glacial retreat in Greenland through increased basal melting, leading to increased calving rates, terminus retreat, glacier speedup, and eventually thinning of inland ice. Knowledge of fjord geometry is crucial for ice-ocean interaction because the availability of ocean heat to the ice will be restricted by narrow sills and shallow grounding lines. We investigate whether the variability in observed changes among Greenland glaciers can be partially explained by variation in fjord geometry.\nUsing statistical techniques commonly employed to detect patterns in complex spatial data, we objectively show that mass change in Greenland tidewater glaciers between 2003 and 2009 is indeed mostly spatially incoherent. Except for a few clusters of similar change in the NW and Scoresby Sund regions, there is significant glacier-scale variability in mass loss rates. To understand the drivers of this local variability, we compare fjord bathymetries from all regions of Greenland, modeled using airborne gravimetry measurements from NASA Operation IceBridge flights, to estimates of glaciological change. Specifically, we investigate the correlation between water depths at the grounding line and the dynamic mass loss of tidewater glaciers. In theory, a deep grounding line will allow greater interaction with the warm Atlantic Water observed in most fjords. The relationship between grounding line depth and mass loss for all of Greenland is modest, but is more robust for regions exhibiting no spatially coherent change. Other potential drivers of glacier change, including fjord width and sill depth, will also be considered.",

While most games are fun by design, few controlled studies have been conducted to assess games’ potential for learning gains in comparison with traditional educational approaches. Without evidence for learning, it can be difficult to justify incorporating STEM games in curricula and other programming. In this study we assess the impact of a game called EcoChains (\nhttp://thepolarhub.org/project/ecochains-arctic-crisis\n) on learning, using a controlled experiment. The EcoChains: Arctic Crisis card game gives players the opportunity to learn about the components of an Arctic marine food web, the reliance of some species on sea ice, and the potential impacts of future changes on the ecosystem. EcoChains was developed under the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership (thepolarhub.org). EcoChains aligns with Next Generation Science Standards LS2 Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics and ESS3 Earth and Human Activity.\nParticipants in this experiment (n=41) were randomly assigned to either play EcoChains or to read a magazine-style article with similar content (the control). Questionnaires, mapping exercises and a 4-week follow-up survey were used to identify changes in participant knowledge of climate change and the Arctic region, attitudes and beliefs about climate change and its impacts, information-seeking behaviors, systems thinking, impressions of and engagement with the intervention experience. Analysis indicates that the game was as effective as, and in some respects more effective than, the article at teaching participants about climate change and the Arctic region and ecosystems. The follow up survey found that game players recalled new information better than those who read the article. Participants were also more engaged in the game than the article, they found it to be more fun, they were happier while playing than while reading, and they were more likely to recommend the game to others. These findings indicate that game-based learning can improve retention of new content knowledge as well as engagement in subject matter.",

Modelling these phenomena in embankment dams, accounting for the groundwater-surface water interactions, is crucial when performing dam safety assessments.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of modelling seepage flows in multi-region dams using a finite element based multi-physics model. The model was applied to the Trängslet dam, the largest dam in Sweden.\nThe objectives were to analyze the characteristics of both the flow and the surface-ground water interactions occurring in the dam, including: i) the saturated and unsaturated laminar flow regimes within the dam body, ii) the non-linear through-flow in the dam shoulders’ coarse material, iii) the influence of the surface waves in the reservoir on the seepage flow by coupling the physics to a hydrodynamic interface, and iv) the influence of a conceptual “erosion tunnel” on the seepage flow and its interaction with the surface water flow by coupling the physics to a CFD interface.\nThe focus of the study was on the influence of the transient water head boundary condition, surface waves and the internal erosion tunnel on the location of the phreatic line and the seepage flow rate. The simulated seepage flow of the dam in its original condition tallied with the monitoring measurements (40-70 l/s). The main feature found was the relatively high position of the phreatic line, which could compromise the stability of the dam.\nThe combination of the seepage model with the reservoir hydrodynamics indicated a negligible influence of the surface waves on seepage flow. Results from the combination of the seepage model with fluid dynamics indicated that a conceptual “erosion tunnel” placed within the dam, even as high as in the unsaturated zone, significantly affects the phreatic line’s position. This also causes the seepage flow to increase by several orders of magnitude, resulting in non-linear turbulent flow regimes in the downstream shoulder of the dam and, ultimately, dam failure.\nWhile the modelling was limited by a lack of reliable geometrical and geotechnical data, the results of the study do highlight the importance of including groundwater-surface water interactions in dam safety assessments.",

            "abstract": "The general relationship between climate and tree growth is a well established and important tenet shaping both paleo and future perspectives of forest ecosystem growth dynamics. Across much of the American west, water limits growth via physiological mechanisms that tie regional and local climatic conditions to forest productivity in a relatively predictable way, and these growth responses are clearly evident in tree ring records. However, within the annual cycle of a forest landscape, water availability varies across both time and space, and interacts with other potentially growth limiting factors such as temperature, light, and nutrients. In addition, tree growth responses may lag climate drivers and may vary in terms of where in a tree carbon is allocated. As such, determining when and where water actually limits forest growth in real time can be a significant challenge. Despite these challenges, we present data suggestive of real-time growth limitation driven by soil moisture supply and atmospheric water demand reflected in high frequency field measurements of stem radii and cell structure across ecological gradients. The experiment was conducted at the Lubrecht Experimental Forest in western Montana where, over two years, we observed intra-annual growth rates of four dominant conifer species: Douglas fir, Ponderosa Pine, Engelmann Spruce and Western Larch using point dendrometers and microcores. In all four species studied, compensatory use of stored water (inferred from stem water deficit) appears to exhibit a threshold relationship with a critical balance point between water supply and demand. The occurrence of this point in time coincided with a decrease in stem growth rates, and the while the timing varied up to one month across topographic and elevational gradients, the onset date of growth limitation was a reliable predictor of overall annual growth. Our findings support previous model-based observations of nonlinearity in the relationship between climate and annual ring formation, and suggest a rather immediate growth response to critical micro-meteorological conditions occurring at different times across the landscape by linking the timing and magnitude of tree growth responses to in situ measurements of environmental conditions.",

Although critical for predicting or assessing habitat suitability, spatially distributed estimates of snag basal area are not generally available across landscapes at spatial scales relevant for conservation planning. This study evaluates the use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) to 1) identify individual conifer snags and map their basal area across a recently burned forest, and 2) map habitat suitability for a wildlife species known to be dependent on snag basal area, specifically the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus). This study focuses on the Rim Fire, a megafire that took place in 2013 in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, creating large patches of medium- and high-severity burned forest. We use forest inventory plots, single-tree ALS-derived metrics and Gaussian processes classification and regression to identify conifer snags and estimate their stem diameter and basal area. Then, we use the results to map habitat suitability for the black-backed woodpecker using thresholds for conifer basal area from a previously published habitat suitability model. Local maxima detection and watershed segmentation algorithms resulted in 75% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Snags are identified with an overall accuracy of 91.8 % and conifer snags are identified with an overall accuracy of 84.8 %. Finally, Gaussian process regression reliably estimated stem diameter (R2 = 0.8) using height and crown area. This work provides a fast and efficient methodology to characterize the extent of a burned forest at the tree level and a critical tool for early wildlife assessment in post-fire forest management and biodiversity conservation.",

            "abstract": "The last glacial-interglacial transition is punctuated by brief periods of rapid return to glacial-like conditions followed by abrupt warmings. Ice core records reveal episodes of rapid increases in CO2 and synchronous decreases in Δ14C that co-occur with these abrupt warmings (Hughen et al., 2000; Fairbanks et al., 2005). As the largest mobile carbon reservoir, the deep oceans have been implicated as the most likely source of this 14C-deplete CO2. Records of benthic radiocarbon offsets from the atmosphere provide evidence of intermediate depth ventilation of a 14C-deplete reservoir during deglaciation. However, modeling studies focusing on ocean circulation changes alone are unable to replicate the full-observed glacial-interglacial CO2 change. Changes in the biological pump could provide an additional mechanism contributing to the glacial drawdown and deglacial release of CO2.  The Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) is currently responsible for ~10% of global ocean primary productivity and is strongly connected to the Southern Ocean (Pennington et al., 2006) making it ideally suited for studying past changes in the biological pump. This study uses a multi-proxy approach to investigate the role of carbonate compensation and export productivity over the last 26,000yrs. Intermediate to deep-water transects of B/Ca, Cd/Ca, and U/Ca for the benthic foraminifera Cibicidoides wuelerstorfi were developed from 7 EEP cores (1620-3200m water-depth) extending from 8.2°N to 2.3°S in the Panama Basin. The fraction of calcite dissolved was estimated for high-resolution core TR163-23 (2,730m; 0.41°N, 92.16°W) using the G. menardii fractionation index (MFI) (Mekik et al., 2002). A record of benthic foraminiferal radiocarbon offsets from the atmosphere was also developed for TR163-23 providing a larger picture of the relative role of both ventilation and the biological pump in changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the last glacial-interglacial transition.",

            "abstract": "The work of geoscientists is to engage inquiry, discovery and exploration of Earth history and processes, and increasingly, to apply this knowledge to the “grand challenges” that face humanity. Geoscience as a discipline is confronted with an incomplete geologic record, observations or data that are often ambiguous or uncertain, and a need to grasp abstract concepts such as temporal reasoning (‘deep time’), spatial reasoning over many orders of magnitude, and complex system behavior. These factors provide challenges, and also opportunities, for training future geoscientists. Beyond disciplinary knowledge, it is also important to provide opportunities for students to engage the community of practice and demonstrate how to “be” a geoscientist. Inculcation of geoscience “ways of knowing” is a collective responsibility for geoscientists (teaching faculty and other professionals), at all instructional levels, in all geoscience disciplines, and for all students. A whole-student approach is recommended. Geoscience programs can be designed to focus on student success by explictly: 1) defining programmatic student learning outcomes , 2) embedding assessments throughout the program to demonstrate mastery, 3) aligning course sequences to reinforce and anticipate essential concepts/skills, 4) preparing students to be life-long learners; 5) assigning responsibilities to courses/faculty to ensure these goals have been met; 6) providing opportunities for students to “do” geoscience (research experiences), and 7) modeling professional behaviors in class, field, labs, and informal settings. Extracurricular departmental activities also contribute to student development such as journal clubs, colloquia, field trips, and internships. Successful design of geoscience department programs is informed by: the AGI Workforce program and Summit on the Future of Geoscience Education that define pathways for becoming a successful geoscientist; training in Geoethics; Geoscience Education Research; and the NAGT Building Strong Departments program that has developed extensive web-based resources using the “matrix approach”\nhttp://nagt.org/nagt/profdev/twp/trav_departments.html\n. Geoscience departments should commit to producing great Science and great Scientists.",

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is run at a sufficiently fine resolution (4-km horizontal grid spacing), over a sub-continental domain driven by the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), to examine WRF’s ability to simulate the observed seasonal precipitation and snowpack dynamics. WRF retrospective simulations are being run over a 30-year period from 1980 to 2010. Observations from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL, providing precipitation rate and snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE)) and the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM, providing fine-scale monthly mean values of precipitation and temperature) are used for validation. The results show that WRF captures observed seasonal precipitation and snowpack build-up reasonably well.\nThe second part of this work is in progress. A pseudo-global warming (PGW) technique is used to perturb the retrospective reanalysis with the anticipated change according to the consensus global model guidance under the CMIP5 “high emissions” (RCP8.5) scenario produced by the CCSM4. This technique preserves low-frequency general circulation patterns and the characteristics of storms entering the domain. The WRF model is rerun over 30 years centered on 2050 with perturbed initial and boundary conditions. The results will be used to examine the effect of climate variability and projected global warming on the statistical distributions of precipitation amounts and SWE in the studied domain.",

Critical components in water systems may be more likely to fail under future conditions, and it is possible that the combination of these failures could cascade to system-wide failures compromising water quantity, pressure, and quality delivered to customers. To model the propagation of probability of infrastructural component failures to decreases in system-wide performance under future climate conditions, an event tree failure analysis framework is used Arizona water systems are modeled as the case study.\nFor each major component in the infrastructural systems involved in water extraction, treatment, and transmission, the probability of failure is estimated for a range of possible temperatures. Probability of component failure is calculated by using lifespan derating information to estimate the mean of time to failure probability distributions for different temperatures. The probability distributions are then integrated over selected time intervals to calculate the probability of failure under present and future conditions.\nUnder worst case scenario conditions in Arizona, the probability of failure of two critical components in all water infrastructure systems, motors and electronics, will increase 4% and 10% under an average summertime ambient temperature increase from 104oF to 113oF, where the probabilities of failure over their lifetime at 113oF are 67% and 89% respectively. At the temperature of 122oF, the probability of failure of motors increases another 12% to become 79% likely to fail, and the probability of failure of electronics increases another 7% to become 96% likely to fail.\nThe probabilities of system-wide failures are then calculated by inputting events and their probabilities into event trees that show potential pathways to system failure or recovery. We find that though heat has the potential to significantly decrease the reliability of the urban water systems in Arizona, proactive governance and strategic improvements to maintenance practices can effectively offset these decreases, thereby minimizing risk.",

            "abstract": "In response to the occurrence of relatively large (and felt) earthquakes that are potentially induced by man-made activities, there is an increasing trend for the industry and government regulators to include a “traffic light” system in their decision-making process. Despite its tremendous implications to the cost of operations and the protection of public safety, the protocol that defines the different scenarios for different lights (“green”, “yellow”, or “red”) has not been thoroughly validated to truly reflect the associated seismic risk. Most government regulators adopt a traffic light protocol (TLP) that depends on the magnitude of the earthquake of interest and sometimes felt reports from local communities. It is well known that the estimate of an earthquake’s magnitude can have some uncertainty. While an uncertainty of +/-0.2 in magnitude is understandable and generally accepted by the seismological community, it can create a serious problem when the value of magnitude is the predominant factor in the TLP for induced seismicity. Recent examples of magnitude 4 and larger earthquakes in northeast BC and western AB that are possibly induced by shale gas hydraulic fracturing have demonstrated vividly the possible deficiency of existing TLP for induced seismicity. From the viewpoint of mitigating seismic risk, we argue that a ground-motion based TLP should be more effective than a magnitude-based approach. A workshop with representatives from government agencies, the industry, and the academia will be held to review the deficiency of the current TLP for induced seismicity and to explore innovative ways of improvement. The ultimate goal of the TLP for induced seismicity is to reach a balance between the protection of public safety and the economic benefit of developing natural resources In this presentation, main conclusions of this workshop will be presented.",

We develop and test a new theory for the formation of channel bifurcations based on fluid mass conservation and system-averaged transport conditions rather than local hydrodynamics. We built 29 experimental deltas under a variety of boundary conditions to examine the inception and growth of bars and channel bifurcations. From the initial condition of water and sediment entering a still basin of uniform depth as a wall-bounded turbulent jet, delta growth begins with the formation of a lunate bar as predicted by the hydrodynamics of jet spreading. However, the lunate bar diverts water and sediment laterally causing the bar to widen into a radially symmetric sediment “apron” extending uniformly from the channel axis to the flume walls. This apron is stable to perturbations, and its distal limit progrades basinward while maintaining a roughly constant flow depth of ~10 times the median grain diameter (H=2-3 mm). Bar formation and channel bifurcation occur on top of the apron at the distance where shear stress applied by radially-averaged flow velocity falls below the threshold of sediment motion. Our model predicts that the distance to the first channel bifurcation should scale with water discharge, scale inversely with flow depth over the apron, and scale with median grain diameter to the negative one half.",

(Ulrich, et al, 2010) AutoClass identifies classes by a two-step process in which it: (1) finds, without human supervision, a set of class definitions based on specified attributes of a sample of the image data pixels, such as magnetic field and intensity in the case of MWO images, and (2) applies the class definitions thus found to new data sets to identify automatically in them the classes found in the sample set.\n HMI high resolution images capture four observables-magnetic field, continuum intensity, line depth and line width-in contrast to MWO’s two observables-magnetic field and intensity. In this study, we apply AutoClass to the HMI observables for images from June, 2010 to December, 2014 to identify solar surface feature classes. We use contemporaneous TSI measurements to determine whether and how variations in the HMI classes are related to TSI variations and compare the characteristic statistics of the HMI classes to those found from MWO images. We also attempt to derive scale factors between the HMI and MWO magnetic and intensity observables.\nThe ability to categorize automatically surface features in the HMI images holds out the promise of consistent, relatively quick and manageable analysis of the large quantity of data available in these images. Given that the classes found in MWO images using AutoClass have been found to improve modeling of TSI, application of AutoClass to the more complex HMI images should enhance understanding of the physical processes at work in solar surface features and their implications for the solar-terrestrial environment.\nUlrich, R.K., Parker, D, Bertello, L. and Boyden, J. 2010, Solar Phys. , 261 , 11.",

A detailed survey of seasonal frost depth (SFD) and soil water content (SWC) here is significant for understanding the hydrological response to thawing permafrost. However, little is known about the spatial heterogeneity of SFD and SWC at the hillslope-scale in this vulnerable permafrost region. Thus, high-frequency ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was applied to a field site that varied in terms of topography (slope, aspect and elevation) and surface environments (vegetation cover and stream presence). The GPR data and accompanying field observations of gravimetric water content and frost depth revealed a spatial variation at the hillslope-scale in SFD and SWC, and indicated that topography, vegetation and stream distribution significantly influence the patterns observed. The average SFD was much deeper along the north-facing slope, compared to the south-facing slope in early May and its thickness varied considerably with altitude along each slope. An increase in the extent of vegetation cover correlated with decreasing SFD. The SWC at shallow depth was higher along the south-facing slope than along the north-facing slope in the beginning of the thawing period. For slopes of both aspects, the SWC vertical profiles exhibited a similar variability, with SWC decreasing with depth, but at different rates. This study demonstrates that GPR provides an appropriate method for quantifying soil water content at hillslope scale on the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The petrogenesis of intermediate magmas in arcs is a critical contribution to crustal growth. Andesites are commonly thought of as a hybrid product, the result of two endmember magmas mixing. At the Mount Baker volcanic field (MBVF), northern Cascade arc, andesites are the predominantly erupted lavas since 1 Ma and yet their origin is poorly constrained. Previous studies have suggested that open-system processes play a dominant role. However, the studies rely heavily on bulk rock compositions and overlook complex mineral textures and compositions. To better understand the complex processes at work at MBVF, we focus on establishing mineral and crystal clot populations in three andesitic flow units (55-59% SiO2). Petrographic and geochemical analyses suggest that variable-composition crystal clot and phenocryst populations in a single flow are related. We interpret the crystal clots to represent cumulates entrained in the erupting host magma and that related phenocrysts are disaggregates of crystal clots. The existence of common, multiple phenocryst and crystal clot populations in each flow of different age and SiO2 content provides strong evidence that intermediate magmas of MBVF are more than just the end product of mixing between two magmas. Furthermore, we suggest that most phenocrysts do not represent equilibrium products of their host liquid, evident from wide compositional ranges of ferromagnesian minerals (e.g. augite core Mg# 70-87). In fact, the most primitive phenocryst populations show the least amount of disequilibrium texture but represent assemblages expected to fractionate from basaltic to basaltic-andesitic liquids rather than equilibrium assemblages from their host bulk rock “liquid” composition. As a result, we interpret the variable SiO2 signature of the three andesitic flow units to have been obtained through the incorporation of cumulates/liquids as basaltic to basaltic-andesitic magma ascends.",

            "abstract": "Seismic wave attenuation is a promising attribute for the petroleum exploration, thanks to its high sensitivity to physical properties of subsurface. It can be used to enhance the seismic imaging and improve the geophysical interpretation which is crucial for reservoir characterization. However getting an accurate attenuation profile is not an easy task, this is due to complex mechanism of this parameter, although that many studies were carried out to understand it. The degree of difficulty increases for the media composed of carbonate rocks, known to be highly heterogeneous and with complex lithology. That is why few attenuation studies were done successfully in carbonate rocks.\nThe main objectives of this study are,\nGetting an accurate and high resolution attenuation profiles from several oil fields. The resolution is very important target for us, because many reservoirs in Abu Dhabi oil fields are tight.\nSeparation between different modes of wave attenuation (scattering and intrinsic attenuations).\nCorrelation between the attenuation profiles and other logs (Porosity, resistivity, oil saturation…), in order to establish a relationship which can be used to detect the reservoir properties from the attenuation profiles.\nComparison of attenuation estimated from VSP and sonic waveforms.\nProvide spatial distribution of attenuation in Abu Dhabi oil fields.\nTo reach these objectives we implemented a robust processing flow and new methodology to estimate the attenuation from the downgoing waves of the compressional VSP data and waveforms acquired from several wells drilled in Abu Dhabi. The subsurface geology of this area is primarily composed of carbonate rocks and it is known to be highly fractured which complicates more the situation, then we separated successfully the intrinsic attenuation from the scattering.\nThe results show that the scattering is significant and cannot be ignored. We found also a very interesting correlation between the attenuation profiles and the other petrophysical logs as the porosity, oil saturation, resistivity and fractures. We deduced that the combination between the scattering and the intrinsic attenuation is a promising and is very useful for the petroleum exploration, especially in the case of Abu Dhabi reservoirs known to be highly fractured.",

            "abstract": "A double layer (DL) is a nonlinear electrostatic structure consisting of two layers of opposite charge in the plasma, with a characteristic potential jump and unipolar electric field. Previous observations and simulations of DLs in the auroral region showed that those DLs are closely related to ion acoustic waves and typically propagate at ion sound speed. However, recent observation of DLs in the magnetosphere near the equator shows that some DLs propagate at a speed much greater than ion sound speed, inferring a different type of DL that may be associated with electron acoustic waves. In this study, we investigate the formation of DLs in two scenarios in the magnetosphere using particle-in-cell simulations. First, in a current-carrying uniform plasma, we artificially change the ion to electron mass ratio to study the transition from ion-acoustic DLs to electron-acoustic structures. Second, we study the formation of DLs at the boundary of two electron populations with different temperatures. These results may explain recent observations of different types of nonlinear electrostatic structures by Van Allen Probes.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving is responsible for nearly half of the mass lost from ice sheets to the oceans. However, a lack of a well-parameterized calving model leaves most numerical ice sheet models incomplete. Previous studies have sought to parameterize iceberg calving assuming that calving occurs when a surface crevasse intersects with a basal one. Although a variety of models have successfully reproduced patterns of glacier retreat, they are frequently tuned by adding melt water into surface crevasses until glacier behavior matches observations, which is puzzling because calving also occurs during winter when no melt water is available. Here we examine crevasse propagation using a 2D full-Stokes finite element model along the center flow of an idealized glacier terminating in ocean to see when water-free surface crevasses intersect with water-filled basal crevasses on a lubricated bed. Crevasse propagation is computed using the Nye zero-stress-model, assuming they have a negligible effect on the stress field of the glacier. We find that for a given water depth, simulated glaciers evolve to a state where either basal and surface crevasses intersect or the glacier begins to float. This allows us to map out a stability threshold that predicts for a given water depth if certain ice thicknesses will result in full thickness failure. Assuming seeds for crevasses are present everywhere, this threshold poses an upper limit on ice thickness: as the thickness decreases full thickness penetration is increasingly likely. Comparing our theoretical stability threshold with observational data deduced from Operation IceBridge, we find that most tidewater glaciers have water depth and ice thickness combinations fall in a narrow region above our predicted threshold and below buoyancy. The agreement between observations and our simulations suggests that glaciers evolve until they approach a critical stability threshold where small perturbations can trigger calving events. The stability diagram provides a simple relationship between ice thickness and water depth that can be implemented in numerical ice sheet models to simulate iceberg calving. Furthermore our results allow us to predict not only the conditions when ice tongues are likely to form and when the terminus is likely to remain grounded, but also a distribution of iceberg sizes.",

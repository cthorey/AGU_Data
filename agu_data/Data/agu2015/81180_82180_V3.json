            "abstract": "We report observation and analysis of 23 distinct hot spots on Io from images taken in November of 2011 on the 10-m W.M. Keck II telescope. The observations were obtained with 8 different near-infrared (1-5 μm) filters, although no hot spots were detected at the smallest wavelength filters of Hc (1.58 μm) and Kc (2.27 μm). The radiant flux of each hot spot at the different wavelengths was found, which allowed for 1-T and 2-T blackbody fits to obtain estimates of the temperature, emission area, and subsequently, the total radiant output. Global maps over a cylindrical coordinate system were also constructed at each wavelength.\nIn general, Io appeared to be fairly quiescent compared to datasets obtained between 2001 and 2010, with no significant outburst at any particular hot spot. Using GIS software it was possible to create surface maps that display the changes in some of the major hot spots observed between 2001 and 2011. The analysis of these maps and comparison to observations at different time periods will help to further construct a timeline of Io’s volcanic activity, which will lead to a better understanding of the variations in surface heat flow over time, the global distribution of hot spots, and the style of eruptions.",

Four eddy covariance systems were situated along an elevation gradient in Idaho’s Owyhee Mountains. The sites are part of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory and contribute to an ongoing long-term environmental monitoring network in the USDA’s Reynold’s Creek Experimental Watershed. The sites include a Wyoming big sagebrush site, a low sagebrush site, a post-fire mountain big sagebrush site, and a mountain big sagebrush site located at elevations of 1425, 1680, 1808 and 2111 m. Variations in climate follow the montane elevation gradient; mean annual precipitation at the sites is 290, 337, 425, and 795 mm, respectively, and mean annual temperature is 8.9, 8.4, 6.1, 5.4°C. Transpiration peaked about a month earlier at the lower elevation sites, but with limited precipitation the vegetation also encountered water stress much earlier. The two higher elevation sites experienced relatively little water stress and transpired at near potential for most of the growing season. Implications on water use efficiency were investigated.",

            "abstract": "Since 2009 there has been an increase in rate of seismicity in the Central US (CUS), a major fraction of which has been associated with shale gas production and related wastewater injection. Within this context it is important to discriminate between seismic activity that is anthropogenically induced from that arising from natural tectonic deformation. This discrimination is particularly challenging because tectonic strain rates and natural seismicity rates are low in this intraplate region, such that tectonically active faults may display periods of quiescence that are long (100’s to 1000’s of years) relative to the short (10’s of years) instrumental record. In addition, causative faults are unknown with a poor surface expression, both types of seismicity occur on or reactivate ancient faults in the Precambrian basement, and the instrumental seismic record is sparse. While seismicity provides information about the short-term history of deformation on the involved faults, the long-term is missing. Seismic reflection data offer a means by which to interrogate the long-term history of these faults, which can be discriminatory. In this paper we present examples from two regions of the CUS. The first region shows examples of tectonically active faults within the northern Mississippi Embayment south of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, which were imaged by a high-resolution seismic reflection survey along the Mississippi River. The faults deform Quaternary alluvium and underlying sediments dating from Tertiary through Paleozoic, with increasing amount of deformation with formation age, suggesting a long history of activity. The second region shows examples from the North Texas basin, a region of ongoing shale gas exploitation. Here, industry seismic reflection data image basement faults showing deformation of the Precambrian and Paleozoic sequences, and little to no deformation of younger formations. Specifically, vertical offsets, if any, in the post-Pennsylvanian formations are below the resolution of the seismic data (<~7m), far less than one would expect to have accumulated had these faults been active over the long term, as observed on faults in the first region. The lack of recent deformation suggests that current seismicity on North Texas faults may be due to an induced reactivation of inactive faults.",

In this contribution, we overview basic algorithms to load relativistic Maxwell distributions in PIC and Monte-Carlo simulations. For stationary relativistic Maxwellian, the inverse transform method and the Sobol algorithm are reviewed. To boost particles to obtain relativistic shifted-Maxwellian, two rejection methods are newly proposed in a physically transparent manner. Their acceptance efficiencies are 􏰅50% for generic cases and 100% for symmetric distributions. They can be combined with arbitrary base algorithms.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - posterAGU2015KJonsdottirFINAL.pdf\nThe subglacial Bárðarbunga volcano is composed of a large oval caldera (7x11 km) and fissures extending tens of kilometers away from the caldera along the rift zone, which marks the divergent plate boundary across Iceland. On August 16th, 2014 an intense seismic swarm started below the Bárðarbunga caldera and in the two weeks that followed a dyke migrated some 47 km laterally in the uppermost 6-10 km of the crust along the rift. The dyke propagation terminated in lava fields just north of Vatnajökull glacier, where a major (1.5 km3) six months long eruption took place. Intense earthquake activity in the caldera started in the period August 21-24 with over 70 M5 earthquakes accompanying slow caldera collapse, as verified by various geodetic measurements. The subsidence is likely due to magma withdrawal from a reservoir at depth beneath the caldera. During a five months period, October-February, the seismic activity was separated by over 30 km in two clusters; one along the caldera rims (due to piecewise caldera subsidence) and the other at the far end of the dyke (as a result of small shear movements). Here we present statistical analysis comparing the temporal behaviour of seismicity recorded in the two clusters. By comparing the earthquake rate in the dyke in temporal bins before and after caldera subsidence earthquakes to the rate away from these bins (background rate), we show that the number of dyke earthquakes was significantly higher (p <0.05) in the period 0-3 hours before a large earthquake (>M4.6) in the caldera. Increased dyke seismicity was also observed 0-3 hours following a large caldera earthquake. Elevated seismicity in the dyke before a large caldera earthquake may occur when a constriction in the dyke was reduced, followed by pressure drop in the chamber. Assuming that the large caldera earthquakes occurred when chamber pressure was lowest, the subsiding caldera piston may have caused temporary higher pressure in the dyke and thereby increased the likelihood of an earthquake. Our results thus suggests mechanical coupling over long distances between the distal end of the dyke and the magma chamber and support a simple plumbing system.",

            "abstract": "Moderate to large earthquakes often nucleate within and propagate through carbonates in the shallow crust, therefore several field and experimental studies were recently aimed to constrain earthquake-related deformation processes within carbonate fault rocks.\nIn particular, the occurrence of thick belts (10-100s m) of low-strain fault-related breccias (average size of rock fragments >1 cm), which is relatively common within carbonate damage zones, was generally interpreted as resulting from the quasi-static growth of fault zones rather than from the cumulative effect of multiple earthquake ruptures.\nHere we report the occurrence of up to hundreds of meters thick belts of intensely fragmented dolostones along the major transpressive Foiana Fault Zone (Italian Southern Alps) which was exhumed from < 2 km depth. Such dolostones are reduced into fragments ranging from few centimeters down to few millimeters in size with ultrafine-grained layers in proximity to the principal slip zones. Preservation of the original bedding indicates a lack of significant shear strain in the fragmented dolostones which seem to have been shattered in situ.\nTo investigate the origin of the in-situ shattered rocks, the host dolostones were deformed in uniaxial compression both under quasi-static loading (strain rate ~10-3 s-1) and dynamic loading (strain rate >50 s-1). Dolostones deformed up to failure under low-strain rate were affected by single to multiple discrete (i.e. not interconnected) extensional fractures sub-parallel to the loading direction. Dolostones deformed under high-strain rate were shattered above a strain rate threshold of ~200 s-1(strain >1.2%) while they were split in few fragments or were macroscopically intact for lower strain rates. Experimentally shattered dolostones were reduced into a non-cohesive material with most rock fragments a few millimeters in size and elongated parallel to the loading direction.\nFracture networks were investigated by X-ray microtomography showing that low- and high-strain rate damage patterns are different with the latter being similar to that of natural in-situ shattered dolostones. In-situ shattered dolostones are thus interpreted as the product of off-fault dynamic stress wave loading and can potentially be used to constrain coseismic energy release in fault zones.",

Toaldo was interested in astrometeorology and was the prime mover and the first director of the Astronomic Observatory where he carried out valuable daily observations on both fields. He also taught astronomy and meteorology at the University of Padua.\nThe data was collected from different historical document sources including the original manuscripts made by Toaldo which also contain meteorological readings. A total of 148 aurorae events were recovered from Toaldo's manuscripts. The data reliability was validated using time and season, percentage of the moon illuminated and aurorae directionality.\nThe data shows a secular maximum of the auroral activity around 1780 that occurred at planetary scale. From 1789 onwards there is a sharp decrease of this activity marking the onset of the Dalton Minimum although the solar activity decreases less rapidly.

This unique geometry allows us to conduct multiple and almost simultaneous in-situ measurements through the same low-latitude plasma depletion to investigate their spatial coherence and the motion of structures embedded within the equatorial plasma bubbles. We have used the number density measured with the Electric Field Instrument (EFI) on-board the three satellites of the SWARM constellation during December 2013 and January 2014 and concurrent TEC values obtained by ground-based GPS receivers to fully diagnose the bubble characteristics at multiple scale sizes. We have applied correlation and cross-spectra analysis to the density values measured by the EFI probes to derive the longitudinal variability of plasma density structures and their velocity. Our results indicate a very strong variability of the plasma bubbles in longitude. More specifically, it shows that structures with scale sizes corresponding to 100 and 10 seconds are not in phase. TEC values measures on the ground indicated that TEC plasma depletions moved with a velocity of order 100 m/s and have a westward tilt of order 10°. This presentation will show results for several specific days of SWARM observations during passes in the American sector.",

In addition to newly acquired high-resolution data (ground pixel size of about 20 cm) from the 2015 summer season, the focus will be placed on a new, open-hardware based L1 phase GNSS UAV positioning system. High resolution plane locations collected by the new system enables processing of aerial photos and subsequent high quality DEM creation by SfM without a ground control point network. Such capabilities are very convenient for monitoring very hard to access study sites at which establishing a stable ground control point network is almost impossible. The accuracy of the acquired data is assessed by comparison with a LiDAR reference DEM for both cases, processing with and without utilising a ground control point network.",

Here, we will demonstrate a concept to use the DigitalCrust framework for explaining the variance observed in groundwater chemistry in North America.\nWe combine 3D gridded fields of lithological data with hydrogeological information (e.g. permeability, residence time) and field measurements of major ion groundwater chemistry to improve our understanding of geochemical reactions in the critical zone (The term “critical zone” is used to describe the Earth’s permeable near-surface layer, from the top of the trees to the bottom of the groundwater). While previous empirical assessments of these reactions usually used 2D information, the new data infrastructure of the Digital Crust allows assessing a 3D contributing volume for each groundwater chemistry location. The attributes of this volume will be related to the chemical characteristics of the groundwater.\nThe results of this study will improve our understanding of geochemical interactions in the critical zone and geochemical fluxes to the ocean. At the same time it will demonstrate the potential of the Digital Crust as basis for innovative thematic research across disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Drought conditions vary tremendously from place to place and week to week. Accurate and timely agricultural drought monitoring is essential to understand each drought event, its progression and potential effects, and to provide information to support drought mitigation decisions. Monitoring is improved by integrating information that is timely and region-specific to identify droughts where and when they are happening. The Vegetation Drought Response Index or VegDRI, currently operational across the lower-48 states of the U.S., is a hybrid drought monitoring and mapping tool. VegDRI models integrate satellite observations of vegetation status and climate data with information on land cover, soil characteristics, and other environmental factors to isolate the specific effects of drought on satellite-measured vegetation condition. Developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center and the National Drought Mitigation Center, this index has been applied in the U.S. since 2009 to support national drought monitoring. Recently, the method has been adapted for application in southern Canada using a much sparser in situ climate network and satellite-derived data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Current research showing VegDRI models and maps in adjacent regions of Canada and the U.S. highlighted the sensitivity of VegDRI to known agricultural drought events in Canada over a 15 year period. Preliminary results showed 71% agreement in drought classes between the two countries, with 98% of pixels within 2 categories.",

            "abstract": "Tracer-based, lumped parameter models (LPMs) are an appealing way to estimate the distribution of age for groundwater because the cost of sampling wells is often less than building numerical groundwater flow models sufficiently complex to provide groundwater age distributions. In practice, however, tracer datasets are often incomplete because of anthropogenic or terrigenic contamination of tracers, or analytical limitations. While age interpretations using such datsets can have large uncertainties, it may still be possible to identify key parts of the age distribution if LPMs are carefully chosen to match hydrogeologic conceptualization and the degree of age mixing is reasonably estimated.\nWe developed a systematic approach for evaluating groundwater age distributions using LPMs with a large but incomplete set of tracer data (3H, 3Hetrit, 14C, and CFCs) from 535 wells, mostly used for public supply, in the Central Valley, California, USA that were sampled by the USGS for the California State Water Resources Control Board Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment or the USGS National Water Quality Assessment Programs. In addition to mean ages, LPMs gave estimates of unsaturated zone travel times, recharge rates for pre- and post-development groundwater, the degree of age mixing in wells, proportion of young water (<60 yrs), and the depth of the boundary between post-development and predevelopment groundwater throughout the Central Valley. Age interpretations were evaluated by comparing past nitrate trends with LPM predicted trends, and whether the presence or absence of anthropogenic organic compounds was consistent with model results. This study illustrates a practical approach for assessing groundwater age information at a large scale to reveal important characteristics about the age structure of a major aquifer, and of the water supplies being derived from it.",

Based on stable water isotopes in crop stem and soil water, we investigated seasonal variations in water uptake patterns for summer maize influenced by amount of fertilization application during 2013 and 2014 in Beijing, China. The Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) and direct inference method were used to determine water uptake depth and proportional soil water contribution to summer maize. The results showed that the main soil water source for summer maize was 0-20 cm at seeding (67.7%) and jointing stages (60.5%). Water at deep soil depths (50-90 cm and 90-200 cm) was tended to be extracted as crop grew, even up to 45.2% at grain filling stage. About 72.0% of crop water was sourced from soil water at 0-50 cm depth at maturity stage. However, pronounced differences of water uptake for summer maize with different nitrogen application rate were presented at depths of 0-20 and 20-50 cm during tasseling and grain filling stages, ranging from 5.4% to 68.9%. Comparing water uptake patterns in two experimental seasons, it was largely concentrated at 0-50 cm depth in 2013. This might be due to continuous rainfall before tasselling stage promoted crop root development in shallow soil depth. On the other hand, seasonal drought resulted in 27.2% more deep soil water contribution at grain filling stage in 2014 than that in 2013. These findings can provide quantitative implications for further studies on water flow and nitrate transport in agricultural filed.",

The linear array (BB) is 180 m long and comprises 7 broadband three-component 1-Hz seismometers. Automatic algorithms are used to detect P and S body waves and fault zone head and trapped waves. Statistical analyses of P body wave travel times of 765 events, occurring during 2012-2014 within a 110 by 20 km window centered along the length of the Clark fault, show a 0.6-0.8 % gradual increase in slowness from the SW most (BB01) to the NE most (BB07) station. The results suggest the NE most stations overlie a zone of greater damage. Sharp velocity contrasts across the fault are imaged using fault zone head waves. In total, 72 events (within the same 110 by 20 km window) are found to produce phases with clear head wave characteristics. Further analysis of the candidate events leads to the characterization of two separate groups. The first, consisting of 51 events within approximately 11 km epicentral distance from the array, shows a clear increase of head to P body wave differential times with increasing along fault distance. Based on this moveout, an average velocity contrast across of the fault of 4 % (SW block is slower) is calculated for the portion of the Clark Fault beneath the array. Differential times for the second group show no moveout with along fault distance, suggesting a local secondary bimaterial interface with limited along-strike and/or depth extent. Events located in a broad region that also includes the San Andreas and Elsinore Faults produce candidate trapped waves that are most clear at stations BB05, BB06 and BB07 (the three NE most stations). Waveform modeling results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Soil water flow in macropores is subject to different process controls than water flow in the soil matrix. Depending on macropore areal concentration, size distribution and tortuosity, they can lead to an abrupt increase in infiltration. In the saprolitic soils of Central Panama, macropores are ubiquitous and originate from the processes of soil shrinkage upon drying, growth and decay of roots and burrowing animals. Our experiment data show that macropores have great impact on infiltration and runoff production. Existing models based on soil physics take into account preferential flow using either dual continuum, dual porosity or dual permeability assumptions, but are still rooted firmly in the Richards equation. Our research is taking a different numerical approach by extending the improved Talbot-Ogden (T-O) 1-D finite water-content infiltration method, which discretizes the soil not in space but in the water-content domain and provides the opportunity to mathematically describe non-Darcian flows through high Bond number flow paths. The entire watershed is discretized into cells and the water flow processes in each cell are simulated using a modified quasi 1-D extended T-O approach. Provided that the density of the macropores is high enough that they are on-average well in contact with the soil matrix, the macropore in each cell can be treated as a moisture bin embedded in the matrix, dominated by gravity and pressure-driven flow physics. Interactions between flows in macropores and the soil matrix are governed by the conductivity of the macropore wall and the corresponding wetting contact angle. This presentation discusses simulation of macropore flow using non-Darcian flow physics, and the effects of macropore geometry and wall parameters on bulk infiltration and small catchment response. The simulation results are compared against measured discharge and tracer breakthrough.",

            "abstract": "Earth scientists are increasingly required to think across disciplines and utilize a wide range of datasets in order to solve complex environmental challenges. Although significant progress has been made in distributing data, researchers must still invest heavily in developing computational tools to accommodate their specific domain. Here we document our development of lightweight computational data systems aimed at enabling rapid data distribution, analytics and problem solving tools for Earth science applications. Our goal is for these systems to be easily deployable, scalable and flexible to accommodate new research directions. As an example we describe “Ice2Ocean”, a software system aimed at predicting runoff from snow and ice in the Gulf of Alaska region. Our backend components include relational database software to handle tabular and vector datasets, Python tools (NumPy, pandas and xray) for rapid querying of gridded climate data, and an energy and mass balance hydrological simulation model (SnowModel). These components are hosted in a cloud environment for direct access across research teams, and can also be accessed via API web services using a REST interface. This API is a vital component of our system architecture, as it enables quick integration of our analytical tools across disciplines, and can be accessed by any existing data distribution centers. We will showcase several data integration and visualization examples to illustrate how our system has expanded our ability to conduct cross-disciplinary research.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the impacts of climate change on landscape evolution has been a subject of intense research for past many years. Among the various impacts of climate change in landscapes is the influence of changing precipitation patterns on the re-organization of river network across the basin. Here, we investigate the effect of non-uniform spatio-temporal patterns of precipitations on the evolution of river networks. For this, we simulate river networks dynamics based on optimal channel network approach, on a prescribed two-dimensional lattice, under constant and varying spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation. For a given precipitation rate, the steady state river network (the optimal channel network) is obtained by finding a drainage pattern that minimizes the total energy of the network. This steady state river network is further perturbed with non-uniform rainfall patterns and its dynamics are recorded. We show that under non-uniform rainfall conditions, river networks significantly re-organize themselves towards new steady states with different total energies. Although the reorganized river networks statistically follow similar bifurcation rules (Horton’s laws), they exhibit different geomorphological signatures. In particular, the re-organization on the landscape is mainly seen in the form of order based channel migration, basin capture and formation of new channels and basins. Based on an empirical slope-area relationship coupled with optimal channel network, we generate three-dimensional digital elevation models of the evolved landscape for further exploring the hillslope-channels interactions. Our results show the potential use of optimal channel networks as a simple and yet versatile method for exploring the effects of climate change on river networks.",

However, the existence of velocity anisotropy caused by aligned fractures introduces great challenge in reconstructing accurate medium properties. The number of elastic parameters for anisotropic media is much higher than that of elastic media, making anisotropic elastic-waveform inversion even more nonlinear and non-unique than isotropic elastic-waveform inversion. In addition, seismic data for many applications such as geothermal exploration and monitoring for enhanced geothermal systems are often acquired using sparsely distributed sources and receivers. We develop an anisotropic elastic-waveform inversion method with a compressive sensing technique for characterizing fracture zones using sparse seismic data. Rather than inverting for a reference velocity and Thomsen’s anisotropic parameters that are based on weak anisotropy assumption, we directly invert for subsurface elasticity parameters with multicomponent seismic data. We employ a compressive sensing technique to handle sparsely acquired seismic data. Furthermore, we formulate the conventional least-squares-based elastic-waveform inversion problem into two minimization subproblems to improve the robustness and the convergence rate of the inverse problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new anisotropic elastic-waveform inversion with compressive sensing using synthetic and field sparse seismic data.",

With a multiple fiber-amplifier-based Swept-Frequency Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave (SF-IM-CW) high-power laser transmitter and a multiple-aperture receiver, the ACES system provides simultaneous measurements of the differential optical depth at the 1571-nm CO2 absorption line and the associated range between the transmitter and target on an airborne platform. The precise measurement of the CO2 differential optical depth and the range, determined by signal amplitudes and phases in the ACES returns, together with the temperature, pressure, and water vapor information at the same location, make it possible to retrieve the column-averaged CO2 dry air mixing ratio (XCO2). The Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) of both return-signal amplitudes and phases of three simultaneously-received SF-IM-CW signals in the ACES system directly affect the measurement precision of the differential optical depths and the ranges between the ACES system and the Earth’s surface or the tops of intermediate cloud layers. In this paper, we present results from numerical simulations and experimental measurements of ACES SNRs based on the laboratory-determined system parameters and flight experiments over ocean and land areas. These results will be used in the design of an IM-CW CO2 Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar system for ASCENDS mission.",

The observed land-atmosphere coupling (LAC) strength was assessed by means of correlation coefficients R and “sensitivity indices” I (a measure of the comparative change in an atmospheric variable for a one-standard-deviation change in soil moisture).\nIn the current study, we evaluate similar features of LAC in global predictions generated by version 5.1 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.1), when coupled to the CLM4 land model and downscaled to the ARM SGP site. Each day’s prediction was made after initializing the CAM5 atmosphere with ERA Interim reanalysis state variables, while other needed variables were obtained from a nudging simulation. In addition, the CLM4 daily initial conditions were determined by running the land model offline using observed surface net radiation, precipitation, and wind as forcings.\nDifferent aspects of LAC in the CAM5 will be compared with those found in the ARM observations during the summers of 2003-2011, when 3 independent measurements of soil moisture are available to provide an estimate of the inherent uncertainties in the LAC strengths determined from the ARM observations. This evaluation may uncover some unrealistic aspects of LAC in the CAM5 model that point toward potential deficiencies in its land or atmospheric model parameterizations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and was performed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Zambia is a major hotspot for agricultural development in the African savannas, which will be targeted for agricultural expansion to relieve food shortages and economic insecurity in the next few decades. Recent scholarship rejects the assumption that the large reserves of arable land in the African savannas could be converted to cropland with low ecological costs. In light of these findings, the selection of land for agricultural expansion must consider not only its potential productivity, but also the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss that would result from the land conversion. To examine these tradeoffs, we have developed a multi-objective optimization technique to seek scenarios for agricultural development in Zambia that simultaneously achieve production targets and minimize carbon, biodiversity, and economic cost constraints, while factoring in the inter-annual variability in crop production in this highly uncertain climate. Potential production is determined from well-characterized yield potential estimates while robust metrics of biodiversity and high resolution mapping of carbon storage provide fine scale estimates of ecological impact. We draw production targets for individual crops from potential development pathways, primarily export, commodity-crop driven expansion and identify ecologically responsible agricultural development scenarios that are resilient to climate change and meet these demands. In order to achieve a doubling of production of nine key crops, assuming a modest 20% overall increase in yield potential, we find a range of scenarios that use less than 1600 km2 of new land without infringing on any protected areas or exceeding 6.7 million tons of carbon emissions.",

            "abstract": "Arc magmatism is causally related to the recycling of materials from the subducting plate. Numerous studies showed that the recycled material flux is dominated by recycled continental crust (oceanic sediment, eroded crust) and altered oceanic igneous crust (AOC). The crustal component is highly enriched, and thus its signal in arc magmas can readily be distinguished from mantle wedge contributions. In contrast, the impact of the AOC flux is much more difficult to detect, since the AOC isotopically resembles the mantle. Mass balance studies of arc input and output suggest that the recycled flux from the thick (6000 meter on average) AOC may buffer the flux of the recycled continental crust to the point of concealment in arc settings where the latter is volumetrically minor. In particular, highly fluid- mobile elements Sr and Pb in arc magmas are strongly influenced by the AOC, implying that the arc chemistry may allow for inferring the Sr and Pb isotopic composition of the subducted AOC.\nThis hypothesis is being tested by a compilation of published data of high-quality trace element and isotope compositions from global arcs. In agreement with previous studies, our results confirm that the Sr-rich fluids released from the AOC control the arc Sr isotopes, whereby the slightly elevated 87Sr/86Sr (up to 0.705) of many arcs may principally reflect the similarly elevated Sr isotope ratios of the AOC rather than a recycled crustal component. In contrast, the arc Pb isotope ratios are influenced by both the AOC and the recycled crustal component which create the typical binary mixing arrays. These arrays should then point to the Pb isotope composition of the AOC and the recycled crust, respectively. However, as the proportions of these end members may strongly vary in arc magmas, the exact 206Pb/204Pb of the subducted AOC in a given setting is challenging. Remarkably, the Pb isotope systematics from well-constrained western Aleutian (minimal sediment subduction) and central Mexican (dominated by recycling of eroded crust) arcs imply a similar unradiogenic Pb of the recycled AOC at 206Pb/204Pb ~18.1. Tentatively, these results suggest that the AOC subducted in the past may be more unradiogenic on average than mean composition inferred from the erupted magmas along the active mid-oceanic ridges.",

Leaf water potential, a measure of the force exerted by the evaporation of water from the leaf surface, is an indicator of plant water stress and can help predict tree mortality in response to drought. Scientists have traditionally measured water potentials on a tree-by-tree basis, but have not been able to produce maps of tree water potential at the scale of a whole forest, leaving forest managers unaware of forest drought stress patterns and their ecosystem-level consequences. Imaging spectroscopy, a technique for remote measurement of chemical properties, has been used to successfully estimate leaf water potentials in wheat and maize crops and pinyon-pine and juniper trees, but these estimates have never been scaled to the canopy level. We used hyperspectral reflectance data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) to map leaf water potentials of giant sequoia trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in an 800-hectare grove in Sequoia National Park. During the current severe drought in California, we measured predawn and midday leaf water potentials of 48 giant sequoia trees, using the pressure bomb method on treetop foliage samples collected with tree-climbing techniques. The CAO collected hyperspectral reflectance data at 1-meter resolution from the same grove within 1-2 weeks of the tree-level measurements. A partial least squares regression was used to correlate reflectance data extracted from the 48 focal trees with their water potentials, producing a model that predicts water potential of giant sequoia trees. Results show that giant sequoia trees can be mapped in the imagery with a classification accuracy of 0.94, and we predicted the water potential of the mapped trees to assess 1) similarities and differences between a leaf water potential map and a canopy water content map produced from airborne hyperspectral data, 2) spatial variability in leaf water potentials and, 3) relationships between water potential and tree leaf area, topography, and surrounding tree density. These results will help forest managers plan prescribed burns to maintain the health of giant sequoia trees during drought.",

These flares are referred to as confined flares, which are not associated with mass or energetic particles leaving the Sun. However, electrons are accelerated to MeV energies as indicated by the presence of microwave emission with a turnover frequency of ~15 GHz (Gopalswamy et al. 2009, IAU Symposium 257, p. 283). In this paper, we extend the study of confined flares to lower soft X-ray flare sizes (M and above) that occurred in the time window of the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). We also make use of the microwave spectral information from the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP). During 1996 – 2014, NoRH and NoRP observed 663 flares with size M1.0 or larger. Using the CME observations made by SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/SECCHI, we found 215 flares with definite CME association (eruptive flares) and 202 flares that definitely lacked CMEs (confined flares). The remaining 146 flares whose CME association is unclear are excluded from the analysis. We examined the peak brightness temperature and the spatial size obtained by NoRH. Although there is a large overlap between the two populations in these properties, we found that microwave sources with the largest spatial extent and highest brightness temperature are associated with eruptive flares. Spectral analysis using NoRP data showed a tendency that more confined flares had higher turnover frequency (≥17 GHz). We also compare the NoRH images with the photospheric magnetograms to understand the difference in the magnetic structure of the two types of flare sources.",

            "abstract": "In most space and ground-based Earth observations, the accuracy with which objects can be positioned depends ultimately on the accuracy of the underlying terrestrial reference frame (TRF). For example, errors in the currently available TRFs could account for as much as 15% of the observed sea level rise signal. Determination of a TRF typically involves precise estimation of the positions and velocities of surface stations using decades of space geodetic observations. The model of station motions needs to address heterogeneous time scales including secular drifts of plate tectonics and seasonal periodicities due to atmospheric and ground water loadings. Seismic events and post-seismic relaxation tend to lead to discontinuities in the observation time series, which become sources of nonlinearity in the estimation problem. The state dimension of the smoothing problem is usually on the order of ten thousands, which is two to four orders of magnitude smaller than that of a typical atmospheric and ocean data assimilation problem. However, TRF requires a precision of 1mm in position out of a mean dynamic range of about 1 meter, as well as a full posterior error covariance matrix. These requirements challenge the available computation capabilities. Moreover, the use of prior models are kept minimal to prevent introduction of biases in the observations, leading to a smoothing problem that involves matrices with relatively high condition numbers. A filter/smoother solution based on the information matrix is desirable here since the prior model tends to be only partial or implicit. A \"square-root\" solution is also desirable since a major source of numerical instability is round-off error affecting positive definiteness of covariance and information matrices. The well-known Square-Root Information Filter followed by the Dyer-McReynolds Covariance Smoother seem suitable although this approach requires a large array for Householder transformations. The Modified Bryson-Frazier smoother and a new information filter/smoother require only a single matrix inversion per time step for the entire procedure, while not offering numerical stability of a square-root approach. These methods are applied to emulate the ITRF2008 solution, a TRF standard, in order to evaluate computational advantages of each method.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_A_Irani_Rahaghi_poster2.pdf\nAn improved understanding of surface transport processes is necessary to predict sediment, pollutant and phytoplankton patterns in large lakes. Lake surface water temperature (LSWT), which varies in space and time, reflects meteorological and climatological forcing more than any other physical lake parameter. There are different data sources for LSWT mapping, including remote sensing and in situ measurements. Satellite data can be suitable for detecting large-scale thermal patterns, but not meso- or small scale processes. Lake surface thermography, investigated in this study, has finer resolution compared to satellite images. Thermography at the meso-scale provides the ability to ground-truth satellite imagery over scales of one to several satellite image pixels. On the other hand, thermography data can be used as a control in schemes to upscale local measurements that account for surface energy fluxes and the vertical energy budget. Independently, since such data can be collected at high frequency, they can be also useful in capturing changes in the surface signatures of meso-scale eddies and thus to quantify mixing processes.\nIn the present study, we report results from a Balloon Launched Imaging and Monitoring Platform (BLIMP), which was developed in order to measure the LSWT at meso-scale. The BLIMP consists of a small balloon that is tethered to a boat and equipped with thermal and RGB cameras, as well as other instrumentation for location and communication. Several deployments were carried out on Lake Geneva. In a typical deployment, the BLIMP is towed by a boat, and collects high frequency data from different heights (i.e., spatial resolutions) and locations. Simultaneous ground-truthing of the BLIMP data is achieved using an autonomous craft that collects a variety of data, including in situ surface/near surface temperatures, radiation and meteorological data in the area covered by the BLIMP images. With suitable scaling, our results show good consistency between in situ, BLIMP and concurrent satellite data. In addition, the BLIMP thermography reveals (hydrodynamically-driven) structures in the LSWT – an obvious example being mixing of river discharges.",

            "abstract": "The Salar de Atacama (SdA), a large endorheic basin adjacent to the Central Andes in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, has accumulated over 1800 km3 of evaporites and a lithium-rich brine since the late Miocene. Focused groundwater discharge in endorheic basins, such as those in the Chilean Altiplano, provide opportunities to investigate mechanisms for closing hydrologic budgets in arid regions. We demonstrate that modern evapotranspiration is 5 to 21 times greater than modern recharge from precipitation in the topographic watershed. Multiple lines of evidence including an adapted chloride mass balance method applied to remotely sensed precipitation estimates and sodium mass balance calculations support this conclusion. We contend that the missing water needed to close the extreme hydrologic imbalance of SdA is sourced from recharge on the orogenic plateau in an area over 4 times larger than the topographic watershed, augmented by transient draining of stored groundwater. Groundwater recharged during wetter periods in the late Pleistocene is still actively draining and discharging from storage without corresponding recharge into the system. Geologic evidence from the volume of evaporites deposited in the basin suggests that the SdA has been receiving significant amounts of fresh inflow waters over at least 7 Ma despite the region being hyperarid over the same time frame. Our conceptualization of the depositional model for evaporite accumulation necessitates the water table being at or close to the land surface. Subsidence associated with basin development has accommodated significant accumulation of these deposits thereby requiring the sustenance of fresh inflow waters during uplift of the Andean plateau. Sustained groundwater discharge to the basin requires long residence times, deep water tables and strong gradients in landscape and climate enabled by an uplifting plateau. The application of steady state assumptions to the modern hydrologic system are unsupported by observations and difficult to justify in this geologic setting with extremely low recharge rates and high topographic relief. These results have implications for lake-level based paleoclimatic reconstructions on the Altiplano-Puna plateau and conceptualizations of watershed boundaries near plateau margins.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of vegetation are vital to understand habitats and their provision of ecosystem services as well as having applications in satellite calibration, weather modelling and forestry. The majority of humans now live in urban areas and so understanding vegetation structure in these very heterogeneous areas is of importance.\nA number of previous studies have used airborne lidar (ALS) to characterise canopy height and canopy cover, but very few have fully characterised 3D vegetation, including understorey. Those that have either relied on leaf-off scans to allow unattenuated measurement of understorey or else did not validate.\nA method for creating a detailed voxel map of urban vegetation, in which the surface area of vegetation within a grid of cuboids (1.5m by 1.5m by 25 cm) is defined, from full-waveform ALS is presented. The ALS was processed with deconvolution and attenuation correction methods. The signal processing was calibrated and validated against synthetic waveforms generated from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, taken as “truth”. The TLS data was corrected for partial hits and attenuation using a voxel approach and these steps were validated and found to be accurate. The ALS results were benchmarked against the more common discrete return ALS products (produced automatically by the lidar manufacturer’s algorithms) and Gaussian decomposition of full-waveform ALS.\nThe true vegetation profile was accurately recreated by deconvolution. Far more detail was captured by the deconvolved waveform than either the discrete return or Gaussian decomposed ALS, particularly detail within the canopy; vital information for understanding habitats. In the paper, we will present the results with a focus on the methodological steps towards generating the voxel model, and the subsequent quantitative calibration and validation of the modelling approach using TLS. We will discuss the implications of the work for complete vegetation canopy descriptions in urban systems and consider broader uses in other landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Among the different types of volcanoes, basaltic ones usually form the most voluminous edifices. Because volcanoes are growing on a pre-existing landscape, the geologic and structural framework of the basement (and earlier volcanic landforms) influences the stress regime, seismicity, and volcanic activity. Conversely, the masses of these volcanoes introduce a morphological anomaly that affects neighboring areas. Growth of a volcano disturbs the tectonic framework of the region, clamps and unclamps existing faults (some of which may be reactivated by the new stress field), and deforms the substratum. A volcano’s weight on its basement can trigger edifice spreading and collapse that can affect populated areas even at significant distance. Volcano instability can also be driven by slow tectonic deformation and magmatic intrusion. The manifestations of instability span a range of temporal and spatial scales, ranging from slow creep on individual faults to large earthquakes affecting a broad area. Our work aims to investigate the relation between basement setting and volcanic activity and stability at Etna (Sicily, Italy), Kilauea (Island of Hawaii, USA) and Piton de la Fournaise (La Reunion Island, France). These volcanoes host frequent eruptive activity (effusive and explosive) and share common features indicating lateral spreading and collapse, yet they are characterized by different morphologies, dimensions, and tectonic frameworks. For instance, the basaltic ocean island volcanoes of Kilauea and Piton de la Fournaise are near the active ends of long hotspot chains while Mt. Etna has developed at junction along a convergent margin between the African and Eurasian plates and a passive margin separating the oceanic Ionian crust from the African continental crust. Magma supply and plate velocity also differ in the three settings, as to the sizes of the edifices and the extents of their rift zones. These volcanoes, due to their similarities and differences, coupled with their long-time and high-level monitoring networks, represent the best natural laboratories for investigating the manifestations and mechanisms of spreading and collapse, the feedback process between spreading and eruptive activity (especially along rift zones), and the role of the regional geodynamics.",

            "abstract": "The redistribution of winter accumulation from surface melt into firn or deeper layers (i.e. internal accumulation) remains a poorly understood component of glacier mass balance. Winter accumulation is usually quantified prior to summer melt, however the time window between accumulation and the onset of melt is minimal so this is not always possible. Studies which are initiated following the onset of summer melt either neglect sources of internal accumulation or attempt to estimate melt (and therefore winter accumulation uncertainty) through a variety of modeling methods. Here, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) repeat common midpoint (CMP) surveys with supporting common offset surveys, mass balance snow pits, and probing to estimate temporal changes in water content within the winter accumulation and firn layers of the southern Juneau Icefield, Alaska. In temperate glaciers, radio-wave velocity is primarily dependent on water content and snow or firn density. We assume density changes are temporally slow relative to water flow through the snow and firn pack, and therefore infer that changing radio-wave velocities measured by successive CMP surveys result from flux in surface melt through deeper layers. Preliminary CMP data yield radio-wave velocities of 0.15 to 0.2 m/ns in snowpack densities averaging 0.56 g cm-3, indicating partially to fully saturated snowpack (4-9% water content). Further spatial-temporal analysis of CMP surveys is being conducted. We recommend that repeat CMP surveys be conducted over a longer time frame to estimate stratigraphic water redistribution between the end of winter accumulation and maximum melt season. This information could be incorporated into surface energy balance models to further understanding of the influence of internal accumulation on glacier mass balance.",

It is somehow not well recognized by the lightning community that Jefimenko [1966] introduced a pair of electromagnetic equations that are related to general time-varying, three-dimensional current and charge density. Jefimenko [2004] has further proved that his equations are equivalent to the Maxwell equations but showed that they are more advantageous regarding the causality from the sources to the resultant fields. Although more general, it is not straightforward to apply the original Jefimeko equations to lightning electromagnetics since the fields depend not only on current but also on charge density, and each term in the equations is not solely related to the more conventional radiation, induction or the static fields. In this presentation, we derive the original Jefimenko equations one step further to show that they can be related solely to the source current, and we group the terms according to the more conventional radiation, induction and static components. The new forms of the Jefimenko equations are in agreement with Uman’s equations if a one-dimensional source current is considered. However, the new Jefimenko equations are three dimensional in nature and are expressed in general vectors and vector operators and therefore can be easily applied to lightning electromagnetic calculations for a more realistic, 3-d lightning current distributions.\nUman, M.

Formulations for fresh snow density have typically either used fixed values or been modeled empirically using field data that is limited to specific seasons or regions. There is also currently limited work exploring how the sensitivity to fresh snow density in regional climate models varies with resolution. Here, we present a new formulation compiled from (a) over 1600 distinct density profiles from multiple sources across Antarctica and (b) near-surface variables from the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale (MAR). Observed values represent coastal areas as well as the plateau, in both West and East Antarctica (although East Antarctica is dominant). However, no measurements are included from the Antarctic Peninsula, which is both highly topographically variable and extends to lower latitudes than the remainder of the continent. In order to assess the applicability of this fresh snow density formulation to the Antarctic Peninsula at high resolutions, a version of MAR is run for several years both at low-resolution at the continental scale and at a high resolution for the Antarctic Peninsula alone. This setup is run both with and without the new fresh density formulation to quantify the sensitivity of the energy balance and SMB components to fresh snow density. Outputs are compared with near-surface atmospheric variables available from AWS stations (provided by the University of Wisconsin Madison) as well as net accumulation values from the SAMBA database (provided from the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l'Environnement).",

            "abstract": "In satellite remote sensing, Landsat sensors are recognized for providing well calibrated satellite images for over four decades. This image data set provides an important contribution to detection and temporal analysis of land changes. Landsat 8 (L8), the latest satellite of the Landsat series, was designed to continue its legacy as well as to embrace advanced technology and satisfy the demand of the broader scientific community.\nSentinel 2A (S2A), a European satellite launched in June 2015, is designed to keep data continuity of Landsat and SPOT like satellites. The S2A MSI sensor is equipped with spectral bands similar to L8 OLI and includes some additional ones. Compared to L8 OLI, green and near infrared MSI bands have narrower bandwidths, whereas coastal-aerosol (CA) and cirrus have larger bandwidths. The blue and red MSI bands cover higher wavelengths than the matching OLI bands. Although the spectral band differences are not large, their combination with the spectral signature of a studied target can largely affect the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance seen by the sensors. This study investigates the effect of spectral band differences between S2A MSI and L8 OLI sensors.\nThe differences in spectral bands between sensors can be assessed by calculating Spectral Band Adjustment Factors (SBAF). For radiometric calibration purposes, the SBAFs for the calibration test site are used to bring the two sensors to the same radiometric scale. However, the SBAFs are target dependent and different sensors calibrated to the same radiometric scale will (correctly!) measure different reflectance for the same target. Thus, when multiple sensors are used to study a given target, the sensor responses need to be adjusted using SBAFs specific to that target. Comparison of the SBAFs for S2A MSI and L8 OLI based on various vegetation spectral profiles revealed variations in radiometric responses as high as 15%. Depending on target under study, these differences could be even higher.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is a key sector of the Argentinean economy, accounting for 6 to 8 5% of the GDP in the last ten years. Argentina switched in the 90´s from an articulated co-evolution between extensive livestock and crop farming, with annual rotation of crops and livestock, to intensive decoupled practices. Under these new production schemes, ecosystems were supplied with more nutrients, generating increasing levels of wastes. Other changes have also occurred, associated with the shift of the agricultural frontier and the consequent reduction in the cattle stock. In addition, changes related to climate through the strong increase in rainfall in the 80s and 90s in the west Pampas, helped to boost agricultural development. The agriculture sector accounts for practically all NH3 emissions in Argentina, however no inventory has been thus far available. To bridge this gap and particularly to have accurate input information to run coupled atmospheric chemistry models for secondary inorganic aerosols, we estimated 2000-2012 NH3 emissions, both at national and spatially disaggregated levels. Of particular interest for us was also temporal disaggregation as crops growing and temperature exhibit strong seasonal variability. As no NH3 inventory was available we also estimated related N2O emissions to verify our estimates with those of national GHG emission inventory (NEI). National NH3 emissions in 2012 amounted to 309.9 Gg, use of fertilizers accounted for 43.6%, manure management 18,9%, manure in pasture 36,0% and agricultural waste burning 1.5%. Our N2O estimates are in good agreement with the GHG-NEI. NH3 estimates in the EDGAR database for 2008 are 84.0% higher than ours for this year, and exhibit more significant differences per category, namely 113,6% higher for use of fertilizers and about 500% higher for agricultural waste burning. Urea dominates national NH3 emissions, accounting for 32,8% of the total and its use for wheat and corn crops dominates the trend.",

During apoapse mode the highly elliptical orbit of MAVEN allows for up to four apoapse disk images by IUVS per day. Maps of FUV feature intensities and intensity ratios as well as derived CO/CO2 and O/CO2 column density ratios will be shown. Column density ratios are derived from lookup tables created using the Atmospheric Ultraviolet Radiance Integrated Code [Strickland et al., 1999] in conjunction with observed intensity ratios. Column density ratios provide a measure of composition changes in the Martian atmosphere. Due to MAVEN's orbital geometry the observations from this time period focus on the southern hemisphere. The broad view provided by apoapse observations allows for the investigation of spatial and temporal variations (both long term and local time) of the atmospheric composition (via the column density ratios). IUVS FUV intensities and derived column density ratios will also be compared with model results from Mars Global Ionosphere/Thermosphere Model (MGITM) and the Mars Climate Database (MCD).",

            "abstract": "The location and timescales of silicic magma production has received much recent attention and these questions are at the forefront of understanding incubation times for eruptive episodes and ultimately, the production of continental crust. While idealizations of differentiation in simplified magma reservoir geometries have been useful to frame end-member behavior, most magmatic systems, and particular large magma reservoirs, are open systems with time varying geometries. Evidence of open systems and assembly of magmatic systems incrementally are present in a range of plutonic and volcanic rocks. To evaluate the timescales of silicic magma production, a 3D multiphase dynamics model was implemented that includes heat transfer, phase change and magma dynamics. The size of the magmatic systems under consideration are not prescribed, but rather grow or shrink in response to the flux of heat and intrusions. To compare simulations to a range of data, major element chemistry, phase assemblage, and tracking of representative crystals are made through time.\nA particular focus of this presentation is a comparison of dynamic processes to proxies used as chronometers. This includes recording the timescale of appearance of different phases that can be compared to timescales inferred from diffusion profiles and monitoring zircon saturation and dispersal. Both the differentiation timescale and timescales of the major growth of zircons are a relatively small fraction of the melt-present lifetime of magma reservoirs, and in particular, typically represent relatively smaller fractions for larger magmatic systems. Melt can exist at low melt fraction (<0.2) for timescales of 100s kyr for the largest systems, while spending only a small amount of time at high melt fraction. Nevertheless, these reservoirs can be assembled incrementally with magma fluxes in the ranges estimated for arcs. A mid-upper crust location is important to have phase assemblages with sufficient leverage to produce the most silicic magmas. A generalized view from these simulations is one in which magmas reside for long periods at low melt fraction, but where many chronometers and dynamics operate on much shorter timescales, reconciling some apparently inconsistent observations on the duration of magmatism.",

We pose the problem as a one-dimensional inversion of the depth along the thalweg, utilizing a strong-constraint formalism. The optimization problem is constructed around a cost function defined as the error between estimated and observed transverse mean water surface elevation along the river; the cost function is augmented by the SWEs (the constraints) using Lagrange multipliers. This mathematical construction allows the development of the adjoint SWEs, as well as the gradient of the cost function with respect to the maximum depth along the river, which can be computed from the forward and adjoint solutions. An iterative algorithm is used to obtain a bathymetric profile that results in water surface elevations that are a best fit to the data, as constrained by the governing equations. Defining the river cross-sectional profile as parabolic in nature, and presuming knowledge of discharge and bottom friction, the approach is shown to be effective in capturing large-scale bathymetric features. The algorithm has been vetted against synthetic data generated for two river-reaches: 2.5km of the Snohomish River in Washington State, and 17km of the Kootenai River in Idaho. These rivers were chosen due to the availability of high-resolution bathymetric data, as well as the significant difference in overall characteristics (e.g. mean slope). A range of river discharges and bottom frictions were used to generate the synthetic surface elevation datasets, using Delft3D as the hydrodynamic model. Overall, the results indicate that the approach is valid, with the algorithm performing best in shallower water (see figure). Initial results for joint estimation of river depth and discharge are also presented.",

            "abstract": "A plasma depletion layer (PDL) is predicted beyond the heliopause, analogous to the PDLs observed sunwards of the magnetopauses of Earth, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. The physics is that draping of interstellar (ISM) magnetic field lines over the heliopause should increase the magnetic field strength (and so the perpendicular ion temperature), cause density depletions by allowing plasma ions (and electrons) with large parallel temperatures to escape along the field, and increase the perpendicular to parallel temperature anisotropy until limited by wave instabilities. It is argued that published Voyager 1 magnetometer and plasma wave data beyond the heliopause provide strong evidence for the magnetic field amplification (by ≈ 30%) and density depletion (by ≈ 50%) expected for the PDL. The predicted reduction in parallel temperature is ≈ 50%. Using the ISM magnetic field direction obtained from the centroid of the IBEX Ribbon, the orientation of the PDL and the associated locations on the heliopause of the points of maximum magnetic field draping and maximum total pressure are predicted. It is observed that the IBEX Ribbon overlies the former while the latter lies within the ridge of maximum non-Ribbon ENA flux. The PDL should be strongest along the ISM field line passing through these points and the nominal Sun-ISM velocity vector. It is predicted that Voyager 2 lies within 5 degrees (≈ 10 AU) of the strong PDL region while Voyager 1 is over 15 degrees (≈ 35 AU) away. Thus Voyager 2 should observe a much stronger PDL (stronger magnetic field amplification, density depletions, and reductions in parallel temperature) than Voyager 1. Finally, the reduced cosmic ray fluxes observed near 90 degree pitchangle by Voyager 1 beyond the heliopause may be explained qualitatively in terms of magnetic focusing as cosmic rays propagate away from the stronger field regions of the PDL and magnetic draping region on the heliopause, assuming isotropic cosmic rays at the heliopause.",

Extreme shear weakening observed in laboratory friction experiments on silica-rich rocks has been explained by the formation of a hydrated amorphous ‘silica gel’ on the slip surface, but the mode of formation and deformation behavior of this material are not known. In addition, the wear material displays time-dependent strengthening on timescales of hours to days. We performed shearing experiments on chert rocks and analyzed the wear material formed at a range of slip rates from 10-4 – 10-1 m/s. We show by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction that silica lubrication is the result of the formation of amorphous nanopowder rather than a gel. The nanopowder has distinct structure and properties when compared to commercially available amorphous silica nanoparticles, which result from the degree and distribution of hydration and the style of bond strain within particles (observed by Raman spectroscopy and FTIR). The lubrication effect is due to intra-particle plasticity, even at low temperature and interparticle lubrication caused by trapping of water layers between hydrated surfaces. The hours to days timescale of healing may be explained by the natural time-dependent sintering between the hydrated surfaces of the nanopowder. Formation of amorphous silica nanopowders during slip can explain the general characteristics of earthquake ruptures, including the timescales of coseismic weakening and post-seismic healing.",

            "abstract": "Signs of unrest are usually detected in active volcanoes before the onset of eruptions. However, a few eruptions start suddenly without evident precursory activity or very short run-up time. The latter poses a challenge to volcano observatories regarding the capability to issue early warnings. Calbuco (42°S, Southern Andes) explosive event in April 2015 is a recent case where clear signs of unrest were detected shortly before the eruption of an andesitic magma (57% SiO2). In fact, although isolated low magnitude VT events were recorded 2 months before, the base level was only disturbed 3 hours before by an emergent seismic swarm of M<2.5 VT events, followed by 30 minutes of escalating LP and HB events. Calbuco erupted after 54 years of quiescence and no ground deformation was detected by InSAR or ground-based methods before the eruption. This short precursory activity is comparable to run-up times observed in basaltic to andesitic volcanoes. Previous authors have proposed a relationship between repose and run-up times. Repose time seems to be related with dynamics of plumbing systems (recharge and storage) and thus depends on the magma viscosity and hence magma composition. Others have shown that correlation between repose and run-up times is dependent of volcano typology. Here we expand the catalog and consider other factors as the crustal thickness, physical properties of the country rocks, depth of magma chambers and tectonic regime for all the reported eruptions with existing information. Our findings show that eruptions preceded by an extremely short unrest period occur mostly under conditions of favorable (tectonically-controlled) magma pathways unclamping, even in high-silica systems with large repose times.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - TopCAT_PySESA_AGU_2015.pdf\nThe increasing use of high-resolution topography (HRT) constructed from point clouds obtained from technology such as LiDAR, SoNAR, SAR, SfM and a variety of range-imaging techniques, has created a demand for custom analytical tools and software for point cloud decimation (data thinning and gridding) and spatially explicit statistical analysis of terrestrial surfaces. We will present on a number of analytical and computational tools designed to quantify surface roughness and texture, directly from point clouds in a variety of ways (using spatial- and frequency-domain statistics). TopCAT (Topographic Point Cloud Analysis Toolkit; Brasington et al., 2012) and PySESA (Python program for Spatially Explicit Spectral Analysis) both work by applying a small moving window to (x,y,z) data to calculate a suite of (spatial and spectral domain) statistics, which are then spatially-referenced on a regular (x,y) grid at a user-defined resolution.\nCollectively, these tools facilitate quantitative description of surfaces and may allow, for example, fully automated texture characterization and segmentation, roughness and grain size calculation, and feature detection and classification, on very large point clouds with great computational efficiency. Using tools such as these, it may be possible to detect geomorphic change in surfaces which have undergone minimal elevation difference, for example deflation surfaces which have coarsened but undergone no net elevation change, or surfaces which have eroded and accreted, leaving behind a different textural surface expression than before. The functionalities of the two toolboxes are illustrated with example high-resolution bathymetric point cloud data collected with multibeam echosounder, and topographic data collected with LiDAR.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Brian Crump Poster Final Draft TMDedits.pdf\nThe Gravity for the Redefinition of the American Vertical Datum (GRAV-D) project of NOAA’s National Geodetic Survey has been collecting airborne gravity data since 2008 using 3 TAGS gravimeters, S-137, S-160 and S-161 (Table 1). The 38 surveys contain 1697 gravimeter calibration readings taken when the aircraft is parked on the ground before and after each flight, called still readings. This dataset is uniquely suited to examine the drift characteristics of these instruments. This study is broken into 3 parts: re-computation of individual still reading values; examination of drift rates during flights and surveys; and examination of long term drift rates.\nRe-computation of still readings was accomplished by isolating the least-noisy 10-minute segment of gravity data while the aircraft was parked and the beam unclamped. This automated method worked in most cases, but a small number of readings required further examination. This method improved the consistency of pre- and post-flight still readings as compared to those recorded in the field. Preliminary results indicate that the drift rate for these 3 instruments during a typical survey period is both small (95% smaller than 0.35 mGal/day) and linear. The average drift rate during a survey is -0.11 mGal/day with a standard deviation of 0.12 mGal/day (Figure 1). Still readings for most surveys were well represented by a linear trend, but a small number have curvature or discontinuities. The nature and cause of this non-linearity will be investigated.\nEarly results show a long term linear drift rate for these 3 gravimeters between 0.01 and 0.04 mGal/day. There also appears to be significant non-linear variability. Comparing the 1.5-2 year time series of still readings from S-160 and S-161 with the 7.5 year time series for S-137, indicates that data from more than two years are needed to accurately characterize the long-term behavior. Instrumentation and processing causes for this non-linearity will be explored.\nTable1.

            "abstract": "Triaxial compression experiments were conducted on Fontainebleau sandstone at temperatures to 900°C and effective pressures to 175 MPa with varying water contents. Both yield and peak strengths associated with semibrittle faulting decrease linearly with an increase in intragranular water concentration (COH); COH is determined from infrared spectroscopy. Microstructural observations and the influence of strain rate, temperature, and COH on peak strength suggest that transient semibrittle flow is accommodated through cataclasis assisted by stress-corrosion microcracking. The roles of the experimental variables on the constitutive behavior are similar to those reported for subcritical cracking of quartz single crystals. At high COH, microstructural observations indicate an increase in the relative contribution of mm-scale distributed shear fractures (bands) to axial strain, reflecting a reduction in grain-scale fracture toughness. This is consistent with the inference that highly dissipative shear fractures lead to the observed reduction in strength at high COH. Stress vs. strain rate data for transient semibrittle flow show temperature-dependent rate behavior, and are well fit by an exponential law with an activation enthalpy of 185 to 250 kJ/mol and Peierls stress of 2.5 to 7.5 GPa. Using these constraints, we infer that stress-corrosion cracking is rate-limited by the dislocation activity at crack tips. Correlation of microscale COH maps to microstructures suggests that intragranular water in the undeformed sandstone is associated mainly with clusters of fluid inclusions, resulting in a highly nonuniform distribution of COH both within and between grains. Axially deformed samples show a reduction in the median and variability of COH over a range of length scales. We observe that a local reduction in COH correlates with fluid inclusions that are decrepitated and crosscut by intragranular fractures. We conclude that intragranular fracture is the primary mechanism of water transport in our experiments.",

            "abstract": "The drifting and blowing of snow due to atmospheric turbulence is a significant process in the context of hydrology, avalanche forecasting, and micrometeorology in alpine and polar regions. Spatial variability in snow deposition, erosion, and transport due to turbulence can lead to large spatial variations in snowpack depth, which is a determining factor for the timing of surface runoff. In mountainous regions, blowing snow can also lead to the formation of snow cornices on the leeward side of mountain peaks, thereby increasing avalanche risk. Despite the importance of snow transport, only a few studies that account for the effects of turbulent airflow on snow erosion, transport, and deposition over complex topography have been conducted to date.\nIn this study, we investigate the effects of turbulence on snow deposition and erosion in complex terrain using large eddy simulation (LES). A finite-volume Eulerian code for heavy particles is used to evolve the snow concentration field, and wall models are developed for the snow erosion and deposition fluxes. The surface topography is represented using an immersed boundary method following the direct forcing approach. We conduct simulations of snow deposition and erosion over realistic and idealized surface topography. An area source of particles is imposed near the top of the boundary layer. The relationships between the topography, turbulent flow structures, and snow erosion and deposition will be explored, and numerical considerations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The potential for annual solar energy production largely depends on the amount of incoming shortwave radiation which is dependent on cloud cover. Due to natural large-scale climate variability, long-term cloud cover can vary substantially, therefore modifying the total energy that can be produced by solar cells in individual locations. Under anthropogenic climate change, future precipitation is expected to significantly deviate from observed values, therefore suggesting that cloud cover, and thus solar energy potential, will also change. The expected changes are both positive and negative depending on geographic region and can be highly spatially variable, particularly in regions of complex terrain. Because of the short-term availability of observed radiation and cloud cover data, it is difficult to study the historical climatology of solar energy potential, thus making future projections uncertain. Research has shown that another readily available climate variable, the diurnal temperature range, correlates well with daily averaged shortwave radiation values during months of minimal/no snow cover, and can thus serve as a proxy for shortwave radiation during the warm season throughout the period of record. In the present study, the diurnal temperature range is shown to be an excellent predictor of shortwave radiation around the state of Vermont, independent of latitude and elevation. Monte Carlo significance testing is also used to examine recent trends in this region.",

In addition of providing visual images, satellite-based instrumentation also provide spectral radiance data that allow the computation of atmospheric temperature, moisture and trace gas profiles and other geophysical variables including cloud parameters. Hyperspectral sounders, AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder), IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) and CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) on low-Earth orbiting satellites, provide atmospheric profiles on a global scale with the spatial and temporal resolution needed to complement traditional profile data sources such as that obtained by radiosondes. The goal of this paper is to describe the information that hyperspectral sounders are capable of adding to weather monitoring and short-term forecasting systems. Retrievals derived from all four operational sounders are used in time-series to describe the pre-convective environment (including moisture advection and stability tendencies) antecedent to the initiation of severe weather. Temporal and spatial consistency and continuity is achieved among different instruments on different platforms through the use of a single atmospheric profile retrieval algorithm. Our results demonstrate the utility of using hyperspectral sounding products from multiple satellites for the real-time weather monitoring/prediction operation.",

Tephra from the eruption blanketed much of the western United States, and is a key Quaternary chronostratigraphic marker, in particular for dating deposition of mid-Pleistocene glacial and pluvial deposits in western North America. We performed 40Ar/39Ar dating of single sanidines to delimit eruption age, and ion microprobe U-Pb and trace-element analyses of crystal faces on single zircons to characterize magmatic evolution and date near-eruption crystallization, as well as analyses of crystal interiors to date the interval of zircon crystallization. Sanidines from the two LCT members A and B yield an 40Ar/39Ar isochron date of 631 ± 4 ka (2σ). Crystal faces on zircons from both members yield a weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 627 ± 6 ka (2σ) and have trace element concentrations that vary with eruptive stratigraphy. Zircon interiors yield a weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 660 ± 6 ka, and reveal reverse and/or oscillatory zoning of trace element concentrations, with many crystals containing high-U concentrations and dark cathodoluminescence (CL) cores. These crystals with high-U cores are possibly sourced from ‘defrosting’ of melt-impregnated margins of the growing subvolcanic reservoir. LCT sanidines mirror the variation of zircon composition within the eruptive stratigraphy, with crystals from upper LCT-A and basal LCT-B having bright-CL rims with high Ba concentrations, suggesting late crystallization after addition of less evolved silicic magma. The occurrence of distal LCT in stratigraphic sequences marking the Marine Isotope Stage 16-15 transition supports the apparent eruption age of ca. 631 ka. These results reveal that Lava Creek zircons record episodic heating, renewed crystallization, and an overall up-temperature evolution for Yellowstone’s subvolcanic reservoir in the 103-104 year interval before eruption.",

The processes that govern the size, shape, and motion of barrier islands are not well constrained, yet central to coastal dynamics. While the global distribution of barrier islands has been mapped and assessed, there is little consensus on the forces controlling barrier island formation, motion, or preservation.\nThis study presents a new semi-global database of modern barrier islands to better understand their morphology and spatial distribution. We have mapped, in Google Earth, the subaerial extent of >350 barrier islands and spits, measuring spatial characteristic such as exposed area, perimeter, length, and width. These objects are cross-referenced with parameters that potentially control morphology, including tidal range, wave height, climate, distance from the continental shelf, proximity to fluvial output, and tectonic setting. This approach provides a more optimal framework to assess controls on coastal features, including barrier island morphology, and to investigate potential geometric scaling relationships.\nPreliminary analysis shows trends in the spatial characteristics of barrier islands. There is a strong linear relationship between the perimeter and length (y= -0.59 + 0.42x, R2=0.95). Linear trends also relate length to area when the data are separated by tidal range to wave height ratio. Assessment of barrier island shape supports the hypothesis of Hayes (1979) that barrier islands in wave-dominated settings are long and linear while those in mixed energy setting are more rounded. The barrier islands of the Texas Gulf of Mexico are larger than the global average for the database, with distinctly longer length values (41.16 km vs. 15.77 km respectively) and larger areas (103.81 km2 vs. 42.14 km2 respectively). Initial assessment shows that tidal range and wave height are primary controls barrier island dimensions. Future work will consider climate, latitude, fluvial input, and tectonic regime as additional factors. Assessing modern barrier islands will lend insight into potential paleomorphodynamic relationships and help determine how islands are transferred into the rock record, with implications for sequence stratigraphy, subsurface reservoirs, etc.",

            "abstract": "The imposition of an external shear on a system of partial melt will result in compaction of the solid matrix and concentration of the interstitial liquid melt leading to the formation of regions of contrasting high and low porosity. In experiments, direct and torsional shear geometries have demonstrated that these regions of varying porosity form in bands orientated at low angles relative to the shear plane. A variety of numerical models have been employed to recreate these experimental results. Simple shear, pure shear and torsional shear geometries have been used in both linear and nonlinear numerical settings to model the formation of the porosity bands. In this contribution the numerical models utilize a shear geometry derived from the velocity field of the plate-driven corner flow of a mid-ocean ridge. Motivation for using the velocity field of a mid-ocean ridge comes from evidence that suggests the existence of lateral melt channeling from either side of the ridge axis. Imposing the shear from a mid-ocean ridge corner flow allows for the evaluation of the resulting porosity bands in terms of suitability for channeling melt laterally toward the ridge axis. This is done using both slow and fast spreading ridge geometries. The degree of similarity between previous numerical and experimental results has been found to be greatly influenced by the imposed viscosity law of the solid matrix phase. In order to keep this in mind, the numerical models in this contribution use three different matrix viscosity laws: strain-rate independent, strain-rate dependent and anisotropic. Of these rheologies, strain-rate independence results in the poorest orientation for channeling melt directly to the ridge axis. The strain-rate dependent and anisotropic viscosities present more favorable direct-channeling orientations for the fastest growing porosity bands, but in both cases the background flow will rotate bands to less ideal orientations over time. However, these less favorable orientations for direct melt channeling may result in a more confined region of melt channeling at the base of the plate where a high porosity layer is proposed to exist due to the eventual freezing of upwelling mantle melt. In this high porosity region, melt would be transported toward the ridge axis along the base of the plate under the influence of gravity.",

Subsequent water column surveys and video imaging conducted by Okeanos Explorer and ROV Deep Discoverer in 2014 as well as R/V Atlantis and DSV Alvin, as part of the SeepC program in 2015, re-imaged a majority of these gas seep locations providing an opportunity to make preliminary assessments of gas plume ephemerality and the variability of seafloor methane discharge as a function of time. Analysis of newly collected water column backscatter data indicates that some previously imaged gas plumes are no longer present and that a number of new gas plumes are present in locations where they were previously determined to be absent. Additionally, newly acquired video imagery demonstrates that seafloor gas emission at seep locations can vary between absence and abundant effusively on time scales as short as minutes and that this variability is not correlated with that of in situ temperature and pressure observations. These new results indicate that individual methane plume features can be ephemeral on intra-annual to much shorter time scales. Additionally, these results suggest that short-term variability in gas discharge at individual plumes, away from the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability zone, is not mediated by fluctuations in hydrostatic pressure or thermal perturbations. Despite evidence for high temporal variability in the discharge rates of individual gas plumes, video imagery of robust chemosynthetic communities and thick carbonate crusts suggests an overall persistence of methane emissions at seep sites on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years. Collected data are insufficient to fully constrain the temporality of gas discharge on the northern US Atlantic margin; however, presented results demonstrate the necessity of including a temporal variability term in any calculations of total methane flux and suggest how such a term may be parameterized.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric inversions have been used to assess biosphere-atmosphere CO2 surface exchanges at various scales, but variability among inverse flux estimates remain significant even at fine scales. Atmospheric transport errors are presumed to be one of the main contributors of this variability. However, few studies have quantified them thoroughly. Previous studies have quantified systematic errors affecting inversion estimates by using ensemble techniques but not limited to transport errors (e.g., different amount of observations, inverse methodologies, prior fluxes). Here, we isolated the transport errors and propagated them into CO2 mixing ratios using a multi-physics ensemble created with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) mesoscale model. The transport differences of this ensemble will come exclusively from the different physical parameterization used (e.g., planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, land surface model (LSMs), cumulus parameterizations and microphysics parameterizations). Each simulation was coupled to the same CO2 surface fluxes from CarbonTracker, which allow us to generate simulated atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios. We evaluate the atmospheric transport errors over a highly instrumented (i.e., atmospheric soundings, in-situ CO2 measurements) area, the Mid-Continental Intensive (MCI) region, for 2008 summer period. Meteorological variables (i.e., wind speed, wind direction and PBL height) are used to calibrate our ensemble and verify that we generated an ensemble that represents the transport errors over the region. Simulated atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios from this calibrated ensemble are used to understand and estimate the contribution of transport errors in CO2 mixing ratios. Using the flatness of the rank histogram as a metric we were able to find a calibrated ensemble that represents transport errors for the all three meteorological variables. Finally, we present how this calibrated ensemble can be used to understand and evaluate the impact of transport errors on atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios.",

What process or processes determine when this energy is released is uncertain, although it is evident that both near-Earth plasma instability and magnetotail reconnection play a role in this energy release. Much emphasis has recently been placed on the role of magnetic reconnection in substorms, we focus here on observations of the unmistakeable signs of a plasma instability acting at substorm onset.\nUsing data from the THEMIS spacecraft, we show that electromagnetic waves grow in the magnetotail at the expense of the local electron and ion thermal energy. The wave growth in space is the direct counterpart to the wave growth seen at the substorm onset location at the ionosphere, as measured by the CARISMA and THEMIS magnetometers and THEMIS all-sky-imagers. We present evidence that the free energy source for the instability is associated with the electron and ion thermal energy, and not the local electron or ion flow energy.",

The eastern Tibetan Plateau contains several terrestrial ‘redbed’ basins within the Yidun Arc Terrane (YAT) that preserve a Mesozoic sedimentary record of YAT post-accretionary tectonism, and a Cenozoic sedimentary record influenced by terrane collisions to the south, including arc magmatism and re-activation of inherited structures in response to strike-slip translation and far-field deformation. The West and East Ganzi basins in the northern YAT formed in a compressional tectonic setting and basin fill records a detrital zircon signature indicative of provenance from Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks of the Zhongza Massif and local Mesozoic Yidun arc plutons. The West and East Ganzi basins may be isolated flexural basins associated with the collision of the YAT and the Gondwana-derived Qiangtang Terrane with the Lhasa block during the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous time. Structural analysis shows that the West and East Ganzi basin strata have deformational phases associated with additional Mesozoic terrane collisions, far-field reactivation deformation associated with the India-Asia collision, and Late Cenozoic strike-slip deformation associated with growth of Tibetan Plateau. The Jawa and Mula basins located in the YAT to the southeast of the West and East Ganzi basins contain similar basin fill and structural features; however, both the Jawa and Mula basins contain a Cenozoic zircon population, establishing a maximum depositional age of ~41 Ma for both basins. The Jawa and Mula basins formed as small isolated basins associated with Early Cenozoic far-field deformation related to the India-Asia collision. Analyses of these four basins, along with recent study of Mesozoic deposits in the Qamdo basin of the eastern Qiangtang area to the west, shows that the southeastern Tibet plateau region experienced significant Late Mesozoic-early Cenozoic tectonism before the India-Asia collision; this record highlights Mesozoic crustal heterogeneity that influenced the late Cenozoic uplift evolution of the modern Tibetan Plateau.",

Like x-rays, an image can be constructed from the negative of the absorbed (or scattered) muons. Unlike x-rays, these muons can penetrate thousands of meters of earth. Muon tomography has been shown to be useful across a wide range of applications (such as imaging of the interior of volcanoes and cargo containers). This work estimates the sensitivity of muon tomography for various underground applications. We use simulations to estimate the change in flux as well as the spatial resolution when imaging static objects, such as mine shafts, and dynamic objects, such as a CO2 reservoir filling over time. We present a framework where we import ground density data from other sources, such as wells, gravity and seismic data, to generate an expected muon flux distribution at specified underground locations. This information can further be fed into a detector simulation to estimate a final experimental sensitivity. There are many applications of this method. We explore its use to image underground nuclear test sites, both the deformation from the explosion as well as the supporting infrastructure (access tunnels and shafts). We also made estimates for imaging a CO2 sequestration site similar to Futuregen 2.0 in Illinois and for imaging magma chambers beneath the Cascade Range volcanoes. This work may also be useful to basic science, such as underground dark matter experiments, where increasing experimental sensitivity requires, amongst other factors, a precise knowledge of the muon background.",

Up-to-date knowledge about the pre-storm morphology of the coast can be instrumental in making accurate predictions about coastal change and damage during large storms like Hurricanes and Nor’Easters. For example, alongshore variations in the shape of ephemeral sandbars along the coastline can focus wave energy, subjecting different stretches of coastline to significantly higher waves. Variations in beach slope and width can also alter wave runup, causing higher wave-induced water levels which can cause overwash or inlet breaching. Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) offer a new capability to rapidly and inexpensively map vulnerable coastlines in advance of approaching storms. Here we present results from a prototype system that maps coastal topography and surf-zone morphology utilizing a multi-camera sensor. Structure-from-motion algorithms are used to generate topography and also constrain the trajectory of the sUAS. These data, in combination with mount boresight information, are used to rectify images from ocean-facing cameras. Images from all cameras are merged to generate a wide field of view allowing up to 5 minutes of continuous imagery time-series to be collected as the sUAS transits the coastline. Water imagery is then analyzed using wave-kinematics algorithms to provide information on surf-zone bathymetry. To assess this methodology, the absolute and relative accuracy of topographic data are evaluated in relation to simultaneously collected terrestrial lidar data. Ortho-rectification of water imagery is investigated using visible fixed targets installed in the surf-zone, and through comparison to stationary tower-based imagery. Future work will focus on evaluating how topographic and bathymetric data from this sUAS approach can be used to update forcing parameters in both empirical and numerical models predicting coast inundation and erosion in advance of storms.",

            "abstract": "The threshold of motion for aeolian sand transport marks the initial entrainment of sand particles by the force of the wind. This is typically defined and modeled as a singular wind speed for a given grain size and is based on field and laboratory experimental data. However, the definition of threshold varies significantly between these empirical models, largely because the definition is based on visual-observations of initial grain movement. For example, in his seminal experiments, Bagnold defined threshold of motion when he observed that 100% of the bed was in motion. Others have used 50% and lesser values. Differences in threshold models, in turn, result is large errors in predicting the fluxes associated with sand and dust transport. Here we use a wind tunnel and novel sediment trap to capture the fractions of sand in creep, reptation and saltation at Earth and Mars pressures and show that the threshold of motion for aeolian sand transport is best defined as a continuum in which grains progress through stages defined by the proportion of grains in creep and saltation. We propose the use of scale dependent thresholds modeled by distinct probability distribution functions that differentiate the threshold based on micro to macro scale applications. For example, a geologic timescale application corresponds to a threshold when 100% of the bed in motion whereas a sub-second application corresponds to a threshold when a single particle is set in motion. We provide quantitative measurements (number and mode of particle movement) corresponding to visual observations, percent of bed in motion and degrees of transport intermittency for Earth and Mars. Understanding transport as a continuum provides a basis for revaluating sand transport thresholds on Earth, Mars and Titan.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the finest turbulent scales present in the lower atmosphere using numerical simulations helps to study the processes that occur in the atmospheric boundary layer, such as the turbulent inflow condition to the wind plant and the generation of the wake behind wind turbines. This work employs several nested domains in the WRF-LES framework to simulate conditions in a convectively driven cloud free boundary layer at an instrumented field site in complex terrain. The innermost LES domain (30 m spatial resolution) receives the boundary forcing from two other coarser resolution LES outer domains, which in turn receive boundary conditions from two WRF-mesoscale domains. Wind and temperature records from sonic anemometers mounted at two vertical levels (30 m and 60 m) are compared with the LES results in term of first and second statistical moments as well as power spectra and distributions of wind velocity. For the two mostly used boundary layer parameterizations (MYNN and YSU) tested in the WRF mesoscale domains, the MYNN scheme shows slightly better agreement with the observations for some quantities, such as time averaged velocity and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE). However, LES driven by WRF-mesoscale simulations using either parameterization have similar velocity spectra and distributions of velocity. For each component of the wind velocity, WRF-LES power spectra are found to be comparable to the spectra derived from the measured data (for the frequencies that are accurately represented by WRF-LES). Furthermore, the analysis of LES results shows a noticeable variability of the mean and variance even over small horizontal distances that would be considered sub-grid scale in mesoscale simulations. This observed statistical variability in space and time can be utilized to further analyze the turbulence quantities over a heterogeneous surface and to improve the turbulence parameterization in the mesoscale model.",

            "abstract": "Finding ways to engage youth in inadvertent learning about nature and the environment is challenging, particularly in urban areas where environmental literacy is profoundly limited by access to safe and representative spaces. Termed the Nature Deficit Disorder, the lack of contact and connection between people and their environment leads to a less than holistic approach to environmental management at the personal and governmental levels. One of the challenges is developing ways to engage youth in science learning not by bringing them indoors to a science museum but rather by taking the science museum outdoors. Funded by the NSF Informal Science Learning program, we launched a collaborative between scientists and artists to understand the nature and impact of environmental learning through outdoor art and science programming, called StreamLines. Launched in 2014 and now near full deployment, the program is part of a bigger initiative in Indianapolis (Reconnecting to Our Waterways) to embrace the multiple waterways that traverse the city as a valuable community and health resource.\nThis collaborative is designed to function on multiple levels. An Artist and Scientists Roundtable engages practitioners in regular conversations supplemented by external readings to share how practitioners use concepts and tools from the “opposite” side to inform their work and scholarship. Physical installations of iconic art at individual sites reflect the environmental conditions at individual sites are designed as tools for explicit and implicit learning and exploration about the environment. Music, poetry, and dance programming developed for individual sites portray cogent characteristics of place and are meant to allow visitors to see how artists engage with and draw from the environment for inspiration. A research approach unpins all of these efforts, utilizing a set of different sample populations to explore environmental education and potential advocacy after interactions with components of StreamLines.",

As part of the Earth Explorers outreach program in Boulder, Colorado, we worked with a group of middle school students to build and use these sensors. The students were in 6th and 7th grade, and we met three times. Once to introduce the scientist and science they will be working on, the second time to actually do the hand-on project and, finally, to review what they learned in the experiment.\nArduino is an open-source electronics platform that is simple to program, using the Arduino programming language. There are example codes available for the particle sensors and they are easy to adapt to different uses. The sensor setup is straightforward and was built into a small footprint on a plastic toy brick with a handle for easy use. We pre-loaded the Arduino board with the necessary software, but had the students wire the sensor, Arduino, indicator lights and battery together and attached them to the brick. This gave the students an opportunity to learn about electricity and wiring, in addition to air pollution.\nThe sensor is not calibrated or quantitative, so only qualitative data was obtained. The qualitative data, however, was sufficient to allow the students to make predictions and test their hypotheses. While most of the students predicted outside, near the parking lot would have the highest PM levels, they learned that indoor pollution can be much higher, particularly in carpeted areas.",

Although chemical evolution of biomass burning plumes in the ambient is a vital issue for the study of climatic and health effects, the understanding of secondary pollutants formation during the aging of biomass burning plumes is far from complete. Here we collected typical agriculture residues and forest plant branches in the Pearl River Delta in south China, and got them burned in laboratory-controlled conditions and introduced the plumes from burning these biomass directly into the GIGCAS indoor smog chamber with a reactor of 30 m3 to investigate the photochemical aging of the plumes. The inorganic trace gases, including SO2, NOx, NH3 and O3, were monitored online with chemiluminescence gas analyzers, precursor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitor online with a PTR-ToF-MS and offline by a preconcentrator coupled with a gas chromatography–mass selective detector/flame ionization detector/electron capture detector (GC-MSD/FID/ECD), particle number concentrations and size distributions were obtained using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), and a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-TOF-AMS) was used to measure the chemical compositions and evolutions of submicron aerosols and to trace the change in the average element ratios of organics, like H/C, O/C, and N/C. The results from the study were summarized in the following aspects: 1) primary emission factors of gaseous and particulate pollutants from burning of typical biomass including agricultural remains and forest wood plants; 2) yields of secondary pollutants, including secondary inorganic and organic aerosols and gaseous products (like O3) during photochemical aging of biomass burning plumes; 3) relationship between the formed secondary organic aerosols and the precursor VOCs; 4) changing size distribution and chemical compositions of submicron particles during photochemical aging of biomass burning plumes; and 5) influence of temperature and relative humidity on the photochemical aging of biomass burning plumes.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation state of the mantle plays an intrinsic role in the magmatic evolution of the Earth. Here we present new μ-XANES measurements of Fe3+/ΣFe ratios (a proxy for ƒO2) in a suite of submarine glasses from the Galapagos Archipelago. Using previously presented major, trace, and volatile elements and isotopic data for 4 groups of glass that come from distinct mantle sources (depleted upper mantle, 2 recycled, and a primitive mantle source) we show that Fe3+/ΣFe ratios vary both with the influence of shallow level processes and with variations in mantle source. Fe3+/ΣFe ratios increase with differentiation (i.e. decreasing MgO), but show a large variation at a given MgO. Progressive degassing of sulfur accompanies decreasing Fe3+/ΣFe ratios, while assimilation of hydrothermally altered crust (as indicated by increasing Sr/Sr*) is shown to increase Fe3+/ΣFe ratios. After taking these processes into account, there is still variability in the Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of the isotopically distinct sample suites studied, yielding a magmatic ƒO2 that ranges from ΔQFM = +0.16 to +0.74 (error < 0.5 log units) and showing that oxidation state varies as a function of mantle source composition in the Galapagos hotspot system. After correcting back to a common MgO content = 8.0 wt%, the trace element depleted group similar to MORB (ITD), and the group similar to Pinta (WD = high Th/La, Δ7/4, Δ8/4 ratios) show Fe3+/ΣFe ratios within the range of MORB (average ITD = 0.162 ± 0.003 and WD = 0.164 ± 0.006). Another trace element enriched group similar to Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul (ITE = enriched Sr and Pb isotopes) shows evidence of mixing between oxidized and reduced sources (ITE oxidized end-member = 0.177). This suggests that mantle sources in the Galapagos that are thought to contain recycled components (i.e., WD and ITE groups) have distinct oxidation states. The high 3He/4He Fernandina samples (HHe group) are shown to be the most oxidized (ave. 0.175 ± 0.006). With C/3He ratios an order of magnitude greater than MORB this suggests that the primitive mantle is a more carbonated and oxidized source than the depleted upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_FIRR.pdf\nThe water cycle in the dry and cold Arctic is not well understood. In particular, ice clouds, which play a significant role in the radiative budget of this region, are poorly known. In addition to filling a gap in cloud observation at high latitudes, the deployment of CALIPSO and CloudSat satellites also highlighted the ubiquity of optically thin ice clouds during the polar night in the Arctic. These clouds can significantly alter the amount of far infrared radiation escaping the Earth, and consequently the temperatures in the upper atmosphere. Since their signature in the far infrared is also very sensitive to their microphysical properties (crystals size and shape) and optical depth, these quantities can be retrieved from satellite observations. Such measurements in the far infrared (particularly beyond 30 μm), were until recently constrained by technical limitations, but recent advancements in micro-bolometers technology at INO (Québec) has allowed to study this under-explored spectral region. In this context, a satellite mission dedicated to studying thin ice clouds in the Arctic (TICFIRE) is under review at the Canadian Space Agency. We present here the Far InfraRed Radiometer (FIRR), which is meant to be a breadboard for the future satellite instrument.\nThe FIRR measures atmospheric radiation in 9 spectral bands extending from 8 to 50 μm. After characterization in the laboratory, it was operated from the ground under various atmospheric conditions. These measurements were successfully compared to radiative transfer simulations, pointing out the potential of the FIRR to detect ice clouds and to measure low water vapor contents. In April 2015, the FIRR was operated on board an aircraft during the pan-arctic NETCARE campaign. It was looking downward to mimic satellite observations, which is to our knowledge a first in the far infrared. Simultaneously, atmospheric profiles and clouds microphysical properties were measured by probes mounted on the same aircraft. To our knowledge, it’s also the first time that far infrared measurements are performed concomitantly with retrieval of cloud microphysical properties. These measurements are meant to validate the representation of ice clouds in radiative transfer models, as a first step toward a cloud retrieval algorithm based on satellite observations in the far infrared.",

The results indicate that the climate change in India has predominating effects on the basic water balance components such as water yield, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. This analysis is with the assumption of naturalised hydrologic cycle, i.e., the impacts of human interventions like construction of controlled (primarily dams, diversions and reservoirs) and water withdrawals structures are not taken into account. The assumption is unrealistic since there are numerous anthropogenic disturbances which result in large changes on vegetation composition and distribution patterns. These activities can directly or indirectly influence the dynamics of water cycle; subsequently affecting the hydrologic processes like plant transpiration, infiltration, evaporation, runoff and sublimation. Here, we have quantified the human interventions by using the reservoir and irrigation module of VIC model which incorporates the irrigation schemes, reservoir characteristics and water withdrawals. The impact of human interventions on hydrologic variables in many grids are found more predominant than climate change and might be detrimental to water resources at regional level. This spatial pattern of impacts will facilitate water manager and planners to design and station hydrologic structures for a sustainable water resources management.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade and a half, the continued loss of sea is in the Arctic ocean has led to a dramatic increase in marine net primary production (NPP). Increased annual NPP is often, but not always, associated with reduced sea-ice extent and a longer phytoplankton growing season (fewer days of ice cover). However, spatial patterns of enhanced annual NPP suggest that increased nutrient fluxes may also play a role. For instance, the greatest increases in Arctic NPP have been observed on the interior shelves in waters near the shelfbreak. These are areas where additional nutrients may become increasingly available as the sea ice retreats toward the pole, facilitated by increased shelfbreak upwelling. The eastern Arctic, which receives a large fraction of the high-nutrient Pacific water, exhibits an unusual pattern whereby increased annual NPP in more upstream waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas is offset by lower annual NPP in downstream regions of the Greenland Sea. The reason for the decline in NPP in downstream waters is unclear, especially if upstream nutrient supplies and NPP are increasing. Perhaps higher NPP on the Chukchi shelf has caused an increase in the rate of sediment denitrification, resulting in larger losses of fixed nitrogen. This would require that the large increase in annual NPP in the Beaufort Sea be driven by some other nutrient source, perhaps local shelfbreak upwelling. More efficient utilization of these nutrients, due perhaps to longer growing seasons, could eventually reduce inventories downstream, resulting in no change in annual NPP in the Baffin sector and a decline over the outflow shelves near Greenland. This is consistent with the observation that large increases in Chukchi Sea NPP preceded significant declines in Greenland Sea waters by more than a year. More work needs to be done to understand the factors responsible for both the large-scale and the small-scale patterns in annual NPP.",

            "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of tracking wavefronts from ambient noise cross correlations across small, dense arrays (e.g., the Long Beach array). We now apply a similar method to USArray data to explore the information available on a continental scale. The approach measures the travel times and amplitudes of a wave propagating across the array and through numerical computations of spatial gradients corrects for geometric spreading, focusing and defocusing; any remaining signal is attributed to local site amplification effects, intrinsic attenuation, or the presence of sources/scatterers within the array. Because the USArray was active in different regions at different times and therefore subject to a variable background noise field, we are careful to divide the US into smaller regions and ensure that noise correlation pairs can be stacked over an identical time period before measuring a given spatial gradient. USArray observations of distant earthquakes have been shown to recover site amplification terms and attenuation through helmholtz tomography, but the use of ambient noise allows for such measurements at shorter periods and with greater flexibility. Site amplification maps produced with ambient noise show promising variations correlated with local geology, tectonics and velocity models, for periods at least as low as 12 seconds. Additionally, source differences between the incoming and outgoing wavefronts of ambient noise (negative and positive lags) may provide the ability to image noise sources or local scatterers within the continental US. These types of observations, especially site amplification and attenuation, may be used to supplement or improve traditional velocity-based tomographic methods, as they provide different constraints on temperature and density. They may also be useful for seismic hazard studies as they provide direct observations of site effects independent of complex inversions and forward model simulations.",

Many proxy records suggest that the strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds have changed significantly since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~21,000 years BP. However, a recent compilation of all available evidence for Southern Hemisphere westerly wind changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) led to the conclusion that “their strength and position in colder and warmer climates relative to today remain a wide open question” (Kohfeld et al. (2013) Quaternary Science Reviews, 68). This paper finds that an equatorward displacement of the glacial winds is consistent with observations, but cannot rule out other, competing hypotheses.\nUsing the geochemical characteristics of deep-sea sediments deposited along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, I test the hypothesis that the LGM Southern Hemisphere Westerlies were displaced northward. In the central South Atlantic, dust can be delivered from South America via the Westerlies, or from Africa via the Trade Winds. The continental sources of South America and Africa have very different geochemical signatures, making it possible to distinguish between eolian transport via the Westerlies vs. the Trade Winds. Any northward shift in the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies would increase the northward extent of a South American provenance in sediments dominated by eolian sources. I will present geochemical provenance data (radiogenic isotope ratios; major and trace element concentrations) in a latitudinal transect of cores along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that document whether, in fact, such a shift occurred, and put an important constraint on how far north the wind belts shifted during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "Solar filaments are cool, dark channels of partially-ionized plasma that lie above the chromosphere. Their structure follows the neutral line between local regions of opposite magnetic polarity. Previous research (e.g. Schmieder et al. 2013) has shown a positive correlation (80%) between the occurrence of filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections (CME’s). If certain filament properties, such as length, chirality, and tilt, indicate a tendency towards filament eruptions, one may be able to further predict an oncoming CME. Towards this end, we present a novel algorithm based on spatiotemporal analysis that systematically correlates filament eruptions documented in the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK) with HEK filaments that have been grouped together using a tracking algorithm developed at Georgia State University (e.g. Kempton et al. 2014). We also find filament tracks that are not correlated with eruptions to form a null data set in a similar fashion. Finally, we compare the metadata from erupting and non-erupting filament tracks to discover which filament properties may present signs of an eruption onset. Through statistical methods such as the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Random Forest Classifier, we find that a filament that is increasing in length or changing in tilt with respect to the equator may be a useful gauge to predict a filament eruption. However, the average values of length and tilt for both datasets follow similar distributions, leading us to conclude that these parameters do not indicate an eruption event.\nThis work is supported by the NSF-REU solar physics program at SAO, grant number AGS-1263241, and NSF DIBBS grant number ACI-1443061.",

In this paper, we use a hydrological-morphodynamic model (LE-PIHM), which links bedrock, soil, surface and subsurface water flow, plant, energy, and seasonal climate, to address the influence of water-regolith-energy interaction on soil creep process, the possible factors causing slope asymmetry and the spatial distribution of regolith transport at the SSHCZO. Two non-dimensional parameters were used to explore the competitive relationship between regolith diffusion and advection forming self-organized channel spacing, relief and slope length at steady state. Model simulation under seasonal meteorological forcing shows spatial variations of hillslope sediment fluxes. An experimental study using Beryllium 10 at the SSHCZO (West et al 2013) showed that a south-facing planar slope had a greater diffusion flux rate than a planar on north-facing slope. The model confirms this relationship in general although there are significant local variations. The largest regolith transport rate by overland flow (advection) occurs at the junctions of main channel and swales. The model simulation further suggests that north-south differences in diffusive flux may be a result of asymmetric solar insolation which affects freeze-thaw frequency and sediment transport through the process of soil creep. This study demonstrates the value of physically-based distributed landscape evolution model on estimating spatial distribution of regolith transport and highlights the critical transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient loading has contributed to eutrophication in rivers and downstream systems throughout the mid-Atlantic region, USA. It is known that biofilms can be assessed to determine the amount of phosphorus (P) pollution in a system and the agricultural impacts it has on stream health. Polyphosphates are a storage system in algal cells and can be used to reflect the degree of nutrient loading to stream ecosystems. An ISES (in situ enrichment system) experiment was deployed in four flumes of a USDA maintained stream watershed for a 12-day period. In July-August of 2014, experimental vials of agar were enriched with six levels of P loading from 0.0 to 1,540.8 µg PO4-3/day under consistently N enriched conditions. At the end of this period natural growing biofilms were scraped off tiles established in each site and analyzed for chlorophyll, total P, and polyphosphate. While there were no significant differences found in biomass growth between each treatment (two-way ANOVA; F= 3.387, p>0.042), there were significant increases in P storage with increased P provided (F= 148.853, p<0.001). We measured consistent uptake patterns throughout the watershed, suggesting that uptake was a consistent feature of biofilms throughout the landscape (F= 4.172, p>0.05). A large percentage of total P was also stored as polyphosphate in the treatments with added P in relation to the ambient tiles collected. Given these findings, we propose that polyphosphate storage in stream biofilms are an important, early warning indicator for changing trophic status in streams compared with biomass metrics (e.g., chlorophyll); therefore, P storage in stream algae reflects loading from throughout the terrestrial landscape.",

The model, which we developed, utilizes the Geant4 framework, is fully three-dimensional, and is based on actual drawings of LECP/LEMPA. It incorporates all relevant physical effects appropriate to the problem in a Monte Carlo style set of simulations. These simulations produce a response in the model instrument, which we convolve with the CRS and 1 AU data to produce a simulated background for the instruments as a function of time. We then subtract these backgrounds after validating with LECP/LEMPA data taken during times that are known to be background dominated. The resulting ion spectra, though preliminary, show interesting spatio-temporal and directional variations in the heliosheath, with signal-to-noise ratios of a few. Interstellar spectra show a much lower signal to noise ratio and likely represent the background generated in LECP/LEMPA due to local interstellar cosmic rays. However, we can at least place upper limits on the very low energy (< 1 MeV) local interstellar cosmic ray spectrum using this technique.",

Although SADs have been observed and studied extensively, their physical interpretation and mechanism remain not well understood and controversial. In our recent numerical and observational studies, we suggest that SADs may be due to Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities occurring at the front of reconnection outflow jets as they encounter the underlying arcades (Innes et al. Astrophys. J. 796, 27; Guo et al. Astrophys. J. Lett., 796, L29). In this work, we further improve our three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of SADs by incorporating viscous and resistive heating, anisotropic heat conduction, as well as line-tied lower boundary conditions.

            "abstract": "Over the subtropical eastern Pacific, a large stratus cloud deck is often trapped below a strong inversion layer resulting from the combination of strong free tropospheric subsidence and the cool sea surface temperature underneath. The stable inversion leads to a sharp moisture decrease and a large negative refractivity gradient that often causes ducting right above the cloudy boundary layer (CBL). The presence of duct results in systematically negative biases in the GPS radio occultation (RO) refractivity (i.e., N-bias) inside the CBL due to a non-unique retrieval problem. An independent physical constraint is required to extract a unique and bias-free RO refractivity observation. In the overcast scenario, the inversion base temperature corresponds well to the cloud-top-temperature (CTT) of the stratus, which can be precisely measured from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) longwave infrared window channel. In this presentation, the MODIS CTT measurements are used as an independent constraint to correct the systematic biases in the near co-incident RO refractivity soundings from COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate). The sensitivity analysis on the reconstruction technique and the comparison of the reconstructed (bias-free) RO profiles with the radiosonde and ECMWF reanalysis will be presented. The synergy of GPS RO and MODIS cloud measurements provides model-independent observation of CBL thermodynamic structures that are crucial for understanding the boundary layer and low cloud processes in global weather and climate model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Observations along oceanic fracture zones suggest that some mid-ocean ridge transform faults (TFs) previously split into multiple strike-slip segments separated by short (<~50 km) intra-transform spreading centers and then reunited to a single TF trace. This history of segmentation appears to correspond with changes in plate motion direction. Despite the clear evidence of TF segmentation, the processes governing its development and evolution are not well characterized. Here we use a 3-D, finite-difference / marker-in-cell technique to model the evolution of localized strain at a TF subjected to a sudden change in plate motion direction. We simulate the oceanic lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere at a ridge-transform-ridge setting using a visco-elastic-plastic rheology with a history-dependent plastic weakening law and a temperature- and stress-dependent mantle viscosity. To simulate the development of topography, a low density, low viscosity ‘sticky air’ layer is present above the oceanic lithosphere. The initial thermal gradient follows a half-space cooling solution with an offset across the TF. We impose an enhanced thermal diffusivity in the uppermost 6 km of lithosphere to simulate the effects of hydrothermal circulation. An initial weak seed in the lithosphere helps localize shear deformation between the two offset ridge axes to form a TF. For each model case, the simulation is run initially with TF-parallel plate motion until the thermal structure reaches a steady state. The direction of plate motion is then rotated either instantaneously or over a specified time period, placing the TF in a state of trans-tension. Model runs continue until the system reaches a new steady state. Parameters varied here include: initial TF length, spreading rate, and the rotation rate and magnitude of spreading obliquity. We compare our model predictions to structural observations at existing TFs and records of TF segmentation preserved in oceanic fracture zones.",

            "abstract": "One of the major issues confronting aerosol climate simulations of the Arctic and Antarctic Cryospheres is the lack of detailed data on the vertical and spatial distribution of aerosols with which to test these models. This is due, in part, to the inherent difficulty of conducting such measurements in extreme environments. One class of under measured radiative forcing agents in the Polar Region is the absorbing aerosol – black carbon and brown carbon. In particular, vertical profile information of BC is critical in reducing uncertainty in model assessment of aerosol radiative impact at high latitudes.\nDuring the summer of 2015, a Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) was deployed aboard the Department of Energy (DOE) Gultstream-1 (G-1) aircraft to measure refractory BC (rBC) concentrations as part of the DOE-sponsored ACME-V (ARM Airborne Carbon Measurements) campaign. This campaign was conducted from June through to mid-September along the North Slope of Alaska and was punctuated by vertical profiling over 5 sites (Atquasuk, Barrow, Ivotuk, Oliktok, and Toolik). In addition, measurement of CO, CO2 and CH4were also taken to provide information on the spatial and seasonal differences in GHG sources and how these sources correlate with BC. Lastly, these aerosol and gas measurements provide an important dataset to assess the representativeness of ground sites at regional scales.\nComparisons between observations and a global climate model (CAM5) simulations will be agumented with a discussion on the capability of the model to capture observed monthly mean profiles of BC and stratified aerosol layers. Additionally, the ability of the SP2 to partition rBC-containing particles into nascent or aged species allows an evaluation of how well the CAM5 model captures aging of long distant transported carbonaceous aerosols. Finally model sensitivity studies will be aso be presented that investigated the relative importance of the different emission sectors to the summer Arctic BC loadings at different altitudes and the implications of these emissions on the radiation budget.",

            "abstract": "The landfast sea ice around the fringes of Antarctica is often characterized by the presence of platelet ice which forms from the outflow of supercooled ice shelf water from the cavities under ice shelves. The spatial distribution and thickness of the unconsolidated sub-ice platelet is therefore an indicator of oceanic processes at the underside of usually inaccessible ice shelves. Here we show that the presence and thickness of the sub-ice platelet layer can be easily mapped by means of ground-based electromagnetic induction (EM) sounding using both the Inphase and Quadrature components of the induced, secondary electromagnetic field. From comparisons between drill-hole and EM measurements our analysis indicates a mean conductivity of the sub-ice platelet layer of around 600 mS/m. Under the assumption of this conductivity, we show that both the thickness of the sub-ice platelet layer as well as the thickness of the consolidated sea ice above can be concurrently inverted, in good agreement with drill-hole measurements. This inversion is based on the evaluation of two independent look-up tables calculated from a forward model. During extensive surveys across McMurdo Sound in 2011 and 2013 we have mapped the regional distribution and thickness of the sub-ice platelet layers, showing a narrow zone of the thickest platelet ice indicative of the main outflow of supercooled Ice Shelf Water in agreement with previous measurements. However these new data are more detailed and show little variation between the two years. The data also demonstrate the spreading and thinning of the platelet layer with increasing distance from the ice shelf front.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Jazayeri-GPR_pest_POSTER.pdf\nWe seek to establish a method, based on freely available software, for inverting GPR signals for the underlying physical properties (electrical permittivity, magnetic permeability, target geometries). Such a procedure should be useful for classroom instruction and for analyzing surface GPR surveys over simple targets.\nWe explore the applicability of the PEST parameter estimation software package for GPR inversion (www.pesthomepage.org). PEST is designed to invert data sets with large numbers of parameters, and offers a variety of inversion methods. Although primarily used in hydrogeology, the code has been applied to a wide variety of physical problems. The PEST code requires forward model input; the forward model of the GPR signal is done with the GPRMax package (www.gprmax.com).\nThe problem of extracting the physical characteristics of a subsurface anomaly from the GPR data is highly nonlinear. For synthetic models of simple targets in homogeneous backgrounds, we find PEST’s nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is preferred. This method requires an initial model, for which the weighted differences between model-generated data and those of the “true” synthetic model (the objective function) are calculated. In order to do this, the Jacobian matrix and the derivatives of the observation data in respect to the model parameters are computed using a finite differences method. Next, the iterative process of building new models by updating the initial values starts in order to minimize the objective function. Another measure of the goodness of the final acceptable model is the correlation coefficient which is calculated based on the method of Cooley and Naff. An accepted final model satisfies both of these conditions.\nModels to date show that physical properties of simple isolated targets against homogeneous backgrounds can be obtained from multiple traces from common-offset surface surveys. Ongoing work examines the inversion capabilities with more complex target geometries and heterogeneous soils.",

            "abstract": "An accurate empirical calibration is necessary to confidently apply the carbonate clumped isotope (Δ47) thermometer. Previous synthetic carbonate calibrations disagree in temperature sensitivity, with one group of calibrations displaying a shallow Δ47-temperature slope (e.g., Dennis & Schrag, GCA, 2010), and the other a steep slope (e.g., Zaarur et al., EPSL, 2013). These calibrations differ in both the method of mineral precipitation and the temperature of the phosphoric acid used to digest carbonates for analysis, making it difficult to isolate the cause of the discrepancy. Here, we precipitate synthetic carbonates at temperatures of 6-80ºC using 4 different precipitation methods, and analyze the samples using both 90 and 25°C acid digestion. Precipitation experiments varied the use of salts (NaHCO3 and CaCl2) vs. dissolved CaCO3 as a starting solution, the use of carbonic anhydrase to promote isotopic equilibrium among dissolved inorganic carbon species in solution, and the method by which CO2 degasses to force carbonate precipitation. Carbonates precipitated by using salts and allowing CO2 to passively degas produce a shallow calibration slope that we hypothesize to approach isotopic equilibrium. Precipitation methods that bubble CO2 into solution then degas that CO2 (either passively or actively by bubbling N2) produce carbonates with consistently lower Δ47 and higher δ18O values for a given growth temperature. We infer that these carbonates grew in disequilibrium during rapid CO2 degassing. Varying acid digestion temperature does not change the results; acid fractionation factor is not correlated with grain size, Δ47, or d47 values. No precipitation method produces a steep calibration slope. Our large sample set of >60 carbonates lend confidence to a shallow slope calibration, and inform interpretations of Δ47 and δ18O values of natural carbonates that grow under conditions of isotopic disequilibrium.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are an important source of freshwater input to the SE US eco-hydrologic function. Soil moisture, a temporal integral of precipitation, is critical to plant photosynthesis and carbon assimilation. In this study, we investigate the impact TCs have on gross primary productivity (GPP) in the SE US using the physically-based Duke Coupled Hydrology Model with Vegetation (DCHM-V) which includes coupled water and energy cycles and a biochemical representation of photosynthesis. A parsimonious evaluation of model-estimated GPP against all available AmeriFlux data in the SE US is presented. We characterize the seasonality of vegetation activity in the SE US by simulating water, energy, and carbon fluxes using the DCHM-V at high spatial (4 km) and temporal (30-min) resolution over the period 2002 – 2012. The model is run offline using atmospheric forcing data from NLDAS-2, precipitation from StageIV, and phenology indices from MODIS FPAR/LAI. Analysis of model results show the tendency for low GPP to occur in the Appalachian Mountains during peak summer months when water stress limits stomatal function. We contrast these simulations with model runs where periods of TC activity are replaced with the monthly climatological diurnal cycle from NARR. Results show that the timing and trajectory of TCs are key to understanding their impact on GPP across the SE US. Specifically: 1) Timing of moisture input from TCs greatly influences the vegetation response. TCs during peak summer months increase GPP and years with TCs falling in peak summer months see much higher annual GPP averages; 2) Years of drought and low plant productivity (2006-2007, 2011-2012) in the SE US tend to have TCs that fall later in the year when the additional moisture input does not have a significant impact on vegetation activity; and 3) TC path impacts regional GPP averages. The mountain region shows large inter- and intra-annual variability in plant productivity and high sensitivity to water stress. The Appalachian mountain region tends to have higher GPP when TC trajectories are closer in proximity.",

            "abstract": "We use observations from the NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX) aircraft campaign, evaluated with a nudged global chemistry-climate model, to better understand the sources and sinks of glyoxal over the Southeast United States. We find that the model with an isoprene oxidation mechanism that does not account for δ-hydroxyl peroxy radicals (δ-ISOPO2), can better reproduce the observed vertical profiles of glyoxal and HCHO, as well as their correlation (RGF) in the continental boundary layer. The suppression of δ-ISOPO2 is consistent with recent theoretical and laboratory studies, reflecting different fates of δ-ISOPO2 under chamber conditions (NO > 100 ppbv) vs. ambient conditions (NO ~ 0.1 ppbv). By including a reactive uptake of glyoxal in the model (γglyx=2.9×10-3), we find that this improves modeled glyoxal in the surface layer but leads to an underestimate of glyoxal above the surface. We estimate an upper limit (1.0 μg/m3) for SOA contributed by glyoxal uptake by aerosols and clouds in the boundary layer of this region. Our work highlights several uncertainties in current chemical mechanisms on glyoxal production from isoprene oxidation under high and low NOx conditions, which may lead to large biases in the estimates of its contribution to SOA formation. Further investigation on these pathways is warranted to quantify the sources and sinks of glyoxal in regional and global scales.",

Here we present methane clumped isotope results from natural gas wells, hydrothermal vents, marine and lacustrine methane seeps, and culture experiments.\nWe observe a wide range of formation temperatures for thermogenic methane. Methane samples from low-maturity reservoirs indicate formation temperatures between 102-144° C, high-maturity conventional and shale gasses indicate temperatures between 158-246 °C, and thermogenic coal gases indicate temperatures between 174-267 °C. Methane formation temperatures generally correlate positively with δ13C, and negatively with gas wetness indices. Methane samples from a set of marine hydrothermal vents indicate a formation temperature of 290-350 °C.\nMethane sampled from subsurface and marine biogenic sources typically indicate temperatures consistent with the formation environment (0-64° C). In contrast, freshwater biogenic methane samples, and cultures of hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens, express low levels of isotopic clumping inconsistent with their formation temperature. These data and complementary models suggest that kinetic isotope effects, likely modulated by rates and pathways of methanogenesis, affect biogenic methane in cultures and freshwater environments. Alternatively, non-equilibrium signatures may result from mixing of methane with widely differing δD and δ13C values.\nAnalyses of biogenic methane emissions from lakes indicate a correlation between methane flux and non-equilibrium clumped isotope fractionations in a given lake. Results from large methane seeps in Alaskan lakes confirm that some seeps emit thermogenic methane, but also indicate that other seeps emit subsurface biogenic methane or variable mixtures of biogenic and thermogenic methane. These results point to diverse sources for large Arctic methane seeps.",

Further examination by Pu et al. (JGR, 2010) showed that the event was preceded an hour earlier by one with very similar signatures. Traditional use of AE-related indices suggests that the first event was smaller in terms of electric currents than the second. More detailed examination of ground magnetic data shows that it was in fact comparable: in addition, the second event was considerably further to the west. We present results from Automated Meridian Modeling showing that a simple electrojet model with only three parameters (electrojet borders and current) matches data well with approximately 0.2 MA cross-meridian current in both subevents. There was also good conjugacy between hemispheres for both, as indicated by Antarctic magnetometers and inversion based on them. SuperMag data gives dense enough magnetometer coverage that the layout of the substorm current wedge, with auroral zone westward electrojet and subauroral perturbations mainly due to field-aligned current, can be determined. The quantitative data from the ground provides a context in which flows, magnetic fields, and other parameters at the THEMIS constellation and other conjugate spacecraft may be interpreted.",

The model is based on a T-crystallization relationship coupled to a zircon growth model calibrated from zircon solubility and a crustal T-assimilation curve from the EC-RAFC models of Spera and Bohrson (2004). Our model takes into account the latent heat of melting and/or solidification and features temperature-dependent thermal diffusivity. Trace element abundances in the melt are calculated through conservation of mass and isotopic speciation allowing prediction of the distribution of εHf values in zircons. Applications to model the evolution of deeply emplaced large granitoids (i.e., ~25km, ~15000 km3) show that steady recharge yields a zircon population that records the full spectrum of εHf in the system whereas no recharge yields a much narrower range. . Insights gained from modeling reinforce our view that the relationship between assimilation and geothermal structure can be used to estimate past crustal thickness of convergent margins. Modeling of shallow, initially small, subvolcanic magma reservoirs (i.e., ~7 km, ~200 km3) permits insights into zircon age and compositional variability for large silicic volcanic fields and associated calderas. Thermal modeling indicates that substantial recharge is required to maintain magmatic temperatures in the core of an intrusive complex where zircon remains saturated for periods of 100’s of kiloyears. Coupled with previously developed statistical methods, zircon rim-ages predicted by the model were compared to the U-Th rim ages measured from five distinct lava domes of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex erupted between ca. 87 and 120 ka. The fitting constrains the amount of recharge to ~10-3 km3/a between the time of initial intrusion (>500 ka) and the eruption age (75-100 ka). Thus zircons may have the potential to preserve a record of the magnitude and timing of recharge events.",

This study utilized the varnish microlamination (VML) dating method to provide minimum ages on the alluvium overlying GWD deposits, as well as estimating the age of a remnant older alluvium in Fenner Gap. VML results provide a minimum age of 2.8-4.1 ka on the overlying alluvium at the Chambless GWD deposit; agreeable with previously published OSL dates on the underlying GWD of about 10 ka. A VML age of 8.1 ka was found on the overlying alluvium at the Archer sediments GWD situated on the southern lobe. The oldest remnant alluvium in Fenner Gap is situated < 1 km upstream from the GWD deposits and has a minimum VML age of 17.75 ka. This older alluvium could be indicative of a raise in base level caused by wetlands formed during a ground water highstand associated with the last glacial maximum. These VML minimum age estimates may be too young due to the collection of varnish that may not be the oldest present.",

Like a brick-and-mortar center, CosmoQuest includes facilities for doing science and for educating its members through classes, seminars, and other forms of professional development. CosmoQuest is unique with its combination of public engagement in doing science—known as “citizen science”— and its diversity of learning opportunities that enable STEM education. Our suite of activities is able maximize people’s ability to learn and do science, while improving scientific literacy.\nSince its launch on January 1, 2012, CosmoQuest has grown to become the most trafficked astronomy citizen science site on the English-language internet. It has hosted five citizen science portals supporting NASA SMD science and is the only citizen science site to have produced peer-reviewed surface science results [Robbins, et al. 2014]. CosmoQuest, however, is more than just citizen science. It is a virtual research center for the public, and for the educators who teach in classrooms and science centers.\nLike with with any research center, CosmoQuest’s success hinges on its ability to build a committed research community, and the challenge has been creating this community without the benefit of real-world interactions. In this talk, we overview how CosmoQuest has built a virtual community through screen-to-screen interactions using a suite of technologies that must constantly evolve as the internet evolves.",

            "abstract": "Estimating gross primary production (GPP) is an important goal of global change research. However, the relationship between GPP and its environmental drivers is highly complex and as a result, accurate modeling of GPP is difficult. One possible technique to help constrain the uncertainties is by using remote sensing data to try and determine the factors driving GPP directly from satellite imagery. In this study, we used GPP from flux data (GPP_EC) and meteorological observations of a deciduous (SOA) and a coniferous evergreen forest (DF-49) to optimize light use efficiency of sunlit (LUEsun) and shaded (LUEshaded) canopies. We based our analysis on the two-leave light use efficiency model (TL-LUE) at daily, 8 day, and 16 day scales by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) of sunlit (PRIsun) and shaded (PRIshaded) leaves was calculated from spectral observations and related to tower based GPP at the three temporal scales. We found that the coefficient of determination (R2) between PRIsun and LUEsun, as well as PRIshaded and LUEshaded at the evergreen forest was lower than that at the deciduous forest. The modeled GPP was closely to the GPP_EC at the three temporal scales. The R2 between the GPP_EC and modeled daily GPP was the highest when using daily measures of LUE, and lowest when uisng16-day LUEsun and LUEshaded. The results indicated that LUE is an important parameter when modeling instantaneous GPP and the short term variations of it. The results help to obtain a better understanding of how many satellite observations are needed to reliably constrain existing GPP models from remote sensing data.",

            "abstract": "From the Atlantic margin to the Rockies, most earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S. occur in ancient tectonic zones, yet many such features have been historically quiescent. If all intraplate stress were transferred from plate boundaries or bases, the stress field would be broadly uniform, with all well-oriented faults equally likely to slip. But faults are not the only product of tectonism; intrusions, metamorphism, or any number of other alterations may modify crustal and/or upper mantle density, leaving behind lithostatic pressure gradients that can locally elevate or reduce stress on faults. With data provided by Earthscope, we are working to map lithospheric density across the U.S. and to quantify gravitational body-forces using analytical and finite-element methods. Regional-scale 3D models show that gravitational forces focus seismicity and reorient principal stress both in the New Madrid seismic zone and the western Great Plains. Sedimentary fill and low elevation encourage Reelfoot Rift-normal contraction, yet along-strike variations in lower crustal density rotate body-forces beneath New Madrid to interfere constructively with far-field compression, augmenting differential stress by 5-10 MPa. On the plains of SE Colorado and SE Wyoming, the Cheraw and Wheatland/Whalen faults collocate with multiply reactivated Proterozoic sutures, enigmatic Quaternary extension, and focused seismicity with regionally anomalous NW-SE moment tensor T-axes. Earthscope data help reveal anomalously buoyant lower crust beneath each suture -­- which we hypothesize reflects hydration by Farallon slab-derived fluids that have preferentially migrated along ancient fracture networks -- that generates 10 MPa of localized suture-normal tension, consistent with geomorphic strain- and seismic stress-indicators. As continent-wide seismic models emerge from Earthscope data, we will continue to map regions where inherited structures encourage intraplate seismicity.",

Similar to MODIS, the VIIRS imager provides visible through IR observations at moderate spatial resolution with a 1330 LT equatorial crossing consistent with MODIS on the Aqua platform. However, unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks key water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels used by the MODIS cloud algorithms for high cloud detection and cloud-top property retrievals. In addition, there is a significant change in the spectral location of the 2.1μm shortwave-infrared channel used by MODIS for cloud optical/microphysical retrievals.\nGiven the instrument differences between MODIS EOS and VIIRS S-NPP/JPSS, we discuss our adopted method for merging the 15+ year MODIS observational record with VIIRS in order to generate cloud optical property data record continuity across the observing systems.\nThe optical property retrieval code uses heritage algorithms that produce the existing MODIS cloud optical and microphysical properties product (MOD06). As explained in other presentations submitted to this session, the NOAA AWG/CLAVR-x cloud-top property algorithm and a common MODIS-VIIRS cloud mask feed into the optical property algorithm to account for the different channel sets of the two imagers.

            "abstract": "The lack of understanding in the Earth’s geological and physical processes governing sediment deposition render subsurface modeling subject to large uncertainty. Geostatistics is often used to model uncertainty because of its capability to stochastically generate spatially varying realizations of the subsurface. These methods can generate a range of realizations of a given pattern – but how representative are these of the full natural variability? And how can we identify the minimum set of images that represent this natural variability? Here we use this minimum set to define the geostatistical prior model: a set of training images that represent the range of patterns generated by autogenic variability in the sedimentary environment under study. The proper definition of the prior model is essential in capturing the variability of the depositional patterns. This work starts with a set of overhead images from an experimental basin that showed ongoing autogenic variability. We use the images to analyze the essential characteristics of this suite of patterns. In particular, our goal is to define a prior model (a minimal set of selected training images) such that geostatistical algorithms, when applied to this set, can reproduce the full measured variability. A necessary prerequisite is to define a measure of variability. In this study, we measure variability using a dissimilarity distance between the images. The distance indicates whether two snapshots contain similar depositional patterns. To reproduce the variability in the images, we apply an MPS algorithm to the set of selected snapshots of the sedimentary basin that serve as training images. The training images are chosen from among the initial set by using the distance measure to ensure that only dissimilar images are chosen. Preliminary investigations show that MPS can reproduce fairly accurately the natural variability of the experimental depositional system. Furthermore, the selected training images provide process information. They fall into three basic patterns: a channelized end member, a sheet flow end member, and one intermediate case. These represent the continuum between autogenic bypass or erosion, and net deposition.",

A sustained, observationally-driven carbon monitoring system using remote sensing data has the potential to significantly improve the relevant carbon cycle information base for the U.S. and world. Initiated in 2010, NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) project is prototyping and conducting pilot studies to evaluate technological approaches and methodologies to meet carbon monitoring and reporting requirements for multiple users and over multiple scales of interest. NASA’s approach emphasizes exploitation of the satellite remote sensing resources, computational capabilities, scientific knowledge, airborne science capabilities, and end-to-end system expertise that are major strengths of the NASA Earth Science program. Through user engagement activities, the NASA CMS project is taking specific actions to be responsive to the needs of stakeholders working to improve carbon MRV frameworks. The first phase of NASA CMS projects focused on developing products for U.S. biomass/carbon stocks and global carbon fluxes, and on scoping studies to identify stakeholders and explore other potential carbon products. The second phase built upon these initial efforts, with a large expansion in prototyping activities across a diversity of systems, scales, and regions, including research focused on prototype MRV systems and utilization of COTS technologies. Priorities for the future include: 1) utilizing future satellite sensors, 2) prototyping with commercial off-the-shelf technology, 3) expanding the range of prototyping activities, 4) rigorous evaluation, uncertainty quantification, and error characterization, 5) stakeholder engagement, 6) partnerships with other U.S. agencies and international partners, and 7) modeling and data assimilation.",

The interpretation of these seismic data and the corresponding numerical modelling require measurements of the elastic and inelastic properties of representative Earth materials under experimental simulated in-situ pressure-temperature conditions. Seismic tomography studies and corresponding numerical models have demonstrated that under certain conditions subducting slabs can even reach the core mantle boundary. That means former crustal rocks became heavily overprinted by increasing pressure, temperature, deformation and partial material exchange. Because there is no known geodynamic mechanism able to bring them back to the surface as a whole, we cannot sample them. But there is no indication to assume they are simpler than their parental rocks - quite the contrary. I think the first-order future challenge for large volume geophysical high pressure research is to measure data for an understanding of the relation between structural and physical properties of these complex polymineral rock-like assemblages. The paper presents the results of petrophysical transient experiments with natural rocks under uppermost mantle conditions and first steps to perform in-situ experiments under deep mantle conditions.",

We remove magnitude scaling and geometric spreading functions from observed ground motions and invert for stress parameter, regional attenuation and site amplification. Resolving these parameters allows for the derivation of a regionally-calibrated GMPE that can be used to accurately predict amplitudes across the region in real time, which is useful for ground-motion-based alerting systems and traffic light protocols. The derived GMPE has further applications for the evaluation of hazards from induced seismicity.",

The cesium-137 (Cs-137) contents in throughfall, stemflow, and litterfall were monitored in two coniferous stands (plantation of Japanese cedar) and a deciduous broad-leaved forest stand (Japanese oak with red pine). We also measured the ambient dose rate (ADR) at different heights in the forest using a survey meter and a portable Ge gamma-ray detector.\nTotal Cs-137 deposition flux from the canopy to forest floor for the mature cedar, young cedar, and the mixed broad-leaved stands were 166 kBq/m2, 174 kBq/m2, and 60 kBq/m2, respectively. These values correspond to 38%, 40% and 13% of total atmospheric input after the accident. The ambient dose rate in forest exhibited height dependency and its vertical distribution varied with forest type and stand age. The ambient dose rate showed an exponential decrease with time for all the forest sites, however the decreasing trend differed depending on the height of dose measurement and forest type. The ambient dose rate at the canopy (approx. 10 m-height) decreased faster than that expected from physical decay of the two radiocesium isotopes, whereas those at the forest floor varied between the three forest stands. The radiocesium deposition via throughfall seemed to increase ambient dose rate during the first 200 days after the accident, however there was no clear relationship between litterfall and ambient dose rate since 400 days after the accident. These data suggested that the ambient dose rate in forest environment varied both spatially and temporally reflecting the transfer of radiocesium from canopy to forest floor. However, further monitoring investigation and analysis are required to determine the effect of litterfall on long-term trend of ambient dose rate in forest environments.",

This is typically done by using a prediction equation that quantifies amplitudes as a function of key seismological variables such as magnitude, distance and site condition. In this study, we develop a hybrid empirical prediction equation for earthquakes in western Alberta, where evaluation of seismic hazard associated with induced seismicity is of particular interest. We use peak ground motions and response spectra from recorded seismic events to model the regional source and attenuation attributes. The available empirical data is limited in the magnitude range of engineering interest (M>4). Therefore, we combine empirical data with a simulation-based model in order to obtain seismologically informed predictions for moderate-to-large magnitude events. The methodology is two-fold. First, we investigate the shape of geometrical spreading in Alberta. We supplement the seismic data with ground motions obtained from mining/quarry blasts, in order to gain insights into the regional attenuation over a wide distance range. A comparison of ground-motion amplitudes for earthquakes and mining/quarry blasts show that both event types decay at similar rates with distance and demonstrate a significant Moho-bounce effect. In the second stage, we calibrate the source and attenuation parameters of a simulation-based prediction equation to match the available amplitude data from seismic events. We model the geometrical spreading using a trilinear function with attenuation rates obtained from the first stage, and calculate coefficients of anelastic attenuation and site amplification via regression analysis. This provides a hybrid ground-motion prediction equation that is calibrated for observed motions in western Alberta and is applicable to moderate-to-large magnitude events.",

Our current general circulation models (GCMs), however, exhibit rather limited capability in representing this prominent tropical variability mode. Meanwhile, fundamental physics of the MJO are still elusive. In this presentation, by analyzing 27 climate models that participated in the WCRP-WWRP/THORPEX YOTC MJO Task Force and GEWEX GASS global MJO model inter-comparison project, key processes responsible for realistic MJO simulations are explored based on budget analysis of moist static energy (MSE). Results suggest that horizontal advection of MSE, particularly the dry air intrusion from the west of the MJO convection, plays a crucial role for realistic eastward propagation of the MJO in GCM simulations. Due to model deficiencies in simulating both the MJO circulation and spatial distribution of background MSE, the horizontal advection of MSE is greatly underestimated in the poor MJO models, and largely offset by effects from radiative and surface fluxes, leading to rather weak eastward or even westward propagation of MJO convection in those models.",

Recently, as a result of the so-called surface warming hiatus, there has been considerable interest in global ocean heat content (OHC) changes in the deeper ocean, including natural and anthropogenically forced changes evidenced in observational, modelling, and data re-analysis studies. We rely on OHC change estimates from a diverse collection of measurement systems including data from the 19th Century Challenger expedition, a multi-decadal record of ship-based in-situ mostly upper ocean measurements, the more recent near-global Argo floats profiling to intermediate (2000m) depths, and full-depth repeated transoceanic sections. By diagnosing simulated global OHC changes in historically-forced climate models in three depth layers, we show that the current generation of climate models is broadly consistent with multi-decadal estimates of upper, intermediate (700­-2000m) and deep (2000m - ­bottom) global OHC changes as well as with Argo-based estimates over the most recent period. Our results suggest that nearly half of the 1860-­present human-caused increases in global ocean heat content may have occurred since 1998.",

To better understand and monitor urban FFCO2 emissions, we need timely estimates at fine spatial resolution. However, currently available global estimates have coarse resolution of 10km or more except for some US cities which have finer FFCO2 estimates at ~250m (Hestia Project; Gurney et al. 2012). We construct an urban sectoral emission model for the U.S. based on multiple cities and spatially disaggregate each sector to arrive at finely resolved emissions data products. We then calibrate our results with other datasets to confirm whether this approach can be applicable in any global urban domain.\nWe acquire 2012 annual emissions estimates from EPA’s national emissions inventory for the Los Angeles megacity and Indianapolis and apply our U.S. urban sectoral emission model to derive sectoral estimates. We then spatially distribute these sectoral emissions based on activity and other proxy data. We combine remote sensing and open source data such as national land cover data, population density, impervious surface, and road maps to develop intensity metrics of energy use within each sector. These intensity metrics are then used to spatially allocate emissions within each sector. We incorporate global powerplant emissions data to complete our emissions datasets. We validate our urban FFCO2 emissions datasets, both at sectoral and city scales, against Hestia results for two cities and, in case of Indianapolis, compare to results from inverse modeling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This study will guide the next phase of research by developing the methodology to determine the spatial variation of FFCO2 emissions in select cities around the world.",

            "abstract": "Estuaries act as coastal filters for organic and inorganic fluvial materials in which microbial, biogeochemical, and ecological processes combine to transform organic matter and nutrients prior to export to the coastal ocean. The function of this estuarine ‘bioreactor’ is linked to the residence times of those materials and to rates of microbial heterotrophic activity. Our ability to forecast the impact of global change on estuarine bioreactor function requires an understanding of the basic controls on microbial community activity and diversity. In the Columbia River estuary, the microbial community undergoes a dramatic seasonal shift in species composition during which a spring bacterioplankton community, dominated by Flavobacteriaceae and Oceanospirillales, is replaced by a summer community, dominated by Rhodobacteraceae and several common marine taxa. This annual shift occurs in July, following the spring freshet, when river flow and river chlorophyll concentration decrease and when estuarine water residence time increases. Analysis of a large dataset from 17 research cruises (1990-2014) showed that the composition of particulate organic matter in the estuary changes after the freshet with decreasing organic carbon and nitrogen content, and increasing contribution of marine and autochthonous estuarine organic matter (based on PO13C and pigment ratios). Bacterial production rates (measured as leucine or thymidine incorporation rates) in the estuary respond to this change, and correlate strongly with labile particulate nitrogen concentration and temperature during individual sampling campaigns, and with the concentration of chlorophyll in the Columbia River across all seasons. Regression models suggest that the concentration of labile particulate nitrogen and the rate of bacterial production can be predicted from sensor measurements of turbidity, salinity, and temperature in the estuary and chlorophyll in the river. These results suggest that the quality of particulate organic matter supplied by the river influences the composition of estuarine bacterial communities and the degree to which the Columbia River estuary functions as a bioreactor for fluvial particulate material.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_Ko-1.pdf\nIn much of Earth history, basaltic crust has been injected into the mantle due to its high density. In Archean, downwelling basaltic crust is thought to be much more mafic (Mg/Si=0.72) than that of the modern mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) (Mg/Si=0.25). This difference in composition may result in different behaviors of basaltic crust in the mantle with time. We have studied the two compositions of ancient basalt: x=0.8 (Mg/Si=0.72) and x=0.4 (Mg/Si=0.54). The former represents a composition at 3.5 Ga. The glass starting materials were mixed with gold (10 wt%) for internal pressure scale and loaded into the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC) together with a Ne or Ar medium. We have conducted in-situ X-ray diffraction at APS up to 34 GPa and 2200 K. The recovered samples have been analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in aberration-corrected electron microscopy (ACEM) at ASU. The previous study of the modern MORB reported the post-garnet transition occurs at 26-27 GPa and 1800 K. The same transition was observed at a similar pressure range within 2 GPa for both compositions. The post-spinel transition was observed in x=0.8 at 24±2 GPa, while it does not exist in x=0.4 and modern MORB due to the absence of ringwoodite. At 34 GPa and 2200 K, mineralogy of x=0.8 consists of 82% of bridgmanite (bm), 16% of Ca perovskite (CaPv), and 2% of stishovite (stv), while the modern MORB consists of 30% of stv, 26% of CaPv, 23% of bm, and 22% of aluminous phases (in mole fraction). The mineralogy of x=0.4 is similar to x=0.8 with different proportions, but still different from that of modern MORB. The unit-cell volumes of quenched bm at 1 bar and 300 K for x=0.8 and 0.4 were 166.05(5) and 165.69(6) Å3, respectively, which are smaller than bm in modern MORB (170.0(1) Å3). At high pressures, the unit-cell volume of CaPv is greater in the x=0.4 and 0.8 compositions. The compositions of bm and CaPv in x=0.8 show less Al, but more Mg than those found in modern MORB. The zero-pressure density for x=0.8 is estimated to be 4.30(2) g/cm3 which is greater than that of 4.25 g/cm3 in modern MORB. Our new experimental results suggest that the Archean basaltic crust may be more negatively buoyant than modern MORB, making them viable candidates for the lower-mantle heterogeneities.",

            "abstract": "This study aims at identifying spatial and temporal patterns of surface-atmosphere exchange parameters from highly-resolved and long-term observations. For this purpose, a combination of continuous ground-based measurements and dedicated aircraft campaigns using state-of-the-art remote sensing instrumentation at the Jülich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE) is available. JOYCE provides a constantly growing multi-year data set for detailed insight into boundary layer processes and patterns related to surface conditions since 2011. The JOYCE site is embedded in a rural environment with different crop types.\nThe availability of a scanning microwave radiometer and cloud radar is a unique component of JOYCE. The hemispheric scans of the ground-based radiometer allow the identification and quantification of horizontal gradients in water vapor and liquid water path measurements. How these gradients are connected to near-surface fluxes and the topography depending on the mean wind flow and surface fluxes is investigated by exploring the long-term data set. Additionally, situations with strong coupling to the surface can be identified by observing the atmospheric turbulence and stability within the boundary layer, using different lidar systems. Furthermore, the influence of thin liquid water clouds, which are typical for the boundary layer development, on the radiation field and the interaction with the vegetation is examined. Applying a synergistic statistical retrieval approach, using passive microwave and infrared observations, shows an improvement in retrieving thin liquid cloud microphysical properties.\nThe role of vegetation is assessed by exploiting the time series of the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) signal measured at the ground level using automated measurements. For selected case studies, a comparison to maps of hyperspectral reflectance and SIF obtained from an airborne high-resolution imaging spectrometer is realized.",

            "abstract": "Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is a crucial component of the California water supply. Climate change effects on forest ecosystems in this region have reduced snowpack and resulted in earlier snowmelt. Wildfire frequency and severity in the Sierra Nevada have also increased, due to higher temperatures, drought, and a legacy of fire suppression policies leading to fuel loads augmented beyond the historic range of variability. These combined factors have the potential to severely impact California water supply. Using 2014 California Basin Characterization Model (BCM) climate data and automated classification of various Landsat imagery, this study geospatially quantified the effects of low, moderate, and high- severity wildfire on snowpack and snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Sierra Nevada. An assessment of modeled SWE data were also conducted to examine its usefulness in better understanding areas effected by wildfire. Results indicate little to no significant change in post-fire SWE for high and moderate severity wildfire, however, delineated a significant decrease in post-fire SWE in the low severity wildfire. Additionally, tests show little no significant change in fractional snow cover post-fire. This use of remote sensing and modeled data will assist in decision and policy making related to management of forest ecosystems and water resources within the Sierra Nevada.",

            "abstract": "Forest carbon accumulation generally declines with age, a trend largely attributed to reductions in gross primary production (GPP). However, for many species, uncertainty remains about the specific mechanisms limiting GPP. We examine both tree hydraulic and biochemical parameters affecting carbon uptake across a successional gradient in the southern Appalachian Mountains, utilizing a chronosequence approach with 5-, 10-, and 85-year old forest stands. We conducted measurements on four of the dominant species in the region: Liriodendron tulipifera, Betula lenta, Acer rubrum, and Quercus alba. To assess biochemical photosynthetic capacity, we estimated Vcmax and Jmax from over 140 gas exchange A/Ci curves. We determined that leaf gas exchange measurements performed on excised branches of A. saccharum, L. tulipifera, and Q. alba significantly underestimated assimilation by 35, 26, and 63% on average, respectively. Therefore, A/Ci measurements were performed on in situ canopy branches, using an 18 m boom lift to access the tallest trees. We examine how these photosynthetic parameters vary with age, height, and foliar nitrogen content among tree species and canopy positions. In order to investigate hydraulic factors driving stomatal behavior and therefore carbon uptake, we collected measurements of mid-day and pre-dawn leaf water potential (ψmd and ψpd) and xylem cavitation vulnerability. Preliminary results suggest that ψmd-ψpd decreases with along the chronosequence in anisohydric species, whereas ψmd-ψpd increases or remains stable with age/height in isohydric species. These data will be analyzed together with site- and species-specific hydraulic vulnerability data to assess whether the hydraulic safety margin changes with tree age/height, and explore how these patterns vary among species representing different xylem anatomies and a range of isohydric/anisohydric water management strategies. These results will provide improved estimates of common parameters in terrestrial ecosystem models, and contribute to our ability to predict carbon and water tradeoffs in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthesis is an ancient metabolic process on the early Earth. The most primitive phototrophs used reductants such as H2, H2S, and Fe(II) and were widespread in marine, intertidal, and likely continental habitats. These anoxygenic phototrophs were the key primary producers for the first ~1 billion years before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis at 2.7 Ga. The potential clearly exists for this type of primitive photosynthesis to operate on habitable exoplanets.\nAnoxygenic phototrophs are not known to emit gases that are uniquely biogenic in origin, so we focus on surface pigments signatures as having the strongest promise to offer identifiable biosignatures for a pre-oxygenic habitable exoplanet. Following our earlier work that showed photosynthetic cyanobacteria yield a polarization signature potentially useful in remote sensing, here we seek to characterize the remotely detectable polarization biosignatures associated with anoxygenic phototrophs.\nThe six major pigments of anoxygenic phototrophs (bacteriochlorophylls [Bchls]) absorb in the near-infrared (NIR) from ~705 – 1040 nm. The lower symmetry of the pigment structure relative to chlorophylls shifts the energy absorption bands to longer wavelengths. As a result, Bchls are well suited to absorbing the relatively higher flux of red and NIR radiation of M dwarf stars, the most abundant type of star in the Galaxy, as well as the plentiful flux of typical main sequence stars. Homochirality is a powerful biosignature, and because of the optical activity of biological molecules, it can, in principle, be remotely observed on macroscopic scales using circular polarization spectroscopy. Bchls and Chls are optically active molecules with several chiral centers, strongly interacting with the incident light.\nWe measured the reflectance and transmission full Stokes polarization spectra of pure cultures of anoxygenic phototrophs and environmental samples of microbial mats, and found strong correlations between spectral and polarization features. This work characterizing polarization biosignatures associated with the pigments of anoxygenic phototrophs informs the search for life on exoplanets at a similar stage of evolution or biogeochemical state as the Archean Earth (i.e., pre-oxygenic photosynthesis).",

Our measurements included electric, photographic, seismic, and ascustic. The atmospheric-electricity instruments included a 10-station-LMA, slow antenna, fast antenna, and broad-band-RF. Inaddition to standard photography and video, we had infrared video, low-light video, and high-speed video. The slow antenna showed that typically the predominant charge was negative, but at times it was positive. The larger eruptions show the continual electrical discharges that begin coincident within tenths of a second as the explosion. We have sensed these small discharges in many other volcanic eruptions.",

Therefore mapping and monitoring diversity becomes a necessity to assess changes in ecosystems and understanding their consequences. Diversity can be assessed by using different metrics, such as diversity of functional traits or genetic diversity amongst others. In-situ approaches have provided useful, but usually spatially constrained information, often dependent on expert knowledge. We propose using remote sensing in combination with in-situ sampling at different spatial scales.\nWe map phylogenetic and genetic diversity using airborne imaging spectroscopy in combination with terrestrial and airborne laser scanning, as well as exhaustive in-situ sampling schemes. To this end, we propose to link leaf optical properties using a taxonomic approach (spectranomics) to genetic and phylogenetic diversity.\nThe test site is a managed mixed temperate forest on the south-facing slope of Laegern Mountain, Switzerland (47°28'42.0“ N, 8°21'51.8“ E, 682 m.a.s.l.). The intensive sampling area is roughly 300m x 300m and dominant species are European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Ash (Fraxinus excelsior).\nWe perform phylogenetic and intraspecific genetic variation analyses for the five most dominant tree species at the test site. For these species, information on functional biochemical and architectural plant traits diversity is retrieved from imaging spectroscopy and laser scanning data and validated with laboratory and in-situ measurements.\nTo assess regional-scale genetic diversity, the phylogenetic and genetic signals are quantified using the remote sensing data, resulting in spatially distributed intra-specific genetic variation.\nWe discuss the usefulness of combined remote sensing and in-situ sampling, to bridge diversity scales from genetic to canopy level.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency of hydrothermal circulation as a heat and mass exchanger is strongly modulated by the permeability structure of newly formed oceanic crust, which is known to vary spatially and temporally. Here we use the modulation of discharge temperatures by oscillatory tidal loading to estimate permeability vs. depth profiles beneath hydrothermal discharge zones at three basalt-hosted hydrothermal fields.\nPhase lags between fluctuations in discharge temperature and seafloor tidal loading have previously been inverted for the permeability of the underlying discharge zone using the poroelastic modulation model of Jupp and Schulz [2004]. This has yielded a wide range of permeability estimates ranging from 10-13­–10-9 m2. Here we extend the model to a stratified medium comprising a top layer (2A) of permeability k2A overlying a bottom layer (2B) of permeability k2B. We apply it to three basalt-hosted hydrothermal fields on a slow- (Lucky Strike), intermediate- (Main Endeavour Field), and fast-spreading (East Pacific Rise, EPR-9ºN) ridge, where stratification is well known from seismic studies.\nWe estimate a layer 2A permeability of ~10-10 m2 at Lucky Strike, in sharp contrast with EPR-9ºN, where k2A ~ 10-13 m2. At the Main Endeavour field, two different sites located above different distinct discharge zones (as indicated by magnetic studies) yield a high and a low permeability. The permeability of layer 2B is not as well constrained as that of layer 2A, with possible values ranging from 10-14–10-12 m2. We note, however, that the variability in measured phase lags across hydrothermal fields is compatible with a uniform layer 2B permeability of ~10-13 m2. Using theoretical scalings for high-Rayleigh porous convection, we demonstrate that the permeability of layer 2B sets the \"effective permeability\" of the entire convective system, and therefore the efficiency of heat extraction through young oceanic crust. A uniform layer 2B permeability would thus reconcile the observed variability of shallow permeability estimates with the effective value of 10-13 m2 that is often needed to account for the heat transferred at many hydrothermal sites.",

In a previous study, fine-grained sediment sample cores were collected from the Lower Hudson River basin and dated via radionuclides. An objective source appointment method has been established based on several source-sensitive molecular indicators we found. An over 100 year historical record of energy usage in New York City has been reconstructed in cores from Central Park Lake. The reconstructed history is consistent with historical energy consumption data of NYS complied by the US Department of Energy. Wood combustion was dominant one century ago in Manhattan, followed by coal combustion dominance from the 1900s to the 1940s. Petroleum combustion, mainly from motor vehicles in Manhattan, increased gradually from the 1920s, and became the dominant PAH input after 1940s. In most samples collected from elsewhere in the lower Hudson River Basin, petroleum combustion was the dominant PAH input in the last half century. From 2001 to 2012, indoor and outdoor air filter samples were collected from NYC apartments; though non-volatile PAH levels were quite stable, pyrene, which is a semi-volatile PAHs compound, increased over these 12 years, especially in the heating season. The burning of No.6 oil in NYC boilers is thought to lead to this increase and the recent effort in switching No. 6 heating oil to No.2 oil has the potential to overturn the increasing trend.",

            "abstract": "The downstream termination of gravel is measured for two fluvial-deltaic systems: the Selenga and Mississippi rivers. These end-members vary by an order of magnitude for slope, water and sediment discharge, and delta area. Moreover, the contrast between the tectonic regimes of the receiving basins is stark: the Selenga delta is located along the deep-water margin of Lake Baikal, which is an active half-graben rift basin, while the Mississippi discharges onto a passive margin with little tectonic influence. Nevertheless, the two rivers share a striking sedimentological similarity: near the delta apex, gravel is eliminated from the downstream dispersal system, and so sediment reaching the land-water interface is exclusively sand and mud. Field data for both rivers, including sediment samples and water discharge and flow velocity measurements, are used to validate morphodynamic models that assess the downstream changes in fluid stress and gravel transport. The analyses show that there are two distinct mechanisms that drive gravel deposition and prohibit dispersal throughout the delta. For the Selenga, water partitioning among bifurcating channels produces a non-linear reduction in shear stress and gravel deposition. For the Mississippi, backwater flow arrests the downstream movement of gravel during low and moderate water discharges, and although floods overcome backwater and produce uniform flow to the outlet, the duration of floods is too short to disperse gravel throughout the delta. Given sufficient time, model results indicate that both rivers should approach morphodynamic equilibrium, whereby aggradation due to sediment deposition raises local bed slope and sediment transport capacity, thereby facilitating downstream gravel movement. However, both systems possess unique characteristics that prevent this process from occurring. For the Selenga, tectonically induced movements regularly down drop portions of the delta below base level, forcing renewed delta sedimentation. For the Mississippi, channel filling produces regular avulsions, whereby mainstem channels are abandoned. In both cases, sediment is sequestered in perpetuity, and gravel dispersal within the delta begins anew. This presentation will discuss the stratigraphic implications for these different scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Following the passage of Voyager-1 through the Heliopause in August 2012, anomalous cosmic rays essentially disappeared while galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) leveled to a remarkably constant flux. There were two notable exceptions: in March 2013 and May 2014 Voyager-1 experienced small increases of GCRs in the few hundred MeV range. Both events lasted a couple of weeks and were followed by detection of plasma oscillation (Gurnett et al., 2013, 2015). We shall discuss the pitch-angle distribution of GCRs, seen by LECP, and the time profiles of these events. We interpreted the first event as the GCRs remotely sensing a disturbance passing through the magnetic field line of Voyager-1: particles gained energy as they were reflected on the approaching region of stronger magnetic field of the disturbance. Here, we show that energy gain is not restricted to reflected particles, and the effect should be present at all pitch angles in the hemisphere facing the disturbance. The maximum increase of GCR intesity is predicted to occur at the critical reflection angle.\nThe time profile starts with a sharp increase if GCRs are reflected from a sharp shock. However, the disturbance need not be very sharp. For instance, Voyager-1 magnetometer (Burlaga et al., 2013) detected a gradual 5-day increase of the field strength, B, in November 2012. A disturbance with a similar gradual profile would produce a smoother time-profile in the GCR flux at Voyager-1. We shall present numerical simulations and discuss their implications.\nBurlaga, L.F., et al., Astrophys.

            "abstract": "Small, low-power electro-optical scientific payloads are required if small satellites and CubeSats are to become significant enablers of new science. Although these are just one class of scientific instrumentation they have often played a key role in many scientific discoveries. The most significant advances in Earth and space science, over the next decade are most likely to derive from new observational techniques. The connection between advances in scientific understanding and technology has historically been demonstrated across many disciplines and time.\nIn this paper we present a review of three such sensors and the associated CubeSat missions and scientific investigation enabled. Each mission involves a relatively recently developed small electro-optical sensor which is tightly integrated with the small satellite bus in to a “Science Craft”. The first is the NSF funded OPAL mission which makes use of a high-sensitivity, hyper-spectral limb imager to observe the daytime O2 A-band (near 762nm) emission. These observations allow the temperature of the lower thermosphere to be determined and address questions on the energy budget and response of the thermosphere to geomagnetic storms. The second is the MeNISCuS mission Methane Nadir Imaging Spatial-heterodyne CubeSat Spectrometer which is a demonstration of the volume holographic grating (VHG) spatial heterodyne spectrometer developed under a NASA-sponsored STTR contract. Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas and although burning methane produces less CO2 than oil or coal, methane’s global warming potential is about ~30 times higher. As a result, if methane leak rates are greater than 3-5%, the warming potential will outweigh the benefit of reduced CO2. The sources of such leaks can be discovered using missions like MeNISCuS. The third instrument and mission is SEDI a CubeSat scaled Fabry-Perot spectrometer focused on a narrow band around the OI(630) red line for observing winds in the thermosphere. These winds are also important for addressing how the earth’s thermosphere responds to energy inputs from the lower atmosphere below and the space weather inputs from above.\nWe present high level instrument overviews and show how these instruments and CubeSats platforms are used to enable scientific investigations.",

(2004) and requires substantial research efforts to evaluate the capabilities of the method. We have conducted finite element (FE) modeling using the AC/DC module of Comsol Multiphysics to determine the effect of resistivity structure on the phase tensor response. Measurements are made at eleven frequencies from 10-104 Hz at points on a 5x5 grid above various simple model geometries. Phase tensor plotting methods are adapted from Booker (2013) and involve displaying data graphically as stacks of colored ellipses. This allows for interpretation across the frequency spectrum vertically as well as laterally between stations. Two types of plot are presented for each model, a “ϕmin plot” where the ellipses are colored according to the minimum principle phase and a “delta plot” where the ellipses are colored according to the difference between the principle phases (ϕmax - ϕmin), which provides a quantification of the phase anisotropy. Results suggest that the principle phases ϕmin and ϕmax are sensitive to vertical resistivity contrasts but not lateral resistivity contrasts. Conversely, delta plots reveal sensitivity to lateral resistivity contrasts but not vertical resistivity contrasts. A clear distance relationship is observed with proximity to the boundary controlling the frequency range that senses a lateral resistivity contrast. Rotation of the phase tensor ellipses and increased skew values occur in the presence of resistivity contrasts that strike nonparallel to the source field, with the effect increasing towards lower frequencies. The total phase tensor response is confirmed to be sensitive to both vertical and lateral resistivity contrasts and can be used effectively to interpret subsurface resistivity structure.",

Here, empirical orthogonal function analysis is applied to the space-model index domain of precipitation climatologies over the Pacific from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations to explore systematic variation across the ensemble. Two patterns, generically termed principal uncertainty patterns (PUPs), are identified in the December-January-February climatology: the leading PUP is associated with spread in the meridional width of deep convection, while the second is associated with tradeoffs in precipitation intensity along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the spurious Southern Hemisphere ITCZ. These PUPs manifest physically plausible relationships to spread in simulated sea surface temperatures (SSTs), circulation, and moisture.

This study investigates δ13C - Si/HCO3 systematics of the Cauvery River basin which flows through silicate lithology in the higher reaches and carbonate lithology with pedogenic and marine carbonates dominating the terrain in the lower reaches of the basin. The samples for the present study were collected at locations within the watershed during Pre-Monsoon and Monsoon Season 2014. The measurements of stable isotope ratios of δ13CDIC and were accomplished through a Thermo Scientific GasBench II interface connected to a MAT 253 IRMS.\nWe captured a large spatial variation in δ13C and Si/HCO3 values during both seasons; Pre-Monsoon δ13C values ranges between -17.57‰ to -4.02‰ and during Monsoon it varies between -9.19‰ to +0.61‰. These results indicate a two end-member mixing component i.e. a silicate and a carbonate end member; governing the weathering interactions of the Cauvery River. Within the drainage basin, we identified silicate and carbonate dominating sources by using contributions of DIC and δ13C. Si/HCO3 values for Pre-Monsoon ranges between 0.028 - 0.67 and for Monsoon it varies between 0.073 - 0.80. Lighter δ13C composition was observed at sampling sites at higher altitude in contrast to sampling sites at flood plain which show relatively enriched δ13C which indicate mixing of soil derived CO2 with C4 plants. Result suggests dominance of carbonate weathering during the Monsoon Period, while silicate weathering is pronounced during Pre- Monsoon period.",

Such responses include changes in the water level, hydrochemistry and streamflow discharge. Earthquake effects on hydrological systems provide a means to study the interaction between stress changes and regional hydrology, which is otherwise rarely possible. Chile is a country of frequent and large earthquakes and thus provides abundant opportunities to study such interactions and processes.\nHere we present streamflow responses to several Chilean Megathrust earthquakes, including the 1943 Mw 8.1 Coquimbo, 1950 Mw 8.2 Antofagasta, 1960 Mw 9.5 Valdivia, 1985 Mw 8.0 Valparaiso, 1995 Mw 8.0 Antofagasta, 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule, and the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquakes. The stream gauges (n=716) are scattered across Chile, from the Altiplano in the North to Tierra del Fuego in the South. The network thus covers the Andes mountain ranges, the central valley, the Coastal Mountain ranges and (mainly in the more southern parts) the Coastal flats.\nWe combine empirical magnitude-distance relationships, tree-based machine learning tools, and process-based modeling to characterize responses. We first assess the streamflow anomalies and relate these to environmental factors including geology, topography, altitude, soil and vegetation. We then apply 1D-groundwater flow modeling to selected catchments in order to test competing hypotheses for the origin of streamflow changes. We show that the responses of streamflow were heterogeneous, both in sign (decreases and increases in discharge) and in magnitude.",

Extensive knowledge of the elastic properties of complex garnet, of chemical composition pertinent to the region and at relevant high pressures and temperatures, is necessary to constrain the composition of the region and to explain the steep compressional wave (P-wave) and shear wave (S-wave) velocity gradients observed from seismic studies. We have measured the acoustic wave velocities of synthetic polycrystalline complex garnet of a suitable pyroxene composition (Mg1.875Ca0.75Fe0.375 Na0.5Al0.5Si4O12) at simultaneous pressures (P) up to 9.5 GPa and temperatures (T) up to 1000 K in a DIA-type apparatus using ultrasonic interferometry in conjunction with energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray imaging. Travel times of the P- and S-waves, X-ray image data, and X-ray diffraction data were collected during cooling cycles to minimize the effect of non-hydrostatic stress on the specimen. Elastic adiabatic bulk (KS) and shear (G) moduli data were fit to polynomial equations in P and T, yielding (∂KS/∂P)T = 4.6 (1) and (∂G/∂P)T = 1.27 (3) for the pressure derivatives of the elastic KS and G, respectively, and (∂KS/∂T)p = -15.0 (7) MPa/K and (∂G/∂T)P = -10.4 (2) MPa/K for the temperature derivatives of KS and G, respectively. The results are consistent with those of previous studies on garnets of varying compositions, and in general suggest that the pressure and temperature dependence of the elastic bulk and shear moduli of garnet may be insensitive to the garnet composition.",

Several lumped parameter models (LPM)s were considered to represent the groundwater age distribution at each well, including binary mixtures between Inverse Gaussian(young) and Dirac(old), generalized inverse Gaussian, and Levy distributions . LPM model parameters and unknown physical parameters (crustal production rate of 4He, dissolved inorganic carbon contribution from rock dissolution) were estimated using a Bayesian inference, resulting in the posterior probability distribution of the parameters and therefore the uncertainty associated with each. The performance of each LPM in reproducing the data while accounting for the level of model complexity is evaluated using deviance information criteria (DIC) and Bayes Factors (BF). Historical nitrate concentration data are also evaluated as an additional tracer to refine the age distribution. We found that historical nitrate levels can reduce the uncertainty about the age distribution. LPMs with a distinct feature to represent the old fraction of groundwater (for example Inverse Gaussian-Dirac) are better at reproducing the tracer data but with the price of a larger number of parameters, which results in a larger uncertainty about the age distribution itself. Although the uncertainty regarding the shape of the age distribution remains relatively high, whether nitrate is included as a tracer or not, different models predict similar future trends in nitrate concentration.",

            "abstract": "Historically, climate models have been developed incrementally and in compiled languages like Fortran. While the use of legacy compiled\nlanguages results in fast, time-tested code, the resulting model is limited in its modularity and cannot take advantage of functionality\navailable with modern computer languages. Here we describe an effort at using the open-source, object-oriented language Python\nto create more flexible climate models: the package qtcm, a Python implementation of the intermediate-level Neelin-Zeng Quasi-Equilibrium Tropical Circulation model (QTCM1) of the atmosphere. The qtcm package retains the core numerics of QTCM1, written in Fortran, to optimize model performance but uses Python structures and utilities to wrap the QTCM1 Fortran routines and manage model execution. The resulting \"mixed language\" modeling package allows order and choice of subroutine execution to be altered at run time, and model analysis and visualization to be integrated in interactively with model execution at run time. This flexibility facilitates more complex scientific analysis using less complex code than would be possible using traditional languages alone and provides tools to transform the traditional \"formulate hypothesis → write and test code → run model → analyze results\" sequence into a feedback loop that can be executed automatically by the computer.",

To date, the program has reached over 3500 participants, with 1600 stakeholders from 100 countries in 2015 alone. The goals of the program are to develop the technical and analytical skills necessary to utilize NASA resources for decision-support, and to help end-users navigate through the vast, freely available and open data resources. We discuss ARSET’s best practices and training approach to improved data access and application of NASA satellite and model data for air quality, water resources, disasters, land, and wildfire management. ARSET follows an iterative approach where the end user community is engaged and data needs input is solicited throughout the training process. End-user data needs and feedback are also incorporated into current and future training content and communicated to NASA Applied Sciences Program principal investigators and data centers responsible for developing NASA tools, portals, data formats, and other data delivery structures. ARSET’s success has relied upon 1) targeting outreach to applied science professionals both as training participants and collaborators in developing training activities 2) developing training content tailored to a specific to community’s decision support activities and unique environmental challenges 3) promoting interactive forums during trainings to capture and assess end-user needs 4) training scientists within the program in science communication 5) adopting a contextualized gradual learning approach through online and hands-on instruction, and 6) conducting program evaluation, used to assess the benefit of ARSET to program participants and to plan and adapt future training content, methods, and outreach activities.",

            "abstract": "In addition to great flash floods, medium and low magnitude discharge events can also cause great morphological changes in ephemeral river channels. Despite the advances in measurement techniques, such as laser scanning, and simulation approaches, the channel evolution during the different phases of discharge events is still not well known in gravelly ephemeral rivers, such as Rambla de la Viuda (Spain).\nThe aim is to detect the temporal evolution of the ephemeral river channel during consecutive medium (March 2013) and low (May 2013) magnitude discharge events. The study is based on both accurate topographical measurements (laser scanning) and morphodynamic simulations (Delft 2D). Before the final analysis, the model’s performance was tested with different parameterizations. When compared to the observed channel changes, the transport equation had crucial role in simulation results. Engelund-Hansen equation succeeded the best. It was important to use spatially varying grain sizes.\nErosion and deposition (m3) were the greatest during the first hours of the rising phase of the discharge events. After this, erosion and deposition amounts, which were detected hourly, started declining. Thus, this occurred before the peak discharge, and erosion slowed down more than deposition. After the discharge peak, changes in deposition and erosion amounts were slightly more gradual than changes in discharge. The deposition during the receding phase was due to the advancing bar lobe frontier. River bed changes followed temporally the changes in discharges during the receding phase. This was different to the rising phase, when temporal differences occurred between changes in discharges and changes in deposition and erosion. This study shows that both rising and receding phases of discharge events are important for bar movement and channel evolution of the gravelly ephemeral river.",

            "abstract": "Planetary jet streams and vortices have been studied for over 350 years, yet their origin and dynamics are still vigorously debated. On both Jupiter and Saturn zonal flow consists of equatorial superrotation and alternating East-West jets at higher latitude. On Jupiter, numerous vortices, the vast majority anticyclones, occur with various sizes and lifetimes, interacting strongly with the zonal flow. Saturn's vortices and jets are also clearly coupled, and its North and South polar vortices are cyclonic. Models of giant planet atmospheres have generally been of two classes. Shallow flow models produce jets and vortices from 2D turbulence in a very thin spherical layer, but require special conditions to reproduce observed equatorial superrotation. In contrast, deep convection models generically reproduce equatorial superrotation, but typically lack coherent vortices, which do not survive the formation of jets. Here, we combine elements of both approaches using a 3D spherical shell compressible fluid numerical model, driven by convection at depth, but grading to a stably stratified shallow layer. In typical model simulations convective plumes rising from the deep interior impinge on the stably stratified layer, diverge near the outer spherical surface, and efficiently create the dominant anticyclones, which are shielded by downwelling cyclonic rings and filaments. These results may explain the dominance of anticyclones and the flow structure of small and medium sized anticyclonic ovals on Jupiter. The largest of our model vortices form in westward anticyclonic shear nearest the equatorial jet, similar to Saturn’s \"storm alley\" and Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. We also explore conditions under which cyclones, including polar cyclones like those on Saturn, may form.",

            "abstract": "The high vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate conditions causes serious concern regarding climate change impacts on crop development and production, particularly in vulnerable areas like the Mediterranean Basin.\nCrop simulation models are the most common tools applied for the assessment of such impacts on crop development and yields, both at local and regional scales. However, the use of these models in regional impact studies requires spatial input data for weather, soil, management, etc, whose resolution could affect simulation results. Indeed, the uncertainty in projecting climate change impacts on crop phenology and yield at the regional scale is affected not only by the uncertainty related to climate models and scenarios, but also by the downscaling methods and the resolution of climate data.\nThe aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects of spatial resolutions of climate projections in estimating maturity date and grain yield for different varieties of durum wheat, common wheat and maize in Italy. The simulations were carried out using the CSM-CERES-Wheat and CSM-CERES-Maize crop models included in the DSSAT-CSM (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer - Cropping System Model) software, parameterized and evaluated in different experimental sites located in Italy. Dynamically downscaled climate data at different resolutions and different RCP scenarios were used as input in the crop models. A spatial platform, DSSAT-CSM based, developed in R programming language was applied to perform the simulation of maturity date and grain yield for durum wheat, common wheat and maize in each grid cell.\nResults, analyzed at the national and regional level, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since the dawn of earth observation imagery, particularly from systems like Landsat and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, there has been an overarching desire to regionally estimate crop production remotely. Research efforts integrating space-based imagery into yield models to achieve this need have indeed paralleled these systems through the years, yet development of a truly useful crop production monitoring system has been arguably mediocre in coming. As a result, relatively few organizations have yet to operationalize the concept, and this is most acute in regions of the globe where there are not even alternative sources of crop production data being collected.\nHowever, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has continued to push for this type of data source as a means to complement its long-standing, traditional crop production survey efforts which are financially costly to the government and create undue respondent burden on farmers. Corn and soybeans, the two largest field crops in the United States, have been the focus of satellite-based production monitoring by NASS for the past decade. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been seen as the most pragmatic input source for modeling yields primarily based on its daily revisit capabilities and reasonable ground sample resolution.\nThe research methods presented here will be broad but provides a summary of what is useful and adoptable with satellite imagery in terms of crop yield estimation. Corn and soybeans will be of particular focus but other major staple crops like wheat and rice will also be presented. NASS will demonstrate that while MODIS provides a slew of vegetation related products, the traditional normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is still ideal. Results using land surface temperature products, also generated from MODIS, will also be shown. Beyond the MODIS data itself, NASS research has also focused efforts on understanding a variety of data mining and modeling options and results strongly lean toward solutions of ensemble decision trees like Cubist and Random Forest. Those comparisons of what are seen as best will be also be shown. And finally, important model refinements accounting for temporal and spatial trends have also been considered and results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - hildur_poster.pdf\nOn August 16, 2014 an intense seismic swarm originated below the eastern part of Bárðarbunga caldera. The seismicity migrated 50 km NNE until August 28 when the migration stopped 10 km south of Askja Volcano. This eventually lead to an eruption in Holuhraun, north of Dyngjujökull, which lasted nearly six months. The migration of seismicity coincided with displacements of continuous GPS (cGPS) stations, suggesting a lateral dyke formation in the Bárðarbunga volcanic system. The volume of the dyke was estimated in near-real time by modeling of geodetic displacements of GPS stations in the vicinity of Bárðarbunga. At the beginning of the swarm, there was only one cGPS station located conveniently enough to observe the dyke propagation. It was therefore evident that more cGPS stations were needed in order to get reliable estimates of the magma volume being intruded into the upper crust. Between August 20th 2014 and July 10th 2015, 14 new cGPS stations were added in the vicinity of Bárðarbunga.\n24 hour GPS solutions weren't suitable enough to monitor the rapidly evolving events during the dyke propagation, so 8 hour solutions were implemented, giving deformation estimates three times each day. For a better visualisation of the developing activity, a map on the Icelandic Meteorological Office's website was made public, showing the rapid development of geodetic displacements and seismicity in near-real time. The 8 hour solutions were used to estimate the volume change of the magma source under Bárðarbunga and the dyke.\nA few days before the eruption in Holuhraun began on August 31, large earthquakes (>M5.0) started occurring in the caldera of Bárðarbunga and soon after, an ongoing collapse of the caldera was discovered. To monitor this subsidence, which ended up being about 66 meters, a GPS device was placed within the caldera. For the purpose of monitoring significant changes in the rate of caldera subsidence, the volume change of a spherical source beneath the volcano was modeled using far-field GPS stations surrounding the caldera, which correlated very well with the subsidence rate measured by the GPS within the caldera.",

Records of CO2 concentrations and temperature for the last 600,000 years indicate a relative stability in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, reflecting a balance between CO2 input to the atmosphere from volcanism and metamorphism, and output via silicate weathering. The absolute rates of these global fluxes contributes to controlling the lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere. It is therefore extremely relevant and important to quantify the rate of the geological cycle for CO2, as this will contribute to the timescale of recovery from a change in policy on anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nHere we review the state of the art in our knowledge of Earth’s geological CO2 output, and highlight causes of large underestimates, largely due to methodological errors in measurement of CO2 flux. We produce a new, corrected estimate and use this to estimate a CO2 lifetime which is significantly shorter than previously thought.",

Trace elements of U, Th, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, the rare earths (REE) and carbon, oxygen and lead isotopes measured across the P-Tr boundary in Spiti are used as proxies for evaluating abrupt changes in this continental shelf environment.\nδ13Corg excursions of 2.4‰ and 3.1‰ in Atargu and Guling P-Tr sections in Spiti Valley are associated with an abrupt fall of biological productivity while δ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb record of these sediments shows effects of diagenesis. Here, the P-Tr boundary is compositionally distinct from the underlying Late Permian gray shales, as a partly gypsiferous ferruginous layer that allows additional geochemical-isotopic investigation of sedimentary sources. Conspicuous Ce – Eu anomalies in the light REE-enriched Late Permian shales reflect the source composition of the adjacent Panjal Trap basalts of Kashmir. An abrupt change of this source to continental crust is revealed by Nb - Ta and Zr - Hf anomalies at the P-Tr ferruginous layer and continuing through the overlying Early Triassic carbonate rocks. Pb concentration and isotope ratios of 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb identify changes in the sedimentary element flux, distinguishing the Late Permian shales from the distinct siliciclastic continental crustal signature in the Early Triassic carbonates. These geochemical-isotopic constraints on the sedimentary geochemistry of one of the most critical transitions in geological record establish the utility of multi-proxy datasets for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient and redox sensitive trace metal that has the potential to be a tracer of pedogenic processes. Globally, riverine δ98Mo values are elevated relative to bedrock, suggesting weathering processes preferentially retain light Mo isotopes, however, the mechanisms governing this process in soils are poorly understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we studied seven soil profiles developed on a 10ka lava flow in Hawaii receiving 600 to 2000 mm mean annual precipitation. We assessed Mo abundance and isotopic composition as a function of soil organic matter (OM) content, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) (oxyhydr)oxide abundance, and Mo loss/gain. We found net accumulation of Mo across all sites (+48% to +289%) that was positively correlated with increasing precipitation, OM content, and Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxide content and inversely correlated with soil depth. Thus, the highest Mo gains are in the wettest surface soil horizons, which also have high OM content. Selective extractions of surface soils indicate that 13% to 40% of mobile Mo is predominately associated with OM; whereas Mo associated with Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides is an order of magnitude lower (0.6% to 6%). The isotopic composition of soil Mo deviated from parent material values (δ98Mo ~-0.15‰). Mo isotopic values were lightest at the dry sites (δ98Mo values of -0.29‰ to -0.63‰) and become heavy with increasing precipitation (δ98Mo -0.2‰ to +0.3‰). At all sites, the surface horizons were isotopically heavy relative to the subsurface horizons, and samples with the heaviest δ98Mo values corresponded with horizons that have gained Mo and have higher OM content. Subsurface Mo isotopic values are lighter than bedrock isotopic composition and may reflect associations with Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. In order further to constrain Mo fluxes into and out of the soil system, we measured Mo isotopes in local rainwater, groundwater, and vegetation. Based on this data, we propose that the gains in Mo relative to parent material are attributed to exogenous inputs of Mo and the preservation of these inputs depends strongly on Mo-OM interactions. These patterns illustrate the potential for Mo as a tracer of pedogenesis in soils and help elucidate the mechanisms that drive heavy δ98Mo values in the global riverine Mo flux.",

This property of silica suspension can potentially be applied to deliver remedial amendments to the subsurface and establish slow release amendment sources for enhanced remediation. In this study, silica-based delivery of carbon sources for in-situ bioremediation enhancement is investigated. Sodium lactate, vegetable oil, ethanol, and molasses have been studied for the interaction with colloidal silica in aqueous suspensions. The rheological properties of the carbon source amendments and silica suspension have been investigated. The lactate-, ethanol-, and molasses-silica suspensions exhibited controllable viscosity increase and eventually became gels under favorable geochemical conditions. The gelation rate was a function of the concentration of silica, salinity, amendment, and temperature. The vegetable oil-silica suspensions increased viscosity immediately upon mixing, but did not perform gelation. The carbon source release rate from the lactate-, ethanol-, and molasses-silica gels was determined as a function of silica, salinity, amendment concentration. The microbial activity stimulation and in-situ bioremediation enhancement by the slow-released carbon from the amendment-silica gels will be demonstrated in future investigations planned in this study.",

            "abstract": "The current understanding of geochemical reactions in reservoirs for geological carbon sequestration (GCS) is largely based on aqueous chemistry (CO2 dissolves in reservoir brine and brine reacts with rocks). However, only a portion of the injected supercritical (sc) CO2 dissolves before the buoyant plume contacts caprock, where it is expected to reside for a long time. Although numerous studies have addressed scCO2-mineral reactions occurring within adsorbed aqueous films, possible reactions resulting from direct CO2-rock contact remain less understood. Does CO2 as a supercritical phase react with reservoir rocks? Do mineral react differently with scCO2 than with dissolved CO2? We selected muscovite, one of the more stable and common rock-forming silicate minerals, to react with scCO2 phase (both water-saturated and water-free) and compared with CO2-saturated-brine. The reacted basal surfaces were analyzed using atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for examining the changes in surface morphology and chemistry. The results show that scCO2 (regardless of its water content) altered muscovite considerably more than CO2-saturated brine; suggest CO2 diffusion into mica interlayers and localized mica dissolution into scCO2 phase. The mechanisms underlying these observations and their implications for GCS need further exploration.",

Published and new magnetobiostratigraphy was used to determine absolute time and to calibrate a cyclostratigraphy based on anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) intensity variations. The ARM data series was tuned to the orbital eccentricity model to remove the effects of sedimentary rate changes between late Lutetian-middle Priabonian chron boundaries (C19-C15) during syntectonic deposition. Sediment accumulation rates increased up section to 1.15 m/kyr during delta progradation with large oscillations in sedimentation rate in phase with eccentricity cyclicity. The ARM data was a proxy for climate change by recording Milankovitch cyclicity in the detrital magnetite concentration of deposits resulting from runoff variability in the wedge-top basin. Incremental tilting rates were calculated between selected growth horizons over 5 myrs of fold growth. The Eocene age limb tilt began rapidly then decreased more slowly at variable rates that were punctuated by periods of tectonic quiescence. Calculated folding rates varied between 0˚ and 100 ˚/myrs and averaged 14 ˚/myr over 100 kyr time increments. Accuracy and precision in the rate calculations include spatial errors associated with outcrop reconstruction and down plunge projection (<10 m and 104 yrs), bedding attitude (few ˚), absolute chron ages (105 yrs), sample spacing (103 yrs), sample size (102 yrs), and orbital tuning (104 yrs). The absolute age resolution on deformation is a few 100 kyrs while the uncertainties in the relative time between growth horizons is less and estimated at ~20 kyrs. Variation in folding rates of the Pico del Aguila anticline is attributed to unsteady thrusting in the fold’s core.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative characterization of the soil surface–subsurface hydrological and thermal processes is essential as they are primary factors that control the biogeochemical processes, ecological landscapes and greenhouse gas fluxes. In the Artic region, the surface–subsurface hydrological and thermal regimes co-interact and are both largely influenced by soil texture and soil organic content. In this study, we present a coupled inversion scheme that jointly inverts hydrological, thermal and geophysical data to estimate the vertical profiles of clay, sand and organic contents. Within this inversion scheme, the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) serves as a forward model to simulate the land-surface energy balance and subsurface hydrological-thermal processes. Soil electrical conductivity (from electrical resistivity tomography), temperature and water content are linked together via petrophysical and geophysical models. Particularly, the inversion scheme accounts for the influences of the soil organic and mineral content on both of the hydrological-thermal dynamics and the petrophysical relationship.\nWe applied the inversion scheme to the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) intensive site in Barrow, AK, which is characterized by polygonal-shaped arctic tundra. The monitoring system autonomously provides a suite of above-ground measurements (e.g., precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, short-long wave radiation, canopy greenness and eddy covariance) as well as below-ground measurements (soil moisture, soil temperature, thaw layer thickness, snow thickness and soil electrical conductivity), which complement other periodic, manually collected measurements. The preliminary results indicate that the model can well reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soil temperature, and therefore, accurately predict the active layer thickness. The hydrological and thermal dynamics are closely linked to the polygon types and polygon features. The results also enable the quantification of the role of organic material in hydrological – thermal processes in the Artic region.",

            "abstract": "In recent years depleted oil reservoirs have received special interest as carbon storage reservoirs because of their potential to offset costs through collaboration with enhanced oil recovery projects. Leakage of the injected CO2 may occur either as supercritical CO2 or CO2-saturated (brine) water. The injected supercritical CO2 is a nonpolar solvent that can potentially mobilize the residual oil compounds into supercritical CO2 and brine water through phase partitioning. For detailed risk assessment of CO2 leakage, various models can be used to quantify the mass of organic contaminants transported from carbon storage sites to potential receptors such as potable aquifers, in which the partition coefficients of crude oil hydrocarbons between CO2/crude oil/brines for subsurface CO2 sequestration scenarios are the key parameters controlling the fate and transport of organic contaminants along the CO2 leakage pathways. However, the solubilities of many of the oil organic compounds in brines under supercritical CO2 condition have not been yet fully determined. In this study, we developed a novel method to accurately measure the partitioning of crude oil organic compounds (BTEX, PAHs, etc.) between supercritical CO2 and brines and to study the effects of temperature, pressure, salinity, and compound’s cosolvency (solubility enhancement) on the partitioning behavior of oil organic compounds along the various CO2 leakage paths in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "The Harvard Water Vapor (HWV) instrument has repeatedly observed moist layers in the extra-tropical stratosphere, with some present well into the stratospheric overworld (>380 K) over the continental United States during the summer. Gravity wave breaking and/or turbulent mixing associated with deep overshooting convection can lead to the irreversible deposition of water as ice in this region, which rapidly sublimates in the undersaturated environment. This convective mechanism provides a means of delivering water vapor to the stratosphere that bypasses the strict thermal control of tropical cold-point tropopause temperatures. This mechanism may also efficiently deliver boundary-layer air, potentially rich in very short lived halogen species, directly to the overworld stratosphere and thus have implications for the future of ozone recovery. The present analysis examines in situ water vapor and long-lived tracer data acquired during encounters with convectively sourced plumes in the overworld stratosphere to quantify the amount of tropospheric air that is delivered via this mechanism. The trace species considered include CO, CH4, CO2 and O3. The data were acquired aboard NASA’s WB-57 and ER-2 aircraft during multiple summertime missions, including the SEAC4RS mission, staged out of Houston, TX, over the past decade. A simple mixing model is used to constrain the convective contribution to each of the trace species. Additionally, we will discuss how the magnitude convective influence decreases with altitude above the tropopause, and what conditions favor convective penetration of the 380 K surface. Given the potential for dramatic changes to convective frequency and strength in response to climate forcing, it is imperative that this term be well characterized for incorporation into prognostic chemistry and climate models.",

The vent fluids are rich in methane and hydrogen suggesting that serpentinization is occurring at depth in the system. Vent temperature of ~365°C, salinity of ~4.5 wt%, and heat output of ~500 MW suggest that Rainbow field is driven by a magmatic heat source and that phase separation is occurring at depth.\nTo understand the origin of high salinity in the Rainbow hydrothermal fluid, we construct a 2D numerical model of two-phase hydrothermal circulation using the numerical simulator FISHES. This code uses the finite volume method to solve the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, and salt equations in a NaCl-H2O fluid. We simulate convection in an open top 2D box at a surface pressure of 23 MPa and seawater temperature of 10oC. The bottom and sides of the box are insulated and impermeable, and a fixed temperature distribution is maintained at the base to ensure phase separation. We first consider a homogeneous model with a permeability of 10-13 m2 and system depths of 2 and 1 km, respectively. The brine-derived fluid from the deeper system barely exceeds seawater, whereas the shallower system produces a short pulse of 9.0 wt% for 5 years. We then consider 1 km deep systems with a high permeability discharge zone of 5x10-13 m2 that corresponds to a fault zone, surrounded by recharge zones of 10-13, 10-14 and 10-15 m2, respectively. The model with recharge permeability of 10-14 m2 yields stable plumes that vent brine-derived fluid of 4.2 wt% for 150 years. Using the quasi- steady state of this model as a base, we estimate the rate of serpentinization along the fluid flow paths, and evolution of porosity and permeability. This analysis will indicate the extent to which serpentinization will affect the dynamics of the system and will provide insight into methane flux in the Rainbow vent field.",

Rice production has been very dynamic due to improved infrastructure, research and development, and better farm management. However, rice production is susceptible to loss caused by drought, pest and disease attack and climate change. With the growing concern on sustainable and self-reliance food production in the country, there is an urgency to encourage research and efforts to increase rice productivity. Attempts to provide spatial distribution of rice fields on high resolution optical remote sensing data have been employed to some extent, however this technology could be costly. The use of UAV has been introduced to estimate damage ratio in rice crop recently in Indonesia. This technology is one of the ways to estimate rice production quicker, cost-saving and before harvesting time. This study aims to analyze spatio temporal and damage ratio of rice crop using UAV in Indonesia. The study empirically presents the use of UAV (Phantom 2 Vision +) on rice fields to the soil condition and development of management zone map in Bali as an example. The study concludes that the use of UAV allows researchers to pin point characteristics of crop and land in a specific area of a farm. This will then allow researchers to assist farmers in implementing specific and appropriate solutions to production issues.\nKey words: UAV, rice production, damage ratio",

            "abstract": "Gas migration within sedimentary basins is central to both carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrocarbon exploration, both of which involve fluid flow over very large length and time scales (102 to >105 m; 1 to >106 y). Seismic imaging is the primary tool for in-situ gas detection in both cases, but it is limited in resolution and can only provide qualitative information about the presence and distribution of gas. Theoretical models can be a strong complement to seismic observations, providing quantitative tools to inform physical understanding, answer basic feasibility questions, and, in CCS, to assess environmental risk and estimate storage capacity. Here, we develop a new model for gas injection into and migration through a multi-layered sedimentary sequence, where the source may be a wellbore (as in CCS) or a natural influx from a deeper source rock or reservoir. We idealize the sequence as consisting of alternating reservoir-like and seal-like layers, where seals are thinner and more fine-grained. For simplicity, we use a sharp-interface model for gas and water migration within each layer, adopting the assumption of vertical-flow equilibrium. We allow for compressibility in both fluids and, crucially, we also allow for leakage of both fluids across the seals, where the gas is subject to a capillary threshold. The model allows us to better understand how leakage enables inter-layer pressure communication, and how this impacts the evolution of the gas distribution in the sequence both during and after injection. The model also supports lateral and vertical heterogeneity in the permeability field, and in the capillary threshold, allowing us to evaluate the effect of leakage within highly-heterogeneous sequences.",

            "abstract": "We use 3D dynamic finite element models to investigate potential rupture paths of earthquakes propagating along faults in the western San Gorgonio Pass (SGP) region of California. The SGP is a structurally complex area along the southern California portion of the San Andreas fault system (SAF). It has long been suspected that this structural knot, which consists of the intersection of various non-planar strike-slip and thrust fault segments, may inhibit earthquake rupture propagation between the San Bernardino and Banning strands of the SAF. The above condition may limit the size of potential earthquakes in the region. Our focus is on the San Bernardino strand of the SAF and the San Gorgonio Pass Fault zone, where the fault connectivity is not well constrained. We use the finite element code FaultMod (Barall, 2009) to investigate how fault connectivity, nucleation location, and initial stresses influence rupture propagation and ground motion, including the likelihood of through-going rupture in this region. Preliminary models indicate that earthquakes that nucleate on the San Bernardino strand and propagate southward do not easily transfer rupture to the thrust faults of the San Gorgonio Pass fault zone. However, under certain assumptions, earthquakes that nucleate along the San Gorgonio Pass fault zone can transfer rupture to the San Bernardino strand.",

Flood inundation maps play a key role in the assessment and mitigation of potential flood hazards. However, there are several communities in the United States where flood risk maps are not available due to the lack of the resources needed to create such maps through the conventional modeling approach. The objective of this study is to develop and examine an economical alternative approach to floodplain mapping using widely available gSSURGO soil data in the United States. The gSSURGO dataset is used to create floodplain maps for the entire United States by using attributes related to soil taxonomy, flood frequency and geomorphic description. For validation, the flood extents obtained from the soil data are compared with existing maps, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), flood extents observed during past floods, and other flood maps derived using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Preliminary results show that overlap between the SSURGO based floodplain maps and FEMA maps range from 65 to 90 percent. While these results are promising, a more comprehensive validation of these maps must be conducted. The soil based approach floodplain mapping approach offers an objective, economical and faster alternative in areas where detailed flood modeling and mapping has not been conducted.",

            "abstract": "The Rio Grande in the Big Bend region of Texas, USA, and Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, has a large sediment supply, and a variable hydrology resulting in rapid channel narrowing during years of low mean and peak flow, and channel widening during rare, large-magnitude floods. This dynamic nature makes the Rio Grande a useful natural laboratory to investigate the relative importance of flow strength and sediment supply in controlling channel change. We analyzed a suite of sediment-transport and geomorphic data to determine the cumulative influence of different flood types on changing channel form. In this study, physically-based analyses suggest that channel change on the Rio Grande is controlled by both changes in flow strength and sediment supply over different spatial and temporal scales.\nChannel narrowing is primarily caused by sediment supplied to the Rio Grande during flash floods on desert tributaries. Tributary floods have large suspended-sediment concentrations, occur for short durations, and attenuate rapidly downstream in the Rio Grande, depositing much of their sediment in downstream reaches. Long-duration floods on the mainstem are the only floods that have the capacity to enlarge the Rio Grande. These floods, released from upstream dams, can either erode or deposit sediment in the Rio Grande depending upon the antecedent in-channel sediment supply and the magnitude and duration of the flood. Geomorphic and sediment-transport analyses show that sand erosion and deposition during long-duration floods are most strongly controlled by the spatial distribution of flow strength as governed by channel slope. However, temporal changes in the grain size and amount of available sand within the channel, as inferred from comprehensive analyses of suspended-sediment concentration and grain size, control the degree of sediment evacuation or accumulation over large spatial scales.",

            "abstract": "The standard paradigm for seismic event monitoring is to scan waveforms from a network of stations and identify the arrival time of various seismic phases. A signal association algorithm then groups the picks to form events, which are subsequently located by minimizing residuals between measured travel times and travel times predicted by an Earth model. Many of these steps are prone to significant errors which can lead to erroneous arrival associations and event locations. Here, we revisit a concept for event detection that does not require phase picks or travel time curves and fuses detection, association and location into a single algorithm. Our pickless event detector exploits existing catalog and waveform data to build an empirical stack of the full regional seismic wavefield, which is subsequently used to detect and locate events at a network level using correlation techniques. Because the technique uses more of the information content of the original waveforms, the concept is particularly powerful for detecting weak events that would be missed by conventional methods. We apply our detector to seismic data from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations network and compare our results with the earthquake catalog published by the University of Utah. We demonstrate that the pickless detector can detect and locate significant numbers of events previously missed by standard data processing techniques.",

The system includes several Global Assimilative Ionospheric Models (GAIMs) developed by the investigators from Utah State University, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and University of Southern California. In this study, four GAIMs are applied to a study of ionospheric response to the 17 March 2015 St. Patrick’s Day storm. It is the most severe geomagnetic storm in the current solar cycle so far. The daily planetary magnetic Ap index and magnetic Kp, Dst, as well as AE indices reached their very high values, i.e., 108, 8, -202 nT, and 2269 nT, respectively. In the assimilative modeling, GPS data from hundreds of globally-distributed ground stations and a number of COSMIC satellites are assimilated into GAIMs to reproduce ionospheric 3-D volume densities and 2-D total electron content (TEC) during the severe storm. Evolution of strong, latitudinally-dependent, and hemispherically asymmetric ionospheric disturbances is revealed through the assimilative modeling. Using the same GPS data, Global Maps of Ionospheric Irregularities and Scintillation (GMIIS) have also been produced. Comparisons of the modeled large-scale ionospheric disturbances and measured small-scale ionospheric irregularities offer additional insight into the M-I-T coupling processes in different regions during varying storm phases. This presentation will provide a picture of distinguished multi-scale ionospheric response to the coronal mass ejection (CME) event during the major geomagnetic storm.",

            "abstract": "The Cascade arc spans ~1300 km from northern California into southern British Columbia, and basaltic magmas have erupted throughout the arc. The compositions of arc basalts are particularly useful in discerning mantle origins and inputs to the magmatic system, as basalts have undergone less differentiation en route to the surface. This presentation will draw on both existing datasets and new research to summarize our knowledge of Cascades arc basalt geochemistry and explore along-arc variability in mantle compositions and subduction recycling (oceanic crust and sediment). Cascades basalts are highly variable in composition; at least five types of primitive basalts erupt in the arc, with calc-alkaline basalts (CAB) and low-K tholeiites (LKT, also called high-alumina olivine tholeiites) being the most common. Such variability has been suggested to correlate with mantle heterogeneities and/or mantle melting processes, with CAB originating from fluid-fluxing of the mantle and LKT representing decompression melts (e.g., Leeman et al., 1990; Schmidt et al., 2008). However, recent work has suggested that, at least in some localities, CAB and LKT magmas could originate from a common mantle source (Mullen et al., 2014). A compilation of published primitive (>7 wt% MgO) basaltic magma compositions illustrates potential mantle heterogeneity along the arc, as well as variations in subduction recycling. Increases in melt H2O contents, radiogenic isotopes, oxygen isotopes, and LILE from north to south along the arc commonly suggest an increase in the amount of subduction component added to the mantle beneath the southern Cascades. The origin of the subduction component (crust vs. sediment) appears variable as well. With recent work on the seafloor sediments offshore of the north Cascades (Carpentier et al., 2010, 2013, 2014), researchers have been able to model the contributions of subducted sediment and crust to the north Cascades arc magmas and have suggested that sediment recycling is minimal (Mullen and Weis, 2013; Mullen and McCallum, 2014). New work on the geochemistry of seafloor sediments offshore of the southern Cascades will complement these existing datasets and provide better constraints on the origin of the increased subduction signature in the southern arc and variations in along-arc subduction recycling.",

The New York City Department of Environmental Protection has an ongoing series of studies to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the availability of high quality water in this water supply system. Recent studies identify increasing trends in total precipitation and in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in this region. The objectives of the present study are: to analyze the proba­bilistic structure of extreme precipitation based on historical observations: and to evaluate the abilities of stochastic weather generators (WG), statistical models that produce synthetic weather time series based on observed statistical properties at a particular location, to simulate the statistical properties of extreme precipitation events over this region. The generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) has been applied to the annual block maxima of precipitation for 60 years (1950 to 2009) observed data in order to estimate the events with return periods of 50, 75, and 100 years. These results were then used to evaluate a total of 13 WGs were : 12 parametric WGs including all combinations of three different orders of Markov chain (MC) models (1st , 2nd and 3rd) and four different probability distributions (exponential, gamma, skewed normal and mixed exponential); and one semi parametric WG based on k-nearest neighbor bootstrapping. Preliminary results suggest that three-parameter (skewed normal and mixed exponential distribution) and semi-parametric (k-nearest neighbor bootstrapping) WGs are more consistent with observations. It is also found that first order MC models perform as well as second or third order MC models.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea level influence the pressure of the solid Earth over entire ocean basins. While the absolute changes in sea level caused by glacial cycles are small relative to ocean depths, the temporal variations in sea level can lead to pressure changes of similar order to mantle upwelling rates, with the potential to significantly perturb short term rates of melt production at ocean ridges (Huybers and Langmuir, EPSL, 2009). Such changes could then lead to fluctuations in crustal thickness, magma composition and hydrothermal activity. To investigate possible relationships between glacial cycles and ocean ridge processes, we carried out an 18 day cruise of mapping and sediment coring to the Cleft Segment of the Juan de Fuca ridge. High resolution bathymetry was obtained on the west side of the ridge axis to beyond 1Ma to test whether abyssal hill fabric shows periodicities consistent with glacial cycles. Nine successful piston cores up to 7.6m in length provide a sedimentary record back to more than 600kyr to test for spatial and temporal variations in hydrothermal activity. Oxygen isotope stratigraphy on these cores is systematic and provides good age constraints. Short cores near the ridge axis provide a record of the current trace of hydrothermal activity in youngest sediments. Several of the cores impacted basement and recovered a basement sample. Above basement, basaltic glass shards were recovered in the bottom meter of sediment, raising the possibility of temporal records of basalt chemical compositions using the age constraints the sediments provide. The glass samples provide a unique and new perspective on ridge volcanism, since previous off-axis samples were restricted to dredging old fault scarps. Cores can be taken anywhere, raising the potential for global time series studies of ridge volcanism. The coupled bathymetry, sediment geochemistry and magmatic glass compositions hold the promise of a definitive advance in our understanding of the relationship between sea level change and ridge volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Despite a rich nearly-century-long history, Thomson scattering has not been fully exploited as a remote-sensing tool in the corona and nascent solar wind. In particular, stable deep-space coronagraphs such as SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/SECCHI enable time-dependent, photometric analyses that transcend basic feature tracking and brightness estimation. These techniques offer direct insight into the plasma conditions in the outer corona. In particular, fluctuations in the outer coronal brightness comprise both the familiar inhomogeneous \"blobs\" of material first tracked quantitatively with SOHO/LASCO, and also a recently-discovered compressive wave field that permits remote probing of the plasma even though individual wave fronts do not stand out visually. I will discuss recent and current measurements of this wave field in the outer corona as a means to probe outer coronal heating and wind acceleration near the transition from corona to heliosphere (known as the Alfvén surface); and present current results from a study of the transition from mostly smooth to mostly turbulent flow in the nascent solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Keywords: Landsat, long term data record, orbit drift\nThe Landsat satellite series provide the longest temporal record of space-based earth observations and, with their free data availability, the systematic generation of consistent Landsat time series products has been advocated. The Landsat 5 and 7 satellites were launched into nominally the same orbits but temporally sparse station keeping maneuvers meant that their orbits drifted over the satellite mission lives with local crossing times varying differently between sensors and by up to 0.92 hours (Landsat 5 1982 to 2012) and 0.21 hours (Landsat 7 1999 to 2012). Consequently, their images were acquired with temporally variable solar zenith angles. Long-term Landsat 5 and 7 reflectance inconsistencies may be introduced by orbit drift induced solar zenith variations combined with surface reflectance anisotropy. The majority of terrestrial surfaces reflect optical wavelength radiation anisotropically with a directional dependence that varies as a function of the sun–target–sensor geometry, commonly described by the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This study quantifies the overpass time and observed solar zenith angles for all the Landsat 5 and 7 images available in the Landsat archive along an approximately north-south Landsat path over the Conterminous United States. The impact of observed solar zenith angle variations on red and near-infrared nadir view reflectance and on the derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with respect to different Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF land cover types is modelled. Results show that the 31 year Landsat 5 solar zenith variations and the 14 year relative Landsat 5 and 7 solar zenith differences vary latitudinally (up to 10º and 4º respectively) and impose small but significant reflectance and NDVI variations that should be minimized before long-term time series application.",

            "abstract": "Human-induced land cover changes such as urbanization play an important role in regional-scale climate change, due to the altered land-atmosphere interactions in urban areas. We investigate the impacts of projected urbanization in China on future climate. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we downscale Community Earth System Model (CESM) projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5. We find decreased latent and increased sensible heat fluxes over the urban areas by 2050, leading to higher surface temperatures and lower humidity. The projections further reveal that urbanization produces strong warming, up to 1.9°C at regional and local/urban scales, which is of similar magnitude to the greenhouse gas forcing under the RCP 4.5 scenario. At night and during summer, greater urban warming effects are projected, which can be attributed to the high heat capacity of built-up areas. Precipitation responses are more complex, and the impacts of urbanization show varying consequences, primarily in summer. Both precipitation increases and decreases are projected depending on spatial scale, and related to both local moisture deficits and large-scale circulation changes. As this region is also greatly impacted by the monsoon, we find that urbanization will strengthen the East Asian summer monsoon in southern China, and slightly weaken the winter monsoon in eastern China. These results suggest that for the most realistic and complete depiction of future climate, urbanization should be included in model projections",

Combination of the fault attribute results with structural analysis provides 3D insight into the geometry and internal structure of restraining and releasing bends, step-over zones, fault convergence zones, and apparent paired fault bends. The 3D seismic volume covers a 13.7 km2 region along the HFZ offshore of Point Sal and was collected in 2012 as part of the PG&E Central California Seismic Imaging Project (PG&E, 2014). Application of the fault attribute workflow isolated and delineated fault strands within the 3D volume. These results revealed that the northern and southern edges of the survey region are characterized by single fault strands that exhibit an approximate 6° change in strike across the 3D volume. Between these single faults strands is a complex network of fault splays, bends, stepovers, and convergence zones. Structural analysis reveals that the southern portion of the HFZ in the region is characterized by transtensional deformation, whereas transpressional-related folding dominates the central and northern portions of the HFZ.  In the central region, convergence of the Lions Head Fault from the southeast results in an apparent impinging block, leading to development of a “paired fault bend” to the west. Combination of the fault and “chimney” attribute results indicates a strong connection between faults and fluid-migration pathways. Fluid-pathways are concentrated along discrete faults in the transtensional zones, but appear to be more broadly distributed amongst fault bounded anticlines and structurally controlled traps in the transpressional zones.",

Rock magnetic experiments were performed to quantify variability in magnetic properties and to infer sediment sourcing during the late Quaternary. U-channels were studied through AF demagnetization of the natural remanent magnetization, and laboratory-induced magnetizations including anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) acquisition, ARM demagnetization, and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). Maximum angular deviation values average <2°, indicating a strong, well-defined characteristic remanent magnetization dominated by a low-coercivity component that increases up core. Average inclinations are within 4° of the expected geocentric axial dipole, and major inclination features can be correlated across the two cores. Correlation of inclination changes with the Burial Lake record, 200 km to the west (Dorfman, 2013, unpub. thesis), indicates that the Cascade Lake sedimentary sequence overlying the basal diamicton likely spans at least 16 ka. Cascade Lake sediments may be suitable for RPI estimation using the ARM or IRM as a normalizer, following a more detailed examination of magnetic properties. A systematic offset between the Cascade Lake 14C chronology and PSV and RPI chronologies wiggle-matched to field models suggests a hard-water effect of ~1000 yr, although we cannot rule out the possibility that at least some of the age offset represents a post-depositional remanent magnetization lock-in effect at Cascade Lake. S-ratios (IRM0.3T/SIRM) and ARM-ratios (ARM/SIRM) show a sharp decrease in low-coercivity material across the transition from clastic sediments to organic-rich sediments, followed by an increase in the concentration of fine-grained magnetic material and fining of the magnetic grain size up core, along with an increase in organic matter after ~10 ka. Cascade Lake has no significant inflow, therefore this trend in magnetic mineralogy may represent decreasing input of local material from hillslope processes superposed on a persistent eolian input through the Holocene.",

An accurate assessment of N2O emissions from agriculture is vital not only for understanding the global N2O balance and its impact on climate and also for designing crop systems with lower GHG emissions. This work focuses on the early development of an open path N2O instrument for field deployment, based on quantum cascade laser absorption. With a targeted precision of 0.1 ppb at 10 Hz, this instrument will enable eddy covariance measurements to determine vertical fluxes of N2O. Details of the instrument design, which emphasizes ruggedness and high thermal stability, will be presented along with initial results from outdoor testing of the instrument.",

Mars has the potential to have its own native life, and it has environments that appear quite capable of supporting Earth life. As such, Mars is subject to policies intended to keep Earth organisms from growing on Mars, and missions to Mars are controlled to ensure that we know that no Mars life gets to Earth onboard a returning spacecraft. It seems odd, then, that Mars is also the planet on which we have crashed the most (the Moon still owns the overall title), and is still the only body that has had positive results from a life-detection experiment soft-landed on its surface. Mars has very little water, yet it snows on Mars and we have seen regular night-time frosts and near-surface ice on more than half of the planet. Despite strong UV insolation, Mars also has regular dust storms and winds that can cover spacecraft surfaces with dust that itself may be poisonous, but also can protect microbial life from death by UV light. In spite of surface features and minerals that provide ample evidence of surface water in the past, on today's Mars only relatively short, thin lines that lengthen and retract with the seasons provide a hint that there may be water near the surface of Mars today, but the subsurface is almost totally unexplored by instruments needed to detect water, itself.\nIn the face of these contradictions, the implementation of planetary protection requirements to prevent cross contamination has to proceed with the best available knowledge, and in spite of sometimes substantial costs to spacecraft development and operations. In this paper we will review the status of Mars as a potential (hopefully not inadvertent) abode for life, and describe the measures taken in the past and the present to safeguard the astrobiological study of Mars, and project the requirements for Mars planetary protection in a possible future that involves both sample return and human exploration. Such measures are needed to comply with what is a scientific, legal, and even moral requirement as we move forward to understand the place of Mars in our solar system, and our relationship to both.",

The northern half of the segment comprises predominantly glaciovolcanic deposits including pillow lava units, with lesser subaqueous tuff-breccia, lapilli tuff, and hyaloclastite (sensu stricto). High-resolution measurements of individual pillow lavas, intrusions, and lateral stratigraphic variations provide new insight into the emplacement and eruptive processes for glaciovolcanic, pillow-dominated ridges. Field analysis included >50 pillow width/height field measurements, and DGPS tracks from traverses along outcrops, and laser-DGPS points on quarry walls. Our 3-D reconstructions are made using the detailed measurements tied to Gigapan© images, and photo reconstructions using Photoscan© software. The high-resolution Gigapan images facilitate detailed tracings of individual pillows, which are then used for en masse measurements of >500 individual pillow dimensions. The Pillow Size Distributions for individual stratigraphic units are then calculated using ImageJ. Previous work at Undirhliður quarry immediately to the north (Was et al., 2014, EOS, V41D-2839) showed that, using >5000 measurements, different stratigraphic units had distinct characteristic pillow sizes indicating either changes in lava fluxes or in spatial positions with respect to lava supply system. The opportunity to map changes in pillow sizes as well as the spatial relationship between intrusions related to the within-ridge magma supply and pillows provides detailed constraints on the physical mechanisms by which pillow ridges grow exogenously and endogenously.",

            "abstract": "Common Land Model(CoLM), combined the best features of LSM, BATS, and IAP94, has been widely applied and shown its good quality. However, land surface processes are crucial for weather and climate model initialization, hence it’s necessary to constrain land surface model performances using observational data. In our preliminary work, eddy covariance measurements from 20 FLUXNET sites with over 100 site-years were used to evaluate CoLM while simulating energy balance fluxes in different climate conditions and vegetation categories. And the results show CoLM simulates well for all four energy fluxes, with sensible heat flux(H) better than latent heat flux(LE), net radiation (Rnet) the best. In terms of different vegetation categories, CoLM performs the best on evergreen needle-leaf forest among the 8 selected land cover types, and shows significant priority at evergreen broadleaf forest. Although a good agreement of simulation and observation is found on seasonal cycles at the 20 sample sites, it produces extreme bias mostly at summer noon, but not shows consistent bias among different seasons. This underestimate was associated with the weakness in simulating of soil water in dry seasons and incomplete description of photosynthesis as well, that’s why we will first focus on implementing mesophyll diffusion in CoLM to improve the physical process of photosynthesis.",

Cumulus and convection parameterizations are natural culprits but the effect of bypassing them with explicitly resolved convection on global land-atmosphere coupling dynamics has not been explored systematically. We apply a suite of modern land-atmosphere coupling diagnostics to isolate the effect of cloud superparameterization (SP) in the Community Atmosphere Model v3.5, focusing on both the land segment (i.e., soil moisture and evapotranspiration relationship) and atmospheric segment (i.e., evapotranspiration and precipitation relationship) in the water pathway of the land-atmosphere feedback loop. Comparing SPCAM3.5 and conventional CAM3.5 in daily timescale, our results show that the Super-Parameterized model reduces the coupling strength in the Central Great Plain in American, and reverses the terrestrial segment coupling sign (from negative to positive) over India. Which are consistent with previous studies and are favorable improvements on the known issues reported in literatures. Analysis of the triggering feedback strength (TFS) and amount feedback strength (AFS) shows that SPCAM3.5 favorably reproduces the patterns of these indices over North America, with probability of afternoon precipitation enhanced by high evaporative fraction along the eastern United States and Mexico, while conventional CAM3.5 does not capture this signal. The links in the soil moisture-precipitation feedback loop are further explored through applying the mixing diagram approach to the diurnal cycles of the land surface and planetary boundary layer variables.",

            "abstract": "Suspended sediment particle size in rivers is of great interest due to its influence on riverine and coastal morphology, socio-economic viability, and ecological health and restoration. Prediction of suspended sediment transport from hydraulics remains a stubbornly difficult problem, particularly for the washload component, which is controlled by sediment supply from the drainage basin. This has led to a number of methods for continuously monitoring suspended sediment concentration and mean particle size, the most popular currently being hydroacoustic methods. Here, we explore the possibility of using theoretical inversion of the sonar equation to derive an estimate of mean particle size and standard deviation of the grain size distribution (GSD) using three ‘off-the-shelf’ acoustic Doppler current profiles (ADCP) with frequencies of 300, 600 and 1200 kHz. The instruments were deployed in the sand-bedded reach of the Fraser River, British Columbia. We use bottle samples collected in the acoustic beams to test acoustics signal inversion methods. Concentrations range from 15-300 mg/L and the suspended load at the site is ~25% sand, ~75 % silt/clay. Measured mean particle radius from samples ranged from 10-40 microns with relative standard deviations ranging from 0.75 to 2.5. Initial results indicate the acoustically derived mean particle radius compares well with measured particle radius, using a theoretical inversion method adapted to the Fraser River sediment.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive understanding of the river flow dynamics with varying topography in a real field is very intricate and difficult. Conventional experimental methods based on manual data collection are time consuming and prone to many errors. Recently, remotely sensed satellite imageries are at the best to provide necessary information for large area provided the high resolution but which are very expensive and untimely, consequently, attaining accurate river bathymetry from relatively course resolution and untimely imageries are inaccurate and impractical. Despite of that, these data are often being used to calibrate the river flow models, though these models require highly accurate morpho-dynamic data in order to predict the flow field precisely. Under this circumstance, these data could be supplemented through experimental observations in a physical model with modern techniques. This paper proposes a methodology to generate highly accurate river bathymetry and water surface (WS) profile for a physical model of river network system using CRP technique. For the task accomplishment, a number of DSLR Nikon D5300 cameras (mounted at 3.5 m above the river bed) were used to capture the images of the physical model and the flooding scenarios during the experiments. During experiment, non-specular materials were introduced at the inlet and images were taken simultaneously from different orientations and altitudes with significant overlap of 80%. Ground control points were surveyed using two ultrasonic sensors with ±0.5 mm vertical accuracy. The captured images are, then processed in PhotoScan software to generate the DEM and WS profile. The generated data were then passed through statistical analysis to identify errors. Accuracy of WS profile was limited by extent and density of non-specular powder and stereo-matching discrepancies. Furthermore, several factors of camera including orientation, illumination and altitude of camera. The CRP technique for a large scale physical model can significantly reduce the time and manual labour and avoids human errors in taking data using point gauge. Obtained highly accurate DEM and WS profile can be used in mathematical models for accurate prediction of river dynamics. This study would be very helpful for sediment transport study and can also be extended for real case studies.",

            "abstract": "Commonly assumed to have low preservation potential, barrier islands are rarely interpreted in the rock record, and there is little consensus on the terminology and depositional models related to their interpretation. Prevalent on transgressive coastlines, the dimensions of modern barriers are used as analogs for the ancient; however, ancient examples are complicated by post-depositional processes, including thickening through amalgamation and removal by ravinement. Contrasting the dimensions of modern and ancient examples lends insight into the development and preservation of transgressive deposits, improving the ability to predict the size and distribution of barrier island sand bodies in the rock record as well as understanding the variables that control their architecture.\nInterpretation of barrier island deposits from the John Henry Member (Cretaceous Straight Cliffs Fm., Kaiparowits Plateau, southern Utah) motivated an investigation into both ancient and modern barrier islands. Traditional sequence stratigraphic models predict thin condensed deposition during transgression, not accounting for possible thick and laterally extensive accumulations of barrier island deposits. More recent models recognize the possible complexity and heterogeneity of transgressive deposits and the potential for barrier island accumulation. To better understand the relationship between modern and ancient barrier islands, the length (along strike), width (dip direction) and thickness (vertical) of >20 modern and >30 ancient barrier islands were compared. Ancient dimensions were gathered from the literature, while modern dimensions were aggregated from literature and a database of modern barrier islands currently being developed. Initial results suggest that ancient barrier island deposits record the motion of the shoreline during transgression. Ancient barriers are ~2-8 times wider and ~2-3 times thicker than modern islands. The dynamics of barrier island migration and sediment supply control resulting deposits when accommodation is sufficient for preservation. Future consideration of other parameters, including tectonic setting, latitude, and climate may reveal paleomorphodynamic relationships between modern and ancient barriers and improve predictions for ancient barrier dimensions.",

Under the tremendous pressure, the vent fluid from Piccard can be as hot as 398°C. Here, the concentration of ammonium (35 μmol/kg) is much higher than that of the bottom water nitrate (22 μmol/kg). The undetectable nitrate in the vent fluid suggests that nitrate is completely reduced to ammonium in the reaction zone and there has to be an additional source for ammonium production. Because Piccard is unsedimented (i.e., lacking significant sedimentary organic matter), the other possible source of ammonium is the reduction of nitrogen gas (N2). We demonstrated that the isotopic composition of ammonium (δ15N-NH4+) for the Piccard vent fluid end-member (3.4 ± 0.1 ‰) supports the mixing between two ammonium sources: the reduction of nitrate and the reduction of N2. However, at Von Damm, shallower depth (up to 2,300 meters) causes the vent fluid to be relatively cooler (138°C) compared to Piccard and it is very likely that the reduction of nitrate is the only source of ammonium in the vent fluid. Studying the vent fluids from these sites where the temperatures are well above the upper limit for life can be useful in assessing the conditions and abiotic processes that might have given rise to the ammonium production in the early prebiotic ocean.",

And, even though evidence of increased melt rates had been captured by remote sensing observations throughout the last decade, this particular event took the community by surprise. How Greenland ice flow will respond to such an event or to increased frequencies of extreme melt events in the future is unclear, as it requires detailed comprehension of Greenland surface climate and the ice sheet's sensitivity to associated uncertainties. With established uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools embedded within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), we conduct decadal-scale forward modeling experiments to 1) quantify the spatial resolution needed to effectively force surface mass balance (SMB) in various regions of the ice sheet and 2) determine the dynamic response of Greenland outlet glaciers to variations in SMB. First, we perform sensitivity analyses to determine how perturbations in SMB affect model output; results allow us to investigate the locations where variations most significantly affect ice flow, and on what spatial scales. Next, we apply Monte-Carlo style sampling analyses to determine how errors in SMB propagate through the model as uncertainties in estimates of Greenland ice discharge and regional mass balance.\nThis work is performed at the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cryosphere Program.",

            "abstract": "Slow-moving landslides, or earthflows, are characterized by persistent, flow-like motion that is commonly modeled using various viscous and viscoplastic rheologies. One of the manifestations of viscoplastic flow down a slope is the emergence of stationary bodies of fluid at the margins of the flow (i.e. lateral levees). These levees are common signatures of earthflow morphology and, while they are frequently used to outline boundaries for mapping purposes, they have received little attention for what they may indicate about the history and properties of the flow itself. In contrast, lateral levees along lava flows have long been used by physical volcanologists as tools to learn about their non-Newtonian rheologies and chemical compositions. Hulme (1974) was the first to note that, for a given slope, levee width may be characteristic of a fluids’s yield strength and his methodology has been subsequently used to infer properties of lavas on the Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Using these lavas as analogies, we apply Hulme’s approach to earthflows in a variety of settings globally. We find that calculated yield strengths for individual earthflows fall within a relatively narrow range between 101-102 kPa. In addition, individual earthflow complexes often preserve multiple generations of levees, which in some cases may record apparent reductions in yield strength over time for a given flow, possibly from weakening of previously failed material. Knowledge of earthflow yield strength permits the calculation of a critical earthflow thickness below which there will be no downslope motion for a given slope angle. Thicknesses calculated in this manner could thus be used to estimate the flux of landslide material for earthflows without direct depth constraints, provided that surface velocity measurements are obtained by other methods (e.g. InSAR, GPS, manual feature tracking).",

HFOs are not ODSs and the presence of the highly reactive unsaturated bond toward the common atmospheric oxidants (OH, Cl, NO3 and O3) is expected to lead to shorter tropospheric lifetimes relative to those of saturated hydrofluorocarbons. The shorter lifetime reduces their direct contribution to Climate Change. In this study, rate coefficients for the gas-phase reaction of the OH radical with (CF3)2CFCH=CHF (HFO-1438ezy), between 214 and 380 K and 50–450 Torr (He, N2), were measured using pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence (PLP/LIF) and relative rate methods. No pressure dependence was observed within this measurement range. The reaction displays a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence over this temperature range with a slightly positive temperature dependence above 280 K and near temperature independence at lower temperatures. The infrared spectrum of HFO-1438ezy was measured as part of this work. On the basis of the present measurements, the atmospheric lifetime of HFO-1438ezy as well as its radiative efficiency, global warming potential and photochemical ozone creation potential were estimated.",

We have found that a plot of the noise power in a selected quiet bandwidth between 0.01-0.03 Hz as a function of the overall seismic power provides a key Power Assessment Tool (PAT) for visualization of instrument noise. Changing levels of background seismic noise ordinarily make estimations of the noise level of the instrument itself difficult. The PAT plot can be used to detect non-linearity in a gravity sensor by displaying a correlation between noise in the quiet band and the overall level of seismic noise. In the absence of a non-linearity the PAT plot provides a reliable upper estimate of instrument noise level with a single instrument in a noisy location. Collocated superconducting gravity meter and gPhone gravity meter data records collected at Table Mountain Gravity Observatory exhibit very similar behavior using the PAT plot and indicate an upper bound on the instrument noise of both instruments of between 0.2-0.3 μGal/√(Hz) in a quiet noise band between 0.01-0.03 Hz. These noise levels are consistent with the stated instrument noise of the superconducting gravity meters and also agree with noise levels obtained from differenced spectra between the collocated gPhone gravity meters. This confirms the utility of the PAT plot in estimating the noise level of a gravity sensor.",

            "abstract": "The Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) is a major geologic boundary intersecting the Japanese mainland into the northeastern and the southwestern parts. It is also an active fault system that is supposed to have a high seismic potential. We have conducted dense GPS observation and identified a highly localized E-W contraction around the Kamishiro fault at the northern ISTL. Kinematic modeling of this deformation pattern suggests that the fault is shallowly dipping to the east and accommodating the E-W contraction by aseismic faulting below the depth of 2-4 km. This aseismic fault is consistent with the base of the Neogene basin fill, which has accommodated E-W shortening over 10km. On November 22, 2014, a Mw 6.3 earthquake occurred at the Kamishiro fault. The hypocenter is located at the 5km depth and a 9km long surface rupture appeared along the fault trace. GPS observation and InSAR analysis with ALOS-2 data revealed northwestward displacement and uplift (max. 90cm) on the east, and southeastward displacement with subsidence (max. 30cm) on the west, indicating a rupture of the Kamishiro fault. The coseismic crustal deformation pattern is modeled by a faulting on a high-angle reverse fault from the surface to 7km depth, extending ~20km along the fault trace. A large fault slip is estimated at the shallowest (depth<2km) part corresponding to the surface rupture. The geodetic fault model is also consistent with the aftershock distribution. On the other hand, the source fault implies a rupture of the pre-Neogene basement below the basin fill, not the shallow-dipping fault estimated from interseismic deformation. Thus the relationship between the interseismic aseismic faulting and the coseismic fault is not totally clear. The large interseismic contraction mainly reflects inelastic process and only a small portion, if any, contributes to the stress accumulation of the main shock fault. This example demonstrates complexity of the earthquake cycle at a thrust fault system.",

Even with the abundance of data online, relevant data discovery and successful integration is still highly dependent upon the data being published with well-formed and understandable metadata. Tagging a dataset with well-known or controlled community terms is a common mechanism to indicate the intended purpose, subject matter, or other relevant facts of a dataset, however controlled domain terminology can be difficult for cross-domain researchers to interpret and leverage. It is also a challenge for integration portals to successfully provide cross-domain search capabilities over data holdings described using many different controlled vocabularies.\nMappings between controlled vocabularies can be challenging because communities frequently develop specialized terminologies and have highly specific and contextual usages of common words. Despite this specificity it is highly desirable to produce cross-domain mappings to support data integration.\nIn this contribution we evaluate the applicability of several data analytic techniques for the purpose of generating mappings between hierarchies of controlled science terms. We hope our efforts initiate more discussion on the topic and encourage future mapping efforts.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are highly valued for their numerous ecological services including water quality improvement and land-atmosphere interactions. The effectiveness of wetlands in delivering these services is strongly influenced by the shallow groundwater dynamics. As such, in order to understand the variation of ecological processes in wetlands, it is crucial to first quantify the controls on the temporal variations in the groundwater table. In this paper, a physically based and fully distributed hydrologic model was applied to simulate the long term variation of groundwater and the distribution of wetlands in the Second Creek watershed. Covariation in simulated groundwater table and meteorological variables were analyzed using Bayesian regression to evaluate the integrated role of seasonal meteorological controls on interannual variations in maximum groundwater height and the start date and length of the wet period (defined as the period when the groundwater depth is shallower than 30cm). The meteorological controls were quantified based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is an indicator of net wet or dry recharge period. Results indicate that the PDSI in autumn and spring is the dominant control on the length of wet time. The start date of wet time in downstream wetlands is controlled by the autumn PDSI while that in headwater wetlands is controlled by the PDSI in both autumn and the previous summer. The maximum groundwater table height inundation depth of wetlands is controlled by the winter PDSI. These results highlight that to understand that susceptibility of a given groundwater dynamics characteristic, one needs to track the corresponding changes in meteorological forcings within particular seasons. Results will help understand and predict anticipated changes in groundwater dynamics and ecological processes of wetlands in response to changes in meteorological forcings due to climate change in the southeastern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Mid-Ocean basalts (MORB) typically erupt supersaturated with CO2. Along the 2005-06 East Pacific Rise (EPR) lava flow, the concentration of CO2 dissolved in MORB glasses decreases with distance from the vent, and is thought to represent degassing of the lava as it flowed across the ocean floor. An increase in maximum bubble radius and porosity with distance from the vent has also been observed in EPR MORB glasses, suggesting that CO2 degassing occurs through diffusive growth of bubbles present within the melt upon eruption. Additionally, bubble number density increases from vent (1.8x105 bubbles/cm3) to flow front (3.0x106 bubbles/cm3), indicating that bubble nucleation may also play an important role in degassing of the EPR lavas. This study combines CT and optical analyses of a subset of MORB glasses from along the 2005-06 EPR eruption to examine how MORB lava flows degas. Crystallinity of these glasses increases from vent to flow front, and is composed of spherulites, lath-like plagioclase microlites, and blocky to lath-like olivine microlites. Bubbles within these glasses have diameters ranging from 2-446 µm, and are sometimes found attached to the surface of olivine crystals in all examined samples, but not to plagioclase crystals. Porosity increases from 0.01 % to 0.39 % from vent to flow front, in which 72-94 % of this porosity increase results from the growth of pre-existing bubbles, and the remaining 6-28 % is attributed to the nucleation of new bubbles. These results indicate the olivine is an efficient bubble nucleation site in CO2 supersaturated MORB lavas, and that plagioclase is an inefficient nucleation site, just like it is not in rhyolite. Based upon the supersaturation of CO2 in vent samples, a ∆P of ~40 MPa is sufficient to initiate heterogeneous bubble nucleation on olivine. Although degassing of these EPR samples is dominated by the diffusive growth of pre-existing bubbles, the role of bubble nucleation is not entirely trivial, and may be limited by the availability of efficient nucleation sites. Bubble nucleation may therefore play a significant role in the degassing of more crystalline MORB lava flows.",

Besides its volcanic geology, its steep topography contributes to the flashiness of stream flow. The prevalent trade wind results in wet (windward) and dry (leeward) sides of island, which receive unequal amount of moisture for cloud formation. To better understand and describe the mechanism of forming stream flow in Hawaii, a series of hydrologic model, from simple to complex, were used to simulate stream flow on two pilot watershed. We first used a lumped-model, Thornthwaite Monthly Water Balance Model, to describe water budget of each watershed. Second, we used a non-spatial explicit model, topographic index model (TOPMODEL), to describe the surface and subsurface components that contribute to stream flow. Finally, we used a semi-distributed model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to understand the different land use effect on stream flow. In particular, rainfall coverage was obtained from dynamic downscaling model and validated with observation. The spatial distribution of rainfall data were served as input for all models. Through these processes, we strategically dissected the components in contributing to stream flow within a watershed, and revealed the dominate mechanism and drivers of stream flow in the watersheds. We then compared the processes in forming stream flow in watersheds of windward and leeward side. The difference in the two watershed were presented and described. Ultimately, the successful building of flow models allows us to further describe the nutrient and sediment transport that affects both instream habitats and downstream estuarine and coastal system.",

            "abstract": "Euendolithic Cyanobacteria are able to actively bore into mineral carbonates. They are of global significance because they colonize any exposed marine, freshwater or terrestrial carbonate surface. They are responsible of shaping coastal limestomes, damaging mollusk shells, coral skeletons and historical landmarks. Despite their global importance, little is known about the boring mechanism, more specifically how Cyanobacteria realize the tour de force of combining oxygenic photosynthesis to carbonate dissolution. In fact there is only one cultured boring strain, which only bores into calcium carbonate while microborers are found on various types of substrates including magnesium carbonates. The boring mechanism proposed for the model strain may not be general highlighting the need of going back to the field to interrogate eudolithic Cyanobacterial communities boring on other substrates. We collected samples from marine intertidal limestones (mostly calcite CaCO3) and dolostones (mostly dolomite CaMg(CO3)2) from the Mona Island, Puerto Rico that were all infested by endolithic microbial communities. After determination of the samples mineralogy using powder X-ray diffraction, we analyzed the endolithic microbial communities using 16S rDNA library next generation sequencing. Our results indicate that the substrate type does not drive any significant difference in community composition at the phylum level but affects the distribution of Cyanobacteria. We found that while close relatives to the model strain Mastigocoleus testarum BC008 are prominent in limestones, 2 OTUs accounting for up to 26% of the Cyanobacteria, they are in low abundance in dolostones.

The presented modeling approach simulated future flows in the Cache Creek watershed in California, over the 21st century using a hydro-climate model (WEHY-HCM) forced by future climate projections. The future climate projections, based on four emission scenarios, simulated by two GCMs (ECHAM5 and CCSM3) under several initial conditions, were dynamically downscaled using MM5, a regional climate model. The downscaled future precipitation data were bias-corrected before being input into the fully physically-based WEHY watershed hydrology model to simulate the flows at hourly intervals along the main Cache Creek branch and its tributaries during 2010-2099. The results suggest an increasing trend in flood peak discharge magnitudes at the outlet of the studied watershed throughout the 21st century. Similarly, estimates of the 100 and 200-year flood discharge magnitudes increase throughout the study period toward future in the 21st century. The differences among the historical flood frequency, and the flood frequencies during the first half and second half of the 21st century are indicative of the ongoing non-stationarity in the 21st century hydro-climate regime of the study region.",

Climate, topography, vegetation, and edaphic factors determine the runoff generation processes for a given location and a substantial change in any of these factors, either alone or combined, could result in a change in soil water storage dynamics and cause a shift in the runoff generation mechanisms.\nThree paired experimental watersheds were established in 2010 to quantify the streamflow responses to woody plant invasion into grassland in the South-central Great Plains. Here, we compare the runoff generation mechanisms under both vegetation types using soil water content and surface runoff data from 2011 to 2014. These data were collected every 5-15 minutes during the period experiencing both extremely high and low precipitation events. The objectives of this study include: 1). Understand change in soil moisture content and storage dynamic across the entire soil profile under grassland and woody plant invaded grassland watersheds; 2). Determine the dominant runoff mechanism for each vegetation type; and 3). Illustrate the process which shifts the runoff generation mechanisms. These results are important in understanding the impact of woody plant expansions on altering surface water and groundwater availability and therefore affect water resources sustainability management in the South-central Great Plains.",

A lipid biomarker study was undertaken in Mid-Atlantic submarine canyons, focusing specifically on Baltimore and Norfolk canyons, to determine biomarker variability of carbonate rock and the associated sediment in cold seep communities dominated by chemosynthetic mussels, Bathymodiolus childressi. Preliminary 16S metagenomic results confirm the presence of free-living sulfur-reducing bacteria and methantrophic endosymbiotic bacteria in the mussels. Depleted d13C values in both the mussel tissue (-63 ‰) and authigenic carbonates (-48 ‰) support methanotrophy as the dominant nutritional pathway and AOM as the main driver of carbonate precipitation. In addition, paired 14C and 230Th dates are highly discordant, reflecting dilution of the 14C pool with fossil hydrocarbon derived carbon. Seep and canyon sediment, as well as authigenic carbonates, were collected and analyzed for a suite of biomarkers, including sterols, alcohols, alkanes and fatty acids, as well as δ13C values of select biomarkers, to elucidate pathways of organic matter cycling. A comparison of terrestrial biomarker signatures (e.g., n-alkane carbon preference index and C23 / (C23 + C29) values, HMW n-alkanes and C29 sterols) suggests that terrestrial inputs dominate the submarine canyon surface sediment, whereas seep sediment is predominantly marine autochthonous (i.e., cholesterol and 5α-cholestanol). Lipid biomarker profiles (e.g., n-alkanes in the C15 to C33 range) from authigenic carbonates mirror those found in the seep sediment, suggesting that the organisms mediating carbonate precipitation on the seafloor are characteristic of the assemblages present in the sediment at these sites. With widespread methane leakage recently discovered along the Atlantic Margin, the presence of AOM-mediated carbonate precipitation documented in Baltimore and Norfolk canyons suggests that AOM may play a key role in long-term storage of methane and the carbon cycle along the Atlantic Margin.",

            "abstract": "When accessing the impacts of climate change on water resources, it is important to estimate changes in the frequencies and magnitudes of projected floods and droughts in response to climate change, considering that most disasters result from these hydrological extremes. The objective of this study is to estimate the changes of return periods of floods and droughts based on projected future streamflows in the Illinois River Watershed according to various climate change models. Future streamflows are simulated by combining data from 59 climate model scenarios with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. Subsequently, a Gumbel distribution (Extreme Value Type І) is fitted to the annual maximum simulated streamflow to derive the number of return periods of future hydrological extremes. The annual minimum 7-day average streamflow has been adopted for drought analysis. A Weibull distribution (Extreme Value Type Ш) is used to analyze the return periods of low flows. The 10-year and 100-year return periods of floods and droughts from 2020 to 2049 and from 2070 to 2099 are analyzed in comparison to streamflows from 1975 to 2004. Results indicate that average streamflow predicted from 33 (2020-2049) and 29 (2070-2099) climate scenarios are expected to decrease. The majority of the 10-year and 100-year return periods of floods in 2020-2049 and 2070-2099 increase; however 10-year and 100-year return periods for droughts tend to decrease.",

            "abstract": "During a hydraulic fracture, water is pumped at high pressure into a formation. A proppant, typically sand is later injected in the hope that it will make its way into a fracture, keep it open and provide a path for the hydrocarbon to enter the well. This injection can create micro-earthquakes, generated by deformation within the reservoir during treatment. When these injections are monitored, thousands of microseismic events are recorded within several hundred cubic meters.\nFor each well-located event, many source parameters are estimated e.g. stress drop, Savage-Wood efficiency and apparent stress. However, because we are evaluating outputs from a power-law process, the extent to which the failure is impacted by fluid injection or stress triggering is not immediately clear.\nTo better detect differences in source processes, we use a set of dynamic statistical parameters which characterize various force balance assumptions using the average distance to the nearest event, event rate, volume enclosed by the events, cumulative moment and energy from a group of events. One parameter, the Fracability index, approximates the ratio of viscous to elastic forcing and highlights differences in the response time of a rock to changes in stress.\nThese dynamic parameters are applied to a database of more than 90 000 events in a shale-gas play in the Horn River Basin to characterize spatial-temporal variations in the source processes.\nIn order to resolve these differences, a moving window, nearest neighbour approach was used. First, the center of mass of the local distribution was estimated for several source parameters. Then, a set of dynamic parameters, which characterize the response of the rock were estimated. These techniques reveal changes in seismic efficiency and apparent stress and often coincide with marked changes in the Fracability index and other dynamic statistical parameters. Utilizing these approaches allowed for the characterization of fluid injection related processes.",

Unintended side-reactions occurring on the surface of three-way catalysts may lead to emission of a number of non-criteria pollutants whose identity and emission rates are poorly understood. A series of near-roadway field studies conducted between 2009-2015 has investigated LDMV emissions of these pollutants with unprecedented depth of coverage, including reactive nitrogen compounds (NH3, amines, HCN, HONO, and HNO3), organic peroxides, and carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids). Methods to collect these pollutants using mist chambers, annular denuders, impingers, and solid-phase cartridges and quantify their concentration using GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, IC, and colorimetry were developed and validated in the laboratory and field. These methods were subsequently used in near-roadway field studies where the concentrations of the target compounds integrated over 1-4 hour blocks were measured at the edge of a freeway and at a background site 140 m from the roadway. Concentrations followed a steep decreasing gradient from the freeway to the background site. Emission factors (pollutant mass emitted per mass fuel consumed) were calculated by carbon mass balance using the difference in concentration measured between the freeway and background sites for the emitted pollutant and CO2 as a measure of carbon mass in the vehicle exhaust. The significance of these results will be discussed in terms of emissions inventories in the South Coast Air Basin of California, emission trends at this site over the period of 2009-2015, and for NH3, emission measurements conducted by our group and others over the period 2000-2015.",

            "abstract": "In order to investigate subduction dynamics between the South America continent and the oceanic Nazca and Caribbean plates, we have obtained 257 high-quality splitting measurements from teleseismic SKS phases and 85 splitting results from slab-related local Sphases arriving at 38 seismic stations in northwestern South America. We used data primarily from the Colombia National Seismological Network. Our first observation is that delay times obtained from SKS splitting (mean value of 1.15 s) are consistently greater than those from the local S splitting (mean value of 0.31 s). This implies that most of the SKSsplitting is due to upper mantle anisotropy beneath or within the subducting slabs. In contrast, the polarizations of local S-waves are consistently aligned with crustal-scale fault systems, which implies that the anisotropy above the slabs is dominated by tectonic features in the overriding crust or lithosphere, and that the mantle wedge is not contributing significantly to the measured splitting. We identify a clear change in SKS fast directions at the trace of the so-called Caldas Tear (~5°N), which represents a boundary in the style of subduction. To the north of Caldas Tear fast directions are consistently parallel to the direction of convergence of the Caribbean plate and Panama arc with South America. Our results support the idea of Caribbean subduction beneath northwestern Colombia, a hotly debated topic in recent years. Fast directions south of the Caldas tear are subparallel to the direction of Nazca-South America convergence. Entrained mantle flow and deformation beneath the subducting Nazca and Caribbean plates are the main cause of the measured SKS splitting. Further inland, the SKS splitting is consistent with mantle flow parallel to the trend of the Eastern Cordillera. We speculate that a change in slab dip may lead to a change in mantle flow and may be responsible for the intermediate-depth nests of seismicity observed beneath Eastern Cordillera.",

This loss continues today via thermal Jeans escape of neutral hydrogen from the extended H corona. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrometer IUVS constrains this escape with high cadence, spatially resolved measurements of the corona in scattered sunlight in the Lyman alpha line of neutral H at 121.6 nm. These measurements indicate spatial variability in the corona never before recognized, with potential effects on reconstructing the escape history of water and on retrieved escape rates from previous spatially unresolved observations. I will present our current progress in retrieving escape rates and density distributions from the IUVS observations, including the degree to which observations of the H corona can constrain the thermospheric general circulation at Mars.",

            "abstract": "Forest carbon processes are affected by soil moisture, soil temperature and solar radiation. Most of the current biogeochemical models are 1-D and represent one point in space. Therefore they can neither resolve topographically driven hill-slope soil moisture patterns, nor simulate the nonlinear effects of soil moisture on carbon processes. A spatially-distributed biogeochemistry model, Flux-PIHM-BGC, has been developed by coupling the Biome-BGC (BBGC) model with a coupled physically-based land surface hydrologic model, Flux-PIHM. Flux-PIHM incorporates a land-surface scheme (adapted from the Noah land surface model) into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). Because PIHM is capable of simulating lateral water flow and deep groundwater, Flux-PIHM is able to represent the link between groundwater and the surface energy balance, as well as the land surface heterogeneities caused by topography.\nFlux-PIHM-BGC model was tested at the Susquehanna/Shale Hills critical zone observatory (SSHCZO). The abundant observations at the SSHCZO, including eddy covariance fluxes, soil moisture, groundwater level, sap flux, stream discharge, litterfall, leaf area index, aboveground carbon stock, and soil carbon efflux, provided an ideal test bed for the coupled model. Model results show that when uniform solar radiation is used, vegetation carbon and soil carbon are positively correlated with soil moisture in space, which agrees with the observations within the watershed. When topographically-driven solar radiation is used, however, the wetter valley floor becomes radiation limited, and produces less vegetation and soil carbon than the drier hillslope due to the assumption that canopy height is uniform in the watershed. This contradicts with the observations, and suggests that a tree height model with dynamic allocation model are needed to reproduce the spatial variation of carbon processes within a watershed.",

The 206Pb/207Pb composition of Singaporean marine Pb is 1.18-1.20 whereas the local aerosols are 1.14-1.16. In order to explore this discrepancy further, we collected a large volume water from the Johor River estuary (flowing from Malaysia to the northern border of Singapore), added a distinct isotope spike (NBS981, 206Pb/207Pb =1.093) to an unfiltered sample, and followed the dissolved isotope composition of the mixture during the following two months. The initial dissolved Pb concentration was 18.3 pmol/kg with 206Pb/207Pb of 1.200. “Total dissolvable” Pb released after acidification of the in the unfiltered sample was 373 pmol/kg with 206Pb/207Pb of 1.199, indicating that there is a large particulate Pb reservoir with an isotopic composition comparable to regional crustal natural Pb. The isotope spike should have brought the dissolved 206Pb/207Pb to 1.162, but less than a day after isotope spiking, the dissolved Pb had risen to 1.181 and continued a slow increase to 1.197 over the next two months. This experiment demonstrates that Johor estuary particulate matter contains a large reservoir of exchangeable Pb that will modify the isotopic composition of deposited aeolian aerosol anthropogenic Pb. We have modeled the evolution of Pb and Pb isotopes in this experiment with a single Kd -type model that assumes that there are two or three different Pb reservoirs with different exchange time constants. This observation has implications for isotope equilibrium between high Pb/210Pb continental particles and low Pb/210Pb ocean waters – what is merely isotope equilibration may appear to be 210Pb scavenging.",

            "abstract": "In the current research modeling the carbon cycle, some of the biggest setbacks are methodological barriers to calculating the gross primary production (GPP) in the terrestrial biosphere. However, recent developments in high precision gas measurements now allow the use of COS as a potential tracer for determination of GPP, independently of CO2 .Since the tropics are implicated as being the source of the most significant reduction of carbon uptake by the majority of models, making accurate GPP measurements in the tropics is particularly important for carbon modeling. In order to constrain measurements of GPP in the tropics, carbonyl sulfide fluxes on a leaf chamber scale and a canopy-wide scale will be analyzed in a field site in the central Amazon. Accompanying this experiment, I am measuring the resistance of CO2 passing  through the intercellular airspaces in the leaf to the sites of carboxylation, known as mesophyll conductance. Mesophyll conductance is poorly documented in the tropics, and remains a centrally limiting factor in plant uptake of COS and CO2 – with upward estimates of 40% of the CO2 diffusional limitation of photosynthesis hinging on mesophyll conductance (Warren, 2008). This makes mesophyll conductance comparable in magnitude to that of the stomatal conductance, suggesting that mesophyll conductance is one of the most fundamental measurements necessary for developing the predictive capacity of plants’ response to ecosystem changes. Accurate measurements of the mesophyll conductance also lead to better informed models that can upscale assimilation measurements from leaf chambers, by providing quantitative constraints for modeling the uptake of carbonyl sulfide and carbon dioxide by the leaf. Additionally, since mesophyll conductance reacts to environmental variation, it can be used as an indicator for leaf stress. Measurements are taken using the ‘variable J’ technique, involving the use of combined fluorescence measurements and gas exchange data to estimate the ratio of photosynthetic assimilation to differences in CO2 concentration between the intercellular air spaces and the sites of carboxylation.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is widely accepted as a useful technology for characterizing the Earth surface in an objective, reproducible, and economically feasible manner. To date, the calibration and validation of remote sensing data sets and biophysical parameter estimates remain challenging due to the requirements to sample large areas for ground-truth data collection, and restrictions to sample these data within narrow temporal windows centered around flight campaigns or satellite overpasses. The computer graphics community have taken significant steps to ameliorate some of these challenges by providing an ability to generate synthetic images based on geometrically and optically realistic representations of complex targets and imaging instruments. These synthetic data can be used for conceptual and diagnostic tests of instrumentation prior to sensor deployment or to examine linkages between biophysical characteristics of the Earth surface and at-sensor radiance. In the last two decades, the use of image generation techniques for remote sensing of the vegetated environment has evolved from the simulation of simple homogeneous, hypothetical vegetation canopies, to advanced scenes and renderings with a high degree of photo-realism. Reported virtual scenes comprise up to 100M surface facets; however, due to the tighter coupling between hardware and software development, the full potential of image generation techniques for forestry applications yet remains to be fully explored.\nIn this presentation, we examine the potential computer graphics techniques have for the analysis of forest structure-function relationships and demonstrate techniques that provide for the modeling of extremely high-faceted virtual forest canopies, comprising billions of scene elements. We demonstrate the use of ray tracing simulations for the analysis of gap size distributions and characterization of foliage clumping within spatial footprints that allow for a tight matching between characteristics derived from these virtual scenes and typical pixel resolutions of remote sensing imagery.",

Composites constructed from a 1000-yr pre-industrial control simulation show that increased precipitation in the central/eastern Pacific drives a negative NAM response. In contrast, when isolated from ENSO variability, increased precipitation over the western-central Indian Ocean drives a strong and persistent positive NAM response. The sign and amplitude of the NAM responses are largely explained by opposite linear interference of the wave teleconnections propagating from the tropics. This mechanism is confirmed using a new set of experiments where the tropical ocean is nudged separately over the Pacific and Indian Oceans toward the large amplitude 1997/98 -- 1998/99 ENSO cycle. The phase of the quasi-stationary wave and NAM responses in these two cases are of opposite sign, providing strong evidence that precipitation changes over the Indian Ocean, driven by internal variability and/or in response to climate change, can induce teleconnections that affect the northern extratropics independent of--and with opposite-sign to--those associated with ENSO.",

Aligning itself with Executive Order S-3-05, the Air District has set a goal to reduce the region’s GHG emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by the year 2050. The Air District's 10-point Climate Action Work Program lays out the agency’s priorities, actions and coordination with regional stakeholders. The Program has three core objectives: (1) to develop a technical and monitoring program to document the region’s GHG sources and related emissions, (2) to implement a policy and rule-based approach to control and regulate GHG emissions, and finally, (3) to utilize local governance, incentives and partnerships to encourage GHG emissions reductions.\nAs part of the technical program, the Air District has set up a long term, ambient GHG monitoring network at four sites. The first site is located north and upwind of the urban core at Bodega Bay by the Pacific Coast. It mostly receives clean marine inflow and serves as the regional background site. The other three sites are strategically located at regional exit points for Bay Area plumes that presumably contain GHG enhancements from local sources. These stations are at San Martin, located south of the San Jose metropolitan area; at Patterson Pass at the cross section with California’s Central Valley; and at Bethel Island at the mouth of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. At all sites, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are being measured continuously, along with combustion tracer CO and other air pollutants. The GHG measurements are performed with high precision and fast laser instruments (Picarro Inc). In the longer term, the network will allow the Air District to monitor ambient concentrations of GHGs and thus evaluate the effectiveness of its policy, regulation and enforcement efforts. We present data from the sites in their first few months of operation and demonstrate the efficacy and utility of this monitoring network. We also present our progress on the design and fabrication of a dedicated mobile GHG measurement platform (a research van) equipped with state of the art analyzers capable of measuring isotopic methane (13C – CH4), CH4, CO2 and also nitrous oxide (N2O) in ambient air at fast temporal rates.",

            "abstract": "Biofilms play a major role in controlling the fluxes and reactivity of chemical species transported in hydro-logical systems. Micro-organisms require both electron donors and electron acceptors for cellular growth, proliferation and maintenance of their metabolic functions. The mechanisms controlling these reactions derive from the interactions occurring at the micro-scale that depend on mineral compositions, the biota of subsurface environment, but also fluid mixing, which determines the local concentrations of nutriments, electron donors and electron acceptors. Hence, mixing zones between oxygen and nutriment rich shallow groundwater and mineralized deep groundwater are often considered as potential hotspots of microbial activity, although relatively few field data document flow distributions, transport properties, chemical gradients and micro-organisms distributions across these mixing interfaces.\nHere we investigate the origin of a localized biofilm development observed in the fractured granite aquifer at the Ploemeur observatory (H+ network hplus.ore.fr).This biofilm composed of ferro-oxidizing bacteria is observed in an 130m deep artesian well. Borehole video logs show an important colonization of the well by the biofilm in the shallower part (0 to 60m), while it is inexistent in the deeper part (60 to 130m). As flow is localized in a few deep and shallow fractures, we presume that the spatial distribution of biofilm is controlled by mixing between shallow and deep groundwater. To verify this hypothesis we conducted a field campaign with joint characterization of the flow and chemical composition of water flowing from the different fractures, as well as the microbiological composition of the biofilm at different depth, using pyrosequencing techniques. We will discuss in this presentation the results of this interdisciplinary dataset and their implications for the occurrence of hotspots of microbiological activity in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "It has been increasingly recognized and observed that activities within the troposphere, either natural (e.g., thunderstorm, earthquake, volcano) or anthropogenic (e.g., explosion above or below ground), can substantially disturb the ionosphere in the forms of atmosphere gravity wave, infrasonic acoustic wave, and electric-field-induced ionospheric chemical reaction. These disturbances introduce plasma density variations in the ionosphere that adversely distort the transionospheric radio signals for communication, navigation, surveillance, and other national security missions. A new three-year strategic research program has been initiated at LANL in FY16 to investigate, understand, and characterize the interwoven dynamic and electrodynamic coupling processes from the source in the troposphere to the disturbances in the ionosphere via comprehensive observation and model simulation. The planned study area is chosen to be over the US Great Plains where severe thunderstorms occur frequently and where the necessary atmospheric and ionospheric observations are conducted routinely. In this presentation, we will outline our program plan, technical approaches, and scientific goals, and will discuss opportunities of possible inter-institute collaborations.",

            "abstract": "Warm water flowing beneath the large floating ice shelves in Antarctica will play an important role in how fast sea level rises. The lack of detailed bathymetry beneath the large ice shelves and lack of understanding of their internal structure inherently limits our knowledge of how ice shelves will thin and collapse. Understanding the bathymetry beneath the remaining ice shelves is critical to understanding how ice shelves will thin in the future and how that will impact the flux of ice into the global ocean. The Ross Ice Shelf, the largest ice shelf remaining on our planet, buttresses the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The bathymetry beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is the least explored piece of ocean floor on our planet.\nThe IcePod is a compact integrated ice imaging system developed for use on any C-130 aircraft developed with NSF support. The initial development program was targeted towards investigating glacial and ice-sheet processes. In this program, deep and shallow ice radars were developed. Optical instruments, including a scanning laser, Infra-red camera and visible wave camera were integrated into the pod. We have expanded the IcePod instrument suite to include the potential field measurements of magnetic and gravity anomalies with support from the Moore Foundation. During the development, a total field cesium sensor magnetometer and 3-axis fluxgate from previously funded work were also incorporated into the pod. Their behavioral response to being located close to high-frequency electronics, power supplies and metallic objects were studied. We describe in part some of that development process and the positive findings that resulted. The Icepod group is also actively pursuing the development, modification and incorporation of a new gravimeter into the suite of instruments available to the program and is investigating reduction in size of this that may eventually lead to incorporating the gravimeter into the pod itself. As part of this program we are also recording and analyzing data in parallel to this from on-board IMUs that has the capacity of leading to the development of a ‘strap down’ gravimeter. This IcePod plus Potential Fields instrumentation suite will be deployed in Antarctica in 2015 and 2016 to study the Ross Ice Shelf, producing new high resolution imaging of the bathymetry and the ice shelf structure.",

One possible solution to this problem is to analyze the hydrocarbon fluids in the bottom sediments. The object of our study was the core sample from Ivashkinskaya lagoon (Lena Delta, Sakha Republic). Pyrolytic studies were performed for this core sample (ROCK- EVAL 6 TURBO). According to the pyrolysis results there were 5 samples from the upper section in the range 0.36-5.58m selected for the further studies. The common feature of these samples is high content level of the pelitic component. They contain more than 1.0% of TOC and are composed of volatile organic compounds. Extracts obtained from the core sample were analyzed by GC-MS («Hewlett Packard» 6890/5973). Analyzed extracts demonstrated different classes of organic compounds in their composition with saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and acids dominating. Here are the histograms of n-alkanes in function of the carbon atoms number in the molecule (Figure). Considering our work experience with the Black Sea sediments we suggest that the samples with a high degree of even n-alkanes are confined to zones of petroleum hydrocarbons migration coming from the deep oil deposits.\nFigure.

The prevailing dogma that upland forests are sinks of atmospheric CH4 was challenged a decade ago by large discrepancies in bottom-up versus top-down models of CH4 concentrations over upland forests that are still unexplained. Evidence of a novel abiotic mechanism for CH4 production from plant tissue is too small to explain the discrepancy. Alternative hypotheses for this observation have been proposed, but not tested. Here we demonstrate that CH4 is emitted from the stems of dominant tree species in an upland forest. Tree emissions occur throughout the growing season while soils adjacent to the trees are consuming CH4, challenging the concept that forests are uniform sinks of CH4. Scaling by stem surface area showed the forest to be a net CH4 source during a wet sample in June and a reduced CH4 sink by 5% annually. High frequency measurements revealed diurnal cycling in the rate of CH4 emissions, pointing to soils as the CH4 source and transpiration as the most likely pathway for CH4 transport. We propose the forests are smaller CH4 sinks than previously estimated due to stem emissions. Stem emissions may be particularly important in upland tropical forests characterized by high rainfall and transpiration, resolving differences between models and measurements.",

            "abstract": "δ13C values of speleothem calcite decreased globally during the last deglaciation defining a carbon isotope excursion (CIE) despite relatively constant δ13C values of carbon in the ocean-atmosphere system. The magnitude of the CIE varied with latitude, increasing poleward from ~2‰ in the tropics to as much as 7‰ at high latitudes. This recent CIE provides an interesting comparison with CIEs observed in deep time.\nA substantial portion of this CIE can be explained by the increase in atmospheric pCO2 that accompanied deglaciation. The dependence of C3 plant δ13C values on atmospheric pCO2 predicts a 2‰ δ13C decrease driven by the deglacial pCO2 increase. I propose that this signal was transferred to caves and thus explains nearly 100% of the CIE magnitude observed in the tropics and no less than 30% at the highest latitudes in the compilation. An atmospheric pCO2 control on speleothem δ13C values, if real, will need to be corrected for using ice core data before δ13C records can be interpreted in a paleoclimate context. The decrease in the magnitude of the equilibrium calcite-CO2 carbon isotope fractionation factor explains a maximum of 1‰ of the CIE at the highest northern latitude in the compilation, which experienced the largest deglacial warming. Much of the residual extratropical CIE was likely driven by increasing belowground respiration rates, which were presumably pronounced at high latitudes as glacial retreat exposed fresh surfaces and/or vegetation density increased. The largest increases in belowground respiration would have therefore occurred at the highest latitudes, explaining the meridional trend. This work supports the notion that increases in atmospheric pCO2 and belowground respiration rates can result in large CIEs recorded in terrestrial carbonates, which, as previously suggested, may explain the magnitude of the PETM CIE as recorded by paleosol carbonates.",

            "abstract": "Models that translate individual tree responses to distribution and abundance of competing populations are needed to understand forest vulnerability to drought. Currently, biodiversity predictions rely on one scale or the other, but do not combine them. Synthesis is accomplished here by modeling data together, each with their respective scale-dependent connections to the scale needed for prediction—landscape to regional biodiversity. The approach we summarize integrates three scales, i) individual growth, reproduction, and survival, ii) size-species structure of stands, and iii) regional forest biomass. Data include 24,347 USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots and 135 Long-term Forest Demography plots. Climate, soil moisture, and competitive interactions are predictors. We infer and predict the four-dimensional size/species/space/time (SSST) structure of forests, where all demographic rates respond to winter temperature, growing season length, moisture deficits, local moisture status, and competition.\n Responses to soil moisture are highly non-linear and not strongly related to responses to climatic moisture deficits over time. In the Southeast the species that are most sensitive to drought on dry sites are not the same as those that are most sensitive on moist sites. Those that respond most to spatial moisture gradients are not the same as those that respond most to regional moisture deficits. There is little evidence of simple tradeoffs in responses. Direct responses to climate constrain the ranges of few tree species, north or south; there is little evidence that range limits are defined by fecundity or survival responses to climate. By contrast, recruitment and the interactions between competition and drought that affect growth and survival are predicted to limit ranges of many species. Taken together, results suggest a rich interaction involving demographic responses at all size classes to neighbors, landscape variation in moisture, and regional climate change.",

            "abstract": "Trace-element signatures of zircon are becoming increasingly used as a tool to infer the petrologic history of the rock from which that zircon crystallized. In this study, we sampled 11 igneous rocks from west to east across the northern Peninsular Ranges Batholith (PRB) to test how well REE patterns in zircon reflect those of the whole rock in arc magmas (granodiorite–tonalite). Previous studies of the PRB show two transitions from west to east, with respect to their REE patterns; transition 1) a decrease in HREE, from the west to the central PRB, and 2) an increase in LREE from the central to the eastern PRB. Whole rock samples in this study, analyzed by XRF and ICPMS, reproduce this pattern and thus provide a variety of REE signatures with which to test whether zircon can be used as a proxy for whole-rock data.\nZircon from the 11 samples was analyzed by LASS (Laser Ablation Split Stream) ICP-MS, to measure both the age of the zircons and their trace-element compositions. In general, as expected, ages young from west (ca. 104 Ma) to east (ca. 90 Ma). Patterns of HREE in zircon correlate well with those of the whole rock, whereas the LREE correlation is weak. The distribution coefficient for HREE between zircon and whole rock, however, decreases with increasing HREE. Possibilities for this negative relation include: 1) minor changes in whole-rock chemistry, as samples become slightly more felsic from west to east, 2) changes in crystallization temperature from west to east, and 3) sampling bias of HREE-poor zircon rims with HREE fractionated in zircon cores.\nOther trace element data measured in zircon and whole rock include P, Ti, Y, Nb, Hf, Ta, Th, and U and provide interesting results. Nb and Ta show a moderate correlation between zircon and whole rock, but the Nb/Ta ratio does not. Also, though U correlates well between whole rock and zircon and Th/U correlates well between zircon and age, the Th/U ratio of the zircon is negatively correlated with the whole rock; thus, in this case, Th/U changes in zircon are not a good indication of Th/U trends overall. Finally, Ti in zircon correlates strongly with location and whole-rock HREE concentration, indicating that either temperatures and/or Ti activity were higher in the west, early in the construction of the batholith.",

            "abstract": "Several independent observational studies have identified a modulating diurnal signal in the Moon’s neutron leakage flux. Those studies show that the diurnally varying neutron flux signal is of global extent, that the phase of the flux modulations are similar, that the flux minima occur at dawn and that the maxima occur at dusk. Two plausible hypotheses suggest differing explanations for the flux modulation. 1) Diurnally variant surface hydration or 2) Regolith temperature variation, which may modulate the neutron leakage flux with temperature. Studies of the high-latitudes found that for the north and south polar regions >75°, the amplitude of the neutron flux modulation was significantly greater for poleward-facing slopes (PFS) as compared to equator-facing slopes (EFS). If regolith temperature alone is driving the neutron flux modulation, then EFS should exhibit the greater diurnal amplitude, opposite the observation. More recently, studies of the neutron leakage flux in the mid-latitudes indicated that the greater amplitude of the neutron flux modulation on EFS was greater than PFS and is consistent with an interpretation that regolith temperature is modulating the neutron flux towards the northern Mare. However, between +/-(65° to 72°) latitude the ratio of the EFS to PFS neutron flux amplitudes inverts, with the PFS maintaining the greater amplitude as compared to the EFS. In this study the lunar mid to upper latitudes +/-(45° to 90°) will be studied in an effort to discriminate the source of the neutron flux modluation. Neutron, temperature and topography observations by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND), Diviner Radiometer, and Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimiter (LOLA) will be used to investigate the properties of the neutron leakage flux. Correlated studies of these three datasets in Mare and highlands regions will be used to determine the neutron flux characteristics of their respective EFS and PFS.",

            "abstract": "Data from three-dimensional VHF mapping, high-speed video and slow electric field antenna of multiple ground contact flashes (MGCFs) have been analyzed in an attempt to characterize the process through which new ground terminations in natural lightning are formed. The three-dimensional VHF mapping data (obtained by a Lightning Mapping Array, LMA) provided valuable information on the processes that occurred inside the cloud during the interval between strokes. Detailed case studies of over 30 MGCFs observed in the vicinity of a wind farm in Kansas, USA, have allowed the identification and qualitative description of three mechanisms through which a given flash may touch ground at different locations. In events of Type I, the dart leader that initiates the subsequent stroke starts in the original channel and then diverges from the original path of the first stroke, ionizing a new channel and reaching ground at a different location. In high-speed video records, these events eventually have their “diverging” point visible below cloud base and their strike locations are separated by a few hundreds of meters. Type II, on the other hand, comprises flashes in which the subsequent stroke is initiated in an in-cloud branch that is farther from the inception region of the first return stroke, moving in another direction and touching ground at farther distances (up to more than 10 km from the initial strike location). Finally, Type III flashes typically gave rise to several return strokes, each with different ground strike points. Stepped leaders initiated in the same general region in the cloud give rise to these strokes with typical interstroke intervals below 100 milliseconds but no common channel branches among them could be conclusively identified. Representative events of each type are discussed in detail.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the flux of nitrate from different landscape sources in watersheds is important to understand the increased flux of nitrogen to coastal ecosystems. We have used optical nitrate sensors to assess temporal and spatial river concentration variations in NC coastal plain rivers over the past decade on a 15 minute time scale. River nitrate concentrations exhibit large variations at one station on hourly to weekly time scales, indicating that flux estimates from weekly or monthly sampling can contain large errors. We also have mapped downstream nitrate concentration variations with optical sensors in boats and kayaks. Detailed spatial analysis indicates that nitrate, Chlorophyll a, and CDOM are not spatially coherent and one concentration cannot be used to predict the distribution of the other parameters as suggested by some regulatory agencies. Downstream nitrate concentration variations are not related specifically to buffer conditions adjacent only to the main stem river system, but to conditions of all the tributaries and main stem river buffers in the drainage. Hydric soil distributions are an excellent predictor of nutrient transport in watersheds, and are related to the distribution of biogeochemical “hotspots”. Changes in riverine nitrate concentrations on a fine scale are related to the % of cultivated or pastureland located within the 100 foot river buffer area that is underlain by partially hydric or non-hydric soils. These findings have important implications for water resource and drought management by public agencies and utility managers. Not all buffers are created equally in terms of nutrient transport, and resources to remediate and improve buffers should be concentrated in these “critical” buffer areas that are prone to “leak” contaminates into the river ecosystems.

            "abstract": "Understanding how organic compounds interact with clay minerals and which functional groups result in the strongest bonds is pivotal to achieving a better understanding of how mineral composition affects the residence time of carbon and nitrogen in soils. In this work, we describe how small peptides derived from tryptone casein digest are dissolved and suspended with clay minerals to examine the nature of OM adsorption to mineral surfaces and the resulting effect on clay mineral structure. XRD analyses indicate that peptides intercalation results in expansion of the d001 spacing of montmorillonite (Mt) and the smectite component of a 70-30 illite-smectite mixed layer clay (I-S) and poorer crystallinity overall as a result of exfoliation of tactoids. Peptide adsorption is concentration-dependent, however, surface adsorption appears to mediate interlayer adsorption in Mt reaching a maximum of 16% of the mass of the organoclay complex, indicating that at a critical concentration, peptide intercalation will supersede surface adsorption resulting in a more stable attachment. In I-S the degree of surface adsorption and intercalation is proportional to concentration, however, surface adsorption is not a priming mechanism for interlayer adsorption. Thermogravimetric analysis of the organoclay complexes determined by TGA coupled to GC-MS indicate that the most prominent product species measured was 1-(1-Trimethylsiloxyethenyl)-3-trimethylsiloxy-benzene, likely from tryptophan monomer decomposition. The compound was detected over a broad temperature range, greater than 300 oC, during pyrolysis and suggests a carbon-silicon covalent bond formed between the peptide and tetrahedral layers in the clay. An additional silicon-bearing VOC detected at lower pyrolysis temperature by GC was N,N-Diethyl-1-(trimethylsilyl)-9,10-didehydroergoline-8-carboxamide, likely derived from a lysine-bearing peptide derivative. We hypothesize that hydrophobic (non-ionic) peptides react with silanol at the clay platelet edges to induce exfoliation and subsequent formation of stable nanocomposite clays.",

            "abstract": "Instead of building new infrastructure to increase their supply reliability, water resource managers are often tasked with better management of current systems. The managers often have existing simulation models that aid their planning, and lack methods for efficiently generating and evaluating planning alternatives. This presentation discusses how multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) decision support can be used with the sophisticated water infrastructure model, RiverWare, in highly constrained water planning environments. We first discuss a study that performed a many-objective tradeoff analysis of water supply in the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) in Texas. RiverWare is combined with the Borg MOEA to solve a seven objective problem that includes systemwide performance objectives and individual reservoir storage reliability. Decisions within the formulation balance supply in multiple reservoirs and control pumping between the eastern and western parts of the system. The RiverWare simulation model is forced by two stochastic hydrology scenarios to inform how management changes in wet versus dry conditions. The second part of the presentation suggests how a broader set of RiverWare-MOEA studies can inform tradeoffs in other systems, especially in political situations where multiple actors are in conflict over finite water resources. By incorporating quantitative representations of diverse parties’ objectives during the search for solutions, MOEAs may provide support for negotiations and lead to more widely beneficial water management outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal energy harvesting requires extraction and injection of geothermal fluid. Doing so in an optimal way requires a quantitative understanding of site-specific heat transfer between geothermal fluid and the ambient rock. We develop a heat transfer particle-tracking approach to model that interaction. Fracture-network models of heat transfer in fractured rock explicitly account for the presence of individual fractures, ambient rock matrix, and fracture-matrix interfaces. Computational domains of such models span the meter scale, whereas fracture apertures are on the millimeter scale. The computations needed to model these multi-scale phenomenon can be prohibitively expensive, even for methods using nonuniform meshes. Our approach appreciably decreases the computational costs. Current particle-tracking methods usually assume both infinite matrix and one-dimensional (1D) heat transfer in the matrix blocks. They rely on 1D analytical solutions for heat transfer in a single fracture, which can lead to large predictive errors. Our two-dimensional (2D) heat transfer simulation algorithm is mesh-free and takes into account both longitudinal and transversal heat conduction in the matrix. It uses a probabilistic model to transfer particle to the appropriate neighboring fracture unless it returns to the fracture of origin or remains in the matrix. We use this approach to look at the impact of a fracture-network topology (e.g. the importance of smaller scale fractures), as well as the matrix block distribution on the heat transport in heterogeneous fractured rocks.",

Their bulk-rock chemistry are consistent with moderate degrees of partial melting, but elevated incompatible trace element ratios (e.g. La/YbN) are indicative of subsequent secondary processes. Petrographic observation reveals no infiltration of host basalt, but melt infiltration unrelated to the host basalt has occurred, most likely within the sub-continental lithospheric mantle prior to entrainment as xenoliths.\nThe peridotites have a mean [Os] concentration of 2.35 ng g-1 and 187Os/188Os values from 0.12081 ± 16 to 0.12639 ± 14 (cf. PUM = 0.1296 ± 00082), with rhenium depletion model ages (TRD) ranging from 0.48 to 1.30 Ga. Silicate melt contains up to 2 orders of magnitude less Os than peridotites3 but the 187Os/188Os of melt infiltrated peridotite can be skewed by the precipitation of immiscible sulfide when an infiltrating melt reaches S-saturation4. The Borée peridotites retain an unradiogenic Os-isotope signature despite silicate melt infiltration; this may be due to primary base metal sulfides enclosed in silicate minerals and therefore protected from interaction with infiltrating melts. TRD of enclosed sulphides should therefore be able to ‘see through’ any secondary metasomatic events and reveal melt depletion ages significantly older than those obtained from bulk-rock analyses (cf. 4).\n1.

In soils with higher rates of nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization from organic matter, AM-associated plants can be better adapted than ECM-associated plants. Importantly, the photosynthate costs of nutrient uptake for AM-associated plants are usually lower than that for ECM-associated plants. Thus, the global carbon cycle is closely coupled with mycorrhizal controls on N uptake. To investigate the potential climate dependence of terrestrial environments from AM- and ECM-associated plants, this study uses the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with a plant productivity-optimized N acquisition model—the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) model—integrated into its land model—the Community Land Model (CLM). This latest version of CLM coupled with FUN allows for the assessment of mycorrhizal controls on global biogeochemical cycling. Here, we show how the historical evolution of AM- and ECM-associations altered regional and global biogeochemical cycling and climate, and future projections over the next century.",

The scintillation occurrence rate is higher around magnetic noon, while the scintillation level is stronger around magnetic midnight. This study focuses on the dayside scintillation region. In order to resolve the role of the cusp auroral processes in the production of irregularities, we put the GPS phase scintillation in the context of the observed auroral morphology. Results show that the occurrence rate of the GPS phase scintillation is highest inside the auroral cusp, regardless of the scintillation strength and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). On average the scintillation occurrence rate in the cusp region is about 5 times as high as in the region immediately poleward of it. The scintillation occurrence rate is higher when the IMF BZ is negative. When partitioning the scintillation data by the IMF BY, the distribution of the scintillation occurrence rate around magnetic noon is similar to that of the poleward moving auroral form (PMAF) statistics: there is a higher occurrence rate at earlier (later) magnetic local time when the IMF BY is positive (negative). This indicates that the irregularities which give rise to scintillations follow the IMF BY controlled East-West motion of the aurora and plasma. Furthermore, the scintillation occurrence rate is higher when IMF BY is positive when the cusp is shifted towards the post-noon sector where it may get easier access to the higher density plasma. This suggests that the combined auroral activities (e.g., PMAF) and the density of the intake solar EUV ionized plasma are crucial for the production of scintillations.",

            "abstract": "The Yabrai range-front fault (YRF) accommodates deformation within the middle Gobi Alashan block between Tibetan Plateau and the Ordos block. As such, it affords an opportunity to examine the transition between shortening and crustal thickening associated with growth of the Tibetan Plateau and extension in North China. Geomorphic mapping of the active fault trace and trench investigations reveal that the YRF is comprised of three segments with variable fault strike, sense of motion, scarp height, and slip history. Displaced Holocene and Late Pleistocene alluvial deposits indicate that southwestern segment is characterized by oblique-normal displacement with a minor left-lateral component, whereas the middle segment appears to exhibit dip-slip normal displacement. The northeastern segment appears to be primarily a left-lateral strike-slip fault. Geomorphically fresh fault scarps are present within Late Pleistocene-Holocene alluvial fans and terraces along the southwestern and northeastern segments, whereas the middle segment of the fault is coincident with the bedrock alluvial contact along the range front. Along the southwestern segment, 10Be exposure ages of offset fans yield a vertical slip rate of ~0.1 mm/yr over the late Pleistocene. Strike-slip rates along the northeastern fault segment are between 0.23 ± 0.02 and 0.78 ± 0.12 mm/yr. Regionally, the orientation, sense of motion, and slip rates along the Yabrai range-front fault is consistent with both NE-directed shortening across the margin of the Tibetan Plateau and NW-derected extension across the Ordos Block.",

            "abstract": "Pitch angle scattering of electrons caused by chorus emissions is one of significant wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere. A number of previous studies treat the pitch angle scattering as a diffusion of distribution function and calculate diffusion coefficients from observed wave spectra. However, in the diffusion model, we cannot evaluate the nonlinearity of the pitch angle scattering, while recent theoretical works and observation results have pointed out the importance of nonlinear effects. A concept of Wave-Particle Interaction Analysis (WPIA) is proposed by Fukuhara et al. (2009). In the frame of the WPIA, we can directly detect wave-particle interactions by calculating the energy exchange between waves and particles. In the present study, in addition to the method to detect the energy exchange, we propose a method to directly detect the pitch angle scattering of resonant particles by calculating G. The G is defined as the accumulation value of a pitch angular component of the Lorentz force acting on each particle. We apply the proposed method to results of the one-dimensional electron hybrid simulation (Katoh and Omura, 2007a, b). By using the wave and particle data obtained at fixed points assumed in the simulation system, we conduct the pseudo-observation in the simulation. In the result of the analysis, we obtain significant values of G for electrons in the kinetic energy and pitch angle ranges satisfying the cyclotron resonance condition. We compare the result of the analysis of G with the temporal variation of both the pitch angle distributions and the wave spectra. While the pitch angle distribution varies by a few percent through interactions, we obtain the statistically significant G. Furthermore, we compare the G with diffusion coefficient D. While the D showed the broadband diffusive scattering, the G values indicated the narrowband strong scattering. We note that in deriving Fokker-Planck equation and diffusion coefficient D, we use the quasi-linear approximation for the Vlasov equation, but by the proposed G values we can evaluate the pitch angle scattering without any approximation of the physical process governing wave-particle interactions. In this study, we discuss the significance of the G values based on the concept of WPIA to evaluate wave-particle interactions in the space plasma.",

With the consideration of GLONASS observations at CODE in 2003 GLONASS and GPS-GLONASS-intersystem biases were introduced (first for the ionosphere analysis and later also for the clock analysis). Another essential step was the consideration of GLONASS differential code-phase biases (DCPB) needed for successful GLONASS ambiguity resolution. Nowadays, with receivers capable to track more than four GNSS constellations, new frequencies and signals, the handling and adequate consideration of all relevant GNSS biases becomes more and more demanding.\nThe change from a differential to an observable-specific, or pseudo-absolute bias parameterization is one of the important steps towards a flexible, expandable GNSS bias handling. This new approach allows us to deal with more complex GNSS analysis scenarios. In this contribution we will present the latest developments made at CODE regarding GNSS bias estimation.",

            "abstract": "Sierra Nevada (SN) is a mountain range located in the northeastern California, USA, covering an area of 63,100 km2. As one of the most diverse temperate conifer forests on the Earth, forests of SN serve a series of ecosystem functions and are valuable natural heritages for the region and even the country. The still existed gap of accurate fine-resolution tree height estimation has lagged ecological, hydrological and forestry studies within the region. Moreover, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), as one of the most frequently used land surface elevation product in the region, has been proved systematically higher than actual land surface in vegetated mountain areas due to the absorption and reflection effects of canopy on the SRTM radar signal. An accurate fine resolution tree height product across the region is urgently needed for developing models to correct SRTM DEM.\nIn this study, we firstly developed a method to estimate SN tree height distribution (defined by Lorey’s height) through the combination of airborne lidar data, spaceborne lidar data, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and field measurements. Over 5 470 km2airborne lidar data and 1 000 plot measurements were collected across the SN to address this mission. Our method involved three main steps: 1) estimate tree heights within airborne lidar footprints using step-wise regression; 2) link the airborne lidar derived tree height to spaceborne lidar data and compute tree heights at spaceborne lidar footprints; 3) extrapolate tree height estimation from spaceborne lidar footprints to the whole region using Random Forest. The obtained SN tree height product showed good correspondence with independent field plot measurements. The coefficient of determination is higher than 0.65, and the root-mean-square error is around 5 m.\nWith the obtained tree height product, we further explored the possibility of correcting SRTM DEM. The results showed that the obtained tree height product can be used to effectively reduce the systematic bias of SRTM DEM using a regression model. After correction, the mean difference between SRTM DEM and airborne lidar derived DEM decreased from 12.15 m to -0.82 m, and standard deviation of the difference dropped by 2 m.",

Methodologies for determining uncertainty can be complex and can include instrument accuracy and precision estimates, and random and systematic errors. Measurement uncertainty is also impacted by environmental and field factors that can be introduced when operating instruments outside the laboratory setting, which impacts both uncertainty and data quality. The Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program operates over 100 unique instruments at fixed, mobile, and aerial facilities in diverse climatic regimes around the world. The ARM program is in the process of standardizing how it currently reports measurement uncertainty and developing a new strategy for improving the determination of measurement uncertainty and communicating both the uncertainty and data quality information to users. We will present ARMs plan to standardize the method of reporting measurement uncertainty, as well as share ARMs overall strategies to standardize uncertainty assessment across instrument classes, improving calibration approaches, and providing more consistent data quality assessments to specifically address measurement bias corrections. Our goal is to provide an open forum for discussing the necessary and sufficient elements needed to meet the requirements for retrieval algorithm and model simulation development activities.",

            "abstract": "Pyroxenes are a major component of the Earth’s upper mantle and believed to be stable to approximately 16 GPa, along the oceanic geotherm. However, under certain conditions such as subducting slabs, it is possible to carry pyroxenes to much greater depths within the mantle. Pyroxenes penetrating the mantle to such depths could potentially undergo further phase transitions which could impact subducting slab mineralogy and mantle dynamics.\nThe compression behavior of clinopyroxenes has been well characterized up to approximately 25 GPa with much of the work being focused on Ca-rich cpx. Beyond 10 GPa previous studies have published equations of state but there is a general lack of structure determinations.\nCa-rich clinopyroxenes crystallize in the C2/c space group while Ca-poor clinopyroxenes crystalize in P21/c. It has been shown that P21/c clinopyroxenes reversibly transform to C2/c upon increased pressure, temperature, and M2 site cation size. The critical pressure for this transition is exceedingly compositionally dependent at 6.5 GPa and 1.7 GPa for clinoenstatite and clinoferrosilite, respectively. The strong compositional dependence of phase transitions in pyroxenes is motivation for a more complete understanding of compression mechanisms within the broad pyroxene category. By using in situ x-ray diffraction and diamond anvil cells to compress single-crystal clinoenstatite up to 50 GPa this study aims to expand the understanding of Ca-poor clinopyroxene compression mechanisms and elasticity. Here we report a fully reversible high-pressure phase in the P21/c space group found at approximately 45 GPa.",

These examples may inform predictions of the impact of ongoing climate change for present ice sheets. A crucial first step to quantitatively model the collapse of the Fennoscandian Ice sheet is to assess the sensitivity of the modeled ice sheet to paleoclimate. PISM-PIK, a coupled ice sheet and ice shelf model, is used to simulate the extent, thickness, and movement of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet at the LGM. I modeled last glacial maximum (LGM) climate using PMIP3 GCM and compared the ice sheet geometry that results from holding climate fixed at PMIP3 LGM conditions to the observed extent of the FIS at LGM. This same procedure was completed for a modern climate scaled to LGM conditions. I then explored the impact on modeled ice sheet extent of spatially-uniform perturbations in temperature and precipitation for both LGM climates. The goal is to assess the stability of the ice sheet –ice shelf system to changes in fundamental aspect of climate (precipitation and temperature) individually and in concert. The misfit between the modeled extent of the FIS and the geomorphic record of this extent will be used to assess possible errors in paleoclimate models and representations of ice dynamics.",

            "abstract": "In the rhizosphere, metabolic processes of plants and microorganisms are closely coupled, and together with soil minerals, their interactions regulate the turnover of soil organic C (SOC). Plants provide readily assimilable metabolites for microorganisms through exudation, and it has been hypothesized that increasing concentrations of exudate C may either stimulate or suppress rates of SOC mineralization (rhizosphere priming). Both positive and negative rhizosphere priming has been widely observed, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.\nTo begin to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying rhizosphere priming, we isolated a broad range of soil bacteria from a Mediterranean grassland dominated by annual grass. Thirty-nine heterotrophic bacteria were selected for genome sequencing and both rRNA gene analysis and metagenome coverage suggest that these isolates represent naturally abundant strain variants. We analyzed their genomes for potential metabolic traits related to life in the rhizosphere and the decomposition of polymeric SOC. While the two dominant groups, Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, were enriched in polymer degrading enzymes, Alphaproteobacterial isolates contained greater gene copies of transporters related to amino acid, organic acid and auxin uptake or export, suggesting an enhanced metabolic potential for life in the root zone.\nTo verify this metabolic potential, we determined the enzymatic activities of these isolates and revealed preferences of strains to degrade certain polymers (xylan, cellulose or lignin). Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy is being used to determine which polymeric components of plant roots are targeted by specific strains and how exudates may impact their degradation. To verify the potential of isolates to assimilate root exudates and export key metabolites we are using LC-MS/MS based exometabolomic profiling.\nThe traits hypothesized and verified here (transporters, enzymes, exudate uptake and degradation of plant polymers) provide a mechanistic basis of rhizosphere microbial succession and SOC priming and will contribute to our overarching goal of developing predictive models of the rhizosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides a couple of applications in hydrology research such as total water storage (TWS) changes monitoring, quantitative water cycle components estimation, drought monitoring and hydrological modelling. Limited spatial resolutions of gravity measurements and noise contamination can cause errors and uncertainty of the study objective. Therefore, several GRACE studies recommend application of GRACE data retrievals to areas of interests only larger 200,000 km².\nThe Urucuia Aquifer System (UAS) represents a major strategic water resource for Brazil. UAS is located in the drought-stricken northeast of Brazil and its discharge covers about 30% of the São Francisco River water (4th largest river in South America). Hydrological monitoring of the UAS is of increased importance to guarantee future river water supply and related ecosystem services for the territories crossed.\nA pre-processed GRACE three-model-ensemble was used to account for TWS changes and a negative balance was revealed for the UAS territory indicating potential water stress. Individual water cycle components needed to be excluded from the total GRACE signal using supplemental data sets to characterize the remaining storage term equivalent to ‘water stress’. Comprehensive hydrological ground measurements of precipitation, river discharge, hydraulic heads plus further climate remote-sensing data sources were taken into account trying to distinguish natural from anthropogenic groundwater stress. Consideration of climate data from global hydrological models showed an insufficient accuracy which is related to spatial scaling issues whereas the inclusion of available ground data could increase the overall significance of the GRACE signal for this study.\nGRACE-based TWS retrievals were applied successfully in combination with comprehensive hydrological monitoring data to quantify potential groundwater storage changes of the 120,000 km² large UAS.",

            "abstract": "Auroral electron precipitation forms a complex and dynamic energy input into the high-latitude ionosphere and thermopshere. Rapid changes in plasma density due to electron impact ionization create correspondingly rapid changes in conductivity which in turn change the magnitude and altitude profile of magnetospheric current closure in the E- and F-region. Modeling these changes in the ionosphere and their effects on the local or regional upper atmosphere requires detailed input over wide regions. In support of the AMISR PINOT campaign and several rocket campaigns (CASCADES-2, MICA, ASSP) we have developed and tested a method to determine the characteristics of auroral energy input using purely ground-based optical measurements in geometries away from magnetic zenith. Using the N2+ first negative emissions at 427.8 nm reproduces the total energy flux over a wide region, but alone does not indicate the altitude profile of this energy deposition.\nUsing temperature maps of the E-region collected by a Scanning Doppler Imager (SDI) observing the auroral green-line emission is a proxy for the characteristic energy of the precipitating electrons. While in some cases the energy determination underestimates the average energy it still is a good proxy for understanding when the electron distribution changes. We examine two seasons worth of auroral observations and determine the spatial and temporal variability of auroral energy deposition in comparison to solar wind and geophysical activity parameters. We also compare the results with well-known empirical models of electron energy deposition and show that they underestimate the peak local energy deposition rates by as much as a factor of 30.",

            "abstract": "Microseismic events are commonly recorded during hydraulic fracturing experiments. In microseismic interpretations, each event is often regarded as independent and uncorrelated to neighboring ones. In reality, both the rock deformation (static stresses) and transient wave motion (dynamic stresses) associated with microseismic events add to the stress field together with the external loading (fluid injection). We believe the resulting static and dynamic stress perturbations will influence both the timing and spatial evolution of the microseismic cloud. We study the dynamic triggering of microseismicity using numerical simulations of a biaxial deformation test by means of a bonded particle method (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004), where crack development can be tracked and analyzed independently. Our methodology is to compare the stress changes due to one specific event with the occurrence of the next few events in the numerical simulations. In addition, we compute the dynamic stress perturbations for recorded large events analytically given their (non-double couple) failure mechanisms. Our results show that cracks following a major event tend to form in zones affected by the dynamic stresses by promoting new failure in areas that are critically stressed. This confirms that dynamic triggering during hydraulic fracturing operations but also larger scale seismicity is likely. It also demonstrates the often complex interplay between the dynamic and static stress changes and their effect on the temporal and spatial evolution of rock deformation at all scales.",

            "abstract": "Production of natural gas from shale gas reservoirs is curtailed by sorption of methane (CH4) onto minerals and organic constituents in the shale matrix. Recently, supercritical CO2 (scCO2) has been proposed as a working fluid that could be utilized to enable recovery of unproduced CH4 from these low permeability environments. This strategy depends upon a competitive adsorption process in which CO2 drives desorption of CH4 from the shale matrix. However, relative sorption of gases on organic-rich shales is not well understood and appears to depend on several factors, such as clay mineral composition, total organic carbon content, microporosity, and moisture content. Moreover, little is known about the migration mechanisms for CH4 transport from kerogen sources to a production well and the enhanced transport rates that result from formation changes induced by the injection of CO2. In this work, a newly developed high-pressure titration system with in situ spectroscopic detection was used to investigate the sorption behavior of CH4 and CO2 onto Woodford shale and kerogen analogs. The apparatus consists of a custom-designed titanium reactor fitted with quartz windows, switching valves, a fixed-volume injection loop, stainless steel tubing, and a near-infrared spectrometer capable of monitoring gas-phase concentrations at pressures up to 190 bar and temperatures to 100 °C. Quantitative CH4 sorption measurements were conducted in two steps. First, the empty cell was titrated with CH4 to identify a correlation between concentration and the near-infrared absorbance of the CH combination and overtone bands. Next, the process was repeated with a sorbent present in the cell, and the difference between the integrated absorbance from the two titrations was used to determine the sorbed concentration of CH4. Additional experiments were conducted in which the sorbent was initially exposed to CH4, and then scCO2 was titrated into the reactor to desorb the CH4. The results from these investigations will be discussed in the context of optimizing CH4 recovery from shale-gas reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Major solar eruptions such as X-class flares and very fast coronal mass ejections usually originate in active regions on the Sun. The energy that powers these events is believed to be stored as free magnetic energy (energy above the potential field state) prior to eruption. While coronal magnetic fields are not in general force-free, active regions have very strong magnetic fields and at low coronal heights the plasma beta is therefore very small, making the field (in equilibrium) essentially force-free. The Aly-Sturrock theorem shows that the energy of a fully force-free field cannot exceed the energy of the so-called open field. If the theorem holds, this places an upper limit on the amount of free energy that can be stored: the maximum free energy (MFE) is the difference between the open field energy and the potential field energy of the active region. In thermodynamic MHD simulations of a major eruption (the July 14, 2000 'Bastille' day event) and a modest event (February 13, 2009, we have found that the MFE indeed bounds the energy stored prior to eruption. We compute the MFE for major eruptive events in cycles 23 and 24 to investigate the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in solar active regions.\nResearch supported by AFOSR, NASA, and NSF.",

Like other AMISR radars, RISR-C has the ability to use electronic beam steering to simultaneously sample ionospheric plasma parameters in several different line-of-sight directions (over 4000 possible beam directions, of which, typically 10-50 are used in a given experiment). Electron density, electron and ion temperatures, and line-of-sight (LOS) plasma velocities are measured along these beam directions at several ranges in (typically) 1-minute intervals. Combining LOS velocity measurements from several different beam directions allows full 3-d ionospheric plasma velocities to be resolved within the field-of-view of the radar. Ionospheric measurements from the southward facing RISR-C are complemented by measurements by the co-located northward facing RISR-N radar operated by SRI International and the REGO redline optical camera operated by the University of Calgary. Initial comparisons between these instruments demonstrate that RISR-C is operating well and will provide vital new measurements of the polar cap ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Stratigraphic evidence for coseismic land-level change, tsunamis, and storms is found beneath freshwater marshes in coastal northern California at Crescent City (CC). Previous studies at CC have focused on tsunamis, including the 1964 farfield tsunami from the Alaska earthquake, and nearfield tsunamis from earthquakes in the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ). In addition to new data on tsunami inundation and coseismic land-level change, evidence for deposition by large storms shows another significant coastal hazard for the area.\nOur results are from three freshwater wetland sites at CC: Marhoffer Creek, Elk Creek, and Sand Mine. Marhoffer Creek marsh is adjacent to the coast about 5 km north of CC, and at an elevation of > 3.4 m above NAVD88 (>1 m above highest tides). C-14 and diatom data show it has been a freshwater wetland for at least the past 1,800 yr. We identify tsunami deposits associated with two CSZ earthquakes (1700 C.E. and 1,650 yr BP) at Marhoffer Creek. Diatom data show that coseismic subsidence accompanied the 1700 C.E. earthquake; the tsunami deposit from that event extends 550 m inland from the beach. Cs-137 data show that thin sand layers about 70 m from the beach and 20 cm below the marsh surface were deposited by the farfield tsunami in 1964. Intercalated between the 1964 and 1700 tsunami deposits, and extending as far inland as the 1964 deposit, are storm deposits consisting of discontinuous layers of sand and detrital peat. The deposits are found in an interval about 0.5 m thick, and are perched at elevations above the highest winter tides. We surmise that at least some of these deposits record the catastrophic ARkStorm of 1861-1862.\nAt Elk Creek wetland, diatom data confirm coseismic subsidence in 1700 in addition to tsunami deposition. The 1964 tsunami deposit is thin and found only proximal to the Elk Creek channel. At Sand Mine marsh, association with coseismic subsidence is used to differentiate CSZ tsunamis in a complex ~100 m wide inundation zone shared by nearfield/farfield tsunamis and storms.",

            "abstract": "Walvis Ridge (WR) and Rio Grande Rise (RGR) are Cretaceous-Cenozoic large igneous provinces (LIPs) formed by the Tristan-Gough hot spot interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Although hot spot-ridge interaction has long been considered a primary factor controlling WR-RGR morphology, details are fuzzy owing to sparse geophysical data. We examined tectonic fabric revealed in satellite altimetry-derived gravity data to infer details about RGR-WR evolution. Plate tectonic reconstructions indicate that the main RGR plateau and large N-S plateau in the eastern WR erupted at the same point at ~90 Ma. Over the next ~8 Myr, these conjunct LIPs formed a “V” shape with a basin in between. Curved fracture zones within the basin imply the two LIPs formed around a microplate. The prominent rift in the middle of RGR formed nearly perpendicular to the RGR-WR intersection, suggesting an extensional microplate boundary. Hot spot eruptions continued at the MAR, emplacing the eastern WR and two main RGR plateaus until ~60 Ma. During this period, the N-S trending Eastern Rio Grande Rise (ERGR) was erupted along the MAR. Both the ERGR and WR formed bathymetric lineaments parallel to seafloor fault fabric and were likely connected. This resulted in WR seamounts with a “tadpole” shape, the head being small to medium seamounts on the WR track and the tails being low, spreading-fabric-parallel ridges extending up to ~150 km northward. Similar, small seamounts are found in the contemporaneous ERGR. Another critical observation is that the WR-RGR formed at a large crustal discontinuity (~700 km at anomaly C33, ~84 Ma) at one or more fracture zone offsets. By late Cenozoic time (anomaly C5, ~10 Ma), the offset was reduced by half while several new fracture zones formed at the junction between RGR and WR. This implies a connection between ridge reorganization and RGR-WR volcanism that may have resulted from the fracture zones becoming oblique to the spreading direction as Euler poles for South America - Africa shifted. Finally, after ~60 Ma, volcanism emplaced seamounts mainly on the African plate and hot spot volcanism at the MAR was greatly reduced. Results from the present study augment recently published findings of a strong link between the formation of the RGR-WR LIP and spreading ridge tectonics.",

            "abstract": "High Arctic landscapes are composed of watershed basins that vary in size and ecohydrology, but typically have a plant community complex that ranges from dry tundra to moist tundra to wet sedge systems along water body shorelines. The spatial extent of these plant communities reflects mean annual soil moisture and temperature, and is vulnerable to changes in climate conditions. Soil moisture and temperature significantly influence organic matter microbial activity and decomposition, and can affect the fate of soil carbon in tundra soils. Consequently, due to the unique soil carbon differences between tundra plant communities, shifts in their spatial extent may drive future High Arctic biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Understanding this terrestrial-atmosphere trace gas feedback, however, requires quantification of the rates and patterns of CO2 exchange along soil moisture gradients and the associated soil properties. In summer of 2015, soil CO2 flux rate, soil moisture and temperature were measured along a soil moisture gradient spanning three vegetation zones (dry tundra, wet tundra, and wet grassland) in a snow melt-fed lake basin near Thule Greenland. Mean soil temperature during the 2015 growing season was greater in dry tundra than in wet tundra and wet grassland (13.0 ± 1.2, 7.8 ± 0.8, and 5.5 ± 0.9°C, respectively). Mean volumetric soil moisture differed among all three vegetation zones where the soil moisture gradient ranged from 9 % (dry tundra) to 34 % (wet tundra) to 51 % (wet grassland). Mean soil CO2 flux was significantly greater in the wet grassland (1.7 ± 0.1 µmol m-2 s-1) compared to wet tundra (0.9 ± 0.2 µmol m-2 s-1) and dry tundra (1.2 ± 0.2 µmol m-2 s-1). Soil CO2 flux increased and decreased with seasonal warming and cooling of soil temperature. Although soil temperature was an important seasonal driver of soil CO2 flux rates, differences in mean seasonal soil CO2 flux rates among vegetation zones appeared to be a function of the combined effects of soil temperature and soil moisture conditions. These results suggest that the response of vegetation distribution to shifts in precipitation and warmer climate conditions may have significant implications for release of soil carbon as CO2 in High Arctic tundra ecosystems in Northwest Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Changes in soil moisture (SM) are directly related to food and environmental security around the world. Furthermore, precise information about temporal and spatial patterns of SM is crucial for realistic interpretations of environmental change and policy relevant research. This study shows how data fusion of topography (represented by a digital elevation models and derived terrain attributes) and annual SM (represented by remotely sensed microwave observations from 1978 to 2013) enhance spatial detail and improves the correlation between remotely sensed and ground truth SM observations. On average, topography explains 80% of remotely sensed soil moisture variability using a kernel-based form of regression with a RMSE of 0.026 via cross-validation. Predictions of annual SM were generated across the conterminous United States at 1km pixel size for the 36 years of available data. Previous studies report that SM remote sensing data, derived from microwave observations (~27km pixel size), is representative of the first 2 cm of soil depth. We found that field SM measurements best correlates with our 1 km SM product at 60 cm soil depth (R2= 0.52). Furthermore, by averaging field SM measurements between 25 and 60 cm the correlation improved to R2= 0.62. Our results show a similar negative temporal trend for field SM observations and our predicted SM product at 1km pixel size. For both cases the slope is showing a reduction of -1.87 (-0.64 -3.23) %/year and -0.92 (-0.15, -1.25) %/year, respectively. We found a consistent decline of SM at the national level, and a sharp decay in 2012 and 2013. The temporal variability of SM is partially (~51%) explained by spatial and temporal trends of precipitation and temperature across the United States. These results provide insights of alternative approaches to estimate SM trends across continental-to-global scales.",

            "abstract": "Geological processes involved in the formation of Carbonatite rocks are complex and so is the understanding about its formational temperature. Fluid inclusion studies (1) on Carbonatite and their associated Ijolites showed a homogenization temperature of 1000-1100°C for Ijoltes and a temperature (T) range of 200-600°C was assigned to the carbonatite melts. Liquid immiscibility process is held responsible for the origin of parental carbonated (ijolititic/ nephelinitic) magma. The homogenization T signifies about a time interval during which there must be a considerable amount of T dropdown soon after the formation of Ijolite and subsequent crystallization of the residual carbonatite magma. However the lack of information about the T of the primary carbonated melt remains as an important area of petrological research. Experimental studies suggest a T range of 950-1400°C for the primary carbonate melt (2). Advent of Clumped isotope thermometry (3) allowed independent method for estimation of the formational T and provide avenues to derive composition of CO2 in equilibrium with carbonate melt. Earlier attempt involving carbonatites from several locations (4) captured range of T between 83°-416°C . Here we present our observation on calcite growth T in the carbonatites from the Cretaceous Sung valley ultramafic-alkaline-carbonatite complex. Based on stable C,O isotope study and Sr, Nd isotopic composition a mantle origin- genetically linked with the Kerguelen plume was proposed (5). Clumped isotope study on the same samples revealed consistent C and O isotope compositions, providing Δ47 values ranging from 0.32 to 0.48. δ13C and δ18O (in VPDB) values of the present study falls within the “Primary Igneous Carbonatite Field” (6). Using high T thermometry equation (7) we obtained a T range of 137-474 °C for the calcite present in the samples. The T recorded in our study is lower than that deduced experimental values of 960-625°C at 0.1 GPa (8) and fluid inclusion based data (1), suggesting involvement of water during calcite crystallization.\nRef: 1.Romanchev 1972, Geochem Intern; 2.Gaillard et al., 2008, Science; 3.

The role of the ESDSWG is to make recommendations relevant to NASA’s Earth science data systems from user experiences. Each group works independently focusing on a unique topic. Participation in ESDSWG groups comes from a variety of NASA-funded science and technology projects, such as MEaSUREs, NASA information technology experts, affiliated contractor, staff and other interested community members from academia and industry. Recommendations from the ESDSWG groups will enhance NASA’s efforts to develop long term data products.\nEach year, the ESDSWG has a face-to-face meeting to discuss recommendations and future efforts. Last year’s (2014) ASCII for Science Data Working Group (ASCII WG) completed its goals and made recommendations on a minimum set of information that is needed to make ASCII files at least human readable and usable for the foreseeable future.\nThe 2014 ASCII WG created a table of ASCII files and their components as a means for understanding what kind of ASCII formats exist and what components they have in common. Using this table and adding information from other ASCII file formats, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a standardized format. For instance, Space Geodesy scientists have been using the same RINEX/SINEX ASCII format for decades. Astronomers mostly archive their data in the FITS format. Yet Earth scientists seem to have a slew of ASCII formats, such as ICARTT, netCDF (an ASCII dump) and the IceBridge ASCII format.\nThe 2015 Working Group is focusing on promoting extendibility and machine readability of ASCII data. Questions have been posed, including, Can we have a standardized ASCII file format? Can it be machine-readable and simultaneously human-readable? We will present a summary of the current used ASCII formats in terms of advantages and shortcomings, as well as potential improvements.",

            "abstract": "Countries in the Middle East use a large fraction of their scarce water resources to produce cash crops, such as fruit and vegetables, for international markets. At the same time, these countries import large amounts of staple crops, such as cereals, required to meet the nutritional demand of their populations. This makes food security in the Middle East heavily dependent on world market prices for staple crops. Under these preconditions, increasing food demand due to population growth, urban expansion on fertile farmlands, and detrimental effects of a changing climate on the production of agricultural commodities present major challenges to countries in the Middle East that try to improve food security by increasing their self-sufficiency rate of staple crops.\nWe applied the spatio-temporal land-use change model LandSHIFT.JR to simulate how an expansion of urban areas may affect the production of agricultural commodities in Jordan. We furthermore evaluated how climate change and changes in socio-economic conditions may influence crop production. The focus of our analysis was on potential future irrigated and rainfed production (crop yield and area demand) of fruit, vegetables, and cereals. Our simulation results show that the expansion of urban areas and the resulting displacement of agricultural areas does result in a slight decrease in crop yields. This leads to almost no additional irrigation water requirements due to the relocation of agricultural areas, i.e. there is the same amount of “crop per drop”. However, taking into account projected changes in socio-economic conditions and climate conditions, a large volume of water would be required for cereal production in order to safeguard current self-sufficiency rates for staple crops. Irrigation water requirements are expected to double until 2025 and to triple until 2050. Irrigated crop yields are projected to decrease by about 25%, whereas there is no decrease in rainfed crop yields to be expected.",

Synchronized EUV images from STEREO/EUVI A&B 195Å and SDO/AIA 193Å undergo preprocessing steps that include PSF-deconvolution and the application of nonlinear data-derived intensity corrections that account for center-to-limb variations (limb-brightening) and inter-instrument intensity normalization. The latter two corrections are derived using a robust, systematic approach that takes advantage of unbiased long-term averages of data and serve to flatten the images by converting all pixel intensities to a unified disk center equivalent. While the number of applications are broad, we demonstrate how this technique is very useful for CH detection as it enables the use of a fast and simplified image segmentation algorithm to obtain consistent detection results. The multi-instrument nature of the technique also allows one to track evolving features consistently for longer periods than is possible with a single instrument, and preliminary results quantifying CH area and shape evolution are shown.\nMost importantly, several data and software products are made available to the community for use. For the ~4 year period of 6/10/2010 to 8/18/2014, we provide synchronic EUV and coronal hole maps at 6-hour cadence as well as the data-derived limb brightening and inter-instrument correction factors that we applied. We also make available a ready-to-use MATLAB script EUV2CHM used to generate the maps, which loads EUV images, applies our preprocessing steps, and then uses our GPU-accelerated/CPU-multithreaded segmentation algorithm EZSEG to detect coronal holes.",

            "abstract": "The variability in outlet glacier termini positions is an important indicator of overall glacier health and the net effects of ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. Glacier margins fluctuate on both seasonal and interannual time scales and satellite imagery provides a critical spatially- and temporally-extensive resource for monitoring glacier behavior. Outlet glaciers have generally been retreating globally over recent decades, but the magnitude of seasonal variation, overall retreat, and foremost drivers have proven unique to each glacier. The outlet glaciers in central West Greenland are generally experiencing the same regional atmospheric forcing, yet previous studies have shown varying magnitudes of retreat over the last forty years. In this study, we utilize Landsat imagery between the years 1985 and 2014 to digitize a time series of glacier front positions of 18 marine-terminating outlet glaciers in the Disko and Uummannaq Bay regions of West Greenland. We examine potential drivers of trends in outlet glacier retreat through satellite observations of adjacent sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures. Additionally, reanalysis data and long-term automatic weather station measurements are investigated to contextualize the role of atmospheric drivers at both a regional and local scale. Results indicate retreat of all glaciers in the region over the study period and no indication of a south to north trend in magnitude of retreat on either a seasonal or long-term scale. The 11 glaciers in Uummannaq Bay retreated between 25 m and 3.5 km, an average of 1.22 ± 1.20 km over the entire study period. The retreat of 7 glaciers in Disko Bay ranged from 181 m to 2.3 km, an average of 1.0 ± 0.78 km over the period. Although the mean terminus retreat rate between the two bays is comparable, there remains a wide range of total retreat amounts among the glaciers. We investigate the degree of seasonal variation in terminus position as an indicator of longer-term trends in glacier behavior. Furthermore, a longer duration of sea ice presence within individual fjords may delay the initiation of terminus retreat in the spring. These findings underscore the importance of individual fjord geometries, as well as local-scale atmospheric and oceanographic forcings in modulating glacier retreat patterns across West Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Intensified groundwater irrigation is a major factor that contributes to water table decline. This phenomenon has been documented in many parts of the world. This study investigates trends in water table in response to agriculture intensification to meet increasing food demand, water management practices and climate change. A shallow-aquifer model based on the extended Thornthwaite-Mather procedure is used to predict groundwater levels in response to precipitation, evapotranspiration, and groundwater pumping for irrigation. Krishna district in the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India which has a sub-humid, monsoon climate and Calicut district of Kerala state with a wet tropical monsoon climate have been chosen as sites for this study. The effect of increasing food demand by a growing population is investigated by increasing the number of crops per year from one to three. We consider three climate scenarios and two water management practices in this study. The three climate scenarios are the ones those envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The two water management practices considered are the traditional flooded agriculture and the system of rice intensification method which does not use total flooding. The results show that single crop agriculture in Krishna district is sustainable for all climate scenarios and water management practices with a maximum depth to water table around 6 - 7 m at the end of dry season and the water table recovers to the surface most of the time. Increasing crop production with two or three crops per year with groundwater irrigation is unsustainable with the water table levels dropping potentially to 200 – 1000 m at the end of 21st century. We found that climate change and better irrigation water management practices affected ground water levels only minimally compared to the growing more than one crop per year. Our study leads to the conclusion that ground water irrigated rice can only be sustainable when crop evaporation is less then precipitation and in order to meet increasing food demands the rice yield per unit water should be improved.",

            "abstract": "Each of the dramatic global warmings that ended the Pleistocene ice ages began with an interruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). These AMOC interruptions have been invoked to explain the observed deglacial ‘bipolar seesaw’, whereby the northern hemisphere was relatively cool at times when the southern hemisphere was relatively warm, and it is also suspected that the AMOC interruptions contributed to the outgassing of CO2 from the ocean. Here, we use an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that, in addition to the previously-established bipolar seesaw and CO2 effects, an interruption of the AMOC causes the global climate to warm, through a direct physical mechanism. Reduced overturning causes both the absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation to decrease, but with a larger effect for the latter. The result is a positive radiative imbalance of 0.3 - 1 W m-2 that is accommodated by heat accumulation in the subsurface ocean. A gradual retreat of Southern Ocean sea ice increases shortwave absorption, counteracting the increased outgoing longwave radiation that arises from southern hemisphere warming, and maintaining a significant positive radiative imbalance on a millennial timescale. These results suggest that the direct radiative impact of AMOC disruptions was a previously unrecognized, but critical ingredient in tipping the planet out of a stable glacial state.",

            "abstract": "In practical terms, strategic planning for the nation’s economic, social and environmental future increasingly centers on issues relating to fresh water. U.S. energy security is highly dependent on electricity generated by the nation’s fleet of thermoelectric power stations, which today contribute 90% to total electricity production. This presentation summarizes the overall structure and recent progress on a study devoted to climate adaptation and the reliability of power sector infrastructure and operations, when viewed through the lens of strategic water issues. The focus is on electric power infrastructure, i.e., the types, spatial distributions and levels of investment in technologies that deliver or could deliver electricity to the U.S. economy. The work is guided by a central hypothesis, that today’s portfolio of electric power sector infrastructure is unsustainable in the context of satisfying its water needs under anticipated climate change and rising electricity demands. Insofar as water-mediated feedbacks reverberate throughout the national economy, we include macro-economic perspectives as well. The work is organized around the technical development of the NEWS framework which is then used to evaluate, in the context of anticipated climate, economic change and regulatory context: the performance of the nation’s electricity sector, the feasibility of alternative pathways to improve climate adaptation, and impacts of energy technology. Scenarios are co-designed with a stakeholder community, and investment tradeoffs are considered with respect to the productivity of the economy, water availability and aquatic ecosystem condition.\n\n ",

            "abstract": "Arctic aerosol have a strong annual cycle, with winter months dominated by long range transport from lower latitudes resulting in high mass loadings. Conversely, local emissions are more prominent in the summer months because of the decreased influence of transported aerosol, allowing us to regularly observe both transported and local aerosol. This study will present observations of aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution collected at the Polar Environment Artic Research Laboratory and the Alert Global Atmospheric Watch Observatory at Eureka (80N, 86W) and Alert (82N, 62W), Nunavut, respectively. Summer time observations of the number size distribution reveal a persistent mode of particles centered between 30-50 nm, with occasional bursts of smaller particles. The non-refractory aerosol chemical composition, measured by the Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer, is primarily organic, with contributions from both aged and fresher organic aerosol. Factor analysis will be conducted to better understand these sources. The site at Eureka is more susceptible to long range transport since it is at the top of a mountain ridge (610 m above sea level) and will be compared to the site at Alert on an elevated plain (200 m above sea level). This will allow us to determine the relative contributions from processes and sources at the sites at different elevations. Comparisons with aerosol optical depth and GEOS-Chem model output will also be presented to put these surface measurements into context with the overlying and regional atmosphere. Results from this study contribute to our knowledge of aerosol in the high Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Traditional models for the subglacial drainage of ice-dammed lakes in temperate environments invoke a channel eroded into the deformable ice above the bed. In Antarctica, however, modelling studies imply that conditions are more favourable to the drainage of water through channels eroded into the underlying sediments or till, commonly referred to as “canals”. We have developed a model for the discharge of “active” subglacial lakes in Antarctica employing drainage through canals and tested its predictions for ice surface drawdown and rate of outflow against satellite- and ground-based observations. Our modeled outflow from a lake begins as a distributed flow, which evolves to incise a channel into the sediment as outflow rates increase. With further erosion, the canal aperture increases and soon quickly become the dominant flow mechanism, pulling water away from the distributed system. Lower pressure within the canal allows the lake to drain to levels below that necessary to initiate outflow, but also allows the sediment to flow into the canal. This deformational closure of the canal typically, ends lake drainage before all water is evacuated. The observed ice speedups associated with lake drainage appear to correlate not with peak total outflow, but with the peak in distributed outflow that before an effective channel is incised. Peak channelized flow reduces water pressure leading to a net slowdown relative to a steady-state distributed drainage. Although sensitivity studies indicate that rate of channel grown and contraction are highly dependent on relatively unconstrained sediment properties (e.g. grain size, porosity), the total drawdown and peak outflow rates for nearly every active lake identified in Antarctica so far all fall within 2 orders of magnitude of one another. The small spread of observations compared to the parameter space of the sensitivity study may indicate either that there is a feedback mechanism for maintaining optimal sediment properties, or that lake drainage as inferred is indicative of a specific type of subglacial environment. We explore how these findings apply a number of lake districts throughout Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of boron (δ11B) in marine carbonates is well established as a proxy for past ocean pH. Yet, before palaeoceanographic interpretation can be made, rigorous assessment of analytical uncertainty of δ11B data is required; particularly in light of recent interlaboratory comparison studies that reported significant measurement disagreement between laboratories [\n1\n]. Well characterised boron standard reference materials (SRMs) in a carbonate matrix are needed to assess the accuracy and precision of carbonate δ11B measurements throughout the entire procedural chemistry; from sample cleaning, to ionic separation of boron from the carbonate matrix, and final δ11B measurement by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. To date only two carbonate reference materials exist that have been value-assigned by the boron isotope measurement community [\n2\n]; JCp-1 (porites coral) and JCt-1 (Giant Clam) [\n3\n]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will supplement these existing standards with new solution based inorganic carbonate boron SRMs that replicate typical foraminiferal and coral B/Ca ratios and δ11B values. These new SRMs will not only ensure quality control of full procedural chemistry between laboratories, but have the added benefits of being both in abundant supply and free from any restrictions associated with shipment of biogenic samples derived from protected species. Here we present in-house δ11B measurements of these new boron carbonate SRM solutions. These preliminary data will feed into an interlaboratory comparison study to establish certified values for these new NIST SRMs.\n1. Foster, G.L., et al., Chemical Geology, 2013. 358(0): p. 1-14.\n2.

            "abstract": "We used gravity and magnetic data to examine the thermal and crustal structure beneath the Luangwa Rift Valley (LRV) in Zambia in order to examine the geodynamic controls of its formation.. The LRV lies at the boundary between the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic Irumide and Southern Irumide orogenic belts between the Zimbabwe craton and the Bangwelu Block. We computed the Curie Point Depth (CPD) using two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum analysis of the aeromagnetic data, and these results were used to estimate heat flow beneath the LRV. We also inverted the aeromagnetic data for three-dimensional (3D) magnetic susceptibility distribution. We further determined the depths to the Moho using 2D power spectrum analysis of the satellite gravity data and 2D forward modeling of the terrestrial gravity data. We found that: (1) there is no consistent pattern of elevated CPD beneath the LRV, and as such no consistent pattern of elevated heat flow anomaly, (2) there are numerous 5-15 km wide magnetic bodies at shallow depth (5-20 km) beneath the LRV and the 2D forward gravity modeling suggests these to be dense intrusive bodies, (3) a thick crust (49-52 km) underlies the northwestern margin of the rift centered beneath the ~ 1 km high Muchinga escarpment which represents the main border fault of the LRV. This thick crust contrasts with the thinner crust (35-45 km) outside the rift, and (4) the thickened crust coincides with a NE-SE elongated belt of 1.05-1.0 Ga granitoids previously interpreted as manifestations of the metacratonization of the southeastern edge of the Bangweulu Block. Our 2D forward gravity model suggests that the thickened crust is due to the presence of possibly Karoo-aged magmatic under-plated mafic body (UPMB) whose thermal anomaly has since decayed. We suggest that the initiation of the LRV was associated with this deep magmatic activity that introduced rheological weaknesses that facilitated strain localization although it never breached the surface. It is also possible that metacratonization of the southeastern edge of the Bangwelu cratonic block might have facilitated the localization of the UPMB emplacement. New passive seismic and magnetotelluric data acquired as part of the NSF-funded PRIDE experiment will likely contribute to testing the validity of our interpretations.",

Developing this connectedness will help understand key vulnerabilities and improve adaptive capacity important for ecosystem sustainability. BMPs are practical management practices or systems designed and installed in watersheds to provide a wide range of effects to protect or restore the physical, chemical, and biological condition of waterbodies (e.g. changing hydrology; improving vegetative habitat; mitigate adverse environmental change). VAs can be defined as “the degree to which the system is susceptible to and is unable to cope with adverse effects of change” and are often characterized as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity.\nThere are many variables and factors used in calculating the impact of BMPs and VAs. The event mean concentration or load (e.g. nutrient, sediment,) associated with the specific landuse is an important variable. There is much data that predicts the loads associated with the major landuses (urban, agricultural). Loads greatly vary with region; rainfall characteristics (e.g. rainfall intensity, rainfall frequency); soil characteristics (e.g. soil type, hydrologic soil groups); hydrologic characteristics (e.g. runoff potential). A concern also exists that possibly all of the variables associated with changes in an individual land use have not been identified and distinguished for their impact on land use. For example, the loads associated with a high density residential with much green space may be more similar to medium density than loads associated with high rise apartment buildings. Other factors may include age of construction, % of families with children, % of families with pets, level of transiency, and construction activity\nThe objective of our study is to develop an initial framework using multiple variables and factors to represent the connectedness between BMPs and VA in a changing landuse. In future we plan to develop this framework to be better suited across multiple regions and environmental change scenarios. We believe this would lead to improved selection of appropriate landuse load and reasonable load reduction range associated with a variety of BMPs.",

We propose to measure horizontal seafloor displacements using raw sidescan data from repeated multibeam surveys. We grid the data in a natural range and azimuth coordinate frame, and estimate displacement from the peak offset of their normalized cross correlation. This method allows us to obtain sub-pixel accuracy in our displacement calculation as it involves averaging the data over a wide area. Our overall objective is to establish the accuracy of this method and determine how it depends on factors such as: ship speed, repeat track separation, seafloor characteristics, sound speed variations, and ping orientation. We analyze sidescan data archived at the NGDC database that vary over these parameters, finding that under optimal conditions we may obtain decimeter to meter level precision in the range direction and meter level precision in the azimuthal direction. The most important parameter is the ping orientation because small (~2-3 degrees) variations can drastically lower the maximum correlation value. Differing ship speed can cause large reductions in the correlation accuracy, although these effects are more pronounced in the azimuthal direction. Surprisingly, variations in sound speed are partially mitigated by data averaging over both sides of the ship. In addition, the characteristics of the seafloor seem to have minimal influence over the displacement accuracy.",

The program recruited 32 students over 3 years, developed an innovative field course, provided tutoring and mentoring programs, and offered research assistantships for students to work with the research university faculty on funded projects. Under-represented students were 66% of the group. The data was gathered via a web-based survey from April 2nd to April 17th, 2015, using both open ended and item-level responses. Out of 32 participants, the response rate was a significant 50%.\nSome of the survey results include: 1) Most students heard about the program from faulty who recruited them in introductory level classes; 2) Almost all agreed that the geosciences were interesting, fun, important and a good career path; 3) 92% of the community college respondents found transferring to a research university somewhat or not too difficult; 4) The most helpful parts of the program included faculty mentors, the field course, research assistant experiences and relationships with faculty. The least helpful parts included the tutoring services, relationships with other students, and the semester kickoff meetings; 5) over 60% of the students felt very confident in research skills, formulating research questions, lab skills, quantitative skills, time management, collaborating and working independently. They were less confident in planning research, graphing results, writing papers and making oral presentations; 6) most found the faculty very helpful in advising and mentoring, and 86% said they were comfortable asking at least one faculty member for a reference letter; 7) 93% said they were likely to pursue a geoscience career and 86% were confident or somewhat confident they would be successful.",

Due to the complexity of solving the radiative transfer equation, simulating solar radiation under cloudy conditions can be extremely time consuming though many approximations, e.g. two-stream approach and delta-M truncation scheme, have been utilized. To provide a new option to approximate solar radiation, we developed a Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications (FARMS) using simulated cloud transmittance and reflectance from 16-stream RRTM model runs. The solar irradiances at the land surface were simulated by combining parameterized cloud properties with a fast clear-sky radiative transfer model. Using solar radiation measurements from the US Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) central facility in Oklahoma as a benchmark against the model simulations, we were able to demonstrate that the accuracy of FARMS was comparable to the two-stream approach. However, FARMS is much more efficient since it does not explicitly solve the radiative transfer equation for each individual cloud condition. We further explored the use of FARMS to promote solar resource assessment and forecasting research through the increased ability to accommodate higher spatial and temporal resolution calculations for the next generation of satellite and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.",

            "abstract": "We generate model bathymetry and free-air gravity grids for the seafloor seaward of subduction zones that capture the broad trends of deformation due to lithospheric flexure. By using a thin elastic plate formulation with rigidity variations along both horizontal dimensions and which accounts for the effects of plastic yielding, our models are able to reproduce the observed rapid change in curvature at the outer trench wall. Forward models for flexural deflection and plate rigidity are fitted to satellite altimetry-derived marine gravity anomalies jointly with shipboard sonar soundings and swath bathymetry data sets. The estimated parameters are the applied vertical shear and bending moment at the trench axis, and the data misfits are minimized with respect to the L1-norm subject to Tikhonov regularization for smooth variation of the load parameters along the strike of the trench. We perform pre-processing of the input data to enhance the recovery of the flexural signal. Short-wavelength features such as seamounts are isolated using a directional median filter and then excluded from the parameter estimation process. The advantage of adopting anisotropic filtering over similar methods that separate local scale topography from regional swells is that it provides consistent performance in feature detection with minimal user supervision. Our preliminary results from several examples show that the plate rigidity progressively decreases with increasing proximity to the trench axis. These zones of plate weakening correspond to the occurrence of trench-parallel seafloor fractures at the outer trench wall as seen in high-resolution bathymetry data. We seek to determine whether a correlation exists between the distribution or morphology of these fractures and the amount or trend in the reduction of plate rigidity for outer rise regions across the Pacific Rim.",

            "abstract": "Beginning with the opening of a summit vent in 2008, Kilauea’s (Hawaiʻi) summit eruption has exhibited frequent rockfalls from the crater walls into the active lava lake. These events perturb the lake surface, causing vigorous outgassing and sometimes explosions. A network of broadband seismometers records these events as a combination of high-frequency, long-period, and very long period (VLP) oscillations. The VLP portion of the signal has varied in period from 20-40 s since the summit vent opened and has a duration of 10-15 min. These seismic signals reflect the coupling of fluid motion in the conduit to elastic wall rocks. Oscillatory flow can be quantified in terms of the eigenmodes of a magma-filled conduit. Wave motion is affected by conduit geometry, multiphase fluid compressibility, viscosity, and pressure dependent H2O and CO2 solubility. Background stratification and a large impedance contrast at the depth where volatiles first exsolve gives rise to spatially localized families of conduit eigenmodes. The longest period modes are sensitive to properties of bubbly magma and to the length of the conduit above exsolution (which is set by total volatile content).\nTo study the VLP events, we linearize the conduit flow equations assuming small perturbations to an initially magmastatic column, accounting for non-equilibrium multiphase fluid properties, stratification and buoyancy, and conduit width changes. We solve for conduit eigenmodes and associated eigenfrequencies, as well as for the time-domain conduit response to forces applied to the surface of the lava lake. We use broadband records of rockfalls from 2011-2015 that exhibit consistent periods along with lake level measurements to estimate conduit parameters. Preliminary results suggest that VLP periods can be matched with volatile contents similar to those inferred from melt inclusions from Halemaumau explosions. We are currently conducting a more thorough exploration of the parameter space to investigate this further.",

While much has been discovered about the Pluto system since New Horizons launch in 2006, the system has never been imaged at high resolution and anticipation of the “First Light” of the Pluto system had been anticipated by planetary enthusiasts for decades. The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), which built and operates New Horizons, was the focal point for gathering three distinct groups: science and engineering team members; media and public affairs representatives; and invited public, including VIP’s. Guest operations activities were focused on providing information primarily to the invited public and VIP’s. High level objectives for the Guest Operations team was set to entertain and inform the general public, offer media reaction shots, and to deconflict activities for the guests from media activities wherever possible.\nOver 2000 people arrived at APL in the days surrounding closest approach for guest, science or media operations tracks. Reaction and coverage of the Guest Operations events was universally positive and global in impact: iconic pictures of the auditorium waving flags during the moment of closest approach were published in media outlets on every continent. Media relations activities ensured coverage in all key media publications targeted for release, such as the New York Times, Science, Le Monde, and Nature. Social and traditional media coverage of the events spanned the globe. Guest operations activities are designed to ensure that a guest has a memorable experience and leaves with a lifelong memory of the mission and their partnership in the activity. Results, lessons learned, and other data from the New Horizons guest operations activity will be presented and analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Calving is a process that glacier loses its mass by full-thickness penetration of crevasses (i.e. rifting), followed by separation of iceberg from the terminus. Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in West Antarctica has undergone several major calving events including those in 2001, 2007 and 2013. All of them have started from rifting at its shear margin, growing toward the center of the ice shelf, and finally reaching the margin at the other end.\nHowever, recent observation of PIG from remote sensing data affirms unprecedented pattern of rifting, that the rifts start to grow at the center of the ice shelf and expanding to the each ends of the shear margin. Moreover, this evolution was accompanied with incessant disintegration of ice melange (mixture of small icebergs and sea ice) filling the shear margin around the terminus. We found from Landsat 8 images that those rifts start from the troughs transverse to the ice shelf, which are surface features of basal crevasses (i.e. cracks at the bottom of ice shelf). We also analyzed velocity fields of PIG’s flow and confirmed that its change is consistent with the rifting and melange loss. We postulate this rifting event attributes to the associated effects of reduced resistant force by melange disintegration, and expedited erosion of basal crevasses that causes the tensile stress to concentrate. As both of them are closely related to ocean forcing, we also hypothesize that warmer ocean current under the ice shelf has triggered this new mode of rifting and calving event.",

            "abstract": "The Gole Larghe Fault Zone is an exhumed ancient fault zone located in the tonalitic Adamello batholith in the southern Italian Alps. The presence of pseudotachylytes (solidified melt created during rapid frictional sliding) shows that it has been seismically active before exhumation. Previous studies of meso- and microscale fracture densities and orientations showed that the damage structure of the fault zone is highly symmetric with respect to the fault core and that several sub-zones can be distinguished. These structural data are now linked to laboratory measurements of ultrasonic wave velocities and permeabilities on samples taken along a 1.3 km long transect perpendicular to the fault strike to further characterize its damage structure, fluid flow properties, and sealing history. Additionally, we aim to link the various physical properties of the damaged rocks by modeling crack densities, orientations and aspect ratios.\nLaboratory ultrasonic wave velocities and permeabilities correlate systematically with the microfracture density across the Gole Larghe Fault Zone: P-wave velocity is high in the wall rocks, where microfracture density and permeability are low, and low in the damage zone, where microfracture density and permeability are high. In the core zone, microfractures were pervasively sealed by syntectonic mineral precipitation (mainly epidote and K-feldspar), leading to high P-wave velocities and low permeability. The alteration by sealing poses a limitation to the application of the modeled properties: as the model treats rocks with sealed microfractures as intact, the physical properties might be consistently modeled, but they lose their relation to the initial damage state.",

            "abstract": "There is a recent multi-agency push for accurate assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes in the United States. Assessing the state of the carbon cycle in the US requires estimates of stocks and fluxes at large spatial scales. Such assessments are difficult, especially for soil respiration, which dominates ecosystem respiration and is notoriously highly variable over space and time. Here, we report three consecutive years of measurement of soil respiration fluxes in three 1 km2 subalpine forest landscapes: Fraser Experimental Forest (Colorado), Glacier Lakes Ecosystems Experimental Site (“GLEES”, Wyoming), and Niwot Ridge (Colorado). Plots were established following the protocol of the US Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. Clusters of plots were distributed across the landscape in a 0.25 km grid pattern. From 2004 through 2006, measurements of soil respiration were made once monthly during the growing season and twice during snowpack coverage for each year. Annual cumulative soil respiration was 6.10 (+/- 0.21) Mg ha-1y-1 for Fraser, 6.55 (+/- 0.27) Mg ha-1y-1 for GLEES, and 6.97 (+/- 0.20) Mg ha-1y-1 for Niwot. Variability in annual cumulative soil respiration varied by less than 20% among the three subalpine forests, despite differences in terrain, climate, disturbance history and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. We quantified the relationship between respiration fluxes and commonly-measured forest properties and found that soil respiration was nonlinearly related to leaf area index, peaking around 2.5 m2m-2 then slowly declining. Annual litterfall (FA) was subtracted from soil respiration (FR) to calculate total belowground carbon flux (TBCF), which declined with increasing tree height, density and soil nitrogen. This landscape analysis of soil respiration confirmed experimentally-derived principles governing carbon fluxes in forests: as trees age and get taller, and in high-fertility areas, carbon flux to roots declines. In addition, this work suggests that 1) soil respiration may be partially predicted from either FIA data or remotely-sensed products of forest structure, improving the accuracy of large-scale regional C assessments, and 2) soil respiration estimates may be improved by considering spatial variability in soil nitrogen.",

The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) mission effectively provides high-resolution spatial and temporal measurements of the radial current during magnetic storms. These in situ measurements are complementary to magnetic remote sensing from the ground using magnetometer arrays. Here we examine two storms, on May 29, 2010 and August 5, 2011, using AMPERE and solar wind data. We identify the regions whose radial current density has the greatest correlation with solar wind coupling functions and individual magnetic and plasma variables. We develop a statistical model of the radial current density from the magnetospheric and solar wind data which is then used to represent regions of outflowing and inflowing current in the two hemispheres. While the model is limited in representing high spatial resolution, time series of regional and global field-aligned current are reproduced with relatively large correlation coefficients (0.70-0.90) in each event.",

            "abstract": "One of the largest historic earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest occurred on 15 December 1872 (M6.5-7) near the south end of Lake Chelan in north-central Washington State. Lack of recognized surface deformation suggested that the earthquake occurred on a blind, perhaps deep, fault. New LiDAR data show landslides and a ~6 km long, NW-side-up scarp in Spencer Canyon, ~30 km south of Lake Chelan.\nTwo landslides in Spencer Canyon impounded small ponds. An historical account indicated that dead trees were visible in one pond in AD1884. Wood from a snag in the pond yielded a calibrated age of AD1670–1940. Tree ring counts show that the oldest living trees on each landslide are 130 and 128 years old. The larger of the two landslides obliterated the scarp and thus, post-dates the last scarp-forming event.\nTwo trenches across the scarp exposed a NW-dipping thrust fault. One trench exposed alluvial fan deposits, Mazama ash, and scarp colluvium cut by a single thrust fault. Three charcoal samples from a colluvium buried during the last fault displacement had calibrated ages between AD1680 and AD1940. The second trench exposed gneiss thrust over colluvium during at least two, and possibly three fault displacements. The younger of two charcoal samples collected from a colluvium below gneiss had a calibrated age of AD1665– AD1905. For an historical constraint, we assume that the lack of felt reports for large earthquakes in the period between 1872 and today indicates that no large earthquakes capable of rupturing the ground surface occurred in the region after the 1872 earthquake; thus the last displacement on the Spencer Canyon scarp cannot post-date the 1872 earthquake. Modeling of the age data suggests that the last displacement occurred between AD1840 and AD1890. These data, combined with the historical record, indicate that this fault is the source of the 1872 earthquake. Analyses of aeromagnetic data reveal lithologic contacts beneath the scarp that form an ENE-striking, curvilinear zone ~2.5 km wide and ~55 km long. This zone coincides with monoclines mapped in Mesozoic bedrock and Miocene flood basalts. This study ends uncertainty regarding the source of the 1872 earthquake and provides important information for seismic hazard analyses of major infrastructure projects in Washington and British Columbia.",

            "abstract": "During three decades of research on sand bars and sediment transport in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, we have collected unprecedented quantities of data on bar morphology, sedimentary structures, grain size of sand on the riverbed (~40,000 measurements), grain size of sand in flood deposits (dozens of vertical grain-size profiles), and time series of suspended sediment concentration and grain size (more than 3 million measurements using acoustic and laser-diffraction instruments sampling every 15 minutes at several locations). These data, which include measurements of flow and suspended sediment as well as sediment within the deposits, show that grain size within flood deposits generally coarsens or fines proportionally to the grain size of sediment that was in suspension when the beds were deposited. The inverse problem of calculating changing flow conditions from a vertical profile of grain size within a deposit is difficult because at least two processes can cause similar changes. For example, upward coarsening in a deposit can result from either an increase in discharge of the flow (causing coarser sand to be transported to the depositional site), or from winnowing of the upstream supply of sand (causing suspended sand to coarsen because a greater proportion of the bed that is supplying sediment is covered with coarse grains). These two processes can be easy to distinguish where suspended-sediment observations are available: flow-regulated changes cause concentration and grain size of sand in suspension to be positively correlated, whereas changes in supply can cause concentration and grain size of sand in suspension to be negatively correlated. The latter case (supply regulation) is more typical of flood deposits in Grand Canyon.",

This CO2(υ2)-O quenching rate coefficient is poorly understood and current estimates vary by a factor 3-4, with a significant discrepancy between laboratory measurements and those provided by satellite remote sensing. However, the true value of this rate coefficient is of vital importance in understanding both the energetics of the MLT region and for temperatures retrievals from measurements of I15μm.\nThis work builds upon and extends an existing methodology developed by Feofilov et al. (2012) who used TIMED/SABER satellite instrument data to retrieve the CO2(υ2)-O quenching rate coefficient using a synergy of atmospheric and ground-based lidar temperature measurements. Using the SABER overflights of the Fort Collins (CO) lidar, these authors derived the altitude variation of the CO2(υ2)-O quenching rate. The latter demonstrated deficiency of the current non-LTE model of the 15 μm CO2 emission which obviously misses some so far unknown mechanisms of non-thermal excitation of the CO2(υ2) vibrations. Current work involves several other lidar locations and is aimed at assessing whether there is a spatio-temporal variability component to this rate coefficient, and what this could reveal about these additional energy sources and sinks in the real atmosphere that are currently not accounted for in the non-LTE model.",

While ultimately anthropogenic forcings may be brought under control, it is still unclear whether tipping points may exist beyond which human-induced changes to biogeochemical cycles become irreversible. We use the Late Cretaceous and the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary interval as an informative case study. Over this interval, two carbon cycle perturbations (gradual flood basalt volcanism and abrupt bolide impact) occurred within a short time window, allowing us to investigate the resilience of biogeochemical cycles to different pressures applied to the same initial boundary conditions on very different time scales. We demonstrate that relatively gradual emission of CO2 from the Deccan large igneous province was efficiently mitigated within the limits of existing biogeochemical processes. However, the rapid extinction of pelagic calcifying organisms at the K-Pg boundary due to the Chicxulub bolide impact had more profound effects, and caused lasting (> 1 million years) changes to biogeochemical cycles. By combining sedimentological observations with boron isotope-based pH reconstructions over these events, we document two potentially useful partial analogues for best and worst case scenarios for anthropogenic global change. We suggest that if current ocean acidification results in the mass extinction of marine pelagic calcifiers, we may cause profound changes to the Earth system that will persist for 100,000s to millions of years.",

While the latter is an essential predictor of power output, it is widely accepted that wind speed information in other parts of the vertical profile, as well as additional atmospheric variables including atmospheric stability, wind veer, and hub-height turbulence are also important factors. The goal of this work is to determine the gain in predictive ability afforded by adding additional atmospheric measurements to the power prediction model. In particular, we are interested in quantifying any gain in predictive ability afforded by measurements taken from a laser detection and ranging (lidar) instrument, as lidar provides high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of wind speed and direction at 10 or more levels throughout the rotor-disk and at heights well above. Co-located lidar and meteorological tower data as well as SCADA power data from a wind farm in Northern Oklahoma will be used to train a set of statistical models. In practice, most wind farms continue to rely on atmospheric measurements taken from less expensive, in situ instruments mounted on meteorological towers to assess turbine power response to a changing atmospheric environment. Here, we compare a large suite of atmospheric variables derived from tower measurements to those taken from lidar to determine if remote sensing devices add any competitive advantage over tower measurements alone to predict turbine power response.",

            "abstract": "Northeastern North America is often affected by freezing rain events during the cold season. They can have significant consequences (from road accidents, to severe power outages) despite their intensity and duration. The 1998 Ice Storm over Eastern Canada and Northeastern United States is an example of an extreme event with catastrophic consequences. A total of up to 150 mm of ice accumulated during 10 days were observed in some areas. This natural disaster has highlighted the need to better understand how such phenomena will evolve with future climate scenario. The goal is to investigate the feasibility of using regional climate modeling to diagnose the occurrence of freezing rain events over Quebec (Canada). To address this issue, we used the 5th generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), from 1979 to 2014. An empirical method (Bourgouin, 2000) developed to determine the type of winter precipitations was chosen to diagnose freezing rain events. The study focused in the Montreal area and the St. Lawrence River Valley (Quebec, Canada). The sensitivity of the model to horizontal resolution was explored by using three resolutions: 0.44°, 0.22° and 0.11°. In general, freezing rain was diagnosed consistently at all resolutions but the higher one (0.11°) produced more realistic results due to a better representation of the orography. Using the higher resolution, the results showed that the climatology of the freezing rain occurrence in the Montreal area is comparable to available observations. It also suggested that the role of the specific orography of the region with the St. Lawrence River Valley can impact the characteristics of freezing rain events in this area. Overall, this study will contribute to a better preparedness for such events in the future. High resolution regional climate simulations are essential to improve the reproduction of local scale orographically-forced phenomena.",

While the precipitating electrons span a wide range of energies, there is increasing evidence that the shape of the PPA patches is somehow controlled by structures in the near-equatorial cold plasma. One consequence of this is that PPA patches appear to move with convection. Given the tremendous (and rapidly increasing) amount of auroral image data from which the velocity of these patches can be inferred, it is timely to develop and implement techniques for automatic identification of PPA events in these data, and for automatic determination of the velocity of individual patches from that data. As a first step towards this, we have implemented an automatic technique for determining patch velocities from sequences of THEMIS All-Sky Imager (ASI) images, and applied it to a large number of PPA events. Here we demonstrate the use of this technique and present initial results including 2D ionospheric convection maps inferred from PPA data for different levels of magnetic activity. We discuss implications of this technique for remote sensing convection in the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015 Sapling Defoliation Poster1.pdf\nThe availability of soil nutrients limits productivity and influences tree species distribution in tropical forests. Given the scarcity of soil resources, trees in tropical forests should be under selection to store nutrients for periods when nutrient demand exceeds supply. However, little is known about the capacity of trees to remobilize nutrients from long-lived woody biomass in tropical forests, despite wood sequestering a large proportion of bioavailable nutrients in tropical ecosystems. We evaluated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) remobilization from woody biomass via experimental defoliation of saplings from four widely distributed genera of tropical trees in Panama. Focal saplings were sampled in high and low fertility habitats in both montane and lowland forests to maximize contrast in the availability and identity of limiting nutrients. N and P concentrations of stem wood were measured before defoliation and after subsequent re-foliation response to calculate wood remobilization efficiency. Initial wood P concentrations differed significantly within taxa between low and high fertility habitats, whereas initial wood N differed significantly within taxa between lowland and montane forests, but not among soil fertility habitats. In three of four genera studied, wood P concentrations declined after refoliation at both elevations, and the proportion of wood P remobilized was greater on low fertility compared to high fertility sites. In contrast, significant N remobilization was restricted to the low fertility montane site, where nitrogen is most likely to limit plant growth. These findings provide evidence that a significant fraction of N and P in woody biomass is can be remobilized in response to asymmetry in nutrient supply and demand, as opposed consisting primarily of recalcitrant structural material. Furthermore, variation in remobilization responses of species to defoliation provides additional evidence that multiple nutrient-limitation in tropical forests may be driven by functional differences among tree taxa in resource acquisition and allocation.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstructions have provided little consensus on how continental temperatures in Eastern Beringia changed from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Reconstructions show regional differences in LGM severity, the timing of deglacial warming, and Holocene temperature variability. Currently, arctic temperatures are increasing at the fastest rates on the planet, highlighting the need to identify the sensitivities of arctic systems to various climate forcings. This cannot be done without resolving the complex climate history of Eastern Beringia.\nHere, we present two new organic geochemical temperature reconstructions from Lake E5, north central Alaska that span the LGM, last glacial termination and Holocene. The proxies (alkenones and brGDGTs) record seasonally distinct temperatures, allowing for the attribution of different forcings to each proxy. The alkenone-based UK37 reconstruction records spring/early summer lake temperatures and indicates a 4 oC abrupt warming at 13.1 ka and a relatively warm late Holocene, which peaks at 2.4 ka and exhibits a cooling trend from 2.4 to 0.1 ka. The brGDGT reconstruction is calibrated to mean annual air temperature and interpreted here as exhibiting a strong warm season bias. BrGDGTs show an abrupt 4.5 oC warming at 14 ka, and show evidence for an early Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), which cools by 3 oC after 8.4 ka.\nBecause UK37 temperatures do not exhibit an early HTM, we hypothesize that summer insolation had a minimal effect on spring/early summer lake temperatures. Instead, the UK37 reconstruction agrees with sea ice and sea surface temperature reconstructions from the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and northeast Pacific Ocean. We hypothesize that forcings associated with sea ice concentration and changes in atmospheric circulation had stronger affects on spring/early summer lake temperatures and we present modern observational data in support of this hypothesis. By contrast, the summer-biased brGDGT reconstruction suggests a strong and relatively direct temperature response to summer insolation forcing. Together, these records suggest that both internal and external forcings significantly affected LGM to present temperature variability in Eastern Beringia, with different seasonal biases.",

Standard metrics of success for these programs include number of publications, number of users of the data, and number of citations to the program. However, these metrics do not necessarily reflect the scientific value of the program, for example, what new scientific knowledge has been developed. We began to carefully consider how one does establish the scientific value of such programs. We thought that establishing the scientific value of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) would be a good way to examine this issue. We present in this paper our assessment of the value of the climate science research produced through the program. These studies include articles that evaluate the current climates of the NARCCAP simulations, analyze the future climate projections, explore temperature and precipitation extremes and apply new statistical techniques to the analyses. A number of articles apply weighting techniques to the ensemble and quantify the uncertainty represented by the ensemble. Of particular interest is determining what we have learned about future climate projections based on the use of higher resolution dynamically generated future climate information. We will evaluate all research articles and major reports (aside from those regarding impacts) that used the NARCCAP database, and we will assess the major research advances indicated in this literature.",

            "abstract": "The Jack Hills (JH) belt of Western Australia has tremendous potential for increasing our understanding of the ancient geomagnetic field through application of the single silicate crystal paleointensity (SCP) method (e.g. Tarduno et al., 2006). We have recently reported SCP data from JH zircons (Tarduno et al., 2013, 2015) that suggest the presence of a core dynamo > 750 million years earlier than prior estimates (to as old as 4.2 Ga). Here we elaborate on these measurements with an emphasis on our microconglomerate test. The JH belt has been metamorphosed to at least 475 °C, but the interiors of some cobble-sized clasts preserve regions with a magnetite-dominated magnetization that passes a conglomerate test after demagnetization to temperatures of 550 °C (Tarduno and Cottrell, 2013). High unblocking temperature components of magnetization are also suggested in the data of Weiss et al. (2015), but these data are extremely noisy. This leads us to believe that the Weiss et al. (2015) data lack the resolution to examine Paleoarchean to Hadean magnetizations. Locally, components of the JH sediments have the potential to preserve high unblocking temperature magnetizations that can be characterized with the SCP method. As a further step to assess the ancient recording fidelity of the JH meta-conglomerates, we have conducted a micro-conglomerate test on oriented small (~500 to 800 μm) samples, each centered on a single large (200-300 μm) zircon. We use an ultra-high resolution 3-component DC SQUID magnetometer that affords an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than other high-resolution SQUID rock magnetometers. Thermal demagnetization using a CO2 laser shows unblocking between 565 and 580 °C consistent with a magnetite carrier. The characteristic magnetization directions are well defined but together cannot be distinguished from those drawn from a random distribution. Importantly, this positive micro-conglomerate test also addresses the debate over the primary nature of inclusions within JH zircons. We will also discuss our ongoing efforts to further define the geodynamo history as recorded by JH zircons.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that earthquakes and tsunamis couple energy into the dynamically fluid atmosphere. This energy can propagate up to the ionosphere where we can observe perturbations in the total-electron content (TEC) signals measured by global navigation space systems (GNSS). Recent emphasis has been placed on using these new observables to characterize earthquake and tsunami hazards from space, as well as for planetary exploration. Backprojection is an array-based imaging technique used in seismology to characterize the seismic source location, including complex energy release patterns from large earthquakes. Here we present TEC backprojection results from 3 recent earthquakes - 1) 2009 Samoa triggered doublet (Mw 8.1), 2) 2011 Van dip-slip event (Mw 7.1) and 3) 2012 Haida Gwaii strike-slip underthrust event (Mw 7.8). Each of these events presents new obstacles to overcome if backprojection is to be used routinely to monitor hazards from space. We will discuss these obstacles in detail and present approaches to overcome them. For instance, one problem arises from the fact that the observation point is non-stationary in time because the satellites are moving. Another problem stems from the relative geometry of the geomagnetic field and the incoming acoustic wave at the ionosphere. Finally, we present array-based methods to reduce artifacts in the backprojection images, e.g. array deconvolution, and we show that under favorable circumstances, this approach can be used to characterize motion at the Earth surface from space with high temporal and spatial resolution.",

            "abstract": "A promising approach to determining aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests comes through the use of individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) techniques applied to small-footprint LiDAR data. These techniques, when combined with allometric equations, can produce per-tree estimates of AGB. At this scale, AGB estimates can be quantified in a manner similar to how ground-based forest inventories are produced. However, these approaches have significant uncertainties that are rarely described in full. Allometric equations are often based on species-specific diameter-at-breast height (DBH) relationships, but neither DBH nor species can be reliably determined using remote sensing analysis. Furthermore, many approaches to ITCD only delineate trees appearing in the upper canopy so subcanopy trees are often missing from the inventories. In this research, we performed a propagation-of-error analysis to determine the spatially varying uncertainties in AGB estimates at the individual plant and stand level for a large collection of LiDAR acquisitions covering a large portion of California. Furthermore, we determined the relative contribution of various aspects of the analysis towards the uncertainty, including errors in the ITCD results, the allometric equations, the taxonomic designation, and the local biophysical environment. Watershed segmentation was used to obtain the preliminary crown segments. Lidar points within the preliminary segments were extracted to form profiling data of the segments, and then mode detection algorithms were applied to identify the tree number and tree heights within each segment. As part of this analysis, we derived novel “remote sensing aware” allometric equations and their uncertainties based on three-dimensional morphological metrics that can be accurately derived from LiDAR data.",

            "abstract": "A variety of statistical studies have shown that the ionospheric polar potential produced by solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling is linear for weak to moderate solar wind driving, but becomes non-linear during periods of very strong driving. It has been shown that this applies to the two-cell convection potential that develops during southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and also to the reverse convection cells that develop during northward IMF. This has been described as polar potential saturation and it appears to begin when the driving solar wind electric field becomes greater than 3 mV/m. It has also been shown that the summer ionospheric electric field saturates at about the same value (20 mV/m) for both northward or southward IMF. Recent measurements of the high latitude convection on September 12 - 13, 2014 using the Resolute Incoherent Scatter Radar during periods of large northward IMF show ionospheric electric fields varying between 56 mV/m and 156 mV/m within the dayside reverse convection cells. There is no indication of saturation during these periods of very strong driving. A second set of observations during June 22-24, 2015 of a CME interaction with the Earth’s magnetosphere that also produced large northward IMF during the time period when RISR could measure the dayside reverse convection is also investigated. Factors beyond the strength of the driving electric field must play a role in the process that produces polar potential saturation, at least for the case of reverse convection. Results of an investigation of these additional factors will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Processes that drive the propagation of elevated mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have been the topic of a growing body of recent research. Elevated MCSs are responsible for a large percentage of warm season rainfall in the continental United States, and produce flash floods more frequently than other modes of convection. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of MCS propagation is important, since propagation sometimes opposes other environmental forces that influence MCS motion. This leads to nearly stationary MCSs that produce prolific local rainfall totals.\nThe ingredients-based Propagation index (IPI) is introduced in this research. IPI is defined as the normalized product of horizontal warm thermal advection (a proxy for lifting), convective available potential energy (CAPE), and relative humidity. Horizontal plots of IPI are useful in identifying regions of probable convective initiation, including the intersections between potentially unstable flow and outflow boundaries, regions of mesoscale lift along the nose of the low-level jet, convectively induced gravity waves, and frontogenesis. Effective inflow-layer shear vectors are also introduced, and found to be useful for scenarios where IPI does yield predictive insight, such as the traditional “RKW” scenario where the forward propagation of an MCS is driven by thunderstorm outflow.\nIt is argued that horizontal maps of IPI and EILS vectors will contribute significantly to short-term (e.g. 1-2 hr) predictions of the movement of MCSs, and to the subsequent assessment of their potential for flash flood production.",

Although surface temperature is reduced near sunrise and sunset compared to afternoon, THEMIS observations show that there is still sufficient thermal contrast between the surface and atmosphere over a range of latitudes near the sub-solar point to retrieve accurate aerosol optical depth. Because water ice clouds form by condensation, relatively small changes in atmospheric temperature can cause clouds to form or sublimate quickly, and there can be large changes in water ice cloud optical depth over the course of a day. Here we present recent retrievals of water ice aerosol optical depth from THEMIS observations.

Recent projections indicate that sea level could rise globally by more than 1 m by 2100. Potential impacts of SLR in coastal regions are a concern, especially in California which has a ~1,800 km long coastline and where >70% of the population live in coastal counties. However, information on potential impacts of SLR-driven groundwater inundation in California is limited. In this study, we examined potential impacts of SLR-driven groundwater inundation in select low-lying areas of California, including Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon, under +1 m and +2 m SLR scenarios. The results indicate that Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon will be impacted by SLR-driven inundation to different extents. For example, ~15% of present-day dry land in Malibu Lagoon will be inundated with groundwater and the lagoon will be expanded by >100% relative to present-day area under the +2 m SLR scenario. In addition, the area with shallow water table ≤2 m from the ground surface will increase substantially with SLR at Malibu Lagoon. SLR-driven groundwater inundation could be problematic in some low-lying coastal regions. Therefore, improved understanding of potential response of coastal aquifers to SLR could help in preparing for mitigation and adaptation.",

In developing a pan-Arctic perspective on Arctic in-situ temperature variability, several issues must be addressed including accounting for the different lengths of temperature records at different locations when comparing trends, accounting for the steep latitudinal controls on ‘seasonal’ trends, considering the often significant variability between different (sometimes a multitude) of temperature measurements made in the vicinity of a single station, and loss of detail information when data is ingested in a global archives or interpolated into gridded data sets.\nThe International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (www.iasoa.org) is an internationally networked consortium of facilities that measure a wide range of meteorological and climate relevant parameters; temperature is the most fundamental of these parameters. Many of the observatories have the longest temperature records in the Arctic region including Barrow, Alaska (114 years), Tiksi, Russia (83 years), and Eureka, Canada (67 years). Using the IASOA data sets a detailed analysis is presented of temperature trends presented as a function of the beginning date from which the trend is calculated, seasonal trends considered in the context of the extreme Arctic solar ephemeris, and the variability in occurrence of annual extreme temperature events.\nAt the Tiksi observatory, a complete record is available of 3-hourly temperatures 1932 to present that was constructed through digitization of decades of written records. This data set is used to investigate if calculated trends and variabilities are consistent with those calculated from daily minimum and maximum values archived by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information Global Historical Climatology Network (Daily GHCN), Version 3.",

            "abstract": "As New Horizons data is returned, we should consider the possibility that Pluto and Charon went through an intense period of activity following the Charon-forming impact. Our prior work (Barr and Collins 2015) shows that if the deep layer of Pluto’s ice shell is initially warmer than ~200 K after the impact, energy dissipation within Pluto can lead to melting and rapid thinning of the ice shell and tidal stresses can drive tectonics on both bodies.\nHere, we build upon our prior work to simulate the coupled thermal and orbital evolution of the Pluto/Charon system after the Charon-forming impact, taking into account the growth/freezing of an ocean, the onset/cessation of solid-state ice shell convection, and how the changing interior state of Pluto changes the magnitude of tidal deformation and dissipation. We track the heat flow in Pluto as a function of time for a variety of starting conditions after Charon is formed.\nWe find that if Pluto has even a small ocean after Charon forms, the system can readily evolve to its present dual synchronous state. A feedback mechanism exists in which tidal dissipation in the basal ice above the ocean increases its temperature, which in turn leads to faster tidal dissipation. This feedback leads to a heat pulse within Pluto and rapid buildup of tectonic stresses on Pluto and Charon. If Pluto never had any liquid at the base of its ice shell, the tidal dissipation is too small to keep Pluto’s interior warm. Without a starting ocean, it is difficult to start the thermal-orbital feedback process, and difficult for Charon to evolve to its presently observed orbital state within the timespan of solar system history.",

More recently, it has been shown that individual mantle plumes show variable and independent motion. In an effort to assess the relative vectors and magnitudes of plume motion recorded on the Pacific plate we compare the long-lived Hawaii, Louisville and Rurutu hotspot tracks. All three plumes show motion in the modeled age range (0 – 80 Ma) with variable magnitudes related to the proximity of the hotspot from zones of major mantle upwelling as defined primarily by the location of spreading ridges. We compare the observed inter-hotspot distance between tracks through time to the hotspot distances derived through large scale mantle flow and related plume motion modeling. Over 80,000 different hotspot motion model runs with varied viscosity structures, mantle tomography models, and plume starting ages, buoyancies, and depths are compared using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to find a mantle structure which best fits the observed inter-hotspot distance data. Preliminary results in particular are most sensitive to the assumed viscosity structure of the Earth’s mantle and thus finding realistic viscosity structures will provide critical and much needed boundary conditions for Earth-like geodynamic modeling.",

As a result, 10 Transboundary Aquifer Systems (TAS) were identified and some have been assessed in cooperation with the United States. This study is a review of the current state of the 10 TAS. Documentation of scientifically-based knowledge on TAS is an important step in identifying potential issues in policies that might be adopted to address shared water-resource issues.\nThe newly acquired hydrological insights for this very long international border emphasizes the need for more scientific data, widespread communication and information sharing between Canadian and American organizations, and a more clearly defined governments’ role to manage groundwater at the international level. The study reviews the legal frameworks and summarises the current scientific knowledge for the TAS with respect to the hydrologic and geologic framework as well as some of the major drivers for supply and demand.\nIt also describes the links, approach and relevance of studies on the TAS to the UN Law of Transboundary Aquifers and on how these might fit in the ISARM’s regional strategy for the assessment and management of the TAS. Clear communication, shared knowledge and common objectives in the management of TAS will prepare the countries for future negotiations and cooperative binational programs.\nEncouraged by the ISARM approach of the International Hydrological Programme of UNESCO, Canada is now looking forward to playing a key regional role in improving water management, facilitating transboundary water sharing, and enhancing water research and data sharing in future relations between these two nations.",

            "abstract": "Biofilms play a pivotal role on nutrient cycling in streams, which ultimately dictates the export of nutrients to downstream ecosystems. The extent to which biofilms influence the concentration of dissolved nutrients, oxygen and pH in the water column may be determined by the composition of the microbial assemblages and their activity.\nEvidence of biological interactions among bacteria and algae are well documented. However, the development, succession and co-occurence of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria remain poorly understood. These bacteria play a relevant role on the biogeochemical process associated to N cycling, and their relative abundance can dictate the fate of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in streams. In particular, previous studies indicated that nitrifiers are enhanced in streams receiving inputs from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents due to both increases in ammonium concentration and inputs of nitrifiers. However, less is known about the development of denitrifiers in receiving streams, although environmental conditions seem to favor it.\nWe conducted an in situ colonization experiment in a stream receiving effluent from a WWTP to examine how this input influences the development and co-occurrence of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. We placed artificial substrata at different locations relative to the effluent and sampled them over time to characterize the developed biofilm in terms of bulk measurements (organic matter content and algae) as well as in terms of abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers (using qPCR). The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in relation to the developed organic matter, dissolved oxygen and pH and the biomass accrual in stream biofilms under the influence of nutrients inputs from WWTP effluent. Ultimately, the results provide insights on the potential role of nitrifiers and denitrifiers on N cycling in WWTP effluent receiving streams.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the solar wind is a major driver of ultra-low frequency [ULF] power at ground locations from low to high latitudes. However, due to the scarcity of deep polar cap magnetometer sites, it is not clear when, where, or if this is true deep inside the polar cap on open field lines where interplanetary magnetic field [IMF] ULF waves could possibly be directly detected. Given recent observations of very large Joule heating estimates from DMSP data, together with the large heating reported by the CHAMP satellite, it is important to understand the degree to which ULF waves in the solar wind can directly cause such heating. Using a time series of lagged correlation sequences (\"dynamic correlograms\") between GSM Bz ULF power (computed via data obtained from NASA’s Advanced Composition Explorer [ACE] ahead of Earth in the solar wind) and the horizontal ULF power (H^2=N^2+E^2) from ground-based magnetometers in Earth’s southern polar cap, we investigate the direct penetration of ULF waves from the solar wind into the polar ionosphere during a gamut of space weather conditions at a distributed network of Automated Geophysical Observatories [AGOs] in Antarctica. To infer causation, a predicted lag correlation maximum at each time step is computed by simply dividing the associated distance of ACE from Earth by the concurrent bulk solar wind speed. This technique helps parse out direct penetration of solar wind ULF waves from other sources (e.g., via leakage from closed field line resonances due to the bulk solar wind plasma viscously interacting at dawn/dusk flanks inducing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities [KHI] or compressional modes induced by impulses in solar wind dynamic pressure). The identified direct-penetrating ULF waves are related to the DMSP-derived Poynting fluxes by regression analysis, and conclusions are drawn for the importance of the ULF source for the measured heating.

            "abstract": "We investigated carbon dynamics in a steep, forested, headwater stream in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon, USA. Measurements from a continuously recording pCO2 probe located near the mouth of the catchment showed that the stream was always super saturated with CO2 with respect to atmospheric concentrations, ranging from 500 ppm in mid-winter to as much as 3,500 ppm in late summer. Continuous measurements of pCO2 from a hyporheic well suggested that the hyporheic zone was a likely source of the super-saturated stream water because the hyporheic concentrations of CO2 ranged from a mid-winter low of 4,000 ppm to a late summer high of 16,000 ppm. Here, we investigate the causes for the large seasonal changes in pCO2 in the stream water. We conducted longitudinal synoptic surveys of flow and carbon chemistry over the period of baseflow recession during summer 2015. The channel is narrow and steep with occasional bedrock segments. However, debris flow deposits in the lower portions of the studied reach create wider valley floors where hyporheic exchange can capture 100% of the streamflow when discharge is very low. At the beginning of the summer when discharge was relatively high, flow was spatially continuous, but by mid-summer, stream flow became spatially discontinuous. Upwelling hyporheic water in these locations appears to be super saturated with CO2. In early summer, the amount of upwelling hyporheic water was small relative to stream discharge so that hyporheic exchange had only a modest influence on stream pCO2. Later in the summer, when discharge was much smaller relative to hyporheic exchange, we observed much greater spatial variability in CO2, which averaged 2720 ppm downstream of dry segments longer than 5 m but only averaged 980 ppm in wet segments and below shorter dry segments. Over the intervening wet segments, CO2 appears to be evaded from the stream as concentrations decreased rapidly. Also, upslope accumulated area appears to control lateral inputs of hillslope or groundwater which is low in CO2, leading to local minimums in stream CO2 concentrations.

            "abstract": "At its Pleistocene maximum, the greater Yellowstone glacial system consisted of an ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau joined by glaciers from adjacent high mountains, including the Teton Range. In prior research, we obtained 112 exposure ages from moraines and bedrock in this region. These chronologies identified asynchronous outlet glacier culminations around the periphery of the Yellowstone glacier complex, supporting a model of spatial and temporal progressions in buildup and decay of the various ice source regions. Here we build on this previous work and present >30 recently developed 10Be exposure ages on glacial features in the Teton Range. Although the Tetons harbored a relatively small portion of the greater Yellowstone ice complex, glaciers in this range left behind some of the region’s best-preserved moraine sequences and scoured bedrock. Ongoing investigations are focused on developing moraine chronologies in several drainages on the eastern and western Teton Range fronts, and obtaining exposure ages along scoured bedrock transects in glacial troughs upvalley from the dated moraines to define rates of ice recession. Notably, our dating campaign includes lateral moraines that are offset by the Teton fault, providing a rare opportunity to establish direct constraints on integrated long-term slip rates. All new and previously obtained 10Be ages are calculated using recently published calibrations and scaling of 10Be production rates.\nInitial results show that massive lateral moraines in selected drainages are several thousands of years older than adjacent distal end moraines, implying that the laterals were constructed during an earlier phase of the last glaciation and then acted to topographically confine subsequent ice advances. Mean ages of ca. 17-16 ka from terminal moraine loops along with limiting ages from scoured bedrock upvalley of the moraines indicate glacier culminations followed by the onset of rapid ice retreat long after the end of the global Last Glacial Maximum, but well before the start of the Bølling-Allerød warm interval. This expanded chronology provides a refined understanding of the timing of late Pleistocene glacier events in the central Rocky Mountains, and allows a more critical examination of climatic influences on glacier fluctuations in this region.",

            "abstract": "This paper discusses in the impact of complex rock properties on practical applications like fracking and its associated seismic emissions. A variety of borehole measurements show that the complex physical properties of the upper crust cannot be characterized by averages on any scale. Instead they appear to follow 3 empirical rule: a power law distribution in physical scales, a lognormal distribution in populations, and a direct relation between changes in porosity and log(permeability). These rules can be directly related to the presence of fluid rich and seismically active fractures – from mineral grains to fault segments. (These are the “ghosts” referred to in the title.)\nIn other physical systems, such behaviors arise on the boundaries of phase changes, and are studied as “critical state physics”. In analogy to the 4 phases of water, crustal rocks progress upward from a un-fractured, ductile lower crust to nearly cohesionless surface alluvium. The crust in between is in an unstable transition. It is in this layer methods such as hydrofracking operate – be they in Oil and Gas, geothermal, or mining. As a result, nothing is predictable in these systems.\nCrustal models have conventionally been constructed assuming that in situ permeability and related properties are normally distributed. This approach is consistent with the use of short scale-length cores and logs to estimate properties. However, reservoir-scale flow data show that they are better fit to lognormal distributions. Such “long tail” distributions are observed for well productivity, ore vein grades, and induced seismic signals.\nOutcrop and well-log data show that many rock properties also show a power-law-type variation in scale lengths. In terms of Fourier power spectra, if peaks per km is k, then their power is proportional to 1/k. The source of this variation is related to pore-space connectivity, beginning with grain-fractures. We then show that a passive seismic method, Tomographic Fracture ImagingTM (TFI), can observe the distribution of this connectivity. Combined with TFI data, our fracture-connectivity model reveals the most significant crustal features and account for their range of passive and stimulated behaviors.",

Of particular interest are changes in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) as they pose potential impacts in continental climtae. However, in-situ observations are limited in space and time preventing a holistic view of current variability. The representation of long-term transports in ocean models is highly dependent on the atmospheric forcing fields, which may misrepresent real interannual variability. The bottom pressure observations from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide for the first time the ability to observe this global water mass transport. Here, we present the first near-global maps of variability in the depth-independent ocean circulation derived from advanced analysis of GRACE data. We find that significant variability on annual to decadal time scales exists in the deep large-scale circulation, some of which are related to the Southern Annular Mode forcing dominating Southern Ocean variability.",

            "abstract": "Wetland restoration has been suggested as policy goal with multiple environmental benefits including enhancement of atmospheric carbon sequestration. However, there are concerns that increased CH4 emissions associated with restoration may outweigh the potential sequestration benefits. The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is characterized by millions of depressional wetlands and spans climate and land-use gradients that have potential to affect biotic and abiotic factors associated with the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of pothole wetland ecosystems. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive, 4-year study of 119 wetland catchments distributed throughout the U.S. portion of the PPR to assess the effects of land use and restoration practices on CH4 and N2O fluxes and soil properties.\nResults showed that the effects of land use on GHG fluxes and abiotic soil properties differed with respect to catchment zone (upland, wetland), wetland classification, geographic location, and year. CH4 fluxes were greater than previously reported for pothole wetlands, while N2O fluxes were comparable to previously reported values. Moreover, maximum cumulative CH4 fluxes were nearly 3 times as high as previously reported in North America.\nResults suggest that soil organic carbon is lost when relatively undisturbed catchments are converted for agriculture, but sequestration rates associated with restoration are variable. Further, when non-drained cropland catchments are restored, CH4 fluxes generally are not different than the pre-restoration baseline; conversely, when drained cropland catchments are restored, CH4 fluxes are noticeably higher. Consequently, it is important to consider the type of restoration when assessing restoration benefits. Results also suggest that elevated N2O fluxes from cropland catchments likely would be reduced through restoration. The overall variability discovered by this study underscores the difficulty in quantifying the GHG balance of wetlands.",

CIOERT focuses on the exploration and research of ecosystems and habitats along frontier regions of the eastern U.S. continental shelf that are of economic, scientific, or cultural importance or of natural hazards concern. One particular focus is supporting ocean exploration and research through the use of advanced underwater technologies and techniques in order to improve the understanding of vulnerable deep and shallow coral and sponge ecosystems. CIOERT expands the scope and efficiency of exploration and research by developing, testing, and applying new and/or innovative uses of existing technologies to ocean exploration and research activities. In addition, CIOERT is dedicated to expanding ocean literacy and building NOAA's technical and scientific workforce through hands-on, at-sea experiences.\nA recent CIOERT cruise characterized Gulf of Mexico mesophotic and deepwater reef ecosystems off the west Florida shelf, targeting northern Pulley Ridge. This project created and ground-truthed new sonar maps made with an autonomous underwater vehicle; conducted video and photographic transects of benthic habitat and fish using a remotely operated vehicle; and examined the connectivity of fauna from shallow to deep reef ecosystems.\nCIOERT was established in 2009 by FAU-Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, with University of North Carolina, Wilmington, SRI International, and the University of Miami.

            "abstract": "Most geophysical systems are macroscopic physical systems. The behavior prediction of such systems is carried out by means of computational models whose basic models are partial differential equations (PDEs) [1]. Due to the enormous size of the discretized version of such PDEs it is necessary to apply highly parallelized super-computers. For them, at present, the most efficient software is based on non-overlapping domain decomposition methods (DDM). However, a limiting feature of the present state-of-the-art techniques is due to the kind of discretizations used in them. Recently, I. Herrera and co-workers using ‘non-overlapping discretizations’ have produced the DVS-Software which overcomes this limitation [2]. The DVS-software can be applied to a great variety of geophysical problems and achieves very high parallel efficiencies (90%, or so [3]). It is therefore very suitable for effectively applying the most advanced parallel supercomputers available at present.

The model results for sea level, current and wave statistics from the parent grid have been tested with data from several field campaigns at different locations spanning the western, central and eastern portions of LIS. Waves are fetch limited and improvements to the model-data comparison required modifications to spectral coefficients in the wave model. Finally, the nested results were validated with two field campaigns in shallow water environments (i.e. New Haven and Old Saybrook). To assess the spatial variability of storm wave characteristics the domain was forced with the hindcast winds obtained from meteorological models (NAM and WRF) for 13 severe weather events that affected LIS in the past 15 years. We have also forced the system with a simulation of Superstorm Sandy in a warmer climate to assess the impact a climate change on the character of flooding.

Each model produces ten-member ensemble forecasts which generate twenty member ensemble predictions. In this work we evaluate seasonal hindcasts of the recent past climate (1981-2010) simulated by the CanSIPS system. The importance of such evaluation stems from the fact that seasonal hindcasts can be used to calibrate the results of the seasonal predictions. Calibrated forecasts have in general more skill compared to the raw predictions. Moreover, verification of seasonal hindcasts enables an estimation of the expected performance of the prediction system over various regions and seasons (i.e. expected skill maps). Evaluation will be presented against reanalysis data. Near surface temperature and precipitation will be assessed over different geographical locations and various lead times.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) constitute a major part of global VOC emissions and can affect regional or global climate by influencing tropospheric chemistry and forming secondary organic aerosols. Isoprene is the most abundant species in global BVOC budget. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) 2.1 (Guenther et al., 2006, 2012) is a state-of-art emission model that simulates BVOC emissions by considering major environmental activity factors (e.g. temperature, solar radiation). Here we compare measurements of isoprene emissions in a mixed hardwood forest at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) during 1999-2005 growing seasons (Pressley et al., 2004, 2005) with MEGAN model simulations. We investigated the seasonal variations of isoprene emissions by considering the impacts from meteorological conditions, as well as correlations between sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and isoprene flux for a model uncertainty analysis. Model simulations are in good agreement with observations during leaf full expansion periods, but the values are 3-4 times higher than observations before full leaf development and after leaf senescence periods. There are significant correlations between the variations of isoprene emissions and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The Malawi Rift forms the southern termination of the western branch of the East African Rift System. It is suggested that it propagates from the Rungwe Volcanic Province in the north for ~700 km into Mozambique in the south. The northern portion of the Malawi Rift is dominated by the Mesoproterozoic basement rocks of the Ubendian-Usagaran belts to the north and west and the Irumide Belt in the south. The Mugese shear zone (MSZ) forms the boundary between the Ubendian-Usagaran and Irumide Belts. We used magnetic data to determine the relationship between the geology of the nascent Malawi Rift and the strong magnetic fabric observed in the Mugese shear zone from aeromagnetic maps. We integrated the aeromagnetic data with ground magnetic data acquired along two W-E transects using a cesium vapor magnetometer at a nominal station spacing of 500 m. We also acquired kinematic data (strike and dip) on exposed basement geology and Karoo sediments. Both transects extend from the uplifted basement areas cutting across the MSZ into the rift floor sediments. Our results show that the MSZ is characterized by a prominent WNW-ESE magnetic anomaly that is parallel to the basement fabric north of the town of Karonga but changes orientation to NNW-SSE south of Karonga. This shear zone is composed of gneisses in amphibolite to granulite facies that are steeply dipping (50-80°) to the west. The strong magnetization and magnetic lineation of the MSZ results from alternating light and dark colored gneissic bands. This magnetization is strongest in unweathered basement rocks and lowest in weathered basement rocks and Karoo sediments. The orientation of the strong magnetic fabric of the Mugese shear zone may play an important role on the accommodation of strain within the rift basin. Detailed mapping of the magnetic fabric can improve our understanding of the formation of faults in the nascent Malawi Rift.",

            "abstract": "The Lower Cell of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) is characterized by the formation of dense Antarctic Bottom Water, which descends into the abyssal ocean and is sequestered from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years before outcropping again at the Southern Ocean surface. Thus, the dynamics, and changing dynamics, of the Lower Cell may mediate the heat content of the deep ocean and play a key role in determining the long-term rate of atmospheric warming.\nWe examine its dynamics in the Community Climate System Model version 3.5 (CCSM 3.5), a fully-coupled global climate model which was run at two resolutions in the ocean and sea ice components: standard resolution (1.0 degrees) and high resolution (0.1 degrees). In the latter, eddies are explicitly resolved throughout most of the global ocean, and fine-scale sea ice processes are improved. We consider the response of the Lower Cell to two perturbations relevant to projected future climate change: an isolated wind-only experiment, in which westerly wind stress alone is increased, and a full “global warming” experiment, in which carbon dioxide was ramped until doubling. We show that in the mean state, this cell is primarily sustained by surface water mass transformation, itself enabled by heat loss from waters within the sea ice pack. Further, this circulation is notably stronger at fine resolution because of the improved simulation of sea ice dynamics.\nThe response of the Lower Cell to each perturbation is strikingly distinct. Following the intensification of westerly wind stress, overturning in the Lower Cell strengthens by as much as 40%. However, in response to carbon dioxide doubling, the circulation is weakened by up to 60%. In both cases, the sensitivity of this circulation to forcing primarily stems from the strong control that sea ice properties exert on ocean heat loss.\nThe varied response of the Lower Cell circulation to forcing subsequently impacts global ocean heat content. In the wind perturbation experiment, circulation changes cool the deep ocean, compensating for ocean warming induced by increases in Upper Cell strength. In contrast, in the comprehensive global warming perturbation, a weakening of the circulation compounds far-field ocean warming, particularly in the deep and abyssal ocean, and more so at high resolution.",

An increase in infrastructure development and road traffic since the initial development of the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield in 1968 has resulted in extensive flooding, accumulation of road dust, and roadside snowbanks, all of which affect the vegetation and alter the thermal properties of the ground surface. As part of the NSF’s Arctic Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (ArcSEES) project, we established four transects in 2014 and 2015 to document the effects of infrastructure and heavy road traffic on adjacent tundra. Two transects were established perpendicular to the Prudhoe Bay Spine Road north of Lake Colleen and two perpendicular to the Dalton Highway next to the Deadhorse airstrip. Prior to infrastructure development in 1949, rather homogeneous networks of low-centered polygons with less than 30 cm of trough-rim elevation contrast covered both locations. We present the detailed results of vegetation analysis, ice-core drilling, and extensive topographic surveys along the transects. A time series of aerial photographs from 1949 to 2014 (yearly since 1969) documents the changing landscapes in relationship to the record of air-temperature, active layer depths, and permafrost temperatures at Deadhorse. Flooding, road dust, and snow drifts have all contributed to creating warmer soil temperatures and deeper active layers near the road. These factors have all contributed in different ways to alteration of the plant canopy. The altered plant canopies in turn further altered the surface albedo and the ground temperatures. Historical photos indicate that between 1989 and 2012 a regional thawing of the ice-wedges occurred, increasing the extent of thermokarst. Our analysis demonstrates the cumulative effects of infrastructure-related and climate-related factors to these ice-rich permafrost landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic Isotope Maxima (AIM) are centennial-to-millennial scale warming events observed in Antarctic ice core records from the last glacial period and deglaciation. Mounting evidence links AIM events to parallel variations in atmospheric CO2, Southern Ocean (SO) sea surface temperatures and Antarctic Bottom Water production. According to the prevailing view, AIM events are forced from the North Atlantic by melt-water discharge from ice sheets suppressing the production of North Atlantic Deep Water and associated northward heat transport in the Atlantic. However observations and model studies increasingly suggest that melt-water fluxes have the wrong timing to be invoked as such a trigger. Here, drawing on results form the Kiel Climate Model, we present an alternative hypothesis in which AIM events are forced via internal oscillations in SO deep-convection. The quasi-periodic timescale of deep-convection events is set by heat (buoyancy) accumulation at SO intermediate depths and stochastic variability in sea ice conditions and freshening at the surface. Massive heat release from the SO convective zone drives Antarctic and large-scale southern hemisphere warming via a two-stage process involving changes in the location of Southern Ocean fronts, in the strength and intensity of the Westerlies and in meridional ocean and atmospheric heat flux anomalies. The potential for AIM events to be driven by internal Southern Ocean processes and the identification of time-lags internal to the southern high latitudes challenges conventional views on the North Atlantic as the pacemaker of millennial-scale climate variability.",

            "abstract": "It is important to continue to develop strategies to improve our ability to compare results between laboratories chronometers. The U-Pb community has significantly reduced inter-laboratory biases with the application of a community tracer solution and the distribution of synthetic zircon solutions. Inevitably sample selection and processing and even biases in interpretations will still lead to some disagreements in the assignment of ages. Accordingly natural samples that are shared will be important for achievement of the highest levels of agreement. Analogous improvements in quality and inter-laboratory agreement of analytical aspects of Ar-Ar can be achieved through development of synthetic age standards in gas canisters with multiple pipettes to deliver various controlled amounts of argon to the mass spectrometer. A preliminary proof-of concept comes from the inter-laboratory calibration experiment for the 40Ar/39Ar community. This portable Argon Pipette Intercalibration System (APIS) consists of three 2.7 L canisters each equipped with three pipettes of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 cc volumes. The currently traveling APIS has the three canisters filled with air and 40Ar*/39Ar of 1.73 and canister 2 has a 40Ar*/39Ar of 40.98 (~ Alder Creek and Fish Canyon in the same irradiation). With these pipettes it is possible to combine them to provide 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 (0.1+0.2), 0.4, 0.5 (0.1+0.4), 0.6 (0.2+0.4), and 0.7 (0.1+0.2+0.4) cc. The configuration allows a simple test for inter-laboratory biases and for volume/pressure dependent mass fractionation on the measured ratios for a gas with a single argon isotope composition. Although not yet tested, it is also possible to mix gas from any one of the three canisters in proportions of these increments, allowing even more tightly controlled calibration of measurements. We suggest that ultimately each EARTHTIME lab should be equipped with such a system permanently, with a community plan for a traveling system to periodically repeat the inter-calibration tests. The composition(s) of such systems may not be the same for each lab, depending on the requirements of equipment and main age ranges targeted. But with a relatively small number of end member compositions it should be possible to greatly improve the calibration capability of the community.",

            "abstract": "Predictions from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are the foundation for wind power forecasts for day-ahead and longer forecast horizons. The NWP models directly produce three-dimensional wind forecasts on their respective computational grids. These can be interpolated to the location and time of interest. However, these direct predictions typically contain significant systematic errors (“biases”). This is due to a variety of factors including the limited space-time resolution of the NWP models and shortcomings in the model’s representation of physical processes. It has become common practice to attempt to improve the raw NWP forecasts by statistically adjusting them through a procedure that is widely known as Model Output Statistics (MOS). The challenge is to identify complex patterns of systematic errors and then use this knowledge to adjust the NWP predictions. The MOS-based improvements are the basis for much of the value added by commercial wind power forecast providers.\nThere are an enormous number of statistical approaches that can be used to generate the MOS adjustments to the raw NWP forecasts. In order to obtain insight into the potential value of some of the newer and more sophisticated statistical techniques often referred to as “machine learning methods” a MOS-method comparison experiment has been performed for wind power generation facilities in 6 wind resource areas of California.\nThe underlying NWP models that provided the raw forecasts were the two primary operational models of the US National Weather Service: the GFS and NAM models. The focus was on 1- and 2-day ahead forecasts of the hourly wind-based generation. The statistical methods evaluated included: (1) screening multiple linear regression, which served as a baseline method, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) a decision-tree approach called random forests, (4) gradient boosted regression based upon an decision-tree algorithm, (5) support vector regression and (6) analog ensemble, which is a case-matching scheme.\nThe presentation will provide (1) an overview of each method and the experimental design, (2) performance comparisons based on standard metrics such as bias, MAE and RMSE, (3) a summary of the performance characteristics of each approach and (4) a preview of further experiments to be conducted.",

After accounting for the local noise source distribution, we pick group travel times associated with the fundamental mode and use them in a straight-ray tomography procedure to generate group velocity maps at 3.0 Hz and 3.5 Hz. The velocity trends in our results correspond to shallow depths and are consistent with lithologies outlined in a geologic map of the survey area. The most prominent features resolved in our velocity maps are the low velocities to the north corresponding to less-consolidated materials, high velocities to the south corresponding to more-consolidated materials, a low-velocity zone corresponding to artificial fill in Alamitos Bay, and a low-velocity linear feature in the Newport-Inglewood Fault zone.

            "abstract": "Characterizing gas hydrate in a reservoir typically involves a full suite of geophysical well logs. The most common method involves using resistivity measurements to quantify the decrease in electrically conductive water when replaced with gas hydrate. Compressional velocity measurements are also used because the gas hydrate significantly strengthens the moduli of the sediment. At many gas hydrate sites, nuclear well logs, which include the photoelectric effect, formation sigma, carbon/oxygen ratio and neutron porosity, are also collected but often not used. In fact, the nuclear response of a gas hydrate reservoir is not known. In this research we will focus on the nuclear log response in gas hydrate reservoirs at the Mallik Field at the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada, and the Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project Leg 2 sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\nNuclear logs may add increased robustness to the investigation into the properties of gas hydrates and some types of logs may offer an opportunity to distinguish between gas hydrate and permafrost. For example, a true formation sigma log measures the thermal neutron capture cross section of a formation and pore constituents; it is especially sensitive to hydrogen and chlorine in the pore space. Chlorine has a high absorption potential, and is used to determine the amount of saline water within pore spaces. Gas hydrate offers a difference in elemental composition compared to water-saturated intervals. Thus, in permafrost areas, the carbon/oxygen ratio may vary between gas hydrate and permafrost, due to the increase of carbon in gas hydrate accumulations.\nAt the Mallik site, we observe a hydrate-bearing sand (1085-1107 m) above a water-bearing sand (1107-1140 m), which was confirmed through core samples and mud gas analysis. We observe a decrease in the photoelectric absorption of ~0.5 barnes/e-, as well as an increase in the formation sigma readings of ~5 capture units in the water-bearing sand as compared to the hydrate sand interval.

            "abstract": "Studying landscape evolution and developing defensible land management plans require predictions of sediment flux in rivers. Bed load transport equations often use hiding functions to represent the relative mobility of different grain sizes, which is assumed to be caused by hiding effects. Hiding effects describe the tendency for small particles to have lower projection into the flow and higher friction angles than large grains, decreasing their mobility. Hiding function exponents (b) are fit using reach-scale measurements, whereas hiding effects operate at the grain scale. Therefore, the relation between b values and hiding effects has not been explicitly demonstrated. Hiding effects are also commonly measured for grains placed on bed surfaces rather than for in situ grains that experience the packing and burial that are typical of natural streambeds. To examine this issue, we measured resisting forces and projection for in situ and surface grains in a set of laboratory flume experiments. We used these values in a force balance equation to calculate critical shear stresses and then fit hiding functions to the predicted stresses. Lower projection and higher resistance of in situ grains caused their critical shear stresses to be much higher than those for surface grains. In situ grains also had much lower hiding effects because fine and coarse in situ sediment exhibited relatively similar projection values. We compared b values calculated for in situ and surface grains to those obtained from bedload transport measurements in our experiments. Only in situ sediment with relatively weak hiding effects predicted the observed b value from bedload observations. Our results demonstrate that the relative mobility of fine and coarse sediment was largely controlled by packing resistance and that hiding effects are less significant than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "What stress drop are we estimating when we fit a Brune model (1970, 1971) to the moment-rate spectrum of a complex earthquake source? To answer this question we used the slip-rate distributions from more than 30 dynamic rupture simulations (Schmedes et al., 2010) as kinematic sources. We propagate the intermediate- and far-field S-wave to stations between 10-100 km from the fault. For each source, the initial stress field on the fault is a stochastic realization with 2-point statistics consistent with a power law. The resulting models have complex final slip distributions due to the heterogeneity of the initial stress field. This also leads to complex waveforms, even though we use a whole-space as the medium. Preliminary results suggest that the corner frequency in the near-field is dominated by the closest asperity to the point of observation; in the far-field, the largest slip asperity dominates the waveforms. This implies that the stress drop we compute with a Brune model might reflect the stress drop on a particular asperity on the fault, as opposed to an average stress drop on the fault. This will lead to a larger stress drop estimate, because the seismic moment would correspond to the entire earthquake, while the corner frequency would relate to a smaller area (Δσ=M0(fc/(0.42β)3)). In the dynamic rupture simulations we see stress relaxation on the fault as the medium adjusts to the final state. This can lead to a static stress drop larger than the dynamic stress drop. We compare estimates of dynamic stress drops determined from corner frequencies and static stress drops from the near field stations, to better understand the relationship between these two parameters. We also provide a relationship between corner frequency and an average stress drop computed from the dynamic rupture simulations as proposed by Shao et al. (2012). Finally we show inverted stress drops from the 2011 Virginia earthquake (Shao et al., 2011) and conclude that the large observed stress drop is related to two asperities, which are the main contributors to the observed corner frequency. This unique dynamic dataset also allows us to investigate the discrepancies between the stress drop estimates based on near-fault and teleseismic data. We will calculate body wave seismograms at teleseismic distances and estimate their Brune stress drops.",

            "abstract": "Magnetostratigraphy is a useful method in providing geochronologic information for stratigraphic sequences. In general, this dating method requires paleomagnetic samples to be collected from outcrops or drill cores, and the magnetic polarities of the samples to be determined in the laboratory. However, suitable exposures or cores are not always accessible for sampling, especially during investigations of deep-basin stratigraphy. One alternative to collecting discrete rock samples is to use a downhole magnetometer to log the magnetic properties of sediments in a borehole. Downhole measurements are often used to determine the magnetostratigraphy of sediments in deep sea drilling projects, where fine-grained sediments contain reliable paleomagnetic signals. We test whether this methodology can resolve the magnetic polarity of coarse-grained estuarine, fluvial, and marine sediments in a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) multiple-depth water well in San Diego County, California, by correlating borehole magnetic data with discrete paleomagnetic samples from sediment cores collected in the same well. The well is 363 meters deep and penetrates artificial and Quaternary deposits, overlying Eocene and Cretaceous sedimentary formations. We use a BVM-03 borehole probe (use of this product does constitute endorsement by the USGS), with a three-component vector magnetometer (0.1 nT sensitivity) and a susceptibility sensor, to continuously record the in situ total magnetic induction and susceptibility of the surrounding sediment. Post-processing of these magnetic data produces a continuous magnetic polarity record of the borehole sediment, and preliminary results suggest the presence of multiple magnetic polarity reversals. Successful determination of magnetic polarity in the well will allow researchers to establish more precise ages for sedimentary formations in the San Diego area, and will support the use of borehole magnetometer systems in coarse-grained, fluvial environments.",

            "abstract": "The sounding rocket chemical release technique can provide wind measurements in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere with excellent height resolution and extended altitude coverage, but such measurements are generally limited to nighttime conditions. Lithium trails, however, have a sufficiently bright resonant emission in sunlight to be detected with cameras or photometers using very narrow-band filters tuned to the emission wavelength. This type of measurement was attempted successfully a few times in the 1970's. We present the results of a recent experiment that represents the first use of the technique since those early attempts. Specifically, a rocket launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, on July 4, 2013, at 1031 LT, released a series of three lithium trails covering the altitude range from 95 to 125 km. The trails were observed with cameras equipped with 2-nm telecentric filter lenses on a NASA aircraft at an altitude of 28,000 feet, above the majority of the lower-level haze layer. The wind profile obtained from the observations showed maximum wind speeds of approximately 150 m/s in the altitude range where the strongest dynamo currents are expected. A large shear was evident below the altitude of the wind maximum, and the turbopause transition could be seen in the trail within the region of the large shear. In addition, there were large changes in the wind speed and wind direction during the 10 to 15 minute observing period. The results are of interest in terms of the technique development, which improves significantly on the measurements from the 1970's by using modern filter lens systems and sensitive digital cameras. In addition, the observed wind profiles show the characteristics of the winds and their time variations in daytime conditions across this critical altitude range.",

There is evidence that these may serve as conduits for low-temperature hydrothermal circulation of seawater through the oceanic crust. During RV SONNE cruise SO205 in April/May 2010 and BIONOD cruise with RV L´ATALANTE in spring 2012 we took piston and gravity cores for geochemical analyses, as well as for high-resolution pore-water oxygen and nutrient measurements. Specifically, we took cores along a transect at three sites, located 400, 700 and 1000 m away from the foot of a 240 m high seamount, called ‘Teddy Bare’. At all 3 sites oxygen penetrates the entire sediment column of the organic carbon-poor sediment. More importantly, oxygen concentrations initially decrease with sediment depth but increase again at depths of 3 m and 7 m above the basaltic basement, suggesting an upward diffusion of oxygen from seawater circulating within the seamount crust into the overlying basal sediments. This is the first time this has been shown for the deep subsurface in the Pacific Ocean. Mirroring the oxygen concentrations nitrate concentrations accumulate with sediment depth but decrease towards the basement. Transport-reaction modeling revealed that (1) the diffusive flux of oxygen from the basaltic basement exceeds the oxygen consumption through organic matter oxidation and nitrification in the basal sediments and (2) the nutrient exchange between the sediment and the underlying basaltic crust occurs at orders-of-magnitude lower rates than between the sediment surface and the overlying bottom water. We furthermore show that the upward diffusion of oxygen from the basaltic basement affects the preservation of organic compounds within the oxic sediment column at all 3 sites. Our investigations indicate that an upward diffusion of oxygen from the basalt into the overlying sediment may be a widespread phenomenon in this area of the Pacific Ocean that is characterized by numerous seamounts.",

This case-study analyzes reasons as to why jurisdictions may chose to discharge untreated sewage to the ocean rather than to follow the resource-recovery trend argued for in the academic literature. Our study is based on an analysis of the reasoning behind “Plan Director 2006-2020” in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which includes extending the central sewer system to over five million people living in underserviced areas and conveying the sewage to a central discharge station. Our study suggests that the decision to discharge untreated sewage into the ocean via Rio de la Plata rests on four firmly rooted perceptions:\n1. Centralized sewer systems are better than distributed systems, irrespective of scale, 2. Sewage treatment generates sludge and sludge management incurs considerable risks and costs, not least in densely populated areas where access to land is limited, 3. The benefits of resource recovery are overrated and the costs are underestimated and last but not least, 4. The ocean has an enormous self-purifying capacity.\nEach of these four perceptions is discussed in light of the literature, with a focus on the scientific knowledge that is used to frame risks and benefits related to the two policy options (discharging at sea vis-à-vis resource recovery) in particular inferred causal links, and how uncertainty is handled.",

The FGM instruments provide us with magnetic field measurements sampled at 22 Hz, which is sufficient for a precise identification of BS crossings. We compare observed BS locations with distances predicted by gas dynamical models based on upstream plasma parameters in the solar wind. We achieve a very good agreement in a case of a paraboloid with the Earth fixed in a focus point. We use a simple timing method for the estimation of a BS normal and velocity along this normal. We found that the deviations of calculated BS normals from the paraboloid shape are within 20 degrees. We compare calculated BS velocities with several upstream parameters.

            "abstract": "Permafrost thaw driven by climate change in northern high latitudes is thought to play a significant role in enhancing the mobilization of previously sequestered peatland mercury (Hg) to the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Though studies have shown sub-arctic lake Hg dynamics are impacted by adjacent permafrost thaw, the magnitude and long-term effects of Hg mobilization in sub-arctic lakes remain poorly constrained. Three lakes from the well-characterized Stordalen Mire in Abisko, Sweden were sampled in order to study intra- and inter- lake variability in total lake sediment Hg. These three lakes were chosen due to their proximity to a thawing permafrost peatland and were characterized for their carbon and mercury dynamics. Coring sites included: (1) 6 cores taken at Villasjön, a shallow lake less than 1.5 meters water depth with a previously established methane (CH4) ebullition gradient; (2) 2 cores from Mellarsta Harrsjön, a stream-fed lake with a maximum water depth < 7 m; and (3) 2 cores from Inre Harrsjön, connected to Mellarsta Harrsjön, with a maximum water depth of <5 m. Radiocarbon ages constrain the formation of the three lakes to ~ 3400 years ago. We found both significant inter- and intra- lake variations in total sediment Hg. Within Villasjön, the cores associated with the lowest CH4 ebullition have markedly lower total Hg relative to the cores located in areas with the highest observed CH4 ebullition. The depth of maximum sediment Hg content also varies across the ebullition gradient such that the cores from areas with high ebullition rates had high total Hg as deep as ~30 cm whereas maximum total sediment Hg in the low ebullition cores was located in the top 5 cm. From the inter-lake perspective, Mellarsta Harrsjön and Inre Harrsjön, which contain overall lower methane ebullition fluxes relative to Villasjön, were found to contain significantly less Hg. If sediment Hg is mobilized during CH4 ebullition then this pathway of Hg mobilization needs further understanding.",

Using the Singh et al. formalism (2006), the bulk shear strength (t) of a material is related to its shear modulus(G) and to the average differential strain (<Q(hkl)>) over all measured lattice planes (hkl) by t = 6G<Q(hkl)>. We followed an existing framework (Gleason & Mao, 2013) and extend the strength determinations to investigate the effect of nickel on the strength of iron at high pressure. We collected radial X-ray diffraction data on Fe90Ni10 and Fe80Ni20 using a panoramic diamond anvil cell with an X-ray transparent gasket to 100 GPa. This data was combined with existing NRIXS data (Lin 2003) to calculate the strength of these compounds. From this we extrapolated the strength of these iron-nickel alloys to deep earth pressures to give a new constraint on the strength of the inner core. Gaining a better understanding of the strength of iron and its alloys at high pressures can shed light on the strength of the inner core and provide insight into the deformation processes operating in the most remote region of our planet.",

Measurements are made using either direct sunlight or light from the moon (up to 2 weeks per month). The result of the comparison was used to assess the performance of the two instrument types and determine the stability of the measurement systems.\nBoth instruments suffer from non-linearity due to the presence of instrumental stray light caused by the out-off-band radiations scattered from the optics within the instrument. Stray light results in an underestimated ozone column at large ozone path lengths. Since measurements made at the location of the station (Latitude 89.99o, Longitude -24.80o) have solar zenith angles of 66.5 degrees or greater, the issue of stray light is a particular concern.",

Diameters of NEOs are derived from the thermal fluxes measured by WISE, NEOWISE, Spitzer Warm Mission and ground-based telescopes including the IRTF and UKIRT. Diameter and its coupled parameters Albedo and IR beaming parameter (a proxy for thermal inertia and/or surface roughness) are dependent upon the phase angle, which is the Sun-target-observer angle. Orbit geometries of NEOs, however, typically provide for observations at phase angles > 20 degrees. At higher phase angles, the observed thermal emission is sampling both the day and night sides of the NEO. We compare thermal models for NEOs that exclude (NEATM) and include (NESTM) night-side emission.\nWe present a case study of NEO 3691 Bede, which is a higher albedo object, X (Ec) or Cgh taxonomy, to highlight the range of H magnitudes for this object (depending on the albedo and phase function slope parameter G), and to examine at different phase angles the taxonomy and thermal model fits for this NEO. Observations of 3691 Bede include our observations with IRTF+SpeX and with the 10µm UKIRT+Michelle instrument, as well as WISE and Spitzer Warm mission data. By examining 3691 Bede as a case study, we highlight the interplay between the derivation of basic physical parameters and observing geometry, and we discuss the uncertainties in H magnitude, taxonomy assignment amongst the X-class (P, M, E), and diameter determinations. Systematic dependencies in the derivation of basic characterization parameters of H-magnitude, diameter, albedo and taxonomy with observing geometry are important to understand. These basic characterization parameters affect the statistical assessments of the NEO population, which in turn, affects the assignment of statistically-assessed basic parameters to discovered but yet-to-be-fully-characterized NEOs.",

Using electric field measurements and estimates of the cold plasma density from the Van Allen Probes’ Electric Fields and Waves (EFW) instrument, we study erosion of the plasmasphere during moderate and strong geomagnetic storms. We present the electric field and density data both on an orbit by orbit basis and synoptically, showing the behavior of the convection electric field and plasmasphere over a period of months. The data indicate that the large scale duskward electric field penetrates deep (L shell < 3) into the inner magnetosphere on both the dusk and dawn sides, but that the plasmasphere response on the dusk and dawn sides differ. In particular, significant (~2 orders of magnitude) decreases in the cold plasma density occur on the dawn side within hours of the onset of enhanced duskward electric field. In contrast, on the dusk side, the plasmapause is located at higher L shell than it is on the dawn side. In some cases, in the post-noon sector, cold plasma density enhancements accompany duskward electric field enhancements for the first orbit after the electric field enchantment, consistent with a duskside, sunward flowing, drainage plume.",

            "abstract": "Many climate change assessments apply a top-down approach. This starts with information from global climate models, then climate variables are downscaled and multiple models are linked together to make this global-scale information applicable to local systems. While these climate model-driven approaches have many benefits, models are imperfect representations of reality, and thus each step of the modeling cascade requires decisions on how best to span space and time, which can skew results. This research explores an alternative approach which uses the same modeling framework as past climate change studies (global climate models, hydrological models, and impact assessment tools), but reverses the direction of information flow: first, water resource managers identify a metric of concern, e.g., flow above X cfs at a certain gauge, then through model iterations, hydrologic factors that lead to the metric are diagnosed, and finally connections to climate drivers are quantified. In other words, instead of starting with the global climate information, which is often the least understood, the approach first investigates local water system sensitivities. From a hydrologic perspective, this capitalizes on using past weather events to better quantify conditions (e.g. extent, duration, and intensity of precipitation, snow pack, soil moisture) that cause extreme hydrologic events. This helps identify how the character of simulated future events, as they continue to evolve, differs from those of the past, and importantly, forces the assessment to consider the particulars of the local system, the impact of interest, and the decision makers at the start of the study. This presentation will discuss the opportunities and challenges of this approach in the Pacific Northwest. Floods in the Skagit River in western Washington, selected after numerous meetings with water resource managers throughout the region, will be highlighted as a test case for this bottom-up approach.",

Here, surface layer temperature TS calculated by soil temperature of 2-5cm depth. Due to only 5 minutes interval, this state was taken as a state one. (1) soil temperature has mixture change on surface layer and its temperature different is over 35 ℃. (2) Surface layer temperature changes of every month have three stages and its conducted heat, which calculated between TS and T10. Since TS exceeds T10 and heat transfer direction is from surface to underground in May, June and July 2013, even heat transfer amounts reduced by participation in July. However, TS is inferior to T10 and conduced heat direction reverse in August till to February 2014.Continually conduced heat start to next circulation and then it’s heat direction from surface to underground due to TS exceeds T10 again in March and April 2014. (3) Temperature changes of phreatic water table every month have also three stages and its conducted heat which calculated between T75 and T125, heat transfer direction from unsaturated zone to saturated zone due to T75 exceeds T125 from May till middle September 2013. However, T75 is inferior to T125 and heat direction reverse from late September 2013 till May 2014, but conduced heat direction starts to change from unsaturated zone to saturated zone again in early April 2014.The result can imply shallow gruondwater has some contribution to surface layer temperature in different seasons.",

            "abstract": "Melting glaciers contribute large volumes of freshwater to the Gulf of Alaska coast. Rates of glacier volume loss have increased markedly in recent decades, raising concern about the eventual loss of glaciers as a source of freshwater in coastal waters. To better understand the influence of glacier melt water on fjord ecosystems, we sampled oceanography, nutrients, zooplankton, forage fish, and seabirds within four fjords in the coastal Gulf of Alaska. We used generalized additive models and geostatistics to identify the range of influence of glacier runoff in fjords of varying estuarine and topographic complexity. We also modeled the responses of chlorophyll a concentration, copepod biomass, fish and seabird abundance to physical, nutrient and biotic predictor variables. Physical and nutrient signatures of glacial runoff extended 10-20 km into coastal fjords. Glacially modified physical gradients and among-fjord differences explained 66% of the variation in phytoplankton abundance, which drives ecosystem structure at higher trophic levels. Copepod, euphausiid, fish and seabird distribution and abundance were also related to environmental gradients that could be traced to glacial freshwater input. Seabird density was predicted by prey availability and silica concentrations, which may indicate upwelling areas where this nutrient is in excess. Similarities in ecosystem structure among fjords were due to influx of cold, fresh, sediment and nutrient laden water, while differences were due to fjord topography and the relative importance of estuarine vs. ocean influences. We anticipate continued changes in the volume and magnitude of glacial runoff will affect coastal marine food webs in the future.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015.pdf\nGPS monuments around the world exhibit seasonal displacements in both the horizontal and vertical direction with amplitudes on the order of centimeters. For analysis of tectonic signals, researchers typically fit and remove a sine function with an annual period, and sometimes an additional sine function with a semiannual period. As interest grows in analyzing small-amplitude, long-period deformation signals it becomes more important to accurately correct for seasonal variations. It is well established that the vertical component of seasonal GPS signals is largely due to continental water storage cycles (e.g. van Dam et al., GRL, 2001). Other recognized sources of seasonal loading include atmospheric pressure loading and oceanic loading due to non-steric changes in ocean height (e.g. van Dam et al., J. Geodesy, 2012). Here we attempt to build a complete physical model of seasonal loading by considering all of these sources (continental water storage, atmospheric pressure, and oceanic loading) and comparing our model to horizontal and vertical GPS data in the Western US. Atmospheric loading effects are computed from the National Center for Environmental Prediction 6-hourly global reanalysis surface pressure fields; the terrestrial water loading and ocean loading models are generated using SPOTL (Some Programs for Ocean Tide Loading; Agnew, SIO Technical Report, 2012) and parameters from NASA’s Land Data Assimilation Systems and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean model, version 4. We find that with a few exceptions, our seasonal loading model predicts the correct phases but underestimates the amplitudes of vertical seasonal loads, and is a generally poor fit to the observed horizontal seasonal signals. This implies that our understanding of the driving mechanisms behind seasonal variations in the GPS data is still incomplete and needs to be improved before physics-based models can be used as an effective correction tool for the GPS timeseries.",

            "abstract": "Isocyanic acid, HNCO, has emerged as a potentially important reduced nitrogen compound that is emitted in wildfires, and may have health effect implications. The extent of the health effects depends on the solubility of HNCO in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions and the relative rates of hydrolysis versus carbamylation reactions (for example: HNCO + ROH => H2NC(O)OR). We report here results of studies of HNCO solubility and its reaction in buffered aqueous solutions (pH3), tridecane, and n-octanol at temperatures over the range 5 to 37°C. From these data, the heats of solution and activation energy of hydrolysis are estimated, and a partition coefficient between n-octanol and water at 25°C is greater than 1 for low pH solutions, indicating appreciable portioning to a non-polar phase, but HNCO will be distributed mostly in the aqueous phase at neutral pH. In addition, it was found that the rate of reaction of HNCO with n-octanol was competitive with hydrolysis under physiologically relevant conditions (pH7.4, 37°C), indicating that carbamylation of ROH groups could be significant. Based on these results, research on the carbamylation of other functional groups, and solubility and reaction studies of other isocyanates (e.g. CH3NCO) are warranted. The implications of this multi-phase chemistry for global exposures to wildfire emissions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The High Atlas is an intracontinental chain developed as a result of the inversion of Mesozoic basins during the Cenozoic. Its structure is characterized by ENE-WSW tight anticlines limited by wide synclines. In the central sector of the chain, a pervasive tectonic foliation affects Jurassic limestones and marls. There is a controversy about the age of this tectonic foliation and its relationship with either a Late Jurassic or Cenozoic compressional events.\nThe Jurassic carbonates of the Central High Atlas (CHA) show a widespread syntectonic remagnetization carried by magnetite and dated at 100 M.a. by comparing the paleomagnetic direction obtained by small circle intersection (SCI) method with the apparent polar wander path in NW Africa coordinates.\nOnce the 100 M.a. paleomagnetic direction is known, the obtained paleomagnetic direction remagnetization in each site can be used to restore the bedding at the time of the acquisition. In each site, the in situ mean direction of remagnetization defines a small circle (SC) in a complete rotation about the strike of the bedding. This SC gives all possible original directions of the magnetization and if all deformation events are coaxial and without vertical rotation (as it is the case in the study area) all the SC contains the 100 M.a. expected direction. Then, the angle between the 100 M.a. and the in situ paleomagnetic direction along the small circle, equals the angle of rotation of each bed to ultimately find their dips (paleodip) at 100 M.a.\nSince the consistency between folding and cleavage can be examined from their geometrical relationship, and bedding can be restored to its 100 M.a. geometry (paleodips obtained from paleomagnetic analysis), two end-members exist for the different examined folds: (i) cleavage is consistent with present-day bedding orientation and attitude of bedding was acquired after remagnetization (Cenozoic cleavage), (ii) cleavage is consistent with bedding, but dip of bedding was acquired during the pre-remagnetization stage, as inferred from paleomagnetic analysis (Mesozoic cleavage). Intermediate possibilities, having cleavage developed during one of the two stages with intermediate dips between present-day orientation and the horizontal, are also possible, and are analyzed in different examples of the Atlas chain.",

Organized exclusively by graduate students for graduate students, the conference provides a nurturing environment for attendees to familiarize themselves with the bleeding-edge in climate research, foster scientific connections between and across fields, and initiate new interdisciplinary collaborations. Moreover, the conference’s single session format both ensures full exposure to the range of work being presented and provides presenters with a large and engaged audience. Here, we will both elucidate the history and objectives of the conference in addition to showcasing its impact on the younger generation within the climate science community via data and feedback collected from almost a decade of past participants. We will present results quantifying both the high scientific merit of the conference (i.e statistics on the amount of presented work that matriculated into peer reviewed publication, etc.) and the critical opportunity for professional development it provides (i.e. how many students gave their first serious scientific talk at the GCC, what sort professional collaborations developed at the GCC, post-doc fellowships and assistant professorships obtained by participants, etc.). The goal of this work is to illustrate how effective the GCC has been at connecting, educating, and nurturing the future generations of researchers from an extremely diverse set of backgrounds and to share with the community a successful model for future conferences both in the geosciences and the broader scientific community.",

            "abstract": "Ambient seismic noise is the vibration present on seismograms not due by any earthquake or discrete source. It can be caused by trees swaying in the wind or trucks rumbling on the freeway, but the main source of noise is the microseism caused by ocean waves. The frequency content and amplitude of seismic noise varies due to weather, season, and the location of a station, among other factors. Because noise affects recordings of earthquake waveforms, better understanding it could improve the detection of small earthquakes, reduce false positives in earthquake early warning, and quantify uncertainty in waveform-based studies\nIn this study, we used two years of 3-component accelerograms from stations in the GSN. We eliminate days with major earthquakes, aggregate analysis by month, and calculate the mean power spectrum for each component and the transfer function between components. For each power spectrum, we determine the dominant frequency and amplitude of the primary (PM) and secondary (SM) microseisms which appear at periods of ~14s and ~7s, as well as any other prominent peaks. The cross-component terms show that noise recorded on different components cannot be treated as independent. Trends in coherence and phase delay suggest directionality in the noise and information about in which modes it propagates.\nPreliminary results show that the noise on island stations exhibits less monthly variability, and its PM peaks tend to be much weaker than the SM peaks. The continental stations show much less consistent behavior, with higher variability in the PM peaks between stations and higher frequency content during winter months. Stations that are further inland have smaller SM peaks compared to coastal stations, which are more similar to island stations. Using these spectra and cross-component results, we develop a method for generating realistic 3-component seismic noise and covariance matrices, which can be used across various seismic applications.",

            "abstract": "Human activity, including fossil fuel combustion and agriculture has greatly increased the amount of reactive nitrogen (RN) in the atmosphere and its subsequent deposition to land. Increases in deposition of RN compounds can adversely affect sensitive ecosystems and is a growing problem in many natural areas. The National Park Service in conjunction with Colorado State University researchers and assistance from the Forest Service conducted the Grand Teton Reactive Nitrogen Deposition Study (GrandTReNDS) involving spatially and temporally detailed measurements of RN during spring/summer 2011. In this work it was found that during summer months at the high elevation site Grand Targhee, 62% of the nitrogen deposition was due to reduced nitrogen, about equally split between dry and wet deposition, oxidized nitrogen accounted for 27% of the total, and the remaining was wet deposited organic nitrogen. An important next step to GrandTReNDS is the use of chemical transport models (CTMs) to estimate source contributions to RN in the park. Given the large contribution of reduced nitrogen species to total nitrogen deposition in the park, understanding and properly characterizing ammonia in CTMs is critical to estimating the total nitrogen deposition. A model performance evaluation of the CAMx uni-directional model and CMAQ bi-direction and uni-directional 2011 model simulations versus GrandTReNDS and other datasets was conducted. Preliminary results suggest that, in some areas, model performance of ambient ammonia concentration is more sensitive to the spatial resolution of the model and the accuracy of the spatial representation of emissions than to the incorporation of bi-directional flux. Additional model sensitivity runs, including sensitivity to resolution (with and without bi-directional flux capabilities), changes to model estimated ammonia dry deposition velocities, and improved representation of the spatial distribution of ammonia emissions, are used to identify the best set of options for GrandTReNDS modeling, and to provide a measure of uncertainties. This will help atmospheric scientists identify deficiencies in the models and inform future model development.",

            "abstract": "Methane emissions from Stordalen Mire in subarctic Sweden have been increasing over the last century with rising atmospheric temperatures. Methane emissions from lakes in this region have shown a positive correlation with sediment and air temperatures. Previous studies have examined CH4 emissions of these lakes but the primary stream that flows along the edge the mire is understudied. Streams and rivers that exist in permafrost peatland environments are thought to be a pathway for the release of older carbon deposits from thawing permafrost. To understand the potential role of stream morphology and stratigraphy on CH4 concentrations and contributions to carbon cycling in this system, seven sediment cores were extracted from the stream and one from the adjacent lake. Cores were subsampled at 5cm depth intervals and analyzed for CH4 concentration, δ13CH4 isotopes, elemental CHNS and sediment grain size. Results from these analyses show that maximum CH4 concentrations in stream sediments occur at greater depths than in the adjacent lake sediments. Higher CH4 concentrations are observed in organic C rich layers in both environments. However, in stream sediments, CH4 appears to be produced within some stratigraphic intervals, but exists in others as the result of transport. Organic C/N ratios of the sediments indicate a predominance of terrestrial organic C but it is unclear whether the sediment organic C is the result of deposition of C from permafrost thaw or C that was deposited through the degradation of modern plant material.",

            "abstract": "Several different literature parameterizations for the formation and evolution of urban secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are evaluated using a box model representing the Los Angeles Region during CalNex. The model SOA formed only from the oxidation of VOCs (V-SOA) is insufficient to explain the observed SOA concentrations, even when using SOA parameterizations with multi-generation oxidation that produce much higher yields than have been observed in chamber experiments, or when increasing yields to their upper limit estimates accounting for recently reported losses of vapors to chamber walls. Including SOA from primary semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (P-S/IVOCs) following the parameterizations of Robinson et al. (2007), Grieshop et al. (2009), or Pye and Seinfeld (2010) improves model/measurement agreement for mass concentration at shorter photochemical ages (0.5 days). Our results strongly suggest that other precursors besides VOCs are needed to explain the observed SOA concentrations.\nIn contrast, all of the literature P-S/IVOC parameterizations over-predict urban SOA formation at long photochemical ages (3 days) compared to observations from multiple sites, which can lead to problems in regional and global modeling. Sensitivity studies that reduce the IVOC emissions by one-half in the model improve SOA predictions at these long ages. In addition, when IVOC emissions in the Robinson et al. parameterization are constrained using recently reported measurements of these species model/measurement agreement is achieved.\nThe amounts of SOA mass from diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles, and cooking emissions are estimated to be 16 – 27%, 35 – 61%, and 19 – 35%, respectively, depending on the parameterization used, which is consistent with the observed fossil fraction of urban SOA, 71(±3)%. The percentage of SOA from diesel vehicle emissions is the same, within the estimated uncertainty, as reported in previous work that analyzed the weekly cycles in SOA concentrations (Bahreini et al., 2012; Hayes et al., 2013). However, the modeling work presented here suggests a strong anthropogenic source of modern carbon in urban SOA, possibly cooking emissions, that was not accounted for in those previous studies, and which is higher on weekends.",

            "abstract": "We present a new global model of oceanic crustal thickness based on inversion of global oceanic gravity anomaly and constrained by seismic crustal thickness profiles. Models of residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomaly (RMBA) were first calculated by removing from free-air gravity anomaly all gravitational effects that can be estimated using independent constraints, including seafloor topography, sediment thickness, and age-dependent thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere. Models of gravity-derived crustal thickness were then calculated through inversion of the RMBA using best-fitting gravity-modeling parameters obtained from comparison with seismically determined crustal thickness profiles. Model results reveal that bout 5% of the global model crustal volume (or 9% of the global oceanic surface area) is associated with model crustal thickness <5.2 km (designated as “thin” crust). About 56% of the global crustal volume (or 65% of the surface area) is associated with model crustal thickness of 5.2-8.6 km thick (designated as “normal” crust). The remaining 39% of the global crustal volume (or 26% of the surface area) is associated with model crustal thickness >8.6 km (designated as “thick” crust) and is interpreted to have been affected by excess magmatism. Distribution of thickened model crust (>8.6 km) seems to depend on spreading rate and lithospheric age: (1) On ocean basins younger than 5 Ma, regions of thickened model crust are predominantly associated with slow and ultraslow spreading ridges. The relatively strong lithospheric plate at slow and ultraslow ridges might facilitate to support the loading of large magmatic emplacements. (2) In contrast, model crustal thickness near fast and intermediately fast spreading ridges typically does not exceed 7-8 km. As the crustal age increases and the lithospheric plate thickens, however, regions of thickened crust start to develop. (3) The integrated crustal volume depends on both spreading rate and age: For fast and intermediately fast ocean crust, peak values in the integrated crustal volume were reached at about 40-50 Ma and 70-80 Ma. The newly constructed global models of gravity-derived crustal thickness, combining with geochemical and other constraints, can be used to investigate the processes of oceanic crustal accretion and evolution.",

            "abstract": "In water management, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events (especially droughts and floods) are likely to require modifications of management strategies and, in some cases, new infrastructure. In light of these and other challenges, there is a serious need to improve the applicability of water resources research to real-world decision making. Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have shown promise in being able to generate and evaluate new planning alternatives under these conditions, but there has not yet been work that seeks to use a co-production framework to extensively test their efficacy. A group of engineering, social science, and climate researchers collaborated with practitioners from two municipal water providers to design this interdisciplinary study. The focus of the research is to co-produce and test a MOEA-based decision tool directly with a group of water managers from six water utilities from Colorado’s Front Range: Cities of Boulder, Aurora, and Fort Collins, Denver Water, Colorado Springs Utilities, and Northern Water. As part of the co-production of the MOEA testbed, managers provided critical insight on problem formulations, hydrology and demand scenarios, and a hypothetical water supply network using a workshop format. A problem formulation consists of objectives that measure performance, management options that decision makers can change, and constraints that represent acceptable limits for performance. The hypothetical network is based on feedback from our participating utilities and is representative of the water management context along the Front Range of Colorado. This presentation will focus on results from an initial workshop with water managers and provide insights on how our approach can help bridge the gap between decision support research and real-world water management. Our study seeks to inform a set of best practices for incorporating a MOEA-based decision tool in the decision making processes of utilities, to support water supply operations and systems that can adequately respond to a range of uncertain futures. Additionally, this project aims to demonstrate to water resources researchers and practitioners the efficacy of an interdisciplinary co-production framework for improving uptake of innovative decision support tools.",

            "abstract": "Ultramafic arc plutons, key tracers of subduction zone magmatism, are present as Alaskan-type intrusions (no orthopyroxene) and a wide range of mineralogically diverse (ol-opx-cpx-hbl) intrusions. Turnagain (Alaskan-type) and Giant Mascot (opx-rich) are two Mesozoic mid-crustal ultramafic bodies in the Cordillera of British Columbia. They preserve lithologic, trace element, and isotopic records of magmatic evolution and crustal assimilation during the earliest stages of fractionation from mantle wedge-derived magmas. These processes are highlighted by sulfide saturation mechanisms in their respective oxidized parent magmas and the formation of significant magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization at Turnagain (1841.8 Mt at 0.21% Ni) and Giant Mascot (4.2 Mt at 0.77% Ni and 0.34% Cu). The intrusions represent mid-crustal magma conduits through which magmas laden with Mg-rich olivine and pyroxene ascended, stalled, fractionated, locally assimilated fusible pyrite- and graphite-bearing metasedimentary rocks, and ultimately left their crystal cargos as cumulates. Their extrusive components are picritic to ankaramitic basalts. The combined effects of fractional crystallization, sulfide melt segregation, and re-equilibration with sulfide melt are recorded by notable Ni-in-olivine variations. At Turnagain, there is a direct correlation between the presence of sulfide and partially digested phyllite blocks, which is reflected in a broad range of relatively light S isotope ratios. This contrasts with restricted near-mantle S isotope values from the steeply plunging Ni-sulfide pipes at Giant Mascot where sulfide saturation occurred in response to assimilation of host granitoids and schists. Many other similar Paleozoic to Mesozoic ultramafic intrusions in the North American Cordillera, extending from Alaska to Baja, also represent former magma pathways that potentially capture the record of arc growth through magmatic and mineralization processes from primitive arc magmas.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of Mercury’s topography is crucial to understanding Mercury’s complex geology and history, as well as its current rotation state. From onboard the MESSENGER spacecraft, the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) made around 26 million measurements of Mercury’s topography, with radial and horizontal accuracies of ~10 m and ~100 m, respectively. Prior to orbit insertion in 2011, MESSENGER conducted three gravity-assist flybys of Mercury. During the January and October 2008 flybys, MLA made its first altimetric measurements, but the radial and horizontal accuracies were respectively limited to ~100 and ~1000 meters due to uncertainties in the spacecraft and planetary ephemerides. To reduce these geolocation uncertainties, the MLA flyby data have been compared to images taken by the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS), another instrument on MESSENGER. Stereo image pairs acquired by MDIS were selected from a database of over 500,000 image pairs located within 5 degrees of the equator. The selected stereo pairs have high surface resolutions (~200 m/pixel), large overlap areas (overlap ratio > 0.3), and well-matched illumination conditions. Using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline, digital elevation models (DEMs) were constructed from the image pairs that contained MLA flyby data points. We then ran an alignment program on these DEMs to match included MLA altimetry bounce points as closely as possible to the DEM surfaces. The resulting estimated track displacements were aggregated, and the general trends of these displacements can be used to perform a full-flyby orbit adjustment. Such an adjustment would enable more reliable determination of Mercury’s surface elevation and MESSENGER’s trajectory during the 2008 flybys. Accurate elevation measurements from these flybys are especially important because they passed over the southern hemisphere, where MLA coverage from the orbital mission is sparse. Calibration of these MLA data will improve our knowledge of Mercury’s orientation and equatorial topography.",

            "abstract": "Economic development, population growth, and the changing diets and lifestyles of a growing middle class are expected to lead to increasing demands for water, food, and energy in the future. Meanwhile, climate change may cause localized resource scarcity and exacerbate the supply challenges. Moreover, there is a growing awareness that the supply systems for water, food, and energy are inextricably linked and cannot be evaluated in independent silos. Rather, integrated approaches are needed that can identify the potential trade-offs and synergies among sectors, identify holistic solutions, and evaluate the impacts of socioeconomic and hydroclimatic change. Some initial efforts at modeling the energy-water-food nexus in an integrated fashion have been attempted, but they all suffer from limitations and much more research is needed.\nThis study provides a review of the current state-of-the-art in modeling the energy-water-food nexus at both global and regional scales, identifies limitations associated with existing approaches, and proposes specific recommendations for improving nexus assessments. Some limitations of existing models include insufficient spatial resolution for assessing water constraints in the energy sector, inadequate representation of the linkages among sectors, limited assessment of the impacts of socioeconomic and hydroclimatic change, limited inclusion of water conveyance, simplistic downscaling of water and energy demands, and the lack of a consistent framework for global nexus assessment. In addition, research gaps are identified by graphically classifying existing nexus assessments according to their spatial resolution, coverage of nexus sectors and linkages, and suitability for assessing the main drivers of global change (e.g., development, urbanization, technology, and climate change). The final portion of the study proposes recommendations for addressing the research gaps and identifies tremendous opportunity for developing better models and assessment tools for informing the design and deployment of future sustainable food, water, and energy supply systems.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of when the geodynamo started is important for understanding the evolution of the atmosphere and life on Earth. Full vector paleointensity measurements of Archean to Hadean zircons bearing magnetic inclusions from the Jack Hills conglomerate (Western Australia) allow a for reconstruction of the early history of the geodynamo (Tarduno et al., 2015). Data from zircons between 3.3 and 4.2 billion-years-old record magnetic fields varying between 1.0 and 0.12 times recent equatorial field strengths. These magnetizations can only be read using highly sensitive cryogenic magnetometers such as the ultra-high resolution 3-component DC SQUID small bore magnetometer at the University of Rochester. The direct measurement of each component of magnetization separates this class of magnetometer from one-axis instruments that have an inherent limitation due to non-uniqueness. Only a few laboratories have instrumentation/procedures with the resolution to accurately record directions and paleointensities (see presentations by Dare et al., 2015, and Cottrell et al., 2015). For example, data from Weiss et al. (2015) are too noisy to examine Paleoarchean to Hadean magnetic fields. In contrast, our high-resolution paleointensity and age data suggest the presence of a terrestrial core dynamo more than 750 million years earlier than prior estimates. This early start for the geodynamo is similar to that suggested for the early Martian magnetic field. However, the subsequent collapse of the Martian dynamo probably facilitated atmospheric stripping. In contrast, the early start and persistence of atmospheric shielding associated with the long-lived geodynamo was likely a key factor in the development of Earth as a habitable planet. Paleomagnetic evidence for these ancient magnetic fields will be discussed as will the role of planetary magnetic shielding.",

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration, stable C isotopes, absorbance, and fluorescence were used to distinguish DOM sources in two adjacent watersheds, the Arboleda and the Taconazo, which are similar in size, soils, rainfall, and vegetation, yet differ because the Arboleda receives a significant input of regional groundwater that is chemically distinct from the local groundwater, whereas the Taconazo does not. Characteristics of the DOM differed largely among the two streams. Fluorescence and isotope data suggested that more degraded DOM was predominant during dry periods in the Arboleda due to the influence of regional groundwater in that stream. During wet periods, fresher soil-derived DOM was predominant in both streams, similar to the quality of DOM in the Taconazo during base flow. DOM δ13C values of the Arboleda during baseflow ranged from -23 to -34‰, while in the Taconazo values ranged from -25 to -34‰. During storm flow the ranges were smaller and more similar. The Taconazo ranged from -23 to -29‰ and the Arboleda ranged from -23 to -31‰. These differences were more noticeable at baseflow and during the dry season (December to April), suggesting that the DOM from regional groundwater entering the Arboleda had less of an impact when heavily diluted by soil DOM mobilized by precipitation.\nIn both streams, during periods of heavy precipitation, DOM concentrations were much higher than during base flow. Further, at baseflow the Arboleda showed generally lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than the Taconazo, yet export of DOC from the Arboleda watershed was far higher than from the Taconazo due to the large contribution by regional groundwater to the Arboleda water export. Results from this research emphasize the role of regional groundwater in shaping the quality of the organic matter in receiving streams, and their importance as conduits for surface transport of subsurface carbon.",

Abundant minerals in these inclusions are kaersutite, aluminous (7.3-9.7 wt% Al2O3), calcic clinopyroxene, primarily diopside, and olivine (Mg# 69-73) with accessory spinel, sulfide and apatite. Although most apatites are fluor-hydroxyapatite solid solutions, one xenolith contains Cl- and OH-rich apatite suggesting that Cl may have been an important constituent in the parent magma(s) . The xenoliths show abundant evidence for equilibration at relatively low temperatures including amphibole and orthopyroxene exsolution in clinopyroxene, and granules of magnetite in hercynite hosts. If latter texture is due to exsolution, then this particular Group II xenolith equilibrated at temperatures near or below 500oC or at a depth of about 15 km along a conductive geotherm. It may be that all the Group II xenoliths equilibrated at low temperatures given the abundant exsolution textures although Fe-Mg exchange relations suggest equilibration at temperatures in excess of 800oC. Low equilibration temperatures are in conflict with the unusually high equilibration temperatures, >1200oC (Smith, 2000) displayed by Group I xenoliths from this same volcanic field. Taken at face value, the geothermometric results indicate unusually high temperatures in the upper mantle, normal temperatures in the crust and the possibility of a kinked geotherm in the region. Curiously the LCVF lies in an area of “normal” heat flow, south of the Battle Mountain area of high heat flow but the number of heat flow measurements in the Lunar Crater area is very low (Humphreys et al., 2003; Sass, 2005).\n ",

Because this region is uniquely located close to the highly polluted Indian plateau, air mass with high aerosol concentration can be easily transported to this area. These small cumulus clouds, coupled with the effects of aerosol, have a large potential to affect the regional and global albedo. The aerosol effects on cloud properties and atmospheric structures are examined in this work, using the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data that are observed from CARDEX (Cloud, Aerosol, Radiative forcing, Dynamics EXperiment) and MAC (Maldives Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle Campaign). On average, the high polluted cases show warmer temperature through the entire atmospheric column and higher relative humidity in boundary layer. The maximum temperature difference between high and low polluted cases can be found around the cloud layer altitude. In addition, the height of sub-cloud mixed layer is higher in low polluted cases. Clouds in high polluted cases are generally becoming narrower and taller than those in low polluted cases, and are associated with greater cloud water content and higher cloud droplet number concentrations, especially in small droplet range (diameters less than 10 micrometers). Meanwhile, the effective radius of cloud droplets decreases as the aerosol concentration increases. These facts indicate that the high polluted clouds are on average brighter with higher albedo.",

            "abstract": "The role of abrasion of rock cliffs is typically considered in the long-term presence of a beach. During monthly monitoring of hard rock cliff erosion along the North Yorkshire coast, UK, we have observed a number of small ephemeral beaches of highly variable duration and extent. The erosive significance of the temporary presence of sediment at the cliffs is unknown and we set out to examine whether observed alongshore variability in erosion can be linked to the presence of ephemeral beaches. We explore the temporal and spatial variability in sediment deposition and transport along a low-sediment rock coast foreshore, the controlling marine conditions and the effects on cliff erosion.\nWe focus on a 500 m wide embayment set into 70 m high hard rock cliffs consisting of horizontally bedded Jurassic mudstone, shale, siltstone and sandstone. The bay has a wide, shallow gradient foreshore up to 300 m wide with highly variable topography. With the exception of an ephemeral beach (of widths up to approximately 150 m alongshore and 10 m cross-shore) the rock foreshore is typically sand-free, with failed material from the cliffs quickly removed from the cliff toe by the sea leaving only boulders. The high tidal range (6 m) and storm wave environment of the North Sea result in variable marine conditions at the site.\nWe use magnetic sand tracers and a grid of foreshore and cliff face magnets to examine the sand transport across the foreshore and to identify the vertical extent of cliff face impacted by sand. We monitor the driving marine conditions on the foreshore using a network of current meters and wave pressure sensors. Erosion of the cliff face across the whole bay is monitored at high-resolution using terrestrial laser scanning to examine the spatial distribution of abrasion and the influence of the ephemeral beach.",

            "abstract": "Six large rivers, including the Yukon and Mackenzie in North America and the Yenisey, Ob', Lena, and Kolyma in Eurasia, drain the majority of the watershed area surrounding the Arctic Ocean. Parallel sampling programs were initiated at downstream locations on these rivers in 2003 to improve estimates of fluvial export and track large-scale perturbations associated with climate change. Over a decade later, synthesis of water chemistry data from these ongoing sampling efforts provides an unprecedented opportunity to 1) examine similarities and differences among the major Arctic rivers, and 2) think critically about how changes in various water chemistry parameters may or may not inform us about climate change impacts. River-borne organic matter characteristics may be particularly telling because mass flux values and composition/source indicators vary with hydrology and permafrost coverage. However, separating climate impacts that occur within river corridors from those that occur beyond them may be difficult, especially when considering changes in particulate organic matter (POM) loads. Data on suspended POM yields, C:N ratios, stable isotope ratios, and radiocarbon content in the major Arctic rivers show marked spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability that is helpful for thinking about how climate change effects may manifest in the future, but it will be challenging to separate changes in POM related to bank erosion and suspension/deposition of in situ sediment stocks from changes in POM that may be linked to processes such as permafrost thaw occurring across the broader landscape.",

            "abstract": "Soils contain approximately half of Earth’s terrestrial carbon. As such, it is important to understand the factors that control the cycling of this soil organic carbon between the land and the atmosphere. Models that attribute the persistence of soil organic carbon to the intrinsic properties of the molecules themselves are inconsistent with recent observations— for example, materials that are more thermodynamically stable have been found to have a shorter lifetime in soils than ones that are less stable, and vice versa. A new explanation has therefore been posited that invokes ecosystem properties as a whole, and not just intrinsic molecular properties, as the kinetic factor controlling soil carbon dynamics. Because soil dynamics occur on a small scale, techniques with high spatial resolution are required for their study. Existing techniques such as TOF-SIMS require preparation of the sample and introduction into a high vacuum system, and do not address the need to examine large numbers of sample systems without perturbation of chemical and physical properties. To address this analytical challenge, we have coupled a laser ablation (LA) module to an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), thereby enabling sample introduction and subsequent measurement of small amounts of soil organic matter by the laser ablation aerosol mass spectrometer (LA-AMS). Due to the adjustable laser beam width, the LA-AMS can probe spot sizes ranging from 1-150 μm in diameter, liberating from 10-100 ng/pulse. With a detection limit of 1 pM, the AMS allows for chemical characterization of the ablated material in terms of elemental ratios, compound classes, and TOC/TOM ratios. Furthermore, the LA-AMS is capable of rapid, in-situ sampling under ambient conditions, thereby eliminating the need for sample processing or transport before analysis. Here, we will present the first results from systematic studies aimed at validating the LA-AMS method as well as results from initial measurements of the temporal and spatial distribution of chemical species, illuminating carbon dynamics in soil and the rhizosphere and their role in the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitously present in volcanic and hydrothermal gases. Their relative abundances have been demonstrated to be sensitive to physical and chemical parameters, suggesting VOCs as potential tools for evaluating deep reservoir conditions. Nevertheless, reaction pathways for VOC production at hydrothermal conditions are still poorly understood. Reversible catalytic reforming may be responsible for the high abundance of benzene observed in hydrothermal gases relative to saturated hydrocarbons. The dehydrogenation of n-hexane to benzene could proceed with C6 cyclic hydrocarbons as intermediates, as suggested by the relative enrichment in cyclic hydrocarbons observed in gases originating at T <150 °C. In this study, laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the production of benzene from cyclic hydrocarbons at 300°C and 85 bar. At these conditions in pure water, negligible benzene is produced from cyclohexane after 10 days. The presence of a mineral phase, especially sphalerite, favored the formation of both benzene and cyclohexene. The efficiency of dehydroaromatization reaction increased at increasing mineral/cyclohexane ratio, pointing to a surface catalyzed reaction. The catalytic action of sphalerite on the C-H bonds was confirmed by the large abundance of deuterated cyclohexane resulted in D2O experiments. The same experiment carried out using cyclohexene in pure water mainly produced methyl-cyclopentenes (via isomerization) and cyclohexanol (via oxygenation). In presence of sphalerite, the production of significant amounts of benzene confirmed the critical role of this mineral for the aromatization of cyclic compounds under hydrothermal conditions. Contrarily, products from cyclohexene solution phase oxidation using Cu(II) mainly consisted of oxygenated VOCs.",

Most TCD analyses use a method of differencing two raster-based digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from interpolated point data. In order to maximum our understanding of topographic change processes, spatial uncertainty in the DEMs must be adequately accounted for before TCD results are tested against some hydraulic or geomorphic hypothesis. A TCD analysis was conducted from 2008 to 2014 for the ~37-km stretch of the lower Yuba River in Northern California. This time period experienced four floodway filling flow events ranging from 5.9 – 8.8 times bankfull discharge (corresponding to ~2.5-5 year recurrence intervals, respectively). The lower Yuba River provides an excellent site to study fluvial change processes as these moderate and frequent overbank flow events rework the gravels and cobbles left from a legacy of hydraulic mining. This study (1) develops a new method for characterizing DEM uncertainty by using a bootstrapping approach to create confidence intervals for each raster cell value based on the point density and surface variability (2) classifies the TCD results into fluvial change processes (e.g. channel downcutting, overbank scour, bar emergence…etc.) and (3) quantifies the sediment budgets at the segment, reach, and morphological unit scale. DEMs were created from a combination of airborne LiDAR with green and near-infrared lasers, single and multibeam sonar, and RTK-GPS surveys. Results show significant topographic change for the floodway area with a net erosional sediment regime and a slightly depositional sediment regime within the 2008 bankfull channel.",

Through the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study, we have mapped forest disturbances for the conterminous United States using dense time series Landsat observations. The derived map products revealed that more than 50% of the forests in SE-US were harvested or disturbed by other forms of human or natural disturbance events at least once between 1986 and 2010. These products are being analyzed together with ancillary GIS data sets and field inventory data to identify industrial forests and to quantify their logging intensity, timber output, recovery rate, and the harvest-regrowth cycle.

            "abstract": "The behavior of a persistent uranium plume in an extended groundwater- river water (GW-SW) interaction zone at the DOE Hanford site is dominantly controlled by river stage fluctuations in the adjacent Columbia River. The plume behavior is further complicated by substantial heterogeneity in physical and geochemical properties of the host aquifer sediments. Multi-scale field and laboratory experiments and reactive transport modeling were integrated to understand the complex plume behavior influenced by highly variable hydrologic and geochemical conditions in time and space. In this presentation we (1) describe multiple data sets from field-scale uranium adsorption and desorption experiments performed at our experimental well-field, (2) develop a reactive transport model that incorporates hydrologic and geochemical heterogeneities characterized from multi-scale and multi-type datasets and a surface complexation reaction network based on laboratory studies, and (3) compare the modeling and observation results to provide insights on how to refine the conceptual model and reduce prediction uncertainties. The experimental results revealed significant spatial variability in uranium adsorption/desorption behavior, while modeling demonstrated that ambient hydrologic and geochemical conditions and heterogeneities in sediment physical and chemical properties both contributed to complex plume behavior and its persistence. Our analysis provides important insights into the characterization, understanding, modeling, and remediation of groundwater contaminant plumes influenced by surface water and groundwater interactions.",

            "abstract": "Land surface hydrology models serve as an effective approach to simulate hydrological processes, especially in areas which lack in situ observational datasets. A key component to constraining the water, energy, and carbon dynamics within these models is land surface albedo because it links these cycles by driving evapotranspiration and also helps characterize soil infiltration behavior. However, most hydrological models estimate the land surface albedo based on generalized climatologic information, which can introduce uncertainty into the surface energy balance processes and water storage availability in the root-zone if done improperly. In particular, changes in surface albedo can have significant effects where dynamic and spatially heterogeneous land surface changes occur due to abrupt land cover changes, such as wildfire. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world. Thus, the current study employs the new parameterization approach based on estimated change of surface albedo due to fires over different land cover types using long term MODIS time series in the catchment-based land surface model to investigate the potential for improving soil moisture and evapotranspiration simulations in fire-prone Northern Sub-Saharan Africa. We also compare the estimated soil moisture based on new and pre-existing baseline parameterization scheme to remotely-sensed observations obtained from satellite-based soil moisture observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the recently launched satellite, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instruments.",

            "abstract": "Maintaining and archiving accurate site metadata is critical for seismic network operations. The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) Station Information System (SIS) is a repository of seismic network field equipment, equipment response, and other site information. Currently, there are 187 different sensor models and 114 data-logger models in SIS.\nSIS has a web-based user interface that allows network operators to enter information about seismic equipment and assign response parameters to it. It allows users to log entries for sites, equipment, and data streams. Users can also track when equipment is installed, updated, and/or removed from sites.\nWhen seismic equipment configurations change for a site, SIS computes the overall gain of a data channel by combining the response parameters of the underlying hardware components. Users can then distribute this metadata in standardized formats such as FDSN StationXML or dataless SEED. One powerful advantage of SIS is that existing data in the repository can be leveraged: e.g., new instruments can be assigned response parameters from the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Nominal Response Library (NRL), or from a similar instrument already in the inventory, thereby reducing the amount of time needed to determine parameters when new equipment (or models) are introduced into a network.\nSIS is also useful for managing field equipment that does not produce seismic data (eg power systems, telemetry devices or GPS receivers) and gives the network operator a comprehensive view of site field work. SIS allows users to generate field logs to document activities and inventory at sites. Thus, operators can also use SIS reporting capabilities to improve planning and maintenance of the network. Queries such as how many sensors of a certain model are installed or what pieces of equipment have active problem reports are just a few examples of the type of information that is available to SIS users.",

The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of time scales and relative magnitudes of climate forcing increase over time from pulse, continuous, and historical CO2 and thermal emissions. To estimate the amount of global warming that would be produced by thermal and CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, we calculate thermal emissions with thermal contents of fossil fuels and estimate CO2 emissions with emission factors from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5. We then use a schematic climate model mimicking Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 to investigate the climate forcing and the time-integrated climate forcing. We show that, considered globally, direct thermal forcing from fossil fuel combustion is about 1.71% the radiative forcing from CO2 that has accumulated in the atmosphere from past fossil fuel combustion. When a new power plant comes on line, the radiative forcing from the accumulation of released CO2 exceeds the thermal emissions from the power plant in less than half a year (and about 3 months for coal plants). Due to the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, CO2 radiative forcing greatly overwhelms direct thermal forcing on longer time scales. Ultimately, the cumulative radiative forcing from the CO2 exceeds the direct thermal forcing by a factor of ~100,000.",

            "abstract": "The urban and periurban area of Copiapó in the arid Atacama desert has more than 30 abandoned mine tailings, one active copper smelter, and 150,000 inhabitants. Fast development of the mining industry during the 19th century and unplanned growth has led to public concern about the presence of metals in soils and street dust. Recent floods and mud currents in the Copiapó watershed have introduced new solid material in about 40% of the urban area. We conducted a geochemical screening before and after the disaster in March 2015. We found concentrations as high as 1000 mg/kg of copper and 180 mg/kg of arsenic in urban soils. Since effective control measures require connecting sites of metal enrichment with the possible sources, we have performed a statistical analysis of metal association and complemented it with other analyses like x-ray diffraction. Cluster analyses of elemental compositions suggest that mud and tailing have different origins from the rest of the matrices, while soils and street dust have a similar one. Some clusters have a mix of matrices that suggest anthropogenic enrichment of some areas of Copiapó. Our initial results indicate that a correlation between observed enrichment and the copper smelter can be hypothesized for Cu, Pb, and Zn. Further spatial, statistical, and chemical analyses are needed to further confirm such findings, complemented with a thorough analysis of the baseline values that could be considered representative of the area. Future work include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Positive matrix factorization (PMF) to test the link contaminant sources and metal occurrence, while scanning electron microscopy can be used to identify the presence of smelter-related particles. The information generated by this research will be a necessary input for defining urban planning strategies and land use guidelines, defining health risk assessment studies, and for future evaluation of intervention priorities.\nAcknowledgements: Proyecto CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020",

            "abstract": "Despite advances in soil development theory based on studies of old soils or over long timescales, little is known about soil thresholds (dramatic changes in soil properties associated with only small shifts in external forcing factors) that might be expressed in young soils (less than 10 kyr). Therefore, we seek to understand infant soil development in a tropical environment through the sourcing of plant available base cations by measuring the strontium (Sr) isotopic composition of the soil exchange complex. Our sampling strategy spans soils in three different precipitation ranges (950-1060 mm, 1180-1210 mm, and 1450-1500) and an array of soil ages from 500 to 7500 years in the Kona region on the island of Hawaii. In Hawaiian soils, 87Sr/86Sr values are determined by a mixture of three components: a mantle-derived component from the lava (0.7034), a rainfall component (0.7093) and a component from continental dust (0.720). Elevation-controlled leaching intensity in the wettest localities produces a decline in the concentration of base cations supplied by basalt and a dilute resupply by rainfall. In the driest sites, where leaching intensity is dramatically reduced, there is a buildup of rainfall-derived extractable Sr in the soil over time. Slow rock weathering rates produce a small rock-derived cation input to the soil. Thus, Sr isotope signatures reflect both the input of rainfall-derived cations and rock-derived cations with values that fall between rainfall and basaltic signatures. Soils in the intermediate precipitation range have Sr isotopic signatures consistent with both the wet and dry trends; suggesting that they lie close to the critical precipitation amount that marks a shift between these two processes. For the Kona region, this transition seems to occur at 1200 mm /yr. In contrast to the clear-cut differentiation in strontium isotopes with precipitation shifts observed in older soils, patterns on these young soils in Kona are complicated by low soil water residence times and small surface to volume ratios for the rock. These factors lead to a kinetic limitation to the release of rock-derived Sr and other nutrient ions.",

            "abstract": "Biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane remain an important element to help mitigate the impacts of fossil fuels on the atmosphere. However, meeting fuel demands with biofuels requires technological advancement for water productivity and scale of production. This may translate into increased water demands for biofuel crops and potential for conflicts with incumbent crops and other water uses including domestic, hydropower generation and environmental. It is therefore important to evaluate the effects of increased biofuel production on the verge of water scarcity costs and hydropower production. The present research applies a hydro-economic optimization model to compare different scenarios of irrigated biofuel and hydropower production, and estimates the potential tradeoffs. A case study from the Araguari watershed in Brazil is provided. These results should be useful to (i) identify improved water allocation among competing economic demands, (ii) support water management and operations decisions in watersheds where biofuels are expected to increase, and (iii) identify the impact of bio fuel production in the water availability and economic value. Under optimized conditions, adoption of sugar cane for biofuel production heavily relies on the opportunity costs of other crops and hydropower generation. Areas with a lower value crop groups seem more suitable to adopt sugar cane for biofuel when the price of ethanol is sufficiently high and the opportunity costs of hydropower productions are not conflicting. The approach also highlights the potential for insights in water management from studying regional versus larger scales bundled systems involving water use, food production and power generation.",

            "abstract": "Dehydration accompanying metamorphism of sediment and hydrated mafic ocean crust during ocean plate subduction can potentially lead to fracturing and intraplate tremors. As rocks are buried, they lose porosity and permeability and eventually pass into the lithostatic pressure regime where the porosity and permeability are thought to be very small. Pore fluid pressure generation stemming from metamorphic reactions was modeled using the program SUTRAMET (Nabelek et al., 2014), which is a modified version of the program SUTRA (Voss & Provost, 2002). The program allows modeling of metamorphic reactions at high pressures and temperatures and incorporates transient porosity and permeability changes due to overpressure and changing volumes of metamorphic assemblages. Permeabilities (k) of 10-18 and 10-20 m2 within the brittle regime were modeled. The model assumes continuous subduction with fluids generated at horizons where specific P-T conditions for reactions exist. Temperature gradient was assumed to be 10°C/km and the vertical component of subduction velocity to be at 0.85 cm/y. The model reactions in sediment (Campito Formation of western California as a proxy) and average MORB were generated by the program Theriak-Domino (de Capitani and Petrakakis, 2010). The initial sediment mineralogy includes albite, K-feldspar, phengite, chlorite, and lawsonite. The final mineralogy for the 10°C/km gradient is quartz, phengite, garnet, and pyroxene with jadeite and acmite components. The initial mineralogy of MORB includes chlorite, amphibole, pumpelyite, albite and quartz and the final eclogite mineralogy includes garnet, cpx, kyanite and quartz.\nCalculations show that at k = 10-18 m2, pore fluid pressure can reach 450 MPa. Pore pressure is reduced by negative ∆V of mineral assemblages stemming from reactions; nevertheless, for the garnet-forming reaction, pore pressure is about 110 MPa. Assuming a tensile strength of 15 MPa and fracture aperture given by rock compressibility, fracturing allows reduction of pore pressure to this level. That is not the case, however, for k = 10-20 m2. Even with fracturing and accounting for negative ∆V, pore pressure can reach 300 MPa for garnet-forming reactions. This pressure may exceed the sheer strength within the brittle regime of a subducting slab.",

            "abstract": "Debris flows dominate bedrock erosion and sediment transport in very steep mountain channels, and are often initiated from failure of channel-bed alluvium during storms. While several theoretical models exist to predict mass failures, few have been tested because observations of in-channel bed failures are extremely limited. To fill this gap in our understanding, we performed laboratory flume experiments to identify the conditions necessary to initiate bed failures in non-cohesive sediment of different sizes (D = 0.7 mm to 15 mm) on steep channel-bed slopes (S = 0.45 to 0.93) and in the presence of water flow. In beds composed of sand, failures occurred under sub-saturated conditions on steep bed slopes (S > 0.5) and under super-saturated conditions at lower slopes. In beds of gravel, however, failures occurred only under super-saturated conditions at all tested slopes, even those approaching the dry angle of repose. Consistent with theoretical models, mass failures under super-saturated conditions initiated along a failure plane approximately one grain-diameter below the bed surface, whereas the failure plane was located near the base of the bed under sub-saturated conditions. However, all experimental beds were more stable than predicted by 1-D infinite-slope stability models. In partially saturated sand, enhanced stability appears to result from suction stress. Enhanced stability in gravel may result from turbulent energy losses in pores or increased granular friction for failures that are shallow with respect to grain size. These grain-size dependent effects are not currently included in stability models for non-cohesive sediment, and they may help to explain better the timing and location of debris flow occurrence.",

            "abstract": "Photospheric magnetic field has been measured since 1950s and digital synoptic data exists since 1970s. We study the long-term development of photospheric and coronal magnetic fields, using Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), Mount Wilson, Kitt Peak, Solis, SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI measurements of the photospheric magnetic field and the the potential field source surface (PFSS) model. We pay particular attention to the occurrence of the hemispheric asymmetry of the coronal field. The solar and heliospheric magnetic fields are systematically north-south asymmetric. The southward shift of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) (the so-called Bashful ballerina phenomenon) is a persistent pattern, which occurs typically for about three years during the late declining phase of solar cycle. Multipole analysis of the photospheric magnetic field has shown that the Bashful ballerina is mainly due to the g02 quadrupole term, which is oppositely signed to the dipole moment and reflects the larger magnitude of the southern polar field.\nThe six data sets are in general in a good agreement with each other, but the different spatial resolution causes difference some in results. Moreover, there are number of deviations in different individual data sets that are not related to resolution, e.g., in WSO data and in the current version of Kitt Peak 512 channel magnetograph data. We note that the two lowest harmonic coefficients do not scale with the overall magnitude of photospheric synoptic magnetic maps. Scaling factors based on histogram techniques can be as large as 10 (from Wilcox to HMI), but the corresponding factor in dipole strength is typically less than two. Scaling also depends on the harmonic coefficient. This should be noted, e.g., when using synoptic maps as input for coronal models. We find that, despite the differences between the six different data sets, especially in the measurements at the highest latitudes, they all support the southward shift of the HCS. At the moment, polar fields have reversed and are strengthening especially in the southern hemisphere, leading to the bashful ballerina, but it is not necessary the final condition during the solar minimum after solar cycle 24. Accordingly, it seems that the Ballerina will be bashful even during cycle 24, although final conclusions must wait the later declining phase.",

            "abstract": "Has 20thcentury global warming resulted in increases of extreme warm temperatures and decreases of extreme cold temperatures around the globe? One would certainly expect this to be so if the changes in the extreme temperature probabilities were determined only by the mean shift and not by changes in the width and/or shape of the temperature distribution. In reality, however, the latter two effects could also be important. Even ignoring changes of shape, it is easily shown that a 25% reduction of standard deviation, for example, can completely offset the effect of a mean positive shift of 0.5 standardized units on the probabilities of extreme positive values. A 25% increase of standard deviation can similarly offset the effect of the mean shift on the probabilities of extreme negative values. It is possible for such changes of standard deviation to occur in regions of large circulation and storminess changes associated with global warming.\nWith this caveat in mind, we have investigated the change in probability of extreme weekly-averaged near-surface air temperatures, in both winter and summer, from the first half-century (1901-1950) to the last half-century (1960-2009) of the 1901 to 2009 period. We have done this using two newly available global atmospheric datasets (ERA-20C and 20CR-v2c) and large ensembles of global coupled climate model simulations of this period, plus very large ensembles of uncoupled atmospheric model simulations of our own. The results are revealing. In the tropics, the changes in the extreme warm and cold temperature probabilities are indeed generally consistent with those expected from the mean shift of the distribution. Outside the tropics, however, they are generally significantly inconsistent with the mean temperature shift, with many regions showing little or no change in the positive temperature extremes and in some instances even a decrease. In such regions, it is clear that the change in the temperature standard deviation is important. The discrepancies in the estimated extreme changes among the model simulations and observational datasets are also largely attributable to the discrepancies in their estimated changes of standard deviation.",

            "abstract": "Processes determining biosphere-atmosphere coupling are strongly influenced by vegetation structure. Thus, ecosystem carbon sequestration and evapotranspiration affecting global carbon and water balances will depend upon the spatial extent of vegetation, its vertical structure, and its physiological variability. To represent this globally, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) coupled to General Circulation Models (GCMs) make use of satellite and/or model-based vegetation classifications often composed by homogeneous communities. This work aims at developing a new Global Vegetation Structure Dataset (GVSD) by incorporating varying vegetation heights for mixed plant communities to be used as input to the Ent Terrestrial Biosphere Model (TBM), the DGVM coupled to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM. Information sources include the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover and plant functional types (PFTs) (Friedl et al., 2010), vegetation height from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) (Simard et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014) along with the Global Data Sets of Vegetation Leaf Area Index (LAI)3g (Zhu et al. 2013). Further PFT partitioning is performed according to a climate classification utilizing the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and the NOAA Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data. Final products are a GVSD consisting of mixed plant communities (e.g. mixed forests, savannas, mixed PFTs) following the Ecosystem Demography model (Moorcroft et al., 2001) approach represented by multi-cohort community patches at the sub-grid level of the GCM, which are ensembles of identical individuals whose differences are represented by PFTs, canopy height, density and vegetation structure sensitivity to allometric parameters. To assess the sensitivity of the GISS GCM to vegetation structure, we produce a range of estimates of Ent TBM biomass and plant densities by varying allometric specifications. Ultimately, this GVSD will serve as a template for community data sets, and be used as boundary conditions to the Ent TBM for prediction of canopy albedo in the Analytical Clumped Two-Stream canopy radiative transfer scheme, biomass, primary productivity, respiration, and GISS GCM climate.",

We present results of a highly detailed, spatially explicit mechanistic modelling study exploring the relationships between the environment and malaria in the current and future climate of West Africa. A mechanistic model of human immunity was incorporated into an existing agent-based model of malaria transmission, allowing us to move beyond entomological measures such as mosquito density and vectorial capacity to analyzing the prevalence of the malaria parasite within human populations. The result is a novel modelling tool that mechanistically simulates all of the key processes linking environment to malaria transmission.\nSimulations were conducted across climate zones in West Africa, linking temperature and rainfall to entomological and epidemiological variables with a focus on nonlinearities due to threshold effects and interannual variability. Comparisons to observations from the region confirmed that the model provides a reasonable representation of the entomological and epidemiological conditions in this region. We used the predictions of future climate from the most credible CMIP5 climate models to predict the change in frequency and severity of malaria epidemics in West Africa as a result of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Policymakers must often decide how to proceed when presented with conflicting simulation data from hydrological, climatological, and geological models. While laboratory sciences often appeal to the reproducibility of results to argue for the validity of their conclusions, simulations cannot use this strategy for a number of pragmatic and methodological reasons. However, robustness of predictions and causal structures can serve the same function for simulations as reproducibility does for laboratory experiments and field observations in either adjudicating between conflicting results or showing that there is insufficient justification to externally validate the results. Additionally, an interpretation of the argument from robustness is presented that involves appealing to the convergence of many well-built and diverse models rather than the more common version which involves appealing to the probability that one of a set of models is likely to be true. This interpretation strengthens the case for taking robustness as an additional requirement for the validation of simulation results and ultimately supports the idea that computer simulations can provide information about the world that is just as trustworthy as data from more traditional laboratory studies and field observations. Understanding the importance of robust results for the validation of simulation data is especially important for policymakers making decisions on the basis of potentially conflicting models. Applications will span climate, hydrological, and hydroclimatological models.",

The successful application of photometric models to characterize the physical properties of airless planetary surfaces requires observations which span the broadest possible range of viewing and illumination geometries, from full disk to thin crescent. While New Horizons observed the Pluto system at phase angles no smaller than 15°, full-disk Hubble Space Telescope images (HST Program 13367, M. Buie, PI) at phase angles between 0.06° and 1.7° constrain the phase function near opposition. Together with New Horizons disk-resolved images, we use the near-opposition phase function to test whether ejecta exchange between Pluto’s satellites (Stern 2009, Icarus 199, 571) affects their photometric properties. Using the size of the small satellites measured by New Horizons, we determine the disk-integrated geometric albedo by extrapolating the HST observations to zero phase. New Horizons observations at larger phase angles reveal surface roughness and directional scattering properties. Finally we place the photometric properties of Pluto’s small satellites in context with those of similar size in other planetary systems.",

In this study, we conducted multi-stage drained triaxial tests on laboratory synthesized CH4-HBS samples, which were formed in sand-clay mixtures (5%wt kaolinite) to have non-cementing habits. Three different effective confining stresses, σ3′ = 0.69, 1.38, and 2.76 MPa, were applied on the HBS with the hydrate saturation, Sh, in the range of 0 to ~ 40%. The result confirms that the strength and stiffness of HBS increases with effective confining stress and hydrate saturation. It is also demonstrated that when compared to the cementing HBS, the non-cementing HBS has lower strength and cohesion, owing to less inter-particle adhesion effects from non-cementing hydrate.",

Because of these deleterious effects, multinational strategies to alter technology and reduce emissions have been proposed, but to date, they have ignored many constraints on feasibility. We describe a framework to apportion national energy consumption among land types and household end-uses, to calculate emissions, and to evaluate mitigation strategies. We provide year-2010 emissions of particulate matter, black carbon, organic carbon, nitrogen oxides, methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The study area includes regions where solid biomass fuel provides more than 50% of total residential energy: Latin America, Africa, and Asia.\nUsing nightlight data and population density, we classify land types as urban, electrified rural with and without forest access, and non-electrified rural with and without forest access. We apportion national-level residential fuel consumption among land types and end-uses, and assign technologies to each combination. About 13% of energy is consumed in urban areas, and 45% in non-urban land near forests. About half the energy is consumed in land without access to electricity. Cooking accounts for 54% of consumption, heating 9%, and lighting only 2%, with unidentified uses making up the remainder.\nWe examine possible policies, considering realistic factors that constrain mitigation. Scenarios explored are: (1) cleanest current stove, where plausible existing technology is deployed; (2) stove standards, where stoves are designed to meet performance standards; and (3) clean fuels, where users adopt the cleanest plausible fuels; we assume that people living in forest access areas continue to use wood. For cleaner stoves, emission reductions range from 25-82%, depending on the pollutant. The clean-fuels scenario reduces emissions by 18-25%.",

However, the ability of the models to replicate the magnitude and direction of changes of different components of the hydrograph is not clear. Hence, we initiated a study to evaluate the replicability of the different streamflow components and their changes by employing the widely used Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model for the Fraser River Basin, Canada. We analyzed the replicability of a range of indicators of hydrologic alterations (IHA) by using climate inputs derived from gridded observations and statistically downscaled global climate models. Given that the hydrologic regime of the region is known to be influenced by teleconnections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we used hydrologic responses to the PDO and ENSO states as analogues for evaluating the model’s ability to simulate climate-induced changes to streamflow. The results show a generally good skill of the model in replicating the annual and peak flow related IHAs, but more limited replicability of the minimum flow and flow pulse related IHAs. Additionally, while the results revealed a generally good replication of the qualitative patterns and direction of changes between the different climate states, the magnitude of change for some of the indicators showed considerable differences. Hence, there is a need to exercise caution in the use of model-simulated indicators, and the replicability of both magnitude and direction of change need to be carefully examined before using the simulated indicators for projecting future changes to the flow regime.",

Soil degradation, caused by anthropogenic disturbance can decrease microbial abundance and activity, leading to changes in nutrient availability, soil organic matter, and plant establishment. The addition of amendments to disturbed soils have the potential ameliorate these negative consequences. We studied the effects of soil degradation, via an autoclave heat shock method, and the addition of amendments (biochar and woodchips) on microbial activity, soil carbon and nitrogen availability, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, and plant growth of ten plant species native to the semi-arid southwestern US. Relative to non-degraded soils, microbial activity, measured via extracellular enzyme assays, was significantly lower for all seven substrates assayed. These soils also had significantly lower amounts of carbon assimilated into microbial biomass but no change in microbial biomass nitrogen. Soil degradation had no effect on plant biomass. Amendments caused changes in microbial activity: biochar-amended soils had significant increases in potential activity with five of the seven substrates measured; woodchip amended soils had significant increases with two. Soil carbon increased with both amendments but this was not reflected in a significant change in microbial biomass carbon. Biochar-amended soils had increases in soil nitrogen availability but neither amendment caused changes in microbial biomass nitrogen. Biochar amendments had no significant effect on above- or belowground plant biomass while woodchips significantly decreased aboveground plant biomass. Results show that soil degradation decreases microbial activity and changes nutrient dynamics, but these are not reflected in changes in plant growth. Amendments provide nutrient sources and change soil pore space, which cause microbial activities to fluctuate and may, in the case of woodchips, increase plant drought stress. These results suggest that amendments can ameliorate the negative consequences of soil degradation but their effects are dependent on substrate quality, which influences plant growth and microbial responses.",

Uncertainty in the Cl+CH4 reaction affects the amount of chlorine in radical vs. reservoir forms and has a modest impact on present day SH polar ozone (~±6%), and on the rate of past SH polar ozone decline and future recovery. The O(1D)+N2O reaction has uncertainty in both the total rate coefficient and branching ratio for the O2+N2 and 2*NO product channels. This uncertainty results in a substantial range in present day stratospheric odd nitrogen (±10-25%) and global total ozone (±1-2.5%). This uncertainty also impacts the rate of past global total ozone decline and future recovery, with a range in future ozone projections of ±1-1.5% by 2100, relative to present day. The uncertainty ranges in calculated CH4 and N2O global lifetimes are also examined: these ranges are significantly reduced when using the updated SPARC estimated uncertainties compared with those from JPL-2010.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUposter_4 (1) (1).pdf\nSimulating seismic waves on uniform grids in realistic heterogeneous crustal media typically requires a relatively small grid spacing determined by the minimum velocity, which leads to a large number of grid points and small time step. Discontinuous grid (DG) methods, on the other hand, using finer grids in the lower-velocity region and coarser grids in the higher-velocity part of the model, are much more efficient for geological models including a wide range of seismic velocities. Here, we have developed a 3-D DG fourth-order staggered-grid visco-elastic finite difference (FD) method with a ratio of 3 between coarse and fine grid partitions, and we explore its numerical properties. In particular, we focus on the stability of the scheme for many timesteps (100,000+), often needed for regional and/or high-frequency simulations.\nFD DG implementations suffer inherently from stability problems due to the nature of exchange of wavefield information between the fine and coarse grids. In particular, staggered grids, where analytical stability conditions are less tractable, provide a challenge. The cause of instability is likely related to down-sampling of the wavefield from the fine grid into the coarse grid, and possibly the interpolation to obtain the wave field when transferring the wave field from coarse to fine grids. We have tested the accuracy and stability of several techniques to deal with these issues. For example, we have explored bilinear, bicubic and wavenumber domain interpolation approaches, which all tend to provide good accuracy. For the downsampling we have tested both Lanczo’s and Gaussian filters as well as a new approach, the Weakly Enforced Discontinuous Grid Interface Elements (WEDGIE) method. While these down sampling methods show a significant improvement of stability, our preliminary analysis suggests that stability is affected by several factors, including media properties, spatial dimension, the presence of absorbing boundaries, and anelastic attenuation. Specifically, we find that smaller visco-elastic models with little or no velocity variation near the fine and coarse grid interface and including absorbing boundary conditions tend to be more stable.",

            "abstract": "Soil is the most important long-term sink for carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems, containing more C than plant biomass and the atmosphere combined. However, soil has historically been under-represented in C cycling literature, especially in regards to information about subsurface (>1.0 m) layers and processes. Previous research has indicated that Andisols with large quantities of noncrystalline, variable-charge minerals, including allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite, contain more C both in total and at depth than other soil types in the Pacific Northwest. The electrostatic charge of variable-charge soils depends on pH and is sometimes net positive, particularly in acid conditions, such as those commonly developed under the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. However, even soils with a net negative charge may contain a mixture of negative and positive exchange sites and can hold some nutrient anions through the anion exchange capacity. The most abundant organic functional groups, including carboxylic and phenolic groups, are anionic in nature, and soil positive charge may play an important role in binding and stabilizing soil organic matter and sequestering C. To increase our understanding of the role of variable-charge minerals in soil organic matter stabilization in deep soils, samples were taken to a depth of 3 m at the Fall River Long-Term Soil Productivity Site in western Washington. This site has a deep, well-drained soil with few rocks, which developed from weathered basalt and is classified as an Andisol of the Boistfort Series. Analysis of soil charge characteristics over a pH range allowed for the determination of anion exchange capacity and point of zero net charge at 8 depth intervals. These results, along with total carbon analysis and C-14 dating at each depth interval, are used to evaluate the importance of the anion exchange capacity as a mechanism for storing carbon at depth in variable-charge soils.",

Though it is generally agreed that these large regional faults are responsible for creation of high relief and deep subsidence in the Coachella Valley, the timing, magnitude, and geometries of fault offsets on these structures are still debated. This project applies an integrated source-to-sink approach to investigate tectonic models for evolution of the Pacific-North American plate boundary as recorded in the world-class natural laboratory of the Coachella Valley.\nIn this study we integrate new thermochronometry-constrained kinematic models with tectonostratigraphic interpretations to help quantify the timing, rates, and magnitudes of tectonically driven vertical crustal motions and resulting mass fluxes. We sampled bedrock for U-Th/He (A-He) thermochronometry in the Mecca Hills, Santa Rosa, San Jacinto, and Little San Bernardino Mountains in both spatially focused and widely distributed areas. We also present new results from apatite 4/3He thermochronometry to help constrain the most recent exhumation histories. A-He results reveal spatially variable exhumation ages. The southwest Santa Rosa Mountains experienced late Miocene-early Pliocene exhumation along their southwest flank, while new A-He ages from ranges bounding Coachella Valley reveal complex uplift histories. We integrate our data set with previously published thermochronometric data to improve a regional synthesis of late Cenozoic vertical motions of the Coachella Valley.",

One example is the observation of quasi-periodic, fast-propagating wave trains that are associated with solar eruptions, including flares and CMEs. While there has been considerable progress in understanding such waves from both an observational and theoretical perspective, it remains a challenge to pin down their physical origin. In this work, we detail our results from a case-study 3D thermodynamic MHD simulation of a coronal mass ejection where quasi-periodic wave trains are generated during the simulated eruption. We find a direct correlation between the onset of non-steady reconnection in the flare current sheet and the generation of quasi-periodic wave train signatures when patchy, collimated downflows interact with the flare arcade. Via forward modeling of SDO/AIA observables, we explore how the appearance of the wave trains is affected by line-of-sight integration and the multi-thermal nature of the coronal medium. We also examine how the wave trains themselves are channeled by natural waveguides formed in 3D by the non-uniform background magnetic field. While the physical association of the reconnection dynamics to the generation of quasi-periodic wave trains appears to be a compelling result, unanswered questions posed from recent observations as well as future prospects will be discussed.",

The main objective of this study is to compare the computational performance of a two-dimensional numerical flood model in shared memory multicore (OpenMP), GPU (CUDA), and distributed computing (MPI) environments. The model is based on shallow water equations (SWE), and uses upwind-finite difference numerical formulations to simulate inundation extents along with flood depth and velocity fields. Three study areas with different spatial extents are used to compare the performance of the models. The case study events include Taum-Sauk dam break event (Missouri); New Madrid Spillway breach (Illinois); and a hypothetical flooding of Carrollton city (Georgia) under PMF. Three comparison metrics are used to compare the increase in the performance in using the CPU or GPU MPI versions.

A recent study has shown that evaporative demand (E0) anomaly forecasts from the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) are consistently more skillful than Prcp anomaly forecasts during drought events over CONUS, and E0 drought forecasts may be particularly useful during the growing season in the farming belts of the central and Midwestern CONUS.

The paleoseismic history of potentially active faults in Southeast Asia is addressed at few locations and spans only a few complete recurrence intervals; many faults remain unstudied. Even where the timing of a surface-rupturing earthquakes is known, the extent of rupture may not be well constrained. Therefore, subjective judgment of experts is often used to define the three-dimensional size of future ruptures; limited paleoseismic data can lead to large uncertainties in ground-motion hazard from fault sources due to the preferred models that underlie these judgments.\nThe 300-km-long, strike-slip Three Pagodas fault in western Thailand is possibly one of the most active faults in the country. The fault parallels the plate boundary and may be characterized by a slip rate high enough to result in measurable ground-motion at periods of interest for building design. The known paleoseismic history is limited and likely does not include the largest possible earthquake on the fault. This lack of knowledge begs the question what sizes of earthquakes are expected? Preferred rupture models constrain possible magnitude-frequency distributions, and alternative rupture models can result in different ground-motion hazard near the fault. This analysis includes alternative rupture models for the Three Pagodas fault, a first-level check against gross modeling assumptions to assure the source model is a reasonable reflection of observed data, and resulting ground-motion hazard for each alternative. Inadequate paleoseismic data is an important source of uncertainty that could be compensated for by considering alternative rupture models for poorly known seismic sources.",

As such, they provide a unique opportunity to study the fundamental physical and mechanical properties of early Solar System materials. But to date, few direct studies of physical properties have been conducted on meteoritic materials, in contrast to extensive chemical and isotopic analyses. It is important to determine these properties as they are related to disruption and fragmentation of bolides and asteroids, and activities related to sample return and hazardous asteroid mitigation. Here we present results from an ongoing suite of scale-dependent studies of meteorite strength and fragmentation. The meteorites studied are Tamdakht (H5), an ordinary chondrite that exhibits a heterogeneous structure criss-crossed with shock veins and centimeter-sized regions of white and light grey, and the carbonaceous chondrite Allende (CV3), which suitable pieces are light grey with abundant chondrules and CAIs. Uniaxial compression tests are performed on meteorite cubes ranging from 0.5 to 4 centimeters using an Instron 5985 frame with a 250 kN load cell and compression fixtures with 145mm diameter radial platens. All tests are conducted at room temperature and in displacement control with a displacement rate of 0.25 mm per minute to ensure quasi-static conditions. A three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) system that enables noncontact measurement of displacement and strain fields is also used. Analysis of the strength and failure process of the two meteorite types is conducted and compared to terrestrial materials.",

Just under 600,000 time data points, each including energy and pitch angle distributions, were examined. Before solar zenith angle of 110\n\\degree\n, photoelectrons have the highest occurrence rate; beyond that, plasma voids occur most often. Once past solar zenith angle of 110\n\\degree\n, energy deposition of electrons happens mainly on vertical field lines with median pitch angle averaged energy flux values of 10\n7\n-10\n8\neV cm\n−2\ns\n−1\n. Fractional deposition rates were examined and the highest found was 0.16, which means that the majority of precipitated electrons are magnetically reflected or scattered back out. The average energy of the deposited electrons is found to be 15-30 eV, typical energies of photoelectrons and unaccelerated solar wind electrons. Lastly, deposited flux values were used to look into auroral excitation and ionization. Median electron flux values, from near vertical magnetic field lines past solar zenith angle of 110\n\\degree\n, calculated in this study produced a total electron content of 4.2\n×\n10\n14\nm\n−2\nand a corresponding peak density of 4.2\n×\n10\n3\ncm\n−3\n.",

The hydrologic model is centerpiece of the Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrograph (FLASH; http://flash.ou.edu) real-time system. The hydrologic model is implemented at 1-km/5-min resolution to generate estimates of streamflow. Data from the CONUS-wide stream gauge network of the United States’ Geological Survey (USGS) were used as a reference to evaluate the discrepancies with the hydrological model predictions. Streamflow errors were studied at the event scale with particular focus on the peak flow magnitude and timing. A total of 2,680 catchments over CONUS and 75,496 events from a 10-year period are used for the simulation diagnostic analysis. Associations between streamflow errors and geophysical factors were explored and modeled. It is found that hydro-climatic factors and radar coverage could explain significant underestimation of peak flow in regions of complex terrain. Furthermore, the statistical modeling of peak flow errors shows that other geophysical factors such as basin geomorphometry, pedology, and land cover/use could also provide explanatory information. Results from this research demonstrate the utility of uncertainty characterization in providing guidance to improve model adequacy, parameter estimates, and input quality control. Likewise, the characterization of uncertainty enables probabilistic flood forecasting that can be extended to ungauged locations.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are regarded as one of the best Earth analogs for astrobiological investigations of icy worlds. In the dry valleys, Lake Vida contains an anoxic and aphotic ice-sealed brine that has been isolated for millennia and yet is hosting a population of active microbes at -13˚ C. The biogeochemical processes used by these slow-growing microbes are still unclear. We attempt to elucidate the microbial processes responsible for the survivability of these organisms using metabolomics.\nPreliminary investigations of organic compounds of Lake Vida Brine (LVBr) was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) GC-MS. LVBr contains a vast variety of lipids and is dominated by low molecular weight compounds. Many of these compounds are biomarkers of processes that took place in Lake Vida prior to evaporation and its cryo-encapsulation. These compounds include dimethylsulfide that is derived from the photosynthate dimethylsulfoniopropionate, dihydroactinidiolide that is derived from a diatom pigment, and 2-methyl-3-ethyl-maleimide that is derived from chlorophyll. These compounds, which dominate the lipid reservoir, represent a legacy from an ecosystem that is different from the current bacterial ecosystem of the brine. The abundance of the legacy compounds in the brine is most likely a reflection of the very slow metabolism of the bacterial community in the cold brine. It is important, thus, to be able to distinguish the legacy metabolites and their diagenetic products from the metabolites of the current ecosystem.\nThis legacy issue is specific to a slow growing microbial ecosystem that cannot process the legacy carbon completely. It applies not only to Lake Vida brine, but other slow growing ecosystems such as other subglacial Antarctic lakes, the Arctic regions, and the deep biosphere.",

Accurate damage assessment caused by major natural and anthropogenic disasters is becoming critical due to increases in human and economic loss. This increase in loss of life and severe damages can be attributed to the growing population, as well as human migration to the disaster prone regions of the world. Rapid assessment of these changes and dissemination of accurate information is critical for creating an effective emergency response. Change detection using high-resolution satellite images is a primary tool in assessing damages, monitoring biomass and critical infrastructures, and identifying new settlements. Existing change detection methods suffer from registration errors and often based on pixel (location) wise comparison of spectral observations from single sensor. In this paper we present a novel probabilistic change detection framework based on patch comparison and a GPU implementation that supports near real-time rapid damage exploration capability.",

            "abstract": "Separation of the Earth into a rocky mantle and metallic Fe core is a problem long studied in the planetary science community (e.g. [1]). The timing of core formation influences the abundances of the siderophile elements found in the Earth’s mantle, and the mechanism of core formation influences the degree of chemical equilibration between the rocky mantle and the core at the time of metal separation. However, limited work has been done on formation of metallic cores and its effects on mantle chemistry in rocky planets larger than the Earth. Super-Earths, exoplanets with masses up to ~ 5 Earth masses and radii up to ~1.6-1.7 Earth radii, have significantly larger internal pressures and consequently higher internal temperatures than the Earth, therefore conclusions from Earth-centric studies of core formation may be erroneous. Partitioning coefficients for many of the relevant elements (e.g. Fe, Ni, Si, O, etc.) are available in the literature, but only to relatively low pressures. The relevant pressures for super-Earths are significantly larger. However, data on Fe-O-Ni-Si partitioning at pressures (200-500 GPa) and temperatures relevant to super-Earths have been measured by laser-induced shocks with the ZBL laser at Sandia National Laboratory with a method described in [2]. We will present a model which integrates this data with lower pressure partition coefficients from the literature (e.g. [3],[4],[5]), with special emphasis on Fe and O, to describe partitioning behavior at high pressures and discuss its implications for core size and composition on rocky super-Earths.

Previous studies indicate nitrogen oxides (NOx) are generated in snowpack interstitial air through photolysis of nitrate (NO3-). Gradients in NOx mixing ratios between snowpack interstitial air and the overlying atmosphere regulate NOx surface exchange, which affects the Arctic ozone budget and climate. To better understand the dynamics of cryosphere-atmosphere exchange of NOx in the Arctic, we use a 1-D process-scale model to evaluate measurements of NOxin and above the snowpack during March-May 2009 at Summit, Greenland. The model is based upon the processes previously presented in the snowpack chemistry and physics model, MISTRA-SNOW, which represents snow grains as spheres with surfaces uniformly coated by an aqueous phase.\nModeled profiles of NO, NO2, and O3 up to ~ 2 meters deep into the snowpack for March-May 2009 have been compared to measured profiles and will be presented. During the March-May time period at Summit, low irradiances are observed during March, diurnal irradiance profiles are observed during April, and the sun never sets in May. The model results suggest a key chemical pathway for the formation of NO2 during “nighttime” that was previously unexplained. In addition, modeled 24-hour NOx fluxes are compared to measured NOx fluxes from a MET tower at Summit. Modeled fluxes of NOx in April 2009 are the same order of magnitude as the measurements; however, modeled fluxes of NOx deviate up to one order of magnitude from measurements in May 2009. A detailed analysis of the modeled/measured flux comparison will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Growing urban sprawl and its impact on global climate due to urban heat island effects has been an active area of research over the recent years. This is especially significant in light of rapid urbanization that is happening in some of the first developing nations across the globe. But so far study of urban area growth has been largely restricted to local and regional scales, using high to medium resolution satellite observations, taken at distinct time periods. In this presentation we propose a new approach to detect and monitor urban area expansion using long time series of MODIS data. This work characterizes data points using a vector of several annual metrics computed from the MODIS 8-day and 16-day composite L3 data products, at 250M resolution and over several years and then uses a vector angle mapping classifier to detect and segment the urban area. The classifier is trained using a set of training points obtained from a reference vector point and polygon pre-filtered using the MODIS VI product. This work gains additional significance, given that, despite unprecedented urban growth since 2000, the area covered by the urban class in the MODIS Global Land Cover (MCD12Q1, MCDLCHKM and MCDLC1KM) product hasn’t changed since the launch of Terra and Aqua. The proposed approach was applied to delineate the urban area around several cities in Asia known to have maximum growth in the last 15 years. Results were verified using high resolution Landsat data.",

Laser altimetry and radar data is analyzed from the IcePod 2014 and 2015 field campaigns as well as IceBridge 2013. Icepod is a multi sensor suite that includes ice penetrating radars, a swath scanning laser, visible and IR cameras as well as GPS mounted on a LC-130.\nUsing shallow ice radar data from both IcePod and IceBridge we identify the base of the ice shelf. Across the shelf we observe distinct areas of high reflectivity in the radar data suggesting basal crevassing. In some regions, the basal reflector is not well defined. Laser altimetry profiles correlate surface morphology with features at the base including basal crevasses and marine ice formed by freezing on to the base of the ice shelf. Building Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from the laser altimetry data, we investigate the relationship between the surface expressions of these ice shelf dynamics including thickness changes, potential sites of marine ice at the base and basal morphology in regions where a well defined basal reflector does not exist in the radar profiles.\nWe present accuracy of the IcePod laser altimetry dataset using ground control points and GPS grids from Greenland and Antarctica as well as Photogrammetric DEMs. Our laser altimetry analysis resolves sub-meter surface features which, combined with coincident radar, provides a link between basal processes and their surface expressions.",

            "abstract": "A number of granitic rocks exposed throughout the Central Transantarctic Mountains (CTAM) are thought to have been generated during and following the Ross Orogeny (late Cambrian to early Ordovician). Understanding the origin of these rocks can help improve our understanding of the tectonic events responsible for the suturing of Gondwana. In this study, we use zircon as a tool to investigate the magmatic origins and evolution of CTAM granites. Zircon has a low solubility in almost all melt and fluid compositions, is stable and resistant to alteration at Earth’s surface, and is physically durable during transport. These features enable it to survive many crustal processes during which most other minerals are destroyed, thus preserving an important geochemical record of its crystallizing environments.\nWe collected granitic samples from two sites in the CTAM: Ong Valley (157.5°E, 83.25°S), where the Hope Granite is exposed intruded into pre-Cambrian gneisses, and Moraine Canyon (157.55°W, 86.1°S), where bedrock exposure is dominated by a silicic porphyry of the Wyatt Formation. Our zircon U-Pb data, collected in-situ by laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS, suggests that the Hope Granite has a mean weighted crystallization age of 582 ± 23 Ma (2σ; n=26), older than the published age (510 ± 9 Ma, 1σ; whole-rock Rb-Sr isochrons; Faure & Mensing, 2010). The spread in individual zircon ages is consistent with previous estimates for the duration of intrusion (~20 Myr) of the Hope Granite. Published ages for Wyatt Fm rocks range from ~525 to ~800 Ma, but their origin is uncertain.\nWe will analyze zircons from the Wyatt porphyry for U-Pb isotopes (by LA-ICP-MS) to better constrain its age. In addition, we will obtain trace element compositions of zircons from both intrusions to investigate their magmatic origins. This will allow us to explore potential geochemical connections between the intrusions, and may yield additional insight into the tectonic events involved in the Ross Orogeny.",

We used OMI data from 2005 to 2014 to investigate BrO signatures from salt lakes. The salt lakes regions we cover include Dead Sea; Salt Lake City, US; Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia; and Namtso, Tibet. Elevated signatures of BrO was found in July and August BrO monthly averages over the Dead Sea. Similar results were found in the BrO monthly averages for August 2006 for the Bolivian Salt Flats.\nWe present a detailed description of the retrieval algorithm for the OMI operational bromine monoxide (BrO) product. The algorithm is based on direct fitting of radiances from 319.0-347.5 nm, within the UV-2 channel of OMI. Radiances are modeled from the solar irradiance, attenuated by contributions from the target gas and interfering gases, rotational Raman scattering, additive and multiplicative closure polynomials and a common mode spectrum. The common mode spectra (one per cross-track position, computed on-line) are the average of several hundred fitting residuals. They include any instrument effects that are unrelated to molecular scattering and absorption cross sections. The BrO retrieval uses albedo- and wavelength-dependent air mass factors (AMFs), which have been pre-computed using climatological BrO profiles. The wavelength-dependent AMF is applied pre-fit to the BrO cross-sections so that vertical column densities are retrieved directly.\nWe validate OMI BrO with ground-based measurements from three stations (Harestua, Lauder, and Barrow) and with chemical transport model simulations. We analyze the global distribution and seasonal variation of BrO and investigate BrO emissions from volcanoes and salt lakes.",

            "abstract": "While the combination of warmer and drier mean climatic conditions can have severe impacts on ecosystems, extreme events like droughts or heat waves that break the gradual climate change can have more long-term consequences on ecosystem composition, functioning and carbon storage. Hence, it is essential to assess the changes in climatic variability and the changes in frequency of extreme events projected for the future. Ecosystems could not be in a condition to adapt to these new conditions and might be disrupted. Here, the process-based dynamic vegetation model CARAIB DVM was used to evaluate and analyze how future climate and extreme events will affect European ecosystems.\nTo quantify the uncertainties in the climatic projections and in their potential impacts on ecosystems, the vegetation model was driven with the outputs of different regional climatic models (RCMs), nested in CMIP5 GCM projections for the EURO-CORDEX project. We used the ALADIN version 5.3 (Météo-France/CNRM) and other EURO-CORDEX RCMs. These climatic projections are at a high spatial resolution (0.11-degree, ~12 km). CARAIB simulations were performed across Europe over the historical period 1951-2005 and the future period 2006-2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. We simulated a set of 99 individual species (47 herbs, 12 shrubs and 40 trees) representing the major European ecosystem flora.\nFirst, we analyzed the climatic variability simulated by the climatic models over the historical period and compared it with the observed climatic variability. None of these climatic models can reproduce accurately the present natural climatic variability. Then, to assess the risk of ecosystem disruption in the future and to identify the vulnerable areas in Europe, we created an index combining several CARAIB outputs: runoff, mean NPP, soil turnover, burned area, appearance and disappearance of species. We evaluated the severity of change projected for these variables (period 2071-2100) relative to their current variability (period 1961-1990). Mean changes were considered severe if they exceed observed variability. The highest values of the index were found in southern Europe, indicating that the amplitude of the expected ecosystem changes largely exceeds current interannual variability in this area.",

NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) initiative has enabled collaboration opportunities with stakeholders whose data needs and requirements are unique to the spatial scope of their work: from county to the international scale. At the very local level, the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District leverages CMS high-resolution biomass estimates to develop a Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system in support of the District’s 10-year land stewardship plan and the California’s Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32). On the eastern coast, at the state level, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources utilizes the same high-resolution biomass estimates on a larger scale to better strategize in achieving the goal of 40% canopy cover statewide by 2020. At a regional scale that encompasses the three states of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, LiDAR data collection of the Chesapeake Bay watershed dominate the stakeholder discussions. By collaborating with the U.S. Geological Survey’s 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP), high-resolution LiDAR data will fill critical data gaps to help implement watershed protection strategies such as increasing riparian forest buffers to reduce runoff. Outside of the U.S., the World Resources Institute seeks to harness CMS reforestation products and technical expertise in addressing land restoration priorities specific to each Latin American country. CMS applications efforts expand beyond forest carbon examples discussed above to include carbon markets, ocean acidification, national greenhouse gas inventory, and wetlands. The broad array of case studies and lessons learned through CMS Applications in scaling carbon science for policy development at different spatial scales is providing unique opportunities that leverage science through policy needs.",

A new type of HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) detector has been developed by the DRS Technologies under the IIP program. The new detectors achieved >70% quantum efficiency, including the effect of the fill factor, over the spectral range from 0.4 to 4.3 μm, which significantly improves the receiver performance of our CO2 lidar and enabled other remote sending measurements. The HgCdTe APD arrays have 80 μm square pixels in a 4x4 array along with a bank of 16 preamplifiers on the same chip carrier. Test results at both DRS and GSFC showed the HgCdTe APD array has achieved, an APD gain of 500-1000, 8-10 MHz electrical bandwidth, and an average noise equivalent power (NEP) of <0.5 fW/Hz1/2. It has demonstrated at least a 3 orders of magnitude dynamic range at a fixed APD gain setting. The gains of the APD and the preamplifier can also be adjusted to further extend the receiver dynamic range. During summer 2014 we successfully demonstrated airborne lidar measurements of column CO2 using one of these detectors. The Aerospace Corporation is currently building a 3U CubeSat with one of these detectors in a small closed-cycle cryocooler as the primary payload under the ESTO In-space Validation of Earth Science Technology (InVEST) program. The CubeSat is scheduled to be launched in late 2016 and will fly in a low Earth orbit and monitor the performance for at least a year. We have also updated the performance analysis of a space-based version of our CO2 lidar with the new HgCdTe APD detector. For the retrievals, a least-square-error method is used to fit the measured transmittances to a predetermined line shape function using 8 to 16 sampling wavelengths. The error in the derived total optical depth and the CO2 mixing ratio are estimated via the standard error propagation method. The error in the resultant CO2 mixing ratio is calculated as a function of the received optical signal power, including the effects of the laser energy, receiver telescope size, and solar background radiation noise. The presentation will give more details about the detector and its impact on our CO2 lidar for the ASCENDS mission.",

            "abstract": "Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are a diverse population of short-lived asteroids originating from the main belt and Jupiter family comets. Some have orbits that are easy to access from Earth, making them attractive as targets for science and exploration as well as a potential resource. Some pose a potential impact threat. NEOs have undergone extensive collisional processing, fragmenting and re-accreting to form rubble piles, which may be compositionally heterogeneous (e.g., like 2008 TC3, the precursor to Almahata Sitta). At present, little is known about their interior structure or how these objects are held together. The wide range of inferred NEO macroporosities hint at complex interiors. Information about their density structure would aid in understanding their formation and collisional histories, the risks they pose to human interactions with their surfaces, the constraints on industrial processing of NEO resources, and the selection of hazard mitigation strategies (e.g., kinetic impactor vs nuclear burst). Several methods have been proposed to characterize asteroid interiors, including radar imaging, seismic tomography, and muon imaging (muon radiography and tomography). Of these, only muon imaging has the potential to determine interior density structure, including the relative density of constituent fragments. Muons are produced by galactic cosmic ray showers within the top meter of asteroid surfaces. High-energy muons can traverse large distances through rock with little deflection. Muons transmitted through an Itokawa-sized asteroid can be imaged using a compact hodoscope placed on or near the surface. Challenges include background rejection and correction for variations in muon production with surface density. The former is being addressed by hodoscope design. Surface density variations can be determined via radar or muon limb imaging. The performance of muon imaging is evaluated for prospective NEO interior-mapping missions.",

            "abstract": "Major uncertainties surround future estimates of sea level rise attributable to mass loss from Greenland and the surrounding ice caps in Canada. Understanding changes across these regions is vital as their glaciers have experienced dramatic changes in recent times. Attention has focused on the periphery of these regions where land ice meets the ocean and where ice acceleration, thinning and increased calving have been observed.\nPolynyas are areas of open water within sea ice which remain unfrozen for much of the year. They vary significantly in size (~3 km2 to > ~85,000 km2 in the Arctic), recurrence rates and duration. Despite their relatively small size, polynyas strongly impact regional oceanography and play a vital role in heat and moisture exchange between the polar oceans and atmosphere. Where polynyas are present adjacent to tidewater glaciers their influence on ocean circulation and water temperatures has the potential to play a major part in controlling subsurface ice melt rates by impacting on the water masses reaching the calving front. They also have the potential to influence air masses reaching nearby glaciers and ice caps by creating a maritime climate which may impact on the glaciers’ accumulation and surface melt and hence their thickness and mass balance. Polynya presence and size also have implications for sea ice extent and therefore may influence the buttressing effect on neighbouring tidewater glaciers.\nThe work presented uses remote sensing and mass balance model data to study changes in the North Water polynya (extent, ice concentration, duration) and neighbouring glaciers and ice caps (velocities, calving front positions and mass balance) in Canada and Greenland over a period of approximately 30 years from the mid-1980s through to 2015.",

To assess these impacts and forest responses, gridded data from global climate models (GCM) outputs are used to drive ecosystem model simulations. However, the spatial resolutions of outputs from currently available GCMs are too coarse to be used in many impact assessments at regional or landscape scales. Therefore, climatologists have downscaled GCM projections based on different methods (e.g., statistical and dynamical models). These downscaled climate data are being used as inputs to impact models, such as forest dynamics, crop growth, and hydrological models. However, without comparing differences and quantifying the uncertainties among the downscaled driving datasets, it is difficult for ecosystem modelers and resources managers to select the most appropriate dataset for their specific interests. Our study is aimed at evaluating the performance of different downscaled datasets in representing local and regional climates. We are also investigating the uncertainties among different data sources, especially for projected future periods. We analyzed and contrasted five recently developed downscaled dataset: NEX-DCP30, WorldClim, MACAv2-METDATA, MACAv2-LIVNEH, and ClimateNA. We evaluate the biases in each downscaled dataset by comparing it with a gridded observation-based dataset, such as PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) for the historical period. In this work, we aim to provide recommendations for scientists and natural resource managers to enhance science-based climate change adaptive management across the Pacific Northwest.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation links the water, energy and carbon cycles over land yet even its climatology on global scale is not observed. Tower-based flux measurements are sparse and do not cover diverse biomes and climates. In the last decades, many strategies to derive evaporation based on remote sensing measurements have been developed. However, these methods are dependent on a variety of assumptions and auxiliary data, making them more prone to error propagation. A more data-driven method was developed by Salvucci (2001), who found that under statistical stationary conditions the expected change in soil moisture storage is zero when conditioned to a certain storage for a certain time interval. Consequently, using the water balance, precipitation conditionally averaged to the soil moisture storage is equal to the total loss: evaporation and drainage. Using only soil moisture and precipitation data as model inputs reduces the sources of uncertainty.\nIn this presentation we provide the first estimates of global evaporation from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission by applying the conditional sampling method to passive microwave soil moisture time series and in situ precipitation data. The obtained evaporation estimates show a good correspondence to measured evaporation from eddy correlation towers over selected field sites. Subsequently, a simple approach is developed to directly estimate evaporation from SMAP soil moisture data. This approach enables the investigation of dynamics in evaporation during the dry-down after storms. The timing of the transition between the different stages of evaporation is assessed for different climates especially the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 evaporation; atmosphere limited evaporation to soil limited evaporation respectively. Investigations into the dynamics of unstressed evaporation and transpiration and the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 evaporation increases our understanding of water stress and soil desiccation. It also provides insights into how the water, energy and carbon cycles link together over land.\nSalvucci, G.D., 2001.

            "abstract": "The onset of drought conditions in regions such as California due to shortfalls in precipitation has brought refreshed attention to the vulnerability of our water supply paradigm to changes in climate patterns. In the face of a changing climate which can exacerbate drought conditions in already dry areas, building resiliency into our water supply infrastructure requires some decoupling of water supply availability from climate behavior through conservation, efficiency, and alternative water supply measures such as desalination and water reuse. The installation of these measures requires varying degrees of direct energy inputs and/or impacts the energy usage of the water supply infrastructure (conveyance, treatment, distribution, wastewater treatment). These impacts have implications for greenhouse gas emissions from direct fuel usage or impacts on the emissions from the electric grid. At the scale that these measures may need to be deployed to secure water supply availability, especially under climate change impacted hydrology, they can potentially pose obstacles for meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable utilization goals. Therefore, the portfolio of these measures must be such that detrimental impacts on greenhouse gas emissions are minimized. This study combines climate data with a water reservoir network model and an electric grid dispatch model for the water-energy system of California to evaluate 1) the different pathways and scale of alternative water resource measures needed to secure water supply availability and 2) the impacts of following these pathways on the ability to meet greenhouse gas and renewable utilization goals. It was discovered that depending on the water supply measure portfolio implemented, impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable utilization can either be beneficial or detrimental, and optimizing the portfolio is more important under climate change conditions due to the scale of measures required.",

            "abstract": "The heating of tree trunks and canopy elements is known to contribute to snow surface longwave irradiance; however, mapping the snowmelt energy contribution from individual trees in a discontinuous forested environment remains unexplored. A measurement campaign at the Marmot Creek Research Basin, Alberta, Canada documented the meteorological forcing and resulting tree temperatures on shaded and sun-exposed sides of a forest clearing. Physically based model estimates of trunk and canopy temperatures of individual trees were compared to measurements. Two trunk temperature models were evaluated: a PDE-based heat transfer model and a computationally efficient energy balance model including internal heat storage effects. The models simulated surface temperatures on eight azimuthal trunk sides. Both models performed favorably (RMSE and biases better than 1.7°C and ±0.4°C) with the PDE model that simulated a bark layer best capturing diurnal temperature spikes. On the sun-exposed edge, simulated daily maximum trunk temperatures exceeded air temperature values by 10°C - 15°C and were highest later in the day on the southwestern side; temperatures on the northern side exceeded daytime air temperatures by only 1.5°C. Measurements and models agreed that the trunk surfaces returned to or cooled below ambient air temperature values near sunset; however, the PDE model tracked internal heat storage from daytime surface heating well into the night. On the shaded side of the clearing, daytime trunk temperatures exceeded air temperatures by 3°C to 6°C and the deviations were highly sensitive to the timing and duration of intermittent insolation. Canopy temperatures modeled with an energy balance approach were within the range of thermocouple measurements and exceeded daytime air temperatures by 5°C to 8°C and 1°C to 3°C on the sun-exposed and shaded clearing edges, respectively. Radiative transfer modeling was used to map the energy contribution of trees to the snow surface. Trees provided substantial, but localized, longwave irradiance with higher simulated values on the southern sides of trees and on the sun-exposed clearing edge. The results suggest that snow energy balance models of forested areas with small clearings could be improved by including treatment of gap edges and differences between sunlit and shaded edges.",

            "abstract": "Normal faulting accommodates stretching of the Earth’s crust and is one of the fundamental controls on landscape evolution and sediment dispersal in rift basins. Displacement-length scaling relationships compiled from global datasets suggest normal faults grow via a sympathetic increase in these two parameters (the ‘isolated fault model’). This model has dominated the structural geology literature for >20 years and underpins the structural and tectono-stratigraphic models developed for active rifts. However, relatively recent analysis of high-quality 3D seismic reflection data suggests faults may grow by rapid establishment of their near-final length prior to significant displacement accumulation (the ‘coherent fault model’). The isolated and coherent fault models make very different predictions regarding the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of rift basin, thus assessing their applicability is important. To-date, however, very few studies have explicitly set out to critically test the coherent fault model thus, it may be argued, it has yet to be widely accepted in the structural geology community. Displacement backstripping is a simple graphical technique typically used to determine how faults lengthen and accumulate displacement; this technique should therefore allow us to test the competing fault models. However, in this talk we use several subsurface case studies to show that the most commonly used backstripping methods (the ‘original’ and ‘modified’ methods) are, however, of limited value, because application of one over the other requires an a priori assumption of the model most applicable to any given fault; we argue this is illogical given that the style of growth is exactly what the analysis is attempting to determine. We then revisit our case studies and demonstrate that, in the case of seismic-scale growth faults, growth strata thickness patterns and relay zone kinematics, rather than displacement backstripping, should be assessed to directly constrain fault length and thus tip behaviour through time. We conclude that rapid length establishment prior to displacement accumulation may be more common than is typically assumed, thus challenging the well-established, widely cited and perhaps overused, isolated fault model.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is undergoing some of the most coordinated rapid climatic changes currently occurring anywhere on Earth, including the retreat of the perennial sea ice cover, which integrates forcing by, exchanges with and feedbacks between atmosphere, ocean and land. While historical reconstructions from Earth System Models (ESMs) are in broad agreement with these changes, the rate of change in ESMs generally remains outpaced by observations. Reasons for that relate to a combination of coarse resolution, inadequate parameterizations, under-represented processes and a limited knowledge of physical interactions.\nWe demonstrate the capability of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) in addressing some of the ESM limitations in simulating observed variability and trends in arctic surface climate. RASM is a high resolution, pan-Arctic coupled climate model with the sea ice and ocean model components configured at an eddy-permitting resolution of 1/12o and the atmosphere and land hydrology model components at 50 km resolution, which are all coupled at 20-minute intervals. RASM is an example of limited-area, process-resolving, fully coupled ESM, which due to the constraints from boundary conditions facilitates detailed comparisons with observational statistics that are not possible with ESMs. The overall goal of RASM is to address key requirements published in the Navy Arctic Roadmap: 2014-2030 and in the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region, regarding the need for advanced modeling capabilities for operational forecasting and strategic climate predictions through 2030. The main science objectives of RASM are to advance understanding and model representation of critical physical processes and feedbacks of importance to sea ice thickness and area distribution. RASM results are presented to quantify relative contributions by (i) resolved processes and feedbacks as well as (ii) sensitivity to space dependent sub-grid parameterizations to better understand their importance in reducing uncertainty and improving prediction of arctic climate change.",

Under these circumstance, it is necessary to develop a nation-wide social vulnerability map to scrutinize the adequacy of existing emergency management. Yet there has been no systematic past efforts on mapping social vulnerability to hydro-climatic extremes at nation-wide for India. Therefore, immediate efforts are required to quantify the social vulnerability, particularly developing country like India, where major transformations in demographic characteristics and development patterns are evident during past decades. In the present study, we perform a comprehensive spatio-temporal social vulnerability analysis by considering multiple sensitive indicators for three decades (1990-2010) which identifies the hot-spots, with higher vulnerability to hydro-climatic extremes. The population datasets are procured from Census of India and the meteorological datasets are obtained from India Meteorological Department (IMD). The study derives interesting results on decadal changes of spatial distribution of risk, considering social vulnerability and hazard to extremes.",

            "abstract": "The most physically-based method to simulate surface glacier melting is by surface energy balance models since they account for radiative and turbulent heat exchanges occurring at the snow or ice surface. Direct measurements of turbulent fluxes, however, are uncommon given the complexity of making reliable measurements of turbulent energy exchange on alpine glaciers. Most studies thus rely on the bulk aerodynamic method used to parametrize turbulent fluxes; an approach that may be inaccurate due to poorly specified empirical coefficients, such as the transfer coefficient and roughness lengths. Here we present direct measurements of turbulent energy fluxes for two alpine glaciers in British Columbia: Castle Glacier in the Interior Mountains for ablation seasons 2010 and 2012, and Nordic Glacier in Canadian Rockies for ablation season 2014. On both glaciers the turbulent heat fluxes may account for up to 35% of energy available for daily melt. Using eddy-covariance method we derive the roughness lengths for momentum, temperature and humidity, and evaluate the performance of bulk method with different parametrizations for transfer coefficient in simulating the turbulent fluxes. Finally, we estimate the transfer coefficient directly from our measurements, and investigate its dependence on meteorological variables measured at the glaciers.",

The GEMS is one of the first sensors to monitor NO2, SO2, HCHO, O3, and aerosols onboard geostationary earth orbit (GEO) over Asia. Since the GEMS is not launched yet, the simulated measurements and its precision were used in this study. The random and systematic component of the measurement error was estimated based on the instrument design. The atmospheric profiles were obtained from Model for Ozone And Related chemical Tracers (MOZART) simulations and surface reflectances were obtained from climatology of OMI Lambertian equivalent reflectance. The uncertainties of the GEMS trace gas and aerosol products were estimated based on the OE method using the atmospheric profile and surface reflectance. Most of the estimated uncertainties of NO2, HCHO, stratospheric and total O3 products satisfied the user’s requirements with sufficient margin. However, about 26% of the estimated uncertainties of SO2 and about 30% of the estimated uncertainties of tropospheric O3 do not meet the required precision. Particularly the estimated uncertainty of SO2 is high in winter, when the emission is strong in East Asia. Further efforts are necessary in order to improve the retrieval accuracy of SO2 and tropospheric O3 in order to reach the scientific goal of GEMS. Random measurement error of GEMS was important for the NO2, SO2, and HCHO retrieval, while both the random and systematic measurement errors were important for the O3 retrievals. The degree of freedom for signal of tropospheric O3 was 0.8 ± 0.2 and that for stratospheric O3 was 2.9 ± 0.5. The estimated uncertainties of the aerosol retrieval from GEMS measurements were predicted to be lower than the required precision for the SZA range of the trace gas retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Aerodynamic surface roughness is an essential parameter in energy balance studies on glaciers. While actual measurements on bare ice glaciers are rare, a number of literature values exist for different types of ice and snow covers. There are only very few constant values suggested in the literature for debris covered glaciers and actual measurements are even scarcer. This is a significant shortcoming as the debris surface is often very heterogeneous, which results in variable turbulent fluxes. These fluxes, which use surface roughness as an input parameter, are also employed to derive debris thickness from surface temperature. The increased use of aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry on glaciers provides an opportunity to better account for this present shortcoming.\nOn a number of locations of Lirung Glacier in the Nepalese Himalayas we produced high resolution DEMs from terrestrial photogrammetry, from 1 x 1 m plots to a wider basin spanning more than 100 m. These images were then downsampled to different resolutions, ranging from one millimeter to a few centimeters. Employing different equations from the literature we determine surface roughness at different scales. This way we can discuss (1) the variability of results between different commonly used approaches, (2) the variability of surface roughness in space and (3) the impact of image resolution. From a tower with wind and temperature sensors at different heights we additionally infer surface roughness locally. We can then compare these values as well as see the effect of different wind speeds on the derivation of the value.\nEmploying a software originally developed to determine grain size distributions in river beds from optical imagery, we additionally determine rock shapes and size as well as provide an estimate for the grain size distribution of the debris cover. This could provide an initial step to a better estimation of the porous space of the debris cover, which is essential to determine energy flux from the surface to the ice below.",

            "abstract": "Snow accumulation records derived from ice cores are one of the only direct archives of precipitation changes that extend prior to the instrumental period. In Alaska, the development of centennial scale precipitation records is needed to contextualize the current rapid changes in precipitation and glacial mass balance occurring along the North Pacific margin. Here, we investigate precipitation changes over the last three centuries using an ice core collected to bedrock from Mt. Hunter (63° N, 151° W, 4,000 meters above sea level) in Denali National Park, Alaska. To develop the snow accumulation record, we calculated water equivalent annual layer thicknesses in the ice core by identification of annual peaks in major ions (MSA, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) and water isotopes. We then corrected the annual layer thickness for thinning using three different flow models (Nye, Hooke and Dansgaard-Johnsen) that have been widely used to simulate layer thickness with depth near an ice divide. Each of these models is optimized such that the discrepancy between the annual layer counted age scale and the modeled age scale is minimized. Our results show that water equivalent annual accumulation has increased from 1.43 meters in 1900 to 2.03 meters by 2012, an increase of 42%. The Mt. Hunter accumulation record is regionally representative of precipitation in southwest and central Alaska based on strong correlations with reanalysis precipitation data. Comparisons with ERA-Interim reanalysis data show that years of high accumulation on Denali are associated with stronger southerly winds, warmer sea surface and air temperatures, and pressure anomalies resembling a positive phase of the East Pacific-North Pacific Pattern. Together, this analysis shows that precipitation on Mt. Hunter has a strong positive correlation (R2=0.73) with annual average meridional wind strength in southwestern Alaska, which is related to atmospheric pressure gradients between the Bering Sea and the eastern Gulf of Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Over four decades of measurements exist that sample the 3-D composition of reactive trace gases in the troposphere from approximately weekly ozone sondes, instrumentation on civil aircraft, and individual comprehensive aircraft field campaigns. An obstacle to using these data to evaluate coupled chemistry-climate models (CCMs)—the models used to project future changes in atmospheric composition and climate—is that exact space-time matching between model fields and observations cannot be done, as CCMs generate their own meteorology. Evaluation typically involves averaging over large spatiotemporal regions, which may not reflect a true average due to limited or biased sampling. This averaging approach generally loses information regarding specific processes. Here we aim to identify where discrete sampling may be indicative of long-term mean conditions, using the GEOS-Chem global chemical-transport model (CTM) driven by the MERRA reanalysis to reflect historical meteorology from 2003 to 2012 at 2o by 2.5o resolution. The model has been sampled at the time and location of every ozone sonde profile available from the Would Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC), along the flight tracks of the IAGOS/MOZAIC/CARABIC civil aircraft campaigns, as well as those from over 20 individual field campaigns performed by NASA, NOAA, DOE, NSF, NERC (UK), and DLR (Germany) during the simulation period. Focusing on ozone, carbon monoxide and reactive nitrogen species, we assess where aggregates of the in situ data are representative of the decadal mean vertical, spatial and temporal distributions that would be appropriate for evaluating CCMs. Next, we identically sample a series of parallel sensitivity simulations in which individual emission sources (e.g., lightning, biogenic VOCs, wildfires, US anthropogenic) have been removed one by one, to assess where and when the aggregated observations may offer constraints on these processes within CCMs. Lastly, we show results of an additional 31-year simulation from 1980-2010 of GEOS-Chem driven by the MACCity emissions inventory and MERRA reanalysis at 4o by 5o. We sample the model at every WOUDC sonde and flight track from MOZAIC and NASA field campaigns to evaluate which aggregate observations are statistically reflective of long-term trends over the period.",

            "abstract": "Climate change solutions are subject to many inherent uncertainties. One of the most important is the uncertainty over the magnitude of the physical response of the climate system to external forcing. The risk of extremely large responses to forcing, so called “fat-tail” outcomes, cannot be ruled out from the latest science and offer profound challenges when creating policies that aim to meet a specific target of global temperature change.\nThis study offers examples of how mitigation policies can be made resilient to this uncertainty in the physical climate response via indexing policies against an attributable anthropogenic warming index (the magnitude of the observed global mean warming that is can be traced to human activities), the AWI, instead of against time directly. We show that indexing policy measures that influence the total stock of carbon in the atmosphere (such as the fraction of extracted carbon sequestered) against the AWI can largely eliminate the risk of missing the specified warming goal due to unexpectedly large climate responses as well as the risk of costly over-mitigation if the physical response turned out to be lower than expected. We offer further examples of how this methodology can be expanded to include short-lived climate pollutants as well as long-lived carbon dioxide.\nIndexing policies against the AWI can have important consequences for the actions of governments acting to design national climate mitigation policies as well as private sector investors looking to incentivise the transition to a climate-stable economy. We conclude with some thoughts on how these indexes can help focus attention on the long-term perspective that is consistent with the conclusions of the latest climate science on what is required to ultimately stabilise the global climate system.",

            "abstract": "Impact and accretion simulations of terrestrial planet formation suggest that giant impacts are both common and expected to produce extensive melting. The moon-forming impact, for example, likely melted the majority of Earth's mantle to produce a global magma ocean that subsequently cooled and crystallized (e.g. Nakajima and Stevenson, 2015). Understanding the cooling process is critical to determining magma ocean lifetimes and recognizing possible remnant signatures of the magma ocean in present-day mantle heterogeneities (i.e. Labrosse et al., 2007). Modeling this evolution is challenging, however, due to the vastly different timescales and lengthscales associated with turbulent convection (magma ocean) and viscous creep (present-day mantle), in addition to uncertainties in material properties and chemical partitioning.\nWe consider a simplified spherically-symmetric (1-D) magma ocean to investigate both its evolving structure and cooling timescale. Extending the work of Abe (1993), mixing-length theory is employed to determine convective heat transport, producing a high resolution model that captures the ultra-thin boundary layer (few cms) at the surface of the magma ocean. The thermodynamics of mantle melting are represented using a pseudo-one-component model, which retains the simplicity of a standard one-component model while introducing a finite temperature interval for melting (important for multi-component systems). We derive a new high P-T equation of state (EOS) formulation designed to capture the energetics and physical properties of the partially molten system using parameters that are readily interpreted in the context of magma ocean crystallization. This model is used to determine the cooling timescale for a variety of plausible thermodynamic models, with special emphasis on comparing the center-outwards vs bottom-up cooling scenarios that arise from the assumed EOS (e.g., Mosenfelder et al., 2009; Stixrude et al., 2009).",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers are known to be major drivers of precipitation in many parts of the globe, including the West Coast of the United States. Atmospheric rivers are usually identified as long, filamentary structures of elevated vertically-integrated water vapor transport, and can extend over thousands of km, from the tropics all the way to the midlatitudes. However, it is generally unclear where exactly the moisture in atmospheric rivers comes from, and if that moisture is transported over long distances across the entire river, or if it is continuously precipitated out and replenished by local moisture. By better constraining the sources and sinks of moisture in atmospheric rivers, one can learn which geographic regions or meteorological processes are important for forecasting the rivers’ hydrological impacts. Also, by determining how these moisture sources and sinks will change with the global climate, one can gain a better understanding of future atmospheric river conditions, and thus better future hydroclimate projections.\nWe show the sources and sinks of water vapor and cloud condensate in atmospheric rivers as simulated by the water tracer-enabled NCAR Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5). Specifically, numerous regions in the North Pacific and Western North America are tagged with water tracers, and their relative contributions to atmospheric river moisture and precipitation are calculated for rivers that impact the West Coast of the United States. Two simulations using the model are performed, one with modern-day boundary conditions, and another with doubled-CO2 conditions. It is found that the majority of moisture in atmospheric rivers comes from the subtropical (20 to 30° N) Pacific, although a substantial portion of moisture for some atmospheric rivers also comes from the tropics (<20° N), indicating an occasional direct tropical connection. It is also found that the proportional amount of water tracer moisture decreases the farther away the river is from the source, indicating a continuous loss by precipitation, and a replacement by locally evaporated moisture. However, there can still be non-trivial amounts of all the moisture sources at the termination end of the river, indicating that long-distance moisture transport can occur.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Wootten_AGU_ePoster.pdf\nDownscaling is defined as translating the state of variables at a coarse resolution and larger region to the state of variables at a fine resolution for a smaller region. Numerous downscaling techniques exist which are commonly classified as statistical downscaling (based on empirical relationships) and dynamic downscaling (regional climate modeling) techniques. It is common practice for impact assessment and decision making to consider downscaled projections created from one downscaling technique. Several recent studies have demonstrated that different downscaling techniques also have an influence on future projections. In addition, these studies have also demonstrated that the choice of downscaling technique can influence the interim modeling (streamflow, species distribution, etc.) done as part of an impact assessment. Prior studies have also highlighted the three main sources of uncertainty in global climate model (GCM) projections (natural variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty). However, given the use of downscaled projections and the subsequent demonstration of the uncertainty associated with downscaling, there is a need to consider how downscaling contributes to the uncertainty of future projections. This study presents a methodology to assess the contribution of the four sources of uncertainty in downscaled climate projections (natural variability, GCM model uncertainty, downscaling uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty) using Eastern North Carolina as a case study. This considers future projections of temperature and precipitation across the study domain from six different downscaled projections. It is hypothesized that the contribution from downscaling to the uncertainty of the projections is small compared to the sources from the GCMs which drive downscaling. Results of this study also consider the potential influence on an impact assessment using downscaled climate projections in a region.",

The approach of this study is based on the fact that the evaluation of stream water quality and quantity is an efficient tool to characterize the sustainability of the agriculture production at a catchment level. Its goal is, therefore, to survey the land use effects on the hydrobiogeochemistry in headwaters areas of the Jaguari River Basin to support sustainable management of water resources in this region. Sampling stations were established on rivers and streams ranging from one to five order channels as well as selected small catchments to conduct studies on overland flow, soil solution, soil quality, aquatic biota and pesticide dynamic. The research team is huge and their goals are specific, diverse and complementary, being summed up as: characterize land use, topography and soils; evaluate erosive potential in agriculture areas; measure soil carbon and nitrogen contents; characterize hydrogeochemistry fluxes; apply hydrological modeling and simulate different land use and management scenarios; monitor possible pesticides contamination; and survey macro invertebrates as indicators of water quality. Based on a synthesis of the results, the project team intends to point out the environmental impacts and contribute recommendations of management for the focused region to conserve water resources in terms of quality and quantity.",

            "abstract": "Natural and anthropogenic forest disturbances are a major contributor to global carbon fluxes, and can act as both a natural component of healthy ecosystem function and a threat to fragile ecosystems as well as human lives and property. The local and global impacts of a disturbance event depend in large part on the timing, intensity, and cause of the disturbance. With some disturbance types expected to increase in frequency and severity under the influence of climate change and increasing anthropogenic land use, knowledge of disturbance events and trends has become particularly crucial for a variety of scientific, political and management needs. Many studies have made use of time series analyses of multitemporal satellite imagery to study forest disturbance events at a variety of scales, but few have endeavored to attribute specific causal information to the disturbances detected, particularly at broad spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this research is to investigate the suitability of a Landsat time series approach for detecting and describing causes of disturbance events across the heterogeneous, forested landscapes of California. Using existing GIS datasets detailing the locations of logging, fire, pest damage and land use conversion events statewide, we extracted the full Landsat time series (1984-2015) for six Landsat spectral bands at the location of each disturbance event. The characteristics of each time series vary depending on the nature of the disturbance occurring at that location. These differences can be harnessed as a way of differentiating disturbance types based on observed values before, during, and after the time of the event, which together comprise the disturbance’s temporal signature. We applied a machine learning algorithm to these temporal signatures in order to construct a classification model linking disturbance type with the associated signature. We then applied this model to all forested areas in California using all Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 imagery available, generating a statewide thirty-year record of disturbance timing and cause. The resulting product, which can be expanded as new data becomes available, provides for land managers, researchers, and other interested parties a consistent and comprehensive source of information on disturbance events across California.",

Tyrosine is a common amino acid, 4-hydroxyphenylalanine, HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(NH2)-C(O)OH), and is present in many atmospheric bio-aerosols. Nitration of the aromatic units of protein molecules in polluted air enhances their allergenicity. The mechanism of heterogeneous nitration process of bio-aerosols by common nitrating agents in the atmosphere, O3/NO2, NO3, N2O5 is not well understood. This chemistry is thought to proceed via reactions with O3 and NO2 on particle surfaces, through mechanisms that are still uncertain. The possible role of higher nitrogen oxides also remains uncertain, partly due to a lack of measurements of fundamental chemical and physical parameters. In this work, we undertook measurements of reactive uptake of NO3, N2O5, as a function of relative humidity and temperature in a tyrosine coated flow tube reactor with chemical ionization mass spectrometric (CIMS) detection. Uptake coefficients on tyrosine coated flow tube were small under low relative humidity but were enhanced by an order of magnitude in the presence of high relative humidity, particularly for N2O5. The measured uptake coefficients were mostly due to reaction with water adsorbed on the surface of the flow tube. Only ~10% of the reactive uptake could be attributed to reaction with tyrosine. Following uptake, the contents of the flow tube were extracted, and analyzed using electrospray ionization - mass spectrometer (ESI-MS) to identify and quantify the products of the nitration reaction. The only organic reaction product detected was 3-nitro-tyrosine (3-NT). The measured uptake coefficients, mechanism of the title reactions and the possible atmospheric implications of these findings will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The injection of nano- and microscale zerovalent iron (ZVI) particles has emerged as a promising technique for groundwater remediation. In particular, ZVI injections offer a suitable alternative for the remediation of areas not accessible with other techniques, such as areas characterized by low hydraulic conductivity. In such cases, the injection is performed at high pressure in order to create preferential flow paths (i.e., fractures). Particle injection via fracturing demands an adequate monitoring of the ZVI delivery to track the migration path of the particles as well as to delineate the extension and distribution of the iron slurry. However, characterization of ZVI injections is to date based mainly on the analysis of groundwater and soil samples, thus, limiting the spatio-temporal resolution of the investigation and making it not suitable for real-time monitoring. To overcome this, here we present the application of the complex conductivity (CC) imaging method to characterize the delivery of guar gum stabilized microscale ZVI (GG-mZVI) particles during a field-scale injection by hydraulic fracturing. Our results demonstrated that CC images provide not only an improved characterization of the contaminant distribution, but also valuable information to identify the migration pathway of the injected GG-mZVI. The relatively short acquisition time of CC datasets permitted to obtain monitoring data with enhanced temporal resolution, i.e., after each injection (every ~15 minutes), while still covering an extended area of investigation in comparison to conventional geochemical monitoring by means of soil and water samples. As presented in Figure 1, the CC images revealed an increase (~20%) in the induced electrical polarization (Φ), upon delivery of ZVI into the targeted area, due to the accumulation of ZVI. Furthermore, larger changes (>50%) occurred in shallow sediments, a few meters away from the injection, suggesting the migration of particles through preferential flowpaths. Correlation of the electrical response and geochemical data, in particular the analysis of recovered cores from drilling after the injection, confirmed the migration of particles (and stabilizing solution) to shallow areas through fractures formed during the injection.",

Evidence of these interactions are presented based on analyses of an ensemble of NASA satellite data sets, including aerosol optical thickness (AOT) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), as well as an atmospheric reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and a simulation of The Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. We analyzed the components of the rate of change of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) to explore the possible role of dust aerosol radiative forcing on reinforcing energetic terms associated with the African easterly waves (AEWs) during boreal summer seasons when the activity of AEWs peaks. This study shows that the anomalous perturbations in concentration of dust in the oceanic Saharan Air Layer (OSAL) precede amplified growth and decay of the subsequent waves compared to waves occurring prior to dust outbreaks. The amplified EKE associated with dust outbreaks are followed by seeding of new wave packets through enhanced divergence and convergence of ageostrophic geopotential height fluxes in the tropical Atlantic storm track. Meanwhile, the enhanced forcing of the mean-circulation associated with the increased momentum fluxes of the high frequency eddies at the northern track of AEWs occurs with a time-lag after the peak of dust concentration in the OSAL. We suggest that dust radiative heating in the OSAL may act as an additional energy source to amplify the thermal/mechanical activity of eddies in the northern track of the AEWs.",

Climate change and its impacts are already being experienced in the NRB such as increased temperature and decreased number of snowfall days. This study addresses how a warming climate leads to changes in surface water availability across the NRB. We perform a climatology and trend analysis of water budget terms for the NRB including precipitation, river runoff, and evapotranspiration using observed data from 1950 to 2010. Furthermore, we analyze the future changes in these parameters using statistically downscaled data of CMIP5 climate models for RCP8.5 scenario focusing 2050s and 2080s time slices. Mann-Kendall trend test is used for the trend analysis. We find that during the last six decades, annual mean temperature of the NRB has risen by 1.17°C, and the contribution of snow to the runoff has significantly declined. The runoff to precipitation ratio shows significantly decreasing trend of 0.02 per decade. Further, with significant increase in temperature by 2080s, the NRB may shift from snowmelt to a rainfall-dominated system. This alternation has potential to adversely affect a range of water-dependent resource sectors. This study is expected to advance the understanding on the hydrological changes in the NRB and help to improve management of water resources.",

An accurate 2D model of the attenuation experienced by seismic waves traveling through the earth is especially important for reasonable amplitude estimation at small event-to-station distances. In this study, we investigate the detailed attenuation structure in the region around southern Nevada as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE). The SPE consists of a series of chemical explosions at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) designed to improve our understanding of explosion physics and enable better modeling of explosion sources. Phase I of the SPE is currently being conducted in the Climax Stock Granite and Phase II will move to a contrasting dry alluvium geology. A high-resolution attenuation model will aid in the modeling efforts of these experiments. To improve our understanding of the propagation of energy from sources in the area to local and regional stations in the western U.S., we invert regional phases Pn, Pg, and Lg to examine the crust and upper mantle attenuation structure of southern Nevada and the surrounding region. We consider observed amplitudes as the frequency-domain product of a source term, a site term, a geometrical spreading term, and an attenuation (Q) term (e.g. Walter and Taylor, 2001). Initially we take a staged approach to first determine the best 1D Q values; next we calculate source terms using the 1D model, and finally we solve for the best 2D Q parameters and site terms considering all frequencies simultaneously. Our preliminary results agree generally with those from the continent-wide study by Pasyanos (2013). With additional data we are working to develop a more detailed and higher frequency model of the region as well as move toward a fully non-linear inversion.",

            "abstract": "Since 2013 the RHUL group has been identifying methane plumes from major UK sources using a Picarro 2301 coupled to the A0941 mobile module. Once identified the plumes have been sampled by filling Tedlar or Flexfoil bags for later carbon isotopic analysis by high-precision IRMS. This method has ben successfully deployed to isotopically characterize the main anthropogenic methane emitters in the UK (natural gas, coal, landfill, wastewater treatment, cattle; Zazzeri et al., 2015) and during overseas campaigns in eastern Australia (coal, cattle, legacy gas wells) and Kuwait (landfill, wastewater treatment, oil refineries, cattle, camels). This has identified strong similarities of isotopic signature for some sources (landfill, cattle), but large variations for others (natural gas, coal), which must be isotopically resolved at regional scale. Both landfill and natural gas emissions in SE England have tightly-constrained δ13C signatures, averaging -58 ± 3‰ and -36 ± 2‰, respectively, the latter being characteristic of homogenised North Sea gas supply. In contrast, signatures for coal mines in England and Wales fall in a range of 51.2 ± 0.3‰ to 30.9 ± 1.4‰, but can be tightly constrained by region.\nOn a local scale in west London, repeat surveys in the boroughs of Hounslow and Runnymede have been made for comparison with the latest 1x1 km grid UK inventories for 2009 and 2012, which are subdivided by UNECE categories. An excess methane map can be derived for comparison with inventory emissions maps by identifying daily background and binning the excess values from mobile measurements by grid-square. This shows that the spatial distribution of emissions in the UK 2012 inventory is a big improvement on that of 2009. It also suggests that there is an overestimation of emissions from old landfills (closed before 2000 and reliant on a topsoil cap for oxidation), and an underestimation on emissions from currently active landfill cells.\nZazzeri, G. et al.

            "abstract": "The DataBridge is a National Science Foundation funded collaborative project (OCI-1247652, OCI-1247602, OCI-1247663) designed to assist in the discovery of dark data sets from the long tail of science. The DataBridge aims to to build queryable communities of datasets using sociometric network analysis. This approach is being tested to evaluate the ability to leverage various forms of metadata to facilitate discovery of new knowledge. Each dataset in the Databridge has an associated name space used as a first level partitioning. In addition to testing known algorithms for SNA community building, the DataBridge project has built a message-based platform that allows users to provide their own algorithms for each of the stages in the community building process. The stages are:\nSignature Generation (SG): An SG algorithm creates a metadata signature for a dataset. Signature algorithms might use text metadata provided by the dataset creator or derive metadata.\nRelevance Algorithm (RA): An RA compares a pair of datasets and produces a similarity value between 0 and 1 for the two datasets.\nSociometric Network Analysis (SNA): The SNA will operate on a similarity matrix produced by an RA to partition all of the datasets in the name space into a set of clusters. These clusters represent communities of closely related datasets. \nThe DataBridge also includes a web application that produces a visual representation of the clustering. Future work includes a more complete application that will allow different types of searching of the network of datasets.\nThe DataBridge approach is relevant to geoscience research and informatics. In this presentation we will outline the project, illustrate the deployment of the approach, and discuss other potential applications and next steps for the research such as applying this approach to models. In addition we will explore the relevance of DataBridge to other geoscience projects such as various EarthCube Building Blocks and DIBBS projects.",

            "abstract": "Exploration for geothermal energy in Hot Springs Bay Valley (HSBV) on Akutan Island, Alaska, has revealed a rich hydrothermal history, including what appears to be a stage of peak activity during a significant glacial period. Alteration mineralogy observed in 754 m of drill core recovered from the outflow zone is dominated by chlorite and includes minor smectite clays, a suite of zeolite species and several moderately high-temperature hydrothermal minerals (epidote/clinozoisite, prehnite, adularia and wairakite). The latter minerals each have minimum formation temperatures exceeding 200 oC, and fluid inclusion results in related calcite crystals indicate temperatures of formation to be as high as 275 oC, some 100 oC hotter than the modern boiling point with depth (BPD) curve at that depth (>62 m). In order to maintain liquid temperatures this high, the pressure during mineralization must have been substantially greater (~680 bar), a pressure change equivalent to erosion of ~280 m of rock (ρ=2.5 g/cm3). Although glacial erosion rates are too low (0.034 mm/yr; Bekele et al., 2003) for this amount of erosion to occur in a single glaciation, glacial melting and ablation are substantially more rapid (~100 mm/yr; Bekele et al., 2003; Person et al., 2012). Thus, a more probable scenario than pure erosion is that peak hydrothermal conditions occurred during a large glacial event, with the added pressure from the overlying ice allowing the high temperature minerals to form closer to the ground surface. Subsequent melting of the ice eroded upper tributary valleys and upper levels of the originally smectite-rich alteration assemblage, explaining the paucity of swelling clays in the region. We present mineralogical, fluid inclusion and geochronologic evidence to support these conclusions, and discuss the general implications of sub-glacial hydrothermal system formation and geothermal resource potential.\n",

The Charles and the Mystic Rivers, in eastern Massachusetts, have been the subject of such interactions for hundreds of years. Over time, human dependency and settlement have altered the natural conditions of the rivers, and changed the potential for flood occurrence and property damage. As a result, flood management strategies have been enacted to counter this potential. Before we can assess how human vulnerability and actions related to river flooding will change under future climate conditions, we must first document the evolution of flooding and flood management and understand the motivations and thresholds of response that describe how the system has evolved in the past. We have mined historical data from traditional and non-traditional sources and have developed “mental models” from in-depth interviews of key personnel. We will present the socio-hydrological history of the Charles and Mystic Rivers and recommend how this information can inform future flood management strategies in the face of climate change.",

            "abstract": "With recent improvements in geophysical observations and computational capability, the rupture processes of large earthquakes are routinely imaged with seismic and geodetic data. However, similar to other geophysical problems, the inverted solutions are contaminated with uncertainties caused by various limitations, such as data coverage, observational noise, inaccurate earth response, fault parameterization, inversion algorithms, etc. While it is difficult to estimate the exact impact that each source of uncertainty has on the inverted solutions, their potential effects should be honored in the data mining procedure, especially in the design of the misfit function. We notice that for most finite fault inversion algorithms using seismic data, the misfit between observed and synthetic seismograms is assumed to be temporally homoscedastic. However, considering the errors of subfault Green’s functions and the inverted model, the error associated with the waveform misfit should be heteroscedastic, gradually increasing with time. As a result, the misfits associated with early stages of a large rupture should be weighted more compared with those associated with the later stages. In this study, we develop a series of new objective functions to measure waveform misfits in a sense of weighted least squares. The weights are defined as the reciprocals of standard deviations of combined synthetic and observed noise, which are functions of time and are numerically estimated after assuming different noise characterizations of subfault Green’s functions, observations, and inverted source itself. Fast algorithms are developed so that the weights can be updated iteratively even during the nonlinear finite fault inversions. The justifications and potential impacts of these new objective functions are addressed using both the SIV examples and the recent earthquakes. In the end, it is noteworthy that the proposed approaches could be incorporated into other linear and nonlinear finite fault algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Hawaii offers the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop geothermal energy on the only oceanic hotspot in the U.S. As a remote island state, Hawaii is more dependent on imported fossil fuel than any other state in the U.S., and energy prices are 3 to 4 times higher than the national average. The only proven resource, located on Hawaii Island’s active Kilauea volcano, is a region of high geologic risk; other regions of probable resource exist but lack adequate assessment. The last comprehensive statewide geothermal assessment occurred in 1983 and found a potential resource on all islands (Hawaii Institute of Geophysics, 1983).\nPhase 1 of a Department of Energy funded project to assess the probability of geothermal resource potential statewide in Hawaii was recently completed. The execution of this project was divided into three main tasks: (1) compile all historical and current data for Hawaii that is relevant to geothermal resources into a single Geographic Information System (GIS) project; (2) analyze and rank these datasets in terms of their relevance to the three primary properties of a viable geothermal resource: heat (H), fluid (F), and permeability (P); and (3) develop and apply a Bayesian statistical method to incorporate the ranks and produce probability models that map out Hawaii’s geothermal resource potential. Here, we summarize the project methodology and present maps that highlight both high prospect areas as well as areas that lack enough data to make an adequate assessment. We suggest a path for future exploration activities in Hawaii, and discuss how this method of analysis can be adapted to other regions and other types of resources.\nThe figure below shows multiple layers of GIS data for Hawaii Island. Color shades indicate crustal density anomalies produced from inversions of gravity (Flinders et al. 2013). Superimposed on this are mapped calderas, rift zones, volcanic cones, and faults (following Sherrod et al., 2007). These features were used to identify probable locations of intrusive rock (heat) and permeability.",

            "abstract": "Phytoliths are microscopic grains of silica (SiO2∙nH2O) formed within plants. The biomineralization process typically encapsulates small quantities of carbon termed phytC. Upon decomposition, phytoliths are released from biomass and into soils. Recent research has suggested that phytC may be a large sink of atmospheric CO2 in soils. Important steps, therefore, are to quantify phytC cycling across ecosystems and to measure it’s importance relative to the organic C cycle as a whole. Thus, information regarding phytC pool sizes and flux rates are needed. To an extent this has been performed. PhytC quantities can be easily estimated as long as 1) phytolith quantities and 2) the amount of C present in phytoliths are known. The quantity of C within phytoliths is still a subject of debate, but recent work has found quantities of less than 0.22%. Older studies, which rely on extraction methods which are now known to incompletely remove surface organic residues, have found phytC quantities from 1% to 20%. Hence, studies of phytC cycling using outdated methods may lead to overestimates. In order to re-estimate phytC dynamics, we compiled an extensive list of published works which document phytolith pools in above-ground biomass and soils, as well as flux rates. From these data phytC quantities were calculated using revised estimates of phytolith C percentages. PhytC quantities were also compared to total organic C (TOC) pools and fluxes. These calculations were then extrapolated to biome and global scales. At the biome scale, our results indicate that phytC within living biomass and soil pools as well as fluxes are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. PhytC is generally less than 0.01% of biomass TOC, and less than 1% of soil TOC. Annual phytC fluxes are less than 0.01% of TOC fluxes. At the global scale, annual phytC production is approximately 0.01% to 0.10% of gross C production. The findings of the present study suggest that direct C sequestration by phytoliths may not be as significant as once thought. Recent research has found that at least some phytC originates from soil organic C, which raises further questions about the amount of C actually sequestered. This, coupled with the trace amounts of phytC existing in nature, demonstrate that this component of TOC is not a viable C sequestration mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Recent work suggests that debris flow activity has occurred on Mars in the last few million years during high orbital obliquities, but estimating the amount and frequency of liquid water needed to generate these types of flows is still poorly constrained. While it is relatively common to estimate water amounts needed to produce landforms on Mars, such as gullies or alluvial fans, this is something rarely done on Earth. Consequently, there is little field data on the linkage between climate (snowmelt or rainfall events) and the amount of runoff needed to produce specific volumes of sediment in a landform.\nHere, we present field and modeling data from Meteor Crater, which is a ~50,000 year old impact crater in northern Arizona (USA). Though it is very well preserved, it has developed gullies along its inner wall, similar in form to many gullies on Mars. Meteor Crater, similar to many Martian craters, has also gone through a change in a climate based on the ~30 m of lake sediments on its now dry floor, and what has eroded from its walls has deposited on its floor, making it a closed system. We show using LiDAR-derived topographic data and field observations that debris flows, likely generated by runoff entrainment into talus bordering bedrock cliffs of the crater walls, drove erosion and deposition processes at Meteor Crater. Cosmogenic dating of levee deposits indicates that debris flows ceased in the early Holocene, synchronous with regional drying. For a water-to-rock ratio of 0.3 at the time of transport, which is based on data from rotating drum experiments, it would have taken ~150,000 m3 of water to transport the estimated ~500,000 m3 of debris flow deposits found at the surface of the crater floor. This extensive erosion would require less than 0.4 m of total runoff over the 0.35 km2 upslope source area of the crater, or ~26 mm of runoff per debris flow event. Much more runoff did occur however, as evidenced by lake deposits on the crater floor and Holocene fluvial activity. Our analysis suggests that depositional landforms may record only a small fraction of the total runoff, which has implications for analyses on Mars. Current work is focused on using a hydrodynamic model to predict the conditions (frequency-intensity-duration) that can produce runoff capable of transporting sediment and initiating debris flow failures at Meteor Crater.",

            "abstract": "We compare two seismological indicators of lithospheric deformation along the Himalayan arc from the foothills to the Tibetan plateau, from the eastern to the western syntaxis. The first method is shear wave splitting of core phases such as SKS, which has poor depth resolution but is typically presumed to be primarily sensitive to mantle anisotropy. The data come from a network in western Tibet as well as a worldwide compilation database of results from temporary and permanent networks.\nThe second method is an azimuthal harmonic analysis of receiver functions. Azimuthally varying arrivals in radial and transverse component receiver functions are generated by dipping isotropic contrasts as well as by contrasts in dipping foliation with anisotropy. Both show a two-lobed pattern with backazimuth that identifies the strike of the dipping isotropic contrast or of the foliation. If dipping isotropic contrasts and dipping foliation are formed in the same deformation regime, their strikes are expected to be parallel to one another. The method is different from splitting of P-to-S converted phases. We analyze receiver function data from temporary deployments and permanent stations extending from West Tibet to the eastern syntaxis.\nSKS results show considerable variation across the arc, including variation in splitting times as well as fast axes on a short spatial scale of ~ 50 km. The scatter is larger within the Himalaya and towards the syntaxes than in the plateau interior. The foliation and dip signal in receiver functions is dominated by crustal arrivals. The mapped strikes are parallel to along-arc faults and to known strike-slip systems and show high regional coherence. We show maps of statistical correlations between splitting fast axes and receiver function strikes and show models of expected orientations seen by the two methods in crust and mantle for different deformation models and compositions. We compare the results to different orogens such as Taiwan, where SKS fast axes, receiver function strikes, and orogen axes are all parallel, and the Zagros, where receiver function strikes are orogen-parallel but SKS splits are null. We discuss the results in terms of tectonic models of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, e.g. northward extent of Indian lithosphere and deformation mechanisms operating in the area.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade and a half, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have increasingly been used to reconstruct environmental temperatures; proxies like TEX86 that correlate the relative abundance of these archaeal cell membrane lipids to sea surface temperature are omnipresent in paleoclimatology literature. While it has become common to make claims about past temperatures using GDGTs, our present understanding of the organisms that synthesize the compounds is still quite limited. The generally accepted theory states that microorganisms like the Thaumarchaeota modify the structure of membrane lipids to increase intermolecular interactions, strengthening the membrane at higher temperatures. Yet to date, culture experiments have been largely restricted to a single species, Nitrosopumilus maritimes, and recent studies on oceanic archaeal rRNA have revealed that these biomarkers are produced in diverse, heterogeneous, and site-specific communities. This brings up questions as to whether different subclasses of GDGTs, and all subsequent proxies, represent adaptation within a single organismal group or a shift in community composition. To investigate whether GDGTs with different chain structures, from the simple isoprenoidal GDGT-0 to Crenarchaeol with its many cyclopentane groups, are sourced from archaea with similar or disparate metabolic pathways—and if that information is inherited in GDGTs trapped in marine sediments—this study examines the stable carbon isotope values (δ13C) of GDGTs extracted from the uppermost meters of sediment in the Orca Basin, Gulf of Mexico, using spooling-wire microcombustion isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (SWiM-IRMS), tackling a fundamental assumption of the TEX86 proxy that influences the way we perceive the veracity of existing temperature records.",

            "abstract": "Dual continuum computational models which include both porous media and discrete fracture zones are valuable tools in assessing groundwater migration and pathways in fractured rock systems. Fracture generation models can produce stochastic realizations of fracture networks which honor geological structures and fracture propagation behaviors. Surface lineament traces can be propagated to depth based on fracture zone statistics to produce representations of geological structures in rock. The generated discrete, complex and irregular fracture zone networks, represented as a triangulated mesh, are embedded using orthogonal quadrilateral elements within a three-dimensional hexahedral finite element mesh.\nA detailed coupled density-dependent paleohydrogeologic groundwater analysis of a hypothetical 104 km2 portion of the Canadian Shield has been conducted using the discrete-fracture dual continuum finite element model FRAC3DVS to investigate the characterization of large-scale fracture zone networks on groundwater and tracer movement during a 120,000 year paleoclimate cycle. Permeability reduction due to permafrost was also applied. Time series data for the depth of permafrost, along with ice thickness and lake depth, were provided by the University of Toronto (UofT) Glacial Systems Model. The crystalline rock between fracture zones was assigned properties characteristic of those reported for the Canadian Shield. Total dissolved solids concentrations of 300 g/L are encountered at depth. Surface water features and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used in a GIS framework to define the watershed boundaries at surface water divides and to populate the finite element mesh. This work will illustrate the long-term evolution and stability of the geosphere and groundwater systems to external perturbations caused by glaciation through the use of performance measures such as Mean Life Expectancy and the migration of a unit tracer to depth over a paleoclimate cycle.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has lead to significant glacier retreat in the tropical Andes over the past several decades. Despite the apparent hiatus in warming along the Pacific coast, temperature continues to rise at higher elevations, putting smaller glaciers in lower lying mountain ranges on the verge of complete disappearance.\nAs a result water availability and water quality in glacier-fed river systems will be reduced during the dry season. The lack of a seasonal snow cover in the tropics, which provides for an additional hydrologic buffer in mid-latitude mountain ranges, further exacerbates the situation. Altered precipitation regimes, including changes in total precipitation amount, changes in the rain/snow ratio, or changes in the wet season length will also affect water availability, but projections of these changes are currently fraught with uncertainty.\nThe importance of glacier-fed water supply varies between regions and depends on the presence of other water regulators (reservoirs, wetlands), the length of the dry season and the trajectory of water demand (population growth, expanding economic activities).\nHere we will review downscaled CMIP5 model results for some of these mountain ranges and discuss the consequences of future warming and projected precipitation changes for the Andean cryosphere, while considering uncertainties associated with downscaling methodology, model dependency and choice of emission scenario.\nAdaptation strategies will be evaluated in the light of these results, discussing the need to pursue no-regret strategies, when implementing water conservation measures. Lessons learned from past adaptation and capacity building activities in the region will be discussed, emphasizing a) the need to strengthen the institutional standing of authorities involved in glacier research, b) alignment of capacity building and international cooperation with the national and regional needs and c) improvements to long-term climate and glacier monitoring programs in the region, allowing for a more adequate future management of water resources.",

GLOBE students conduct real science – ask questions, make observations, do measurements, analyze data, and participate in research collaborations with other students and Earth scientists. In the U.S., GLOBE operates through a GLOBE Implementation Office and partnerships with U.S. organizations that recruit schools, train teachers at professional development workshops, and mentor teachers and their students to engage in GLOBE learning and research activities. Internationally, GLOBE is implemented through bilateral agreements between the U.S. government and those of partner countries that provide the structure and funding to fulfill the responsibilities and functions of a GLOBE Partnership. GLOBE students have contributed more than 129 million measurements to ongoing science investigations. GLOBE, in its 20th year, has been successful in engaging students in Earth as a system and environmental science studies during K-12 schooling and beyond as students go into college and in their careers. GLOBE Alumni is a grassroots community of former GLOBE students committed to continue GLOBE activities at a higher level. They have worked with GLOBE in Estonia, Czech Republic, Benin, Thailand and Peru, to support teachers and students in student scientific research to better understand the Earth as a system and the environment. Survey results of participants at the 2014 GLOBE Learning Expedition indicate that 53% of GLOBE students would likely choose GLOBE involvement beyond secondary school, 80 % of teachers are likely to engage former GLOBE students as near-peer mentors to their students, 70% of GLOBE Partners are likely to use the assistance of former GLOBE students when training teachers and 100% of GLOBE Partners and teachers consider former GLOBE students who may be in college or graduated, valuable as research mentors to their GLOBE students. Scientists asked how valuable they think GLOBE alumni can be to a GLOBE-wide student collaborative scientific research project; all responded in the affirmative with one scientist saying “Extremely valuable, one of the best things that happened proving the value of the program”.",

All it requires is a VLF radio receiver monitoring the amplitude and/or phase of a beacon signal over time, which perturbs during ionospheric disturbances.\nFor much of this field’s history, amplitude and phase were analyzed and presented as individual data streams. A clever formulation known as scattered field analysis was recently reintroduced, which combines amplitude and phase into a single measurement, and calculates the phasor of the scattered field, providing insights that would otherwise be missed by either amplitude or phase individually.\nIn this presentation we describe another useful formulation that goes one step further, combining the amplitude and phase of two horizontal magnetic field channels into a single measurement: polarization ellipse. This allows insights that would otherwise by missed by examining one channel at a time.\nUsing this formulation, we take a new look at ionospheric disturbances from thunderstorms, including early/fast events and lightning-induced electron precipitation.",

The Viking, Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix, and Curiosity landers and rovers each included the ability to image the Sun with a science camera equipped with a neutral density filter. Direct images of the Sun not only provide the ability to measure extinction by dust and ice in the atmosphere, but also provide a variety of constraints on the Martian dust and water cycles. These observations have been used to characterize dust storms, to provide ground truth sites for orbiter-based global measurements of dust loading, and to help monitor solar panel performance. In the cost-constrained environment of Mars exploration, future missions may omit such cameras, as the solar-powered InSight mission has. We seek to provide a robust capability of determining atmospheric opacity from sky images taken with cameras that have not been designed for solar imaging, such as the engineering cameras onboard Opportunity and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on Curiosity. Our investigation focuses primarily on the accuracy of a method that determines optical depth values using scattering models that implement the ratio of sky radiance measurements at different elevation angles, but at the same scattering angle. Operational use requires the ability to retrieve optical depth on a timescale useful to mission planning, and with an accuracy and precision sufficient to support both mission planning and validating orbital measurements. We will present a simulation-based assessment of imaging strategies and their error budgets, as well as a validation based on the comparison of direct extinction measurements from archival Navcam, Hazcam, and MAHLI camera data.",

We investigate the solar energy balance in the ice-ocean system using in-situ data collected from Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites and imagery from high resolution optical satellites. AON assets, including ice mass balance buoys and ice tethered profilers, monitor the storage and fluxes of heat in the ice-ocean system. High resolution satellite imagery, processed using object-based image classification techniques, allows us to quantify the evolution of surrounding ice conditions, including melt pond coverage and floe size distribution, at aggregate scale. We present results from regionally representative sites that constrain the partitioning of absorbed solar energy between ice melt and ocean storage, and quantify the strength of the ice-albedo feedback. We further demonstrate how the results can be used to validate model representations of the physical processes controlling ice-albedo feedbacks. The techniques can be extended to understand solar partitioning across the Arctic basin using additional sites and model based data integration.",

            "abstract": "Continental rifting ultimately creates a deep accommodation space for sediment. When a major river flows into a late-stage rift, thick deltaic sediment can change the thermal regime and alter the mechanisms of extension and continental breakup. The Salton Trough, the northernmost rift segment of the Gulf of California plate boundary, has experienced the same extension as the rest of the Gulf, but is filled to sea level by sediment from the Colorado River. Unlike the southern Gulf, seafloor spreading has not initiated. Instead, seismicity, high heat flow, and minor volcanoes attest to ongoing rifting of thin, transitional crust.\nRecently acquired controlled-source seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection data in the Salton Trough provide constraints upon crustal architecture and active rift processes. The crust in the central Salton Trough is only 17-18 km thick, with a strongly layered but relatively one-dimensional structure for ~100 km in the direction of plate motion. The upper crust includes 2-4 km of Colorado River sediment. Crystalline rock below the sediment is interpreted to be similar sediment metamorphosed by the high heat flow and geothermal activity. Meta-sediment extends to at least 9 km depth. A 4-5 km thick layer in the middle crust is either additional meta-sediment or stretched pre-existing continental crust. The lowermost 4-5 km of the crust is rift-related mafic magmatic intrusion or underplating from partial melting in the hot upper mantle.\nNorth American lithosphere in the Salton Trough has been almost or completely rifted apart. The gap has been filled by ~100 km of new transitional crust created by magmatism from below and sedimentation from above. These processes create strong lithologic, thermal, and rheologic layering. While heat flow in the rift is very high, rapid sedimentation cools the upper crust as compared to a linear geotherm. Brittle extension occurs within new meta-sedimentary rock. The lower crust, in comparison, is maintained hot and weak by the overlying sedimentary thermal blanket. The lower crust stretches by ductile flow and magmatism is not localized. In this passive rift driven by distant plate motions, rapid sedimentation and its thermal effects delay final breakup of the crust and the onset of seafloor spreading.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Xu_2015_AGU.pdf\nA modeling approach to methane (CH4) is widely used to quantify the budget, investigate spatial and temporal variabilities, and understand the mechanistic processes and environmental controls on CH4 fluxes across spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, CH4 models are an important tool for integrating CH4 data from multiple sources, such as laboratory-based incubation and molecular analysis, field observational experiments, remote sensing, and aircraft-based measurements across a variety of terrestrial ecosystems. We reviewed 39 terrestrial CH4 models to characterize their strengths and weaknesses and to design a roadmap for future model improvement and application. We found that: (1) the focus of CH4 models have been shifted from theoretical to site- to regional-level application over the past four decades, expressed as dramatic increases in CH4 model development on regional budget quantification; (2) large discrepancies exist among models in terms of representing CH4 processes and their environmental controls; (3) significant data-model and model-model mismatches are partially attributed to different representations of wetland characterization and inundation dynamics. Three efforts should be paid special attention for future improvements and applications of fully mechanistic CH4 models: (1) CH4 models should be improved to represent the mechanisms underlying land-atmosphere CH4 exchange, with emphasis on improving and validating individual CH4 processes over depth and horizontal space; (2) models should be developed that are capable of simulating CH4 fluxes across space and time (particularly hot moments and hot spots); (3) efforts should be invested to develop model benchmarking frameworks that can easily be used for model improvement, evaluation, and integration with data from molecular to global scales. A newly developed microbial functional group-based CH4 model (CLM-Microbe) was further used to demonstrate the features of mechanistic representation and integration with multiple source of observational datasets.",

            "abstract": "Assessments of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), an important pathway for material transport to coastal embayments, are difficult, as there is no simple means to estimate the water flux. Because of processes like tidal pumping, non-homogeneous bottom sediment compositions, high hydrologic and hydrogeologic “heterogeneity”, and the likelihood of multiple sources (i.e. different aquifers or recirculated seawater) within a study region, there could be significant variation in the magnitude of discharge. Furthermore, in highly saline semi-arid environments such as south Texas, density-driven flow will also influence the discharge rates and location of seepage faces. Thus, discharge throughout a bay is undoubtedly variable temporally and spatially so it is not reasonable to extrapolate a single flow rate to the entire surface area. Multiple approaches are necessary especially where the terrestrial groundwater is not fresh like in coastal area of south Texas. To meet this challenge, we have explored the use of high-resolution continuous subsurface imaging techniques, continuous radon monitoring, and other geochemical tracers to more precisely measure SGD and nutrient fluxes to coastal zone waters over time periods of hours and under different climatic conditions. This approach allowed us to differentiate between fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater, delineate seepage faces as dependent on / independent of sediment heterogeneity and convective flow caused by density differences. We were able to also correct SGD rates derived from continuous radon monitoring that can be significantly variable on account of observation uncertainties associated with the above-mentioned complications. Areas of significant SGD, as shown by both continuous resistivity profiling and radon and radium isotopes, were also associated with the highest non-conservative nutrient (i.e. nitrate) concentrations. Overall, this combination of methods shows promise in differentiating between flow driven by terrestrial processes (hydraulic gradients) and recirculated seawater caused by oceanic forcing.",

            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of regional broadband seismic arrays in Alberta provides an unprecedented opportunity to map the subsurface seismic structure. In this study, we compute the P-to-S receiver functions from 5 regional seismic networks and 62 stations to determine the crustal properties beneath southern-central Alberta, a boundary zone between the Mesozoic Canadian Cordillera and the Precambrian craton(s). The optimal Moho depth and Vp/Vs ratio at each receiver are determined by tracing the direct P, converted (Pms) and reverberated (PpPms and PpSms+PsPms) phases through a three-dimensional shear velocity model. The resulting Moho depth-Vp/Vs ratio (H-K) image shows more coherent stacking amplitudes than the traditional H-K method. The map of Moho depth shows an increase of crustal thickness from an average of 41 km in Precambrian domains to ~50 km beneath the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, which indicates a strong crustal gradient across the craton-domain boundary in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The surface elevations along the foreland belt of the Rockies are isostatically compensated by a thickened crustal root, which is consistent with thick-skinned deformation likely sustained during the Laramide phase of the Farallon subduction. To the west of the foreland belt, however, a relatively thin crust with an average thickness of ~36 km is mapped beneath the extreme topography of southern Canadian Rockies. The lack of a deep crustal root is inconsistent with the Airy isostasy model, implying very high temperatures beneath the Cordillera upper mantle. Ratios of average crustal velocities (Vp/Vs) vary from 1.61 to 1.91 across the study region. The smallest values are observed near the northern Snowbird Tectonic Zone (STZ) and Taltson magmatic arc, which suggest a felsic crust resulted from crustal thickening and melting during the early Proterozoic. On the other hand, the Vp/Vs ratio shows the highest value (~1.9) in the vicinity of the Vulcan structure, a proposed suture zone between the Medicine Hat Block and Archean Hearne province. This observation, in combination with a southward-thickening crust, implies extensive Post-collisional mafic magmatism (i.e. underplating) in the Paleoproterozoic eon.",

To better understand the reasons for this bias, we 1) compare the vertical profile of aerosol extinction coefficient from several CMIP5 models to that observed from CALIPSO; and 2) calculate linear cross correlations between convective mass flux, precipitation and aerosol vertical dispersivity using MERRA, GPCP and CALIPSO, respectively, to determine the relationships between convective lofting versus wet removal on the vertical aeorosol profile. Relative to CALIPSO, models underestimate aerosol extinction below 500 hPa by 2-11%, but overestimate aerosol extinction by 3-14% above 500 hPa. Results show more convective mass flux is associated with more precipitation over the entire globe. In the tropics, more convective mass flux and precipitation are correlated to more aerosol aloft. On the other hand, more convective mass flux and precipitation anticorrelate with aerosol aloft over the ocean between 30-60N. Aerosol aloft over this region is linked to the convective mass flux over the aerosol emission sources. Our results suggest ambient convective mass flux, leading to both enhanced aerosol lofting and wet removal by convective precipitation, contributing to model bias both below and above 500 hPa. Sensitivity experiment with CAM5 will be performed to try to better understand model deficiencies.",

Between September 2014 and July 2015, Athabasca University conducted three field campaigns to roll out a 10-station magnetometer network across northern Quebec. Called AUTUMNX, the network is primarily structured along two meridional chains to provide maximal auroral zone coverage in eastern North America, and where possible, take advantage of the magnetic conjugal relationships with Antarctica and the GOES East geostationary weather satellite. The array began producing 10-second real-time data product reliably since July 2015 after improvements to network equipment at select sites in the spring of 2015. Overall, the array has been producing full resolution 2-Hz data on 1-hour delay from most sites since network roll out in November 2014 through the AUTUMNX data portal and through THEMIS SPEDAS. With stable real-time telemetry now flowing, AUTUMNX is ready to play an important role in reporting local space weather conditions leading to geomagnetic induced currents (GICs), which we have been able to link to reported harmonic distortion in the Hydro-Québec power grid.",

            "abstract": "The 1912 eruption of Novarupta-Katmai was the world’s most voluminous eruption since the 1815 eruption of Tombora. The eruption produced 17 km3 of ashfall and 11 km3 of pyroclastic flow deposits that filled nearby valleys, creating what is today known as the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. These voluminous pyroclastic deposits continue to pose hazards when strong winds in the valley resuspend ash in times of low snow cover. These resuspension events may be confined to the valley and only recorded when there are local observations (web camera images, field crew). Occasionally, however, these events can loft ash up to altitudes of several kilometers and extend up to 250 km downwind, where it becomes an aviation hazard. A compilation of satellite observations and pilot reports indicate that such significant events occurred on at least 19 occasions since 2003. The longest duration events occurred in the autumn months of September and October. Predicting the resuspension of ash requires estimates of when the ash is exposed (low snow cover), the magnitude of surface wind gusts, and the threshold friction velocity (u*). Models of u* require a characterization of the source ash (density, grain-size distribution) as well as soil moisture. We have sampled source deposits and have installed instruments in the Katmai region to record the relevant meteorological parameters in order to better predict these resuspension events. Using real-time measurements coupled with high-resolution (6 km, 1 hour) meteorological forecast products and a reanalysis of conditions that produced historic events, we constrain the parameters applicable the resuspension of Novarupta ash thus improving our ability to forecast this potential ash hazard. The volcanic ash dispersion and deposition model, Ash3d, will be used to forecast the transport of the resuspended ash.",

            "abstract": "We used NIRSPEC on the Keck telescope in 2014 to spectrally resolve line profiles of CH3D, NH3, PH3, and H2O in 5-micron Hot Spots on Jupiter. The profile of the CH3D lines is very broad in both NEB and SEB Hot Spots due to collisions with up to 8 bars of H2, where unit optical depth occurs due to collision-induced H2 opacity. The extreme width of these CH3D features implies that Hot Spots do not have significant cloud opacity for P > 2 bars. We retrieved NH3, PH3, and gaseous H2O inside a Hot Spot at 8.8°N in the NEB and also in an SEB Hot Spot at 17°S. Both Hot Spots have similar radiances, indicating that both regions have very thin upper-level clouds. They both have a strong depletion in H2O for P< 4 bars, suggesting that subsidence is responsible for the depletion of volatiles in Hot Spots. The NEB Hot Spot is depleted in NH3 with respect to adjacent latitudes. Interestingly, the SEB Hot Spot does not have a different NH3 abundance than neighboring regions. The SEB, including the Hot Spot, exhibits strong NH3 absorption in the 2 to 4-bar region.\nThe SEB went through a “fade” or whitening in 2010, and a subsequent “revival” or darkening between 2010 and 2014, implying a cycle of condensation and sublimation of NH3 ice. This cycle may play a role in the differences we observed between the NEB and SEB Hot Spots. The dynamical origin of SEB Hot Spots is much less studied than that of NEB Hot Spots, so our observations of NH3 humidity may provide a key piece of the puzzle. We plan to acquire 5-micron spectra simultaneously with spatially-resolved microwave observations, such as with the Juno Microwave Radiometer or the Very Large Array. Microwave opacity is dominated by gaseous NH3 rather than cloud opacity. We predict that SEB Hot Spots where the 5-micron spectrum shows strong NH3 absorption (like those we observed in 2014) would not stand out in microwave data, breaking the 1:1 correspondence seen between microwave and 5-micron intensity by Sault et al. (2004, Icarus 168 336-343.)",

In recent years, the SAGE program has focused on the western edge of the Española basin and the transition into the Santo Domingo basin of the RGR. During this time, we have collected about 40 km of seismic reflection and refraction data along approximately East-West profiles using a 120 channel data acquisition system with a 20 m station interval and a Vibroseis source. Refraction travel time modeling and Common Midpoint (CMP) stacked reflection sections have imaged basin boundary faults and stratigraphy. We also have access to several energy-industry seismic reflection record sections from the 1970s in the study area. These data and some deep drill hole information have allowed detailed interpretation of basin structures along segments of three regional transects across the RGR in northern New Mexico. The interpreted seismic velocities and fault images from the seismic record sections, and lithologies and well logs from drill holes, have also provided important constraints on modeling and interpretation of the regional gravity data along the three transects. The gravity modeling along these transects reveals key structures within the basin including the eastern bounding fault of the Los Alamos graben, eastern boundary faults of the Santo Domingo basin, the Agua Fria fault system near the eastern boundary of the Española basin and interpreted depths to basement of the Española and Santo Domingo basins. Boundary fault offsets are as large as 3 km and maximum basin depths range from 3 to 6 km.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural land generates overland flow differently from natural environment due to features from anthropogenic activities such as cultivated soil layer and tile drain pipe. During rainfall events, the formation of overland flow may happen from infiltration excess and/or saturation excess according to the threshold processes which are influenced by rainfall characteristics and soil hydraulic parameters. The dynamics of threshold processes in varying rainfall and soil hydraulic conditions will affect the surface runoff response which can be inversely analyzed by visually observing the generated saturation patterns.\nThis study aims to explore the use of time-lapse photographs of saturated plot during rainfall events to observe and understand the threshold processes of overland flow generation. The observation was conducted at Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in Lower Austria with a 2 megapixels surveillance camera overlooking a 1.8 ha tile-drained agricultural field situated on a hillslope. The main tile drain pipe extends from the higher ground into the riparian area – creating a depression line which generates the main saturation track. The time-lapse photographs are able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of 0.1 ha saturated plot (117 m long and 10 m wide in average) during three big rainfall events in 2014 which produced measurable overland flow. The photographs also manage to capture the behavior of overland flow on tractor tracks which were generated faster than on the main saturated plot – due to the more compacted soil – and contribute significantly to the overall overland flow discharge and movements. Comparison of the photographs with on-field manual plotting shows good accuracy of the captured saturation plot and the possibility of calculating the plot area digitally. This method gives opportunity to observe overland flow generation on visual basis as a complement of the customary discharge measurements.",

COCONet (Continuously Operating Caribbean Observational Network), which consists of 83 new and refurbished cGNSS/Met stations, spans the entire Caribbean region. TLALOCNet (Trans-boundary Land and Atmospheric Long-term Observational and Collaborative Network) is a similar 24-station in Mexico. Data are being used to study solid earth processes such as plate kinematics, plate boundary deformation, and the earthquake cycle; in addition, by providing more precise estimates of tropospheric water vapor to better forecast the dynamics associated with the annual Caribbean hurricane cycle and the North American monsoon, they also address atmospheric science objectives. COCONet and TLALOCNet rely on the concept of building partnerships with a range of stakeholders that support a common goal of providing free, high-quality, low-latency, open-format data and data products.\nAs part of COCONet, UNAVCO completed installation of sea level monitoring instruments at two locations in the Caribbean Basin. Additionally, two existing sea level stations were upgraded with co-located GNSS hardware. The locations (Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic) enhance the coverage of tide gauge instrumentation in the Caribbean region. Each station consists of tide gauge instruments (radar and pressure gauge) on a marine pier co-located with a cGNSS/Met system. A second cGNSS system is installed nearby (<5km).\nGNSS data from over 100 COCONet and TLALOCNet stations are available at http://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/data-access-methods/dai2/app/dai2.html. Sea level data are available at the IOC sea level archive (ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org). We present the siting plan, construction status, and other highlights of the COCONet and TLALOCNet projects, including the establishment of regional GNSS/Met data centers in Mexico and the Caribbean.",

            "abstract": "When studying subduction zone deformation one is often forced to consider a region significantly landward of the trench. The Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica presents a unique opportunity to obtain rich datasets from land in relatively close proximity to an active megathrust. A recent moment magnitude (Mw) 7.6 earthquake in September 2012 on this portion of the Middle America Trench affords an opportunity to constrain the ongoing postseismic deformation on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean plates. GPS campaigns occupying 22 sites were undertaken immediately following the earthquake in September-December 2012 and most recently in March 2015. Combined with data from a network of 17 continuous GPS in the region, we analyze the spatial and temporal changes in the postseismic velocity field. Another campaign is planned for 2017, in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of the continuous GPS network.\nAfter 2.5 years, campaign GPS results indicate significant trenchward motion of at least 7 cm, relative to a fixed Caribbean plate, for all sites up to the volcanic chain. Maximum values of 22 cm are observed above and updip of the coseismic rupture zone. The trench-parallel component of the displacement field is small, with few deviations between sites. Together these observations are substantially more self-similar over a larger region than what was observed for the coseismic offset. This implies that there may be a low stress differential across the upper plate, suggesting that the subduction interface environment, including the mainshock and surrounding area, has remained relatively weak following the earthquake. By utilizing a dense and long-term geodetic network we will report on initial modeling that aims to characterize the evolution of afterslip. The effect of regional aftershocks, including an Mw 6.5 in October 2012, and viscoelastic mantle relaxation will be considered to establish the necessity of such effects in robustly accounting for postseismic deformation. We will also compare our afterslip results with observations of intereseismic locking and slow slip events for the region.",

This study focuses on a cross section of the Rio Paguate, adjacent to the Jackpile Mine on the Laguna Reservation, west-central New Mexico. Often, the geochemical interactions that occur in the hyporheic zone adjacent to these abandoned mines play an important role in trace element mobility. In order to understand the mobility of uranium (U), arsenic (As), and vanadium (V) in the Rio Paguate; surface water, hyporheic zone water, and core sediment samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). All water samples were filtered through 0.45μm and 0.22μm filters and analyzed. The results show that there is no major difference in concentrations of U (378-496μg/L), As (0.872-6.78μg/L), and V (2.94–5.01μg/L) between the filter sizes or with depth (8cm and 15cm) in the hyporheic zone. The unfiltered hyporheic zone water samples were analyzed after acid digestion to assess the particulate fraction. These results show a decrease in U concentration (153-202μg/L) and an increase in As (33.2-219μg/L) and V (169-1130μg/L) concentrations compared to the filtered waters. Surface water concentrations of U(171-184μg/L) are lower than the filtered hyporheic zone waters while As(1.32-8.68μg/L) and V(1.75-2.38μg/L) are significantly lower than the hyporheic zone waters and particulates combined. Concentrations of As in the sediment core samples are higher in the first 15cm below the water-sediment interface (14.3-3.82μg/L) and decrease (0.382μg/L) with depth. Uranium concentrations are consistent (0.047-0.050μg/L) at all depths. The over all data suggest that U is mobile in the dissolved phase and both As and V are mobile in the particular phase as they travel through the system.",

The initial focus is on Essential Climate Variables identified by the Global Climate Observing System – CH4, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, SO2 and aerosols. This poster addresses our efforts in building the ACP Data Table, an interface to help discover and understand remotely sensed data that are related to atmospheric composition science and applications. We harvested GCMD, CWIC, GEOSS metadata catalogs using machine to machine technologies - OpenSearch, Web Services. We also manually investigated the plethora of CEOS data providers portals and other catalogs where that data might be aggregated. This poster is our experience of the excellence, variety, and challenges we encountered.\nConclusions:\n1.The significant benefits that the major catalogs provide are their machine to machine tools like OpenSearch and Web Services rather than any GUI usability improvements due to the large amount of data in their catalog.\n2.There is a trend at the large catalogs towards simulating small data provider portals through advanced services.\n3.Populating metadata catalogs using ISO19115 is too complex for users to do in a consistent way, difficult to parse visually or with XML libraries, and too complex for Java XML binders like CASTOR.\n4.The ability to search for Ids first and then for data (GCMD and ECHO) is better for machine to machine operations rather than the timeouts experienced when returning the entire metadata entry at once.\n5.Metadata harvest and export activities between the major catalogs has led to a significant amount of duplication. (This is currently being addressed)\n6.Most (if not all) Earth science atmospheric composition data providers store a reference to their data at GCMD.",

We are conducting bench-scale experiments to characterize the mineral dissolution and precipitation and the evolution of permeability in synthetic and natural basalts exposed to CO2-rich fluids. Analytical methods include optical and electron microscopy, electron microprobe, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and micro X-ray computed tomography (μCT) with variable flow rates. Reactive rock and mineral samples consist of 1) packed powders of olivine or natural basalt, and 2) sintered cores of olivine or a synthetic basalt mixture. Each sample was reacted in a batch reactor at 100 °C, and 100 bars CO2. Magnesite is detected within one day in olivine packed beds, and within 15 days in olivine sintered cores. Forsterite and synthetic basalt sinters were also reacted in an NMR apparatus at 102 °C and 65 bars CO2. Carbonate signatures are observed within 72 days of reaction. Longer reaction times are needed for carbonate precipitation in natural basalt samples. Cores from the Columbia River flood basalt flows that contain Mg-rich olivine and a serpentinized basalt from Colorado were cut lengthwise, the interface mechanically roughened or milled, and edges sealed with epoxy to simulate a fractured interface. The cores were reacted in a batch reactor at 50-150 °C and 100 bars CO2. At lower temperatures, calcite precipitation is rare within the fracture after 4 weeks. At higher temperatures, numerous calcite and aragonite crystals are observed within 1 mm of the fracture entrance along the roughened fracture surface. In flow-through experiments, permeability decreased along the fracture paths within a few hours to several days of flow.",

            "abstract": "Meander migration is the principal process controlling how river channels lengthen through time; despite this universal observation, little analysis has been dedicated to evaluating the mechanisms by which meanders accomplish this lengthening. Using an almost yearly archive of Landsat imagery, we show that meandering rivers in the Andes-Foreland Basin of the Amazon Basin lengthen linearly with centreline migration rate, in the absence of cutoff events. We characterised the dominant meander movement mechanism by defining an index we term the symmetry index. The index measures the ratio between downstream and upstream meander erosion about the apex and bounded by inflection points. Indices greater than one represent more translational meander deformation, that is, downstream migration, whereas indices close to one indicate more extensional migration (i.e., increasing meander amplitude).\nWe expanded our dataset to 25 reaches from varying physiographic provinces across the basin. Our results suggest that rivers located in sediment-rich regions migrate more rapidly, and possess higher symmetry indices indicative of more translational bend development. Conversely, rivers with low sediment yields show more extensional bend development. Since alluvial material is responsible for the construction of point bars, rivers conveying larger sediment fluxes have the ability to build bars more quickly. Point bar growth increases channel curvature and deflects high-velocity fluid towards the outer bank encouraging bank erosion. An analysis of point bar locations along the banks of two meandering streams shows that bars positioned downstream of the apex correlate with bends that undergo translational development, whilst material deposited in the centre and upstream of the apex show more extensional and lobing evolution. These results suggest that point bar growth and its relationship to the sediment budget of rivers play an important role in meander migration.",

            "abstract": "The spatial and size distribution of submicron-sized interplanetary dust particles at 1 AU is highly variable due to the nature of its production and transport through the solar system. Nano-dust particles are thought to be produced by mutual collisions between interplanetary dust particles slowly spiraling toward the Sun and are accelerated outward to high velocities by interaction with the solar wind. The WAVES instruments on the two STEREO spacecraft reported the detection, strong temporal variation, and potentially high flux of these particles [Meyer-Vernet et al., 2009].\nSimulations of nano-dust dynamics are performed to gain an understanding of their transport in the inner heliosphere and distribution near 1 AU where they can potentially be detected. Simulations show that the temporal variation in nano-dust detection, as suggested by the STEREO observations, can be described by the dust’s interaction with the complex structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) [Juhasz and Horanyi, 2013]. The dust trajectories and their distribution near Earth’s orbit is a function of the initial conditions of both nano-dust particles and the IMF. Le Chat et al. (2015) reported on the correlation between high nano-dust fluxes observed by STEREO and the observed Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs). We present the results from simulating nano-dust interaction with ICMEs that are modeled as magnetic clouds, and report that the dust trajectories and, thus, their distribution and velocities at 1 AU are significantly altered.",

            "abstract": "Observations of thermosteric and halosteric sea level from hydrographic data, ocean mass from GRACE and altimetric sea surface height are used to infer meridional heat transport (MHT) and freshwater convergence (FWC) anomalies for the Atlantic Ocean. An \"unknown control\" version of a Kalman filter in each of eight regions extracts smooth estimates of heat transport convergence (HTC) and FWC from discrepancies between the sea level response to monthly surface heat and freshwater fluxes and observed heat and freshwater content. The model is run for 1993-2014. Estimates of MHT anomalies are derived by summing the HTC from north to south and adding a spatially uniform, time-varying MHT derived from updated MHT estimates at 41N (Willis 2010). Estimated anomalies in MHT are comparable to those recently observed at the RAPID/MOCHA line at 26.5N. MHT estimates are relatively insensitive to the choice of heat flux products and are highly coherent spatially. MHT anomalies at 35S resemble estimates of Agulhas Leakage derived from altimeter (LeBars et al 2014) suggesting that the Indian Ocean is the source of the anomalous heat inflow. FWC estimates in the Atlantic Ocean (67N to 35S) resemble estimates of Atlantic river inflow (de Couet and Maurer, GRDC 2009). Increasing values of FWC after 2002 at a time when MHT was decreasing may indicate a feedback between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and FWC that would accelerate the AMOC slowdown.",

We present a multivariate Bayesian Poisson regression model for inferring the covariance in tropical cyclone (TC) counts across multiple ocean basins and across Saffir-Simpson intensity categories. Such covariability results from the influence of large-scale modes of climate variability on local environments that can alternately suppress or enhance TC genesis and intensification, and our model also simultaneously quantifies the covariance of TC counts with various climatic modes in order to deduce the source of inter-basin TC covariability. The model explicitly treats the time-dependent uncertainty in observed maximum sustained wind data, and hence the nominal intensity category of each TC. Differences in annual TC counts as measured by different agencies are also formally addressed. The probabilistic output of the model can be probed for probabilistic answers to such questions as:\n- Does the relationship between different categories of TCs differ statistically by basin?\n- Which climatic predictors have significant relationships with TC activity in each basin?\n- Are the relationships between counts in different basins conditionally independent given the climatic predictors, or are there other factors at play affecting inter-basin covariability?\n- How can a portfolio of insured property be optimized across space to minimize risk?\nAlthough we present results of our model applied to TCs, the framework is generalizable to covariance estimation between multivariate counts of natural hazards across regions and/or across peril types.",

The resulting prototype allowed highly automated analysis of δ13C isotopic ratios and CO2 concentration. We achieved a throughput of up to 70 samples per day with DIC contents as low as 1.7 μmol C. We achieved an internal precision of 0.066 ‰ and an external precision of 0.16 ‰, which is comparable to values given for Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS).\nThe prototype instrument is field deployable, suitable for shipboard analysis of deep sea core pore waters. However, the validation of the prototype was centered around a field campaign in Eckernförde Bay, NW- Baltic Sea. As a proof of concept, a shallow site within an area of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and a site outside this area was investigated. We present profiles of δ13C of DIC over 50 cm exhibiting well understood methane turnover processes (anaerobic oxidation of methane).\nAt the lowest point below the seafloor, microbial reduction of CO2 to CH4 dominates. 12CO2 is reduced preferentially over 13CO2, leading to more positive δ13C values in the remaining DIC pool; in layers closer to the surface, the oxidation of CH4 to CO2 becomes more prominent. Since the CH4 pool is enriched in 12C a shift to more negative δ13C can be observed in the DIC pool. In the upper 15 cm, the pore water DIC mixes with the sea water DIC, increasing δ13C again.\nFinally, we will present recent developments to further improve performance and future plans for deployments on research cruises.",

Decrease in ecosystem productivity as well as increase in mortality of some plant species induced by drought and disturbance have been reported. Here, we applied the process-based dynamic vegetation model CARAIB to PNW to simulate the response of water and carbon cycling to current and future climate change projections. The vegetation model has already been successfully applied to Europe to simulate plant physiological response to climate change.\nWe calibrated CARAIB to PNW using global Plant Functional Types. For calibration, the model is driven with the gridded surface meteorological dataset UIdaho MACA METDATA with 1/24-degree (~4-km) resolution at a daily time step for the period 1979-2014. The model ability to reproduce the current spatial and temporal variations of carbon stocks and fluxes was evaluated using a variety of available datasets, including eddy covariance and satellite observations. We focused particularly on past severe drought and fire episodes. Then, we simulated future conditions using the UIdaho MACAv2-METDATA dataset, which includes downscaled CMIP5 projections from 28 GCMs for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We evaluated the future ecosystem carbon balance resulting from changes in drought frequency as well as in fire risk.

In most African countries, supply of drinking water to satisfy population needs is a key issue because of population growth and climate and land use change. During the last three decades, increasing population, changing patterns of water demand, and concentration of population and economic activities in urban areas has pressurize Senegal’s freshwater resources. To overcome this deficit, Senegal turned, to the exploitation of the Lake Guiers. It is the sole water reservoir which can be used extensively as a stable freshwater. Its water is use for irrigating crops and sugar refinery and as a drinking water resource for urban centres, including Dakar, the capital city of Senegal, as well as for the local population and animal herds. To ensure sustainability, a greater understanding of Lake Guiers’s water resources and effective management of its use will be required. In this study we developed and quantified future water situation (water availability and demand) in Lake Guiers under scenarios of climate change and population growth until 2050, using the water management model WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning system). The results show that the pressure on Lake Guiers’s water resources will increase, leading to greater competition between agriculture and municipal demand site. Decreasing inflows due to climate change will aggravate this situation. WEAP results offer basis to assister lake Guiers water resources manager for an efficient long-term planning and management.\nKeywords: climate change, population growth , IWRM, Lake Guiers, Senegal",

Hydrothermal seeps have only recently been discovered, prioritizing their recognition and assessments of the origins/sources of these anomalously warm environments. Trace elements were analyzed with a laser ablation ICP-MS at the Australian National University, avoiding contamination and allowing measurements of recently generated chambers. Living Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Uvigerina peregrina collected from active methane seeps on the east Pacific margin (Costa Rica, Alaska and Hydrate Ridge) have a wider range in both stable isotopic signals and some trace elemental values (e.g., Mg/Ca) compared to nearby inactive areas. Comparisons of additional trace elemental values (e.g., Li/Ca, Cd/Ca, B/Ca, and Ba/Ca) from living Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Uvigerina peregrina from these unique seafloor environments provide additional information in the geochemical influences of cold and hydrothermal seepage on foraminiferal calcite geochemistry. Seep environments are often the result of complex tectonic processes, have implications in past rapid climatic shifts and in future climate change predictions and models, and can influence modern ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles in ways which are not fully understood. Benthic foraminiferal geochemistry provides a potential means to identify seep fluid origins, elucidate seep fluid records and recognize hydrothermal seeps and their spatial and temporal history.",

The factors that control the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are not fully understood, nor are the seasonal and spatial dynamics of these relationships. We sampled six streams along an arctic-boreal gradient in interior Alaska, collecting water from under ice in April, during snowmelt (May), and in early summer (June). These samples were incubated in the laboratory to determine the fraction of DOC that is susceptible to microbial decomposition and the fraction released as carbon dioxide.  Nitrogen and phosphorous additions were used to determine the effect of nutrient limitation on DOC processing. Percent DOC loss across sites ranged from 37-71% in April before snowmelt, 0-9% during snowmelt, and 0-53% in June. We observed no effect of nutrient addition on lability of DOC. Seasonal data are critical to predicting how the processing of DOC in streams will respond to changes in permafrost extent, as well as to changes in the timing of snowmelt and ice-off.",

            "abstract": "The question of “does the streambed change over a flood” does not have a clear answer due to lack of measurement methods during high flows. We seek to inform our understanding of bedload transport by linking field measurements using fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) cable, calculations of disentrainment over time and distance, and in situ measurements of streambed permeability with sediment transport theory and an existing explicit analytical solution to predict depth of sediment deposition and one-dimensional fluid velocity from amplitude and phase information. The method facilitates the study of gravel transport by using near-bed temperature time series to estimate rates of sediment deposition continuously over the duration of a minor flood coinciding with bar formation, including (1) a field method for measuring local rates of deposition and bed elevation change during a minor flood to compute rates of bedload transport, (2) use of an existing analytical solution to quantify the depth of sediment deposition over distance and time from temperature amplitude and phase information, (3) observational and theoretical evidence that incipient motion occurs during a minor flood, (4) observational evidence that suggests rates of sediment transport are not necessarily constant during a constant flow, and (5) field evidence for the persistence of armor layers in gravel bed rivers during a minor flood. These observations of partial bedload transport, taken along a 2 km gravel bed reach of the San Joaquin River, CA, USA during an experimental flow release, suggest that the discharge needed to create the boundary shear is lower than previous estimates, and that partial transport of grain sizes on the bed, including the median particle size, occurs during a minor flood with a current recurrence interval of approximately 1-2 years.",

In addition to agricultural soil amendments, seasonal variation in atmospheric flow introduces dry and wet deposition from urban and desert sources. Both agricultural amendments and atmospheric sources are significant non-point inputs of reactive N, at estimated annual rates of 450 kg/ha and 30 kg/ha respectively in the nearby North China Plain.\nBoth historic and current land use has influenced the biological processing of nitrogen in a particular area. Soil conditions, including moisture, texture, and organic content, control the capacity of a parcel for processing reactive nitrogen. Compounds derived from natural and anthropogenic sources exhibit characteristic stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen that serve as tracers of origin as well as integrators of biological processes. Analysis of bulk soils (including both organic and inorganic N contents) in the system shows δ15N ranging from 1.3 – 8.6 ‰ suggesting varying influence of anthropogenic inputs, fertilizers, soil organic nitrogen, and atmospheric sources based on land use.\nA distributed hydrologic model coupled with one focusing on reactive transport is able to help determine locations with the highest impact on the dissolved N in this system. Spatial statistical methods are employed to determine the biogeochemical influence of model locations whereas δ18O on soil NO3- and δ15N measurements on NO3- and NH4+ in surface water and soil extracts are used to calibrate and validate model predictions based on measured precipitation and streamflow values. Sources are integrated using a Bayesian mixing model to determine likely fate and transport parameters for various N inputs to the watershed. \nThe application of the coupled hydrologic and transport models to a landscape scale catchment suggests integration and expansion to larger watersheds on the basin scale is possible. Identification of sensitive parcels on multiple spatial scales can direct targeted land management efforts to mitigate ecological and health effects of reactive N in surface waters.",

            "abstract": "The presence of toxic metals in watersheds affected by acid drainage (AD) imposes a challenge for sustainable supply of water for cities, agriculture and industry. The formation and settling of metal-rich HFO (hydrous ferric oxides) and HAO (hydrous aluminum oxides) is a relevant mechanism for the attenuation of dissolved metals from AD, particularly for arsenic. Organic matter is known to alter the chemical speciation and key physical properties like particle size distribution (PSD) and settling velocity of HFO and HAO particle suspensions. However, available experimental studies focus either on chemical or physical properties.\nWe used a suite of analytical techniques to probe the effects of organic matter on particle suspensions formed in natural waters and in laboratory model systems. Dissolved organic matter was added at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1 and 1.5 mg C/L) to synthetic AD before neutralization with alkaline solutions. PSD and average particle size were measured with laser scattering transmissometry (LISST), while organic matter was characterized by total organic carbon (TOC) and UV-VIS spectrometry.\nLarger concentrations of organic matter lead to the formation of particle suspensions with larger particle volume and size. When 1.5 mg C/L were added, the total particle volume concentration increased from 0.67 to 23.74 μL/L, while the mean particle size increased from 102 to 176 μm. These results suggests that organic matter influences the fate of metals from AD. Undergoing measurements include total and dissolved metal analyses with total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) and ICP-OES to confirm increased removal of dissolved arsenic.\nThe results from this research are necessary to understand the processes governing natural attenuation of metal contamination in fluvial systems affected by AD and to serve as the basis for enhanced natural attenuation schemes.\nThe authors acknowledge funding from Fondecyt 1130936.",

The aircraft data indicate significant sulfate and carbonaceous contributions to the ATAL, which is supported by the CTM results. We use back trajectory calculations initialized from CALIPSO observations to provide evidence that deep convection over North India is a significant source for ATAL through the vertical transport of pollution to the upper troposphere. Source elimination studies using GEOS-Chem indicate that 80-90% of the aerosol in the ATAL originated from Asian sources, in contrast with much lower (~30%) estimates in earlier studies.

Subduction here is hypothesized to have initiated spontaneously, leaving a characteristic depositional sequence of post-subduction-initiation localized extension and volcanism. We conducted detailed macroscopic and microscopic study of the cores of the lowermost 100m of volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks (Unit IV) directly overlying subduction initiation igneous basement, to identify depositional facies and trends. We subdivided Unit IV into three subunits based on lithologic characteristics. Transitions between the subunits are relatively abrupt, occurring within the length of a single core. The lowermost subunit (IVA) consists of 4 meters of laminated pelagic claystone with thin beds of graded volcaniclastic siltstone, and fine-grained tuff laminae composed of plagioclase feldspar and green-brown amphibole. The middle subunit (IVB) comprises 51 meters of texturally variable, thick-bedded, coarse-grained gravity flow deposits. These are composed of volcaniclastic sandstone and conglomerate containing glassy and tachylitic volcanic grains as well as sedimentary lithic fragments, along with traces of shallow-water carbonate bioclasts. Subunit IVB sediments are poorer in feldspar than IVA and contain only trace amphibole. They show variable grain rounding and an upsection increase in vitric components. Tachylite grains range from sub-angular to well rounded throughout, and other volcanic grain types show upward increases in angularity and vesicularity. The abrupt transition from pelagic sediments in subunit IVA to shallow-water-sourced gravity flows in subunit IVB suggests a rapid emergence of shallow-water to subaerial volcanic center early in the arc’s development. The upper part of subunit IVB also contains igneous intrusions, providing possible evidence for more proximal volcanism at the site. Subunit IVC consists of 46 meters of fine-grained turbidites composed of tuffaceous siltstone, along with radiolarian mudstone and vitric tuff layers. Ongoing studies of the volcanic components will provide additional insight into the source(s) of volcanics throughout the arc’s early development.",

AGU POSTER-final version.pdf\nBringing Research on Learning to the Geosciences (Manduca et al, 2002) stated that “An overaching goal for geoscience education is to help every student to ‘think like a scientist’”, and that continues to challenge geoscience education. The Rhode Island Technology Enhanced Science (RITES) project addresses that goal, and this presentation chronicles that successful effort. RITES strives to improve science education by providing professional development (PD) to the majority of science teachers at the 5th through 12th grade levels throughout Rhode Island. The PD is presented through ~forty 2.5 day workshops that emphasize the innovative use of technology and best teaching practices, consistent with the recommendations detailed in Manduca et al (2002). The presentation will focus on two of these workshops that provide middle and high school teachers with strategies and techniques for guiding student-run explorations of earthquakes as a result of tectonic plate movements. Teachers address these topics much as a scientist would by carrying out the following activities: 1) Identifying the relationships between faults, EQs and plate boundaries; 2) Using GPS data to quantify interseismic deformation; 3) Constructing an Earthquake machine; and 4) Scaling their observations from desktop to crustal scale, and (5) Using the results to forecast earthquakes along the SAF and to estimate the magnitude of earthquakes on ancient faults.\nAs it is unrealistic to expect teachers to be able to incorporate all of this material into their syllabi, we have introduced the concept of Subtle Shifts (Exploratorium, 2006) as a means by which they can easily blend workshop material into their existing courses. Teacher surveys reflect a high level of satisfaction (81-100%), and pre- and post-evaluations show significant normalized gains (Hake, 1998), in about 90% of the courses. Moreover, students of RITES teachers demonstrate statistically significant gains in inquiry skills and content knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Pressure-temperature (P-T) paths derived from garnet chemical zoning and supported by thermal modeling record alternating burial and exhumation during Main Menderes Metamorphism in western Turkey. We studied six rocks along the Selimiye (Kayabükü) shear zone, three from the footwall (Çine nappe) and three from the hanging wall (Selimiye nappe). The shear zone bounds the southern Menderes Massif metamorphic core complex and has been suggested to record compression followed by extension. The rocks are lower-amphibolite facies garnet-bearing metapelites with nearly identical mineral suites. Retrograde overprinting hinders classical thermobarometry; to overcome this, preserved chemical zoning in garnet combined with a G-minimization approach was used to construct detailed P-T paths (e.g., 50 points in some paths). During continuous temperature increase, the Çine nappe paths show increasing, decreasing, and then increasing pressure (an N-shaped path) ending at 7-8 kbar and ~565-590 °C. The Selimiye nappe paths show a single increase in P-T ending at ~7.3 kbar and ~580 °C. Similar bulk-rock compositions in all samples and the separation by the shear zone suggest that garnets grew during distinct events in each nappe. The timing of garnet growth, and thus the P-T paths, is currently undetermined, as monazite inclusions in garnet appear secondary and complicated by excess common Pb. The Çine nappe N-shaped path describes alternations in burial and exhumation, possibly due to thrust motion along the shear zone. To demonstrate the physical plausibility of the P-T paths, a 2-D finite difference solution to the diffusion-advection equation was applied. The results of the thermal modeling suggest that thrusting, denudation, and renewed thrusting would produce similar changes in P-T to the N-shaped path. Thus, the Çine nappe N-shaped P-T path appears to record a gap in thrust motion along the Selimiye (Kayabükü) shear zone prior to ultimate unroofing of the massif.",

            "abstract": "Ancient deltas on Mars are indicative of a geologic history composed of complex fluvio-deltaic deposits. We focus on two morphologically different deltas preserved on Mars, one located in the Jezero crater and the other in the Shalbatana Valles canyon. The Jezero delta, formed during the Noachian age, is a large fluvial delta with strong channelization and a rigid shoreline resembling a terrestrial delta. In contrast, the Shalbatana Delta is a smaller scaled more briefly lived delta system, developed during the Hesperian, that is characterized by its smooth and simple planform. Evidence from previous studies on these Martian deltas such as the base level, mechanism to build sediment cohesion, estimated discharge, and time of formation offer support to ultimately discover why one delta drastically differs from the other. Based upon the observations from these two locations, we investigate through our physical experiments the conditions required to create these prograding deltas. We use carbonate precipitation in our experiments as a mechanism to increase bank stability, an alternative for any chemically driven precipitated deposits that potentially improve cohesion as vegetation does for terrestrial deltas. We found that there are differences in floodplain thickness, channelization, shoreline rugosity, and delta shape in the carbonate verse non-carbonate runs. Additionally, we conducted runs for isolating the influence that shallow and deep standing bodies of water have on prograding deltas. The experimental results suggested that the highly channelized delta (e.g., Jezero delta) rapidly prograded into a shallow body of water, covering a broader surface area and is dependent on a cohesive force for channel organization. On the contrary, Gilbert-type delta (e.g., Shalbatana delta) was best replicated when prograding into a deep standing body of water. Investigation using the experimental carbonate deltas suggests that cohesion results in better channelization (more elongate), smaller sediment aggradation rates, and more rugosity in shoreline. This information is important to further understand and piece together the climatic, hydraulic and biologic history of Mars.",

We estimate the strength of the gravity signal coming from the vortex using an idealized dynamical model for the atmosphere of the giant planet. The gravity anomaly is then compared to the expected accuracy in the retrieval of the surface gravity at the GRS location obtained with numerical simulations of the Doppler data inversion based on the expected trajectory of the spacecraft. Starting from observations of the planet's velocity vectors at the cloud level, we propagate the profiles along coaxial cylinders parallel to the spin axis and explore a wide range of decay scale heights in the radial direction. Assuming the large\nscale vortex dynamics are geostrophic, and therefore thermal wind balance holds, the density anomaly distribution due to Jupiter's winds can be derived from the velocity maps. The novelty of this approach is in the integration of thermal wind relations over a three-dimensional grid, and in the inclusion of the observed meridional velocity as measured during the Cassini flyby of Jupiter. The introduction of longitudinal perturbations to the mean zonal flows gives rise to fluctuations in the tesseral spherical harmonics of Jupiter's gravitational potential. We show that the deeper the penetration of the jets, the stronger is the gravity signal coming from the GRS. On the other hand, the larger the mass involved in the planet's atmospheric motion, the higher are the degree and order of the spherical harmonic expansion of Jupiter's gravity field needed to fit the simulated Doppler data. We show that the mass anomaly associated with the Great Red Spot is detectable by the Juno gravity experiment if the winds penetrate at depth of 2,000 km below the cloud level of Jupiter and that the large mass involved with deep winds does not render much the ability to measure the feature.",

This work will present a simple method to model the remobilization of colloids or nanoparticles in porous media. The simplified model assumes that the release of the immobilized particles in the porous media is only controlled by the wet front. It thus can be described by the advection-dispersion equation couple with simple kinetic expressions of particle release. Simulations from the simplified model were tested against experimental data of the remobilization of clay particles in sand column under transient flow conditions. The model results matched the experimental data very well.",

            "abstract": "Ever since the cross-core chronology became available, the connection between the Earth’s polar regions - or the lack of such [Wunsch, 2003; 2006] - has been an on-going debate in the paleoclimate community. While the inverse relationship inferred from the bipolar seesaw model [Crowley, 1992] could not account for the difference in signal shape of the polar records, integration/differentiation (I/D) has been proposed as the linkage between them [Schmittner et al., 2003; Huybers, 2004; Roe and Steig, 2004; Schmittner et al., 2004]. Stoker and Johnsen [2003] have proposed a revised (thermal) bipolar seesaw model (TBS), demonstrating that the climate record from Antarctic is that of the Greenland convolved with an exponential decaying function, which represents the heat reservoir of the Southern Ocean. More recently, Rial [2012] has proposed phase synchronization (PS) as the polar climate connection from which polar climate records can be treated approximately as a Hilbert transform pair.\nAll three models (I/D, TBS, and PS) have been used to reconstruct past climate of the north from the longer climate record of the south [Siddall et al., 2006; Barker et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2014]. However, no comparison has been made to test and analyze these models against one another for their performance and stabilities. Here we investigated the aforementioned models with polar climate data on the recent AICC2012 chronology to derive the similarities and differences among them in both time and frequency domains. Most importantly we discussed how such differences translate to the discrepancies in reconstructions of the northern climate and possible physical mechanism(s) of connection each model limits and allows.\n",

These main climate indices are El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This study combines the use of wavelet transform techniques and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test in order to achieve its main objective. The MK test was used to analyze trends and determine the starting point of trends in streamflow data. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to extract the time-frequency information of the streamflow and climate index data used. Only streamflow data from gauging stations that are categorized as natural and have a minimum of 40 years of complete records were used in the study – there are 73 gauging stations that met these requirements. Starting points of trends varied from station to station, and the CWT obtained show variabilities at the intra-annual, inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. Wavelet coherence spectra indicate that the influences of ENSO and the NAO indices occur at the 2-6-year time scales, and the influences of the PDO index are more apparent at time scales of up to 8 years and greater than 16 years. In particular, all CWT spectra of streamflow consistently show significant variability at the 6-12 months scales (which may be related to seasonality events such as spring snowmelt). The 6-12 month frequencies were isolated from the streamflow data and Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to identify the amount of time streamflow activities lagged behind the influence of each climate index. This study observed that dominant sources of streamflow variations at periodic scales of 6-12 months, are more significantly influenced by NAO and PDO indices compared with ENSO. The results obtained from this study can be used by water managers and planners in different regions of Canada to improve streamflow predictions, which in turn help to better manage water resources. Furthermore, it is possible to apply the procedures used in this study in other regions of the world.",

            "abstract": "The geophysical exploration of small rubble pile bodies is fundamentally important for understanding the mechanics of gravitationally bound aggregates. The mechanical and geotechnical properties of these bodies are not understood from an experimental perspective, and have only been studied theoretically and using numerical simulations. To carry out experiments in this environment requires the development and deployment of surface packages to the body surface to enable physical interactions and measurements. This talk will discuss how such experiments can be developed and used in the small body environment. It will particularly focuse on one approach that uses a combination of surface seismic sources and probes to measure the seismic properties of a rubble pile.\nThe small body dynamical environment is particularly well suited for the deployment of such surface packages for exploration and scientific measurement purposes. This is mainly due to their meager gravity fields, which allow the delivery of complex instruments to the surface with impact speeds that are at most a meter per second — equivalent to dropping an object from less than a 5 cm height on Earth. Despite this seeming advantage, the delivery and mobility of such packages on the surface of a small body remains a challenging endeavor, and to date the delivery of surface packages to small bodies has had a mixed success rate. Issues that must be accounted for include the delivery trajectories for probes to the surface, motion on the surface of a small body, and interactions between a probe and a small body surface. Studies of all of these issues both theoretically and experimentally will be presented, along with proposed applications to achieve scientific goals on the surfaces of small bodies.",

Building on previous work to dynamically model the transient flows in water distribution networks undergoing frequent filling and emptying, we now consider the hydraulic implications of uncertain input data. Water distribution networks undergoing intermittent supply are often poorly mapped, and household metering frequently ranges from patchy to nonexistent. In the face of uncertain pipe material, pipe slope, network connectivity, and outflow, we investigate how uncertainty affects dynamical modeling results. We furthermore identify which parameters exert the greatest influence on uncertainty, helping to prioritize data collection.",

            "abstract": "Radio occultations (RO) of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals have been used to characterize vertical profiles of radio refractivity that are related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water vapor profiles. Because GNSS signals are able to traverse clouds, they would seem the only satellite remote sensing technique capable of providing the thermodynamics of the troposphere within clouds.\nHowever, to convert refractivity into temperatures refractivity is either assimilated into weather analyses such as ECMWF and NCEP, or converted into pressure and temperature at the top of the atmosphere by using an initial pressure and temperature from a model and, within the lower moist troposphere, the temperature profile is used from a model analysis to infer water vapor. As a consequence, current analyses of atmospheric thermodynamics using RO depend on the accuracy of the models used to analyze the refractivity profiles, most strongly so inside moist clouds where the temperature is that of the model.\nGiven the relevance of clouds in the thermodynamics parameterizations that can improve climate models, one might learn something by maximizing the independence of RO from the models we need to validate. This work compares the features of refractivity profiles within clear, overcast non-precipitating, and overcast precipitating clouds with precipitation information from TRMM, GPM, as a function of height and with cloud top properties from MODIS. When RO refractivity profiles are compared to those of dry adiabats, the static stability of the upper troposphere is visible. Comparison of precipitating and non-precipitating clouds to saturated and non-saturated adiabats show more features associated to precipitation thus providing clues about the thermodynamics changes within precipitating clouds.",

Especially during the summer soil moisture patterns are not only controlled by soils, topography and related abiotic site characteristics but also by root water uptake. Root water uptake influences soil moisture patterns both in the lateral and vertical direction.\nPlant water uptake from different soil depths is estimated based on diurnal fluctuations in soil moisture content and was investigated with a unique setup of 46 field sites in Luxemburg and 15 field sites in Germany. These sites cover a range of geologies, soils, topographic positions and types of vegetation. Vegetation types include pasture, pine forest (young and old) and different deciduous forest stands. Available data at all sites includes information at high temporal resolution from 3-5 soil moisture and soil temperature profiles, matrix potential, piezometers and sapflow sensors as well as standard climate data. At sites with access to a stream, discharge or water level is also recorded. The analysis of soil moisture patterns over time indicates a shift in regime depending on season. Depth profiles of root water uptake show strong differences between different forest stands, with maximum depths ranging between 50 and 200 cm. Temporal dynamics of signal strength within the profile furthermore suggest a locally shifting spatial distribution of root water uptake depending on water availability. We will investigate temporal thresholds (under which conditions spatial patterns of root water uptake become most distinct) as well as landscape controls on soil moisture and root water uptake dynamics.",

Several global reanalyses projects (e.g., ERA, MERRA, CSFR, JMA9) produce and verify these data sets to provide time series as long as possible combined with a high data quality. Due to a spatial resolution down to 50-70km and 3-hourly temporal output, they are not suitable for small scale problems (e.g., regional climate assessment, meso-scale NWP verification, input for subsequent models such as river runoff simulations). The implementation of regional reanalyses based on a limited area model along with a data assimilation scheme is able to generate reanalysis data sets with high spatio-temporal resolution.\nWithin the Hans-Ertel-Centre for Weather Research (HErZ), the climate monitoring branch concentrates efforts on the assessment and analysis of regional climate in Germany and Europe. In joint cooperation with DWD (German Meteorological Service), a high-resolution reanalysis system based on the COSMO model has been developed. The regional reanalysis for Europe matches the domain of the CORDEX EURO-11 specifications, albeit at a higher spatial resolution, i.e., 0.055° (6km) instead of 0.11° (12km) and comprises the assimilation of observational data using the existing nudging scheme of COSMO complemented by a special soil moisture analysis with boundary conditions provided by ERA‐Interim data. The reanalysis data set covers the past 20 years.\nExtensive evaluation of the reanalysis is performed using independent observations with special emphasis on precipitation and high-impact weather situations indicating a better representation of small scale variability. Further, the evaluation shows an added value of the regional reanalysis with respect to the forcing ERA Interim reanalysis and compared to a pure high-resolution dynamical downscaling approach without data assimilation.",

However, the associated hazards and opaqueness of PDCs make it difficult to discern internal dynamics and entrainment through direct observations. In this work, we use a three-dimensional multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian (EEL) model, deposit descriptions, and pyroclast field data, such as paleomagnetic and rind thickness, to study the entrainment efficiency and thus the thermal history of PDCs down the Juive Grande quebrada during the August 16-17th 2006 eruption of Tungurahua volcano. We conclude that 1) the efficient entrainment of ambient air cools the nose and upper portion of the PDCs by 30-60% of the original temperature, 2) PDCs with an initial temperature of 727 °C are on average more efficient at entraining ambient air than PDCs with an initial temperature of 327 °C, 3) the channelized PDCs develop a particle concentration gradient with a concentrated bed load region and suspended load region that leads to a large vertical temperature gradient, and 4) observations and pyroclast temperatures and textures suggest that the PDCs had temperatures greater than 327 °C in the bed load region while the upper, exterior portion of the currents cooled down to temperatures less than 100 °C. By combining field data and numerical models, the structure and dynamics of a PDC can be deduced for these relatively common small volume PDCs.",

Earlier studies show that the principle of maximum entropy (POME) can be utilized to develop vertical soil moisture profiles with accuracy (MAE of about 1% for a monotonically dry profile; nearly 2% for monotonically wet profiles and 3.8% for mixed profiles) with minimum constraints (surface, mean and bottom soil moisture contents). In this study, the constraints for the vertical soil moisture profiles were obtained from remotely sensed data. Low resolution (25 km) MW soil moisture estimates (AMSR-E) were downscaled to 4 km using a soil evaporation efficiency index based disaggregation approach. The downscaled MW soil moisture estimates served as a surface boundary condition, while 4 km resolution TIR based Atmospheric Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) estimates provided the required mean root-zone soil moisture content. Bottom soil moisture content is assumed to be a soil dependent constant. Mulit-year (2002-2011) gridded profiles were developed for the southeastern United States using the POME method. The soil moisture profiles were compared to those generated in land surface models (Land Information System (LIS) and an agricultural model DSSAT) along with available NRCS SCAN sites in the study region. The end product, spatial soil moisture profiles, can be assimilated into agricultural and hydrologic models in lieu of precipitation for data scarce regions.Developing accurate vertical soil moisture profiles with minimum input requirements is important to agricultural as well as land surface modeling. Previous studies have shown that the principle of maximum entropy (POME) can be utilized with minimal constraints to develop vertical soil moisture profiles with accuracy (MAE = 1% for monotonically dry profiles; MAE = 2% for monotonically wet profiles and MAE = 3.8% for mixed profiles) when compared to laboratory and field data. In this study, vertical soil moisture profiles were developed using the POME model to evaluate an irrigation schedule over a maze field in north central Alabama (USA). The model was validated using both field data and a physically based mathematical model. The results demonstrate that a simple two-constraint entropy model under the assumption of a uniform initial soil moisture distribution can simulate most soil moisture profiles within the field area for 6 different soil types. The results of the irrigation simulation demonstrated that the POME model produced a very efficient irrigation strategy with loss of about 1.9% of the total applied irrigation water. However, areas of fine-textured soil (i.e. silty clay) resulted in plant stress of nearly 30% of the available moisture content due to insufficient water supply on the last day of the drying phase of the irrigation cycle. Overall, the POME approach showed promise as a general strategy to guide irrigation in humid environments, with minimum input requirements.",

The first method is based on an exact superposition solution to Maxwell’s time harmonic wave equations for a deposit of spherical particles that are exposed to a plane incident wave. We use a FORTRAN-90 implementation of this solution (the Multiple Sphere T Matrix (MSTM) code), coupled with parallel computational platforms, to directly simulate the reflection from particle layers. The second method examined is based upon the vector radiative transport equation (RTE). Mie theory is used in our RTE model to predict the extinction coefficient, albedo, and scattering phase function of the particles, and the solution of the RTE is obtained from adding—doubling method applied to a plane—parallel configuration.\nOur results show that the MSTM and RTE predictions of the Mueller matrix elements converge when particle volume fraction in the particle layer decreases below around five percent. At higher volume fractions the RTE can yield results that, depending on the particle size and refractive index, significantly depart from the exact predictions. The particle regimes which lead to dependent scattering effects, and the application of methods to correct the vector RTE for particle interaction, will be discussed.",

Because of this, there is continuous development of research focused on remotely-sensed species classifications for many diverse ecosystems. While plant species have been mapped using airborne imaging spectroscopy, the geographic extent has been limited due to data availability and spectrally similar species continue to be difficult to separate. The proposed Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) space-borne mission, which includes a visible near infrared/shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and thermal infrared (TIR) multi-spectral imager, would present an opportunity to improve species discrimination over a much broader scale. Here we evaluate: 1) the capability of VSWIR and/or TIR spectra to discriminate plant species; 2) the accuracy of species classifications within an ecosystem; and 3) the potential for discriminating among species across a range of ecosystems. Simulated HyspIRI imagery was acquired in spring/summer of 2013 spanning from Santa Barbara to Bakersfield, CA with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) instruments. Three spectral libraries were created from these images: AVIRIS (224 bands from 0.4 - 2.5 µm), MASTER (8 bands from 7.5 – 12 µm), and AVIRIS + MASTER. We used canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) as a dimension reduction technique and then classified plant species using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our results show the inclusion of TIR spectra improved species discrimination, but only for plant species with emissivities departing from that of a gray body. Ecosystems with species that have high spectral contrast had higher classification accuracies. Mapping plant species across all ecosystems resulted in a classification with lower accuracies than a single ecosystem due to the complex nature of incorporating more plant species.",

While the subsurface hosts a variety of geochemical and geothermal conditions, elevated pressures are common to all subsurface ecosystems. Understanding how microbes adapt to and thrive in high-pressure environments is essential to linking microbial subsurface processes with global-scale cycles. Here we are using a model extremophile, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, to determine how elevated pressures affect the growth, metabolism, and physiology of subsurface microorganisms. A. fulgidus cycles carbon and sulfur via heterotrophic and autotrophic sulfate reduction in various high temperature and high-pressure niches including shallow marine vents, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and deep oil reservoirs. Here we report the results of A. fulgidus growth experiments at optimum temperature, 83°C, and pressures up to 600 bars. Exponential growth was observed over the entire pressure range, though growth rates were diminished at 500 and 600 bars compared to ambient pressure experimental controls. At pressures up to 400 bars, cell density yields and growth rates were at least as high as ambient pressure controls. Elevated pressures and extended incubation times stimulated cell flocculation, a common stress response in this strain, and cellular morphology was affected at pressures exceeding 400 bars. These results suggest that A. fulgidus continues carbon, sulfur and energy cycling unaffected by elevated pressures up to 400 bars, representing a variety of subsurface environments. The ability of subsurface organisms to drive biogeochemical cycles at elevated pressures is a critical link between the surface and subsurface biospheres and understanding how species-scale processes operate under these conditions is a vital part of global-scale biogeochemical models.",

GW forcing is the key driver of the MLT general circulation, highlighting the importance of the stratosphere in coupling of the lower atmosphere to the MLT. However, observations quantifying the influence of the stratosphere on the MLT are lacking. In this study, the GW spectrum reaching the MLT is quantified by new generation meteor radar observations of GW momentum flux and forcing. The wind field is derived by combining MERRA reanalysis and meteor radar winds. To study the relation between MLT GW forcing and selective filtering of upward propagating GWs by the zonal wind field in the stratosphere, an estimate of the zonal wind experienced by a symmetric distribution of upward propagating GWs is introduced. The ‘net zonal wind’, defined as the average of the most eastward and most westward wind within the column below the MLT, is subsequently related to the GW forcing to derive a quantitative relationship between the stratosphere and the MLT. This relationship is tested for a wide range of dynamical conditions over various mid-latitude sites, to study how lower atmospheric wind variability influences the GW driving of the thermosphere-ionosphere lowermost boundary.",

            "abstract": "Because of the scarcity of observational data, existing estimates of the heat and water budgets of the Persian Gulf are rather uncertain. This uncertainty leaves open the fundamental question of whether this water body is a net heat source or a net heat sink to the atmosphere. Previous regional modeling studies either used speciﬁed surface ﬂuxes to simulate the hydrodynamics of the Gulf or prescribed SST in simulating the regional atmospheric climate; neither of these two approaches is suitable for addressing the above question or for projecting the future climate in this region. For the ﬁrst time, a high-resolution, two-way, coupled Gulf–atmosphere re-gional model (GARM) is developed, forced by solar radiation and constrained by observed lateral boundary conditions, suited for the study of current and future climates of the Persian Gulf. Here, this study demonstrates the unique capability of this model in consistently predicting surface heat and water ﬂuxes and lateral heat and water exchanges with the Arabian Sea, as well as the variability of water temperature and water mass. Although these variables are strongly coupled, only SST has been directly and sufﬁciently observed. The coupled model succeeds in simulating the water and heat budgets of the Persian Gulf without any artiﬁcial ﬂux adjustment, as demonstrated in the close agreement of model simulation with satellite and in situ observations.The coupled regional climate model simulates a net surface heat ﬂux of +3W/m^2, suggesting a small net heat ﬂux from the atmosphere into the Persian Gulf. The annual evaporation from the Persian Gulf is 1.84 m/yr, and the annual inﬂux and outﬂux of water through the Strait of Hormuz between the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea are equivalent to Persian Gulf–averaged precipitation and evaporation rates of 33.7 and 32.1 m/yr, with a net inﬂux of water equivalent to a Persian Gulf–averaged precipitation rate of 1.6 m/yr. The average depth of the Persian Gulf water is ~38 m. Hence, it suggests that the mean residency time scale for the entire Persian Gulf is ~14 months.",

Recent data, particularly from LRO provide unique measures of SPA surface properties. With each new dataset, the differences between the interior of SPA and its surroundings become more, or in some cases less, clearly defined. Here we explore recent datasets that offer insight into surface roughness at a variety of scales and assess implications for the origins of units across SPA. Identifying the origin of units in SPA is critical for identifying future sampling sites that address the science goal of determining the age of SPA.\nThe unique interior of SPA relative to the rest of the Moon is demonstrated by Mini-RF and LOLA derived products. Mini-RF data shows that the interior of SPA has a slightly higher average Circular Polarization Ratio than nearly any other terrain on the Moon, with the exception of the interior of the Orientale Basin. Cahill et al. [2014,Icarus] note that the average interior CPR value of SPA is similar but slightly higher than the mid-latitude farside highlands, suggesting that both are enhanced in blocks at the surface and near subsurface (to depths <2m). However, SPA is distinct relative to the interior of Orientale in the m-chi deconvolution, suggesting that the interior has a regolith with scatterers smaller than the wavelength of Mini-RF (12.6cm).\nLOLA-derived roughness shows that the interior of SPA is smoother than the surrounding highlands [Rosenburg et al.,2011,JGR; Kreslavsky et al., 2013,Icarus]. LOLA roughness measures show roughness variations within the basin tied to volcanism. However the expanse of smooth areas is broader than the previously mapped volcanic units, suggesting that ancient volcanism may be contributing to interior smoothness.\nThe distinction between datasets is likely due to differences in spatial resolution and that Mini-RF data probes the near subsurface. These measurements of roughness offer insight into the origins of units across SPA, including the possible presence of extensive ancient volcanic deposits. Regional variations in LOLA-derived roughness, Mini-RF CPR, and other high resolution measures of surface roughness within SPA will be used to infer, delineate morphologic terrains, and distinguish volcanic and impact-generated units.",

However, due to the spatial resolution of satellite aerosol products (typically 3 km and larger), observing aerosol within dense partly cloudy fields is difficult from space. Here, we apply an adapted version of the MODIS Collection 6 dark target algorithm to the 50-meter MODIS airborne simulator retrieved reflectances measured during the SEAC4RS campaign during 2013 to robustly retrieve aerosol with a 500 m resolution. We show good agreement with AERONET and MODIS away from cloud, suggesting that the algorithm is working as expected. However, closer to cloud, significant AOD increases are observed. We investigate the cause of these AOD increases, including examining the potential for undetected cloud contamination, reflectance increases due to unconsidered 3D radiative effects, and the impact of humidification on aerosol properties. In combination with other sensors that flew in SEAC4RS, these high-resolution observations of aerosol in partly cloudy fields can be used to characterize the radiative impact of the “twilight zone” between cloud and aerosol which is typically not considered in current estimates of direct aerosol radiative forcing.",

We conducted whole rock and mineral Nd, Sr, Pb and Hf isotopic analyses of drill cores obtained from this complex in order to assess the source regions of the parental carbonatite magma. Low precision laser ablation U-Pb age determinations from individual zircon grains separated from carbonate-rich “syenites” range from 480 +/- 20 Ma to 540+/- 14 Ma. Whole rock Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions all plot on Cambrian (~550 Ma) isochrons, implying that the carbonatites crystallized from melts with homogeneous radiogenic isotopic compositions. Initial εNd and εHf are well defined at ~+2 and ~0, respectively, while initial 87Sr/86Sr values are more variable and range from 0.7028 to 0.7058. The contemporaneously emplaced State Line kimberlites in the Front Range of north central Colorado share the same Nd and Sr isotopic compositions imply that sources of these rocks were similar and geographically widespread. Overall, the isotopic compositions are those expected from “Group 1” alkaline igneous rocks, usually interpreted as derivates from the sublithospheric mantle. Cretaceous-Tertiary alkaline rocks in North America generally belong to “Group 1” and may have originated in this fashion (Genet et al., 2014, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.). An alternative possibility is that the Cambrian-Ordovician carbonatites and kimberlites were derived from underlying, carbonated portions of the lithospheric mantle that formed after the original stabilization of the latter in the Paleoproterozoic. Nd and Hf depleted mantle model ages for the Elk Creek and State Line alkaline rocks range from ~0.8 Ga to ~1.1 Ga and allow the possibility that both sets of intrusive rocks represent melting of mantle metasomatized either during or after the assembly of Rodinia. Widespread thinning and heating of the metasomatized mantle during the subsequent breakup of Rodinia could have led to the widespread kimberlite and carbonatite magmatism observed in North America during the Cambrian.",

Typhoons strongly influence climate in this region, leading to increased sediment discharge, hyperpycnal flow, and efficient burial of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (POC) in marine sediments. Here, we investigate the exported POC from high-resolution (~hours) sampling on the LiWu River, Taiwan, during three sequential typhoons in 2008 as well as from soil profiles taken throughout the catchment. We utilize the recently developed Ramped Pyrox technique to investigate the chemical structure and isotopic distribution (14C, δ13C) of different OC sources by separating OC components based on thermo-stability.\nWe show that even the most labile OCbio can exhibit protracted storage in soils (up to ca. 2000 14C years), and that soil OC displays a large increase in apparent age with increasing thermal stability, likely due to contribution by microbially re-worked petrogenic carbon. Additionally, exported POCbio is too depleted and POCpetro too enriched in δ13C to be sourced from upper-catchment soil biomass. Rather, exported POC during large storm events can be best explained by a downstream source. Our results therefore offer an updated view on the mechanisms of organic carbon export from steep mountainous rivers by showing that: (i.) high erosion rates do not preclude significant pre-ageing of soil OC and (ii.) exported POC during large storm events is dominated by a local, downstream signal.",

After a 5-month commissioning period the first scientific phase starts on 1 September as the orbit enters the dusk magnetopause region. The Spin-plane Double Probe electric field instrument (SDP), part of the electric and magnetic fields instrument suite FIELDS, measures the electric field in the range 0.3 - 500 mV/m with a continuous time resolution up to 8192 samples/s. The instrument features adjustable bias currents and guard voltages to optimize the measurement performance. SDP also measures the spacecraft potential, which can be controlled by the Active Spacecraft Potential Control (ASPOC) ion emitter, and under certain conditions can be used to determine plasma density. We present observations of DC and AC electric fields in different plasma regions covered by MMS since launch including the night side flow braking region, reconnection regions at the dusk and dayside magnetopause, and in the magnetosheath. We compare the electric field measurements by SDP to other, independent determinations of the electric field, in particular by the Electron Drift Instrument (EDI), in order to assess the accuracy of the electric field measurement under different plasma conditions. We also study the influence of the currents emitted by ASPOC and EDI on the SDP measurements.",

            "abstract": "The intense cycles of glaciation and deglaciation that have characterized Earth's climate over the past 900,000 years have had a profound impact on the Earth system. The significant imprints that the related variations in surface mass load have had on sea level history and the Earth’s shape can be employed to constrain models of the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) process. These models rely on two fundamental inputs, namely a history of ice-sheet loading and a representation of the variation of viscosity in the lithosphere and in the mantle. Especially important GIA related observables include Global Positioning System (GPS) observations of the movement of the solid Earth's surface and inferences of past relative sea level evolution. Depending on the region from which they originate, these data provide information on different model characteristics. In particular, while the relative sea level constrained relaxation occurring near former centers of glaciation can be relatively easily parametrized to facilitate an inversion for mantle viscosity, the same process in the regions of forebulge collapse is much more complex but nevertheless provides essential further constraints upon mantle viscosity.\nIn this paper, we examine how recently available high-quality datasets of relative sea level evolution from the U.S. East coast (Engelhart et al., Geology, 2011) and the North American Pacific coast (Engelhart et al., QSR, 2015) can be employed, together with an extensive dataset of space-geodetic observations of present-day vertical uplift of the crust over North America (Peltier et al., JGR – Solid Earth, 2015), to further improve the latest state-of-the-art ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model (Peltier et al., JGR – Solid Earth, 2015). It will be demonstrated that the high quality of the data does not only provide further constraints on radial variations of viscosity in the mantle, but also on the history of the deglaciation that occurred over North America after the Last Glacial Maximum. Finally, these improvements, which only arise from a careful, simultaneous study of all relevant geophysical observables (especially those over the regions of forebulge collapse in North America), will also be considered in light of their impact upon our understanding of the evolution of the shape of the forebulge during the late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The Borborema Province of NE Brazil is a large Precambrian domain of the Brazilian shield located in the Northeasternmost corner of South America. It is bounded by the Parnaíba basin to the West and by the São Francisco craton to the South. Its structuration in the Precambrian has been related to compressional processes during the Brasiliano-Pan African orogeny (600-550 Ma). In the Mesozoic, extensional stresses eventually leading to continental breakup, left a number of aborted rift basins within the Province. After continental breakup, the evolution of the Province was marked by episodes of uplift, which might have been coeval with episodes of Cenozoic volcanism. The most prominent expression of those uplift processes is the Borborema Plateau, an elliptically shaped topographic feature in the eastern half of the Province with maximum elevations of ~1200 m. The origin of uplift in the Plateau has been the focus of a number of multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary studies in the past few years, which have imaged the deep structure of the eastern Province with unprecedented detail. The origin of uplift in the western Province, which includes a superb example of basin inversion demonstrated by the ~1000 km elevations of the Chapada do Araripe, however, has been seldom investigated. With the goal of investigating the deep structure of the western Province, a temporary network of 10 collocated seismic and magnetotelluric stations was deployed in the region. The collocated stations were arranged in an approximately NS direction, with an interspation spacing of ~70 km and spanning a total length of ~600 km. The seismic stations consisted of broadband sensors (RefTek 151B-120 \"Observer\") sampling at 100 Hz and were deployed in January 2015; the MT stations consisted of long-period magnetotelluric (LEMI) systems, sampling at 1 Hz and 4 Hz, and were deployed in April 2015 for a period of ~2 weeks. Preliminary results based on teleseismic P-wave receiver functions suggest that the crust thickens towards the South, from 33 km in the Ceará domain to 44 km in the São Francisco craton. Preliminary analyis of MT data suggests a heterogeneous lithosphere, with marked changes in electrical properties around the Chapada do Araripe and a marked resistive structure towards the South, where the profile enters the São Francisco craton.",

Opportunity has acquired 117 albedo panoramas with the Pancam instrument as of sol 3870, across the first 40 km of its traverse. To date, only the first 32 panoramas have been reported upon in previous studies [1]. Here we present an analysis of the full set of PDS-released albedo observations from Opportunity and correlate our measurements with terrain type and known atmospheric events. To acquire a 360-degree albedo observation, Pancam’s L1 (“clear”) filter is used to take 27 broad-spectrum images, which are stitched into a mosaic. Pancam images are calibrated to reflectance factor (R*), which is taken as an approximation of the Lambertian albedo. Areas of interest are selected and average albedo calculations are applied to all of the selections. Results include the average albedo of each scene, as well as equal-area corrections where applicable, in addition to measurements of specific classes of surface features (e.g., outcrops, dusty terrain, and rover tracks). Average scene albedo measurements range from 0.11 ± 0.04 to 0.30 ± 0.04, with the highest value observed on sol 1290 (immediately after the planet-encircling dust storm of 2007). We compare these results to distance traveled, surface morphologies, local wind driven events, and dust opacity measurements. Future work will focus on correlating Pancam albedo values with orbital data from cameras such as HiRISE, CTX, MOC, THEMIS-VIS, and MARCI, and completion of the same analysis for the full Pancam albedo dataset from Spirit.

            "abstract": "Current understanding of the seismic properties of the oceanic upper mantle is heavily weighted toward studies of the Pacific upper mantle. However, global seismic models indicate differences in upper-mantle properties beneath the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Furthermore, factors such as spreading rate, absolute plate motion, and the presence of intraplate volcanism vary between these regions. It is thus important to consider the broad range in parameters when forming ideas about mantle dynamics and lithosphere evolution within ocean basins. We are developing a high-resolution basin-wide seismic model of the Indian Ocean upper mantle. The Indian Ocean contains 16,000 km of mid-ocean ridge, with spreading rates ranging from approximately 14 mm/yr along the Southwest Indian Ridge to 55-75 mm/yr along the Southeast Indian Ridge. It also contains 12 volcanic hotspots, overlies a portion of a large low-shear-velocity province in the lower mantle, and is home to the Australian-Antarctic Discordance and a negative geoid anomaly just south of India, among other features.\nWe measure phase velocity in the period range 30-130 seconds for fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves traversing the Indian Ocean; the data set includes 831 events that occurred between 1992 and 2014 and 769 stations. In order to isolate the signal of the oceanic upper mantle, paths with >30% of their length through continental upper mantle are excluded. Variations in phase velocity in the Indian Ocean upper mantle are explored with two approaches. One, phase velocity is allowed to vary only as a function of seafloor age. Two, a general two-dimensional parameterization is utilized in order to capture perturbations to age-dependent structure. Our preliminary results indicate a strong dependence of phase velocity on seafloor age, with higher velocity associated with older seafloor, and perturbations to the age-dependent trend in the vicinity of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance and the Marion and Kerguelen hotspots. Because the ridges in the Indian Ocean span a wide range of spreading rates, our results also provide a unique opportunity to investigate how the lateral averaging inherent to seismic waves can introduce an apparent spreading-rate dependence of phase velocity.",

We simulate whistler chorus in a compressed dipole field using a hybrid code. The hybrid code uses the particle-in-cell technique in generalized orthogonal coordinates. In the hybrid code, a small fraction of electrons are treated as particles with anisotropic temperature that leads to the whistler instability. Other electrons are treated as a cold fluid without mass. The density of the fluid electrons is large such that the plasma frequency exceeds the electron gyro frequency. Ions serve as a fixed background. We model the compressed dipole field by adding a constant magnetic field component to the dipole field. The direction of the compressed component is the same as that of the dipole field at the equator. This model of the compressed dipole field yields a magnetic field with off-equator minima and smaller inhomogeneity than the dipole field near the equator. The distribution of hot anisotropic electrons along the magnetic field is a function of adiabatic invariants that satisfies MHD force balance. In the compressed dipole field, the hot electron anisotropy, hot electron density and plasma beta in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field are the maximum at the minimum magnetic field. In our simulation, whistler chorus are generated at the minimum magnetic field with a peak frequency in agreement with the prediction by WHAMP, a local dispersion relation solver. The waves propagate in both directions along the magnetic field. Waves that propagate to higher magnetic latitude are damped at the boundary by the artificial resistive layers, while waves that propagate to lower latitude towards the equator continue to grow.",

            "abstract": "The discovery of the genes responsible for microbial methylmercury production, hgcAB, has led to the identification of novel Hg methylators with diverse metabolisms including Fe and SO42- reducing bacteria, syntrophs, and methanogens. We recently developed DNA probes for hgcA in each group of methylators: Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Archaea [Christensen, 2015]. In this study, we use the probes to determine quantity and distribution of hgcA+ organisms in mid-Atlantic marshes and sediments, and in Hg-contaminated wetland soils. We also analyze hgcA distribution over a 28-day soil slurry experiment designed to evaluate the impact of activated carbon on Hg methylation and demethylation [Gilmour, 2015]. Initial soils show Deltaproteobacteria comprise most hgcA+ organisms. Methanogens encompass >45% of the remaining methylators. The addition of SO42- to induce SO42- reducing conditions in slurries caused the number of hgcA+ Deltaproteobacteria to increase and the number of hgcA+ methanogens to decrease to >32%. In soils and slurries, Firmicutes were below detection, suggesting our Firmicute primers are either unrepresentative in natural samples, or that hgcA+ Firmicutes are rare. This observation is interesting as Firmicutes include organisms with divergent metabolisms, and their role in environmental methylation is still unknown. Slurries also show no correlation between hgcA abundance and Hg concentrations. We now plan to explore how hgcA abundance relates to Hg-methylation and electron acceptor availability. Our results offer initial insights into the natural distribution of hgcA, supporting the idea that the distribution of different methylators is related to electron acceptors and redox chemistry.\nChristensen, G., Wymore, AM, King, A, Pdar, M, Hurt Jur, RA, Santillan, EFU, Gilmour, CC, Brandt, CC, Brown, SD, Palumbo, AV, Elias, DA (2015), A Study of Mercury Methylation Genetics: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of hgcAB in Pure Culture, paper presented at American Geophysical Union, San Francisco, CA, USA.\nGilmour, C., Ghosh, U, Santillan, EFU, Soren, AB, Bell, T, Butera, D, McBurney, A (2015), Impacts of Activated Carbon Amendment on Hg Methylation, Demethylation and Microbial Activity in Marsh Soils, paper presented at American Geophysical Union, San Francisco, CA, USA.",

To test these hypotheses, we use sediment pore water profiles of dissolved nitrate and oxygen to reconstruct paleo-preformed nitrate concentrations at two deep-water sites in the western North Atlantic (23°N 57°W, 5557 m water depth; 30°N 58°W, 5367 m water depth). Preformed nitrate increases down-core to 22.7 μM (25.6 m core depth) at the northern site, and to 28.5 μM (27.8 m core depth) at the southern site. The large preformed nitrate gradient between these sites reveals a paleo-boundary between a southern water source high in preformed nitrate and a northern water source with lower concentrations, similar to today’s ocean. However, the boundary between these water masses occurs north of where their modern counterparts meet, indicating that Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) extended farther north during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In addition, the southern source had a higher preformed nitrate concentration than today’s AABW (25 μM), contradicting hypotheses that nutrient utilization was more efficient in the Southern Ocean deep-water formation regions during the LGM. Comparison to our previous Pacific data reveals that the average preformed nitrate concentration of the deep ocean was slightly higher during the LGM than today. This result implies that the CO2-climate feedback was not principally due to more efficient nitrate utilization.",

            "abstract": "A maximally simple, coupled physical-biogeochemical box model is used to examine interactions controlling seasonal hypoxia over the continental shelf in an idealized Eastern Boundary upwelling system (EBUS). On-shelf bottom oxygen drawdown is controlled by the balance between flushing with offshore source waters and the degree to which surface particulate organic carbon (POC) production and its subsequent sinking and respiration are retained over the shelf and focused on the bottom. In the model, POC production is controlled by wind-driven upwelling of a generic nutrient to the surface, balanced by respiration and sinking. The degree to which this production occurs over shelf is a balance between the net POC growth rate η, and the upwelling driven shelf flushing rate λ, equivalent to the Ekman upwelling index scaled by the shelf width and surface layer depth. Initial oxygen drawdown follows this exponential rate of surface POC accumulation over shelf (α=η−λ), and so is slower for rapid upwelling (large λ) or nutrient limited conditions (small η). Retention efficiency indicates that up to 40% or more of upwelled nutrients can be retained over the shelf and contribute to oxygen drawdown. Fluctuations in the amplitude of the upwelling forcing can systematically reduce the potential for oxygen depletion below these estimates, especially when surface sinking export is rapid or forcing is strong.",

            "abstract": "MgSiO3 bridgmanite constitutes about 70% by volume of the Earth’s lower mantle and likely governs the physical behavior of this region. Chemical substitutions in MgSiO3 bridgmanite involving Al and Fe may explain seismic velocity anomalies observed in the Earth’s lower mantle [1-3]. However, the effects of these substitutions on the anisotropic elastic properties of bridgmanite at high pressure and temperature are still experimentally unconstrained.\nHere, we present data of internally consistent measurements of the single-crystal elastic properties of Mg0.88Fe0.12Si0.09Al0.11O3 bridgmanite at high-pressures. Two differently oriented single-crystals of brigmanite have been double-side polished and cut as two semi-disks using a FEI Scios Focused Ion Beam (FIB) machine [4]. Two semi-disks, one for each of the crystallographic orientations, were loaded together in the pressure chamber of a diamond anvil cell with helium as a pressure-transmitting medium. Simultaneous measurements of density and sound velocities have been made on both crystals at high pressures using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Brillouin spectroscopy in order to obtain self-consistent data, which do not depend on a secondary pressure scale. The Brillouin data at each pressure were fitted for both crystals simultaneously in order to reduce correlations among the elastic constants Cij. Our approach allows determining the single-crystal elastic properties of bridgmanite as a function of pressure, derived independently of a secondary pressure. We will use our results for Al-Fe-bearing bridgmanite to discuss the effects of chemical substitution on the high-pressure elasticity of bridgmanite and implications for the interpretation of seismic heterogeneities in Earth’s lower mantle.\n[1] Ni et al.

Individual bedforms may have shapes that can be readily described and perhaps understood, but one storm event after another generate a complex compound surface whose roughness is the sum of both deposition and erosion. Characterizing and understanding the origin of this bedform roughness is one key toward a better estimation of precipitation at a global scale from microwave remote sensing, and also a better understanding of two critical sea ice processes; the transfer of momentum from the atmosphere to ice floes, and the spatial distribution of melt ponds in springtime. During this presentation, we will describe the dynamics of snow bedform formation and we will explore how the basic palette of bedforms combined with a unique weather history can reveal the genesis of a rough snow surface. Detailed laser scanner maps of bedforms measured in Arctic Alaska will be used to illustrate these processes and forms. ",

Their uses include monitoring of cloud conditions and atmospheric composition of chemicals and aerosols due to pollution, dust storms, fires, volcanic activity and air-sea fluxes. Additional studies of carbon flux are important for various ecosystem studies of both marine and terrestrial environments specifically, and can be related to climate change dynamics. Many measurements are becoming more complex as additional sensors become small enough to operate on more widely available small UAS. These include interferometric radars as well as scanning and fan-beam lidar systems which produce data streams even greater than those of high resolution video. These can be used to precisely map surfaces of the earth, ocean or ice features that are important for a variety of earth system studies. As these additional sensor capabilities are added to UAS the ability to transmit data back to ground or ship monitoring sites is limited by traditional wireless communication protocols. We describe results of tests of optical communication systems that provide significantly greater communication bandwidths for UAS, and discuss both the bandwidth and effective range of these systems, as well as their power and weight requirements both for systems on UAS, as well as those of ground-based receiver stations. We justify our additional use of Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) communication protocols with optical communication methods to ensure security and continuity of command and control operations. Finally, we discuss the implications for receiving, geo-referencing, archiving and displaying data streams from sensors communicated via optical communication to better enable real-time anomaly detection and adaptive sampling capabilities using multiple UAS or other unmanned or manned systems.",

Effects of physical heterogeneity (i.e. media uniformity) and carbonate soil content on oil recovery and distribution were evaluated through pore scale quantification techniques. Additionally, experiments were conducted to evaluate impacts of tetrachloroethene (PCE) content on crude oil distribution and recovery under these same conditions. Synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXM) was used to obtain high-resolution images of the two-fluid-phase oil/water system, and quantify temporal changes in oil blob distribution, blob morphology, and blob surface area before and after sequential surfactant flooding events. The reduction of interfacial tension in conjunction with the sufficient increase in viscous forces as a result of surfactant flushing was likely responsible for mobilization and recovery of lighter fractions of crude oil. Corresponding increases in viscous forces were insufficient to initiate and maintain the displacement of the heavy crude oil in more homogeneous porous media systems during surfactant flushing. Interestingly, higher relative recoveries of heavy oil fractions were observed within more heterogeneous porous media indicating that wettability may be responsible for controlling mobilization in these systems. Compared to the “pure” crude oil experiments, preliminary results show that crude oil with PCE produced variability in oil distribution and recovery before and after each surfactant-flooding event. Such effects were likely influenced by viscosity and interfacial tension modifications associated with the crude-oil/solvent mixed systems.",

Hydro-climatic uncertainties attributed to climate change and land use conversions may also alter demands and impact the replenishment of groundwater supply. Groundwater aquifers are not necessarily confined within municipal and management boundaries, and multiple diverse agencies may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach, based on individual concerns and resources. The interactions among water managers, consumers, and the environment influence the performance of local management strategies and regional groundwater resources. This research couples an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework and a groundwater model to analyze the effects of different management approaches on shared groundwater resources. The ABM captures the dynamic interactions between household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands under climate change and population growth uncertainties. The groundwater model is used to analyze the relative effects of management approaches on reducing demands and replenishing groundwater resources. The framework is applied for municipalities located in the Verde River Basin, Arizona that withdraw groundwater from the Verde Formation-Basin Fill-Carbonate aquifer system. Insights gained through this simulation study can be used to guide groundwater policy-making under changing hydro-climatic scenarios for a long-term planning horizon.",

            "abstract": "Although more than 1,100 dams have been removed nationally, only 10% have any post-removal assessments with < 3% having any combined geomorphic and ecological analyses. Taking advantage of the Fall 2012 removal of the 6-m high, 200-yr old Pelham Dam in central MA, we sampled geomorphic parameters in Amethyst Brook (23 km2) pre-removal and in each subsequent post-removal year through 2015. We combined these geomorphic assessments with quantitative electrofishing surveys of stream fish richness and abundance above and below the dam and with visual surveys of native anadromous Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) nest sites. Post-removal assessments were complicated by 2 events: upstream knickpoint migration exhumed an older wooden crib dam 120 m upstream of the former dam, and the occurrence of a 20-yr RI flood 6 months after removal. Process-based erosion dominated in the initial post-removal months with significant bed erosion and knickpoint migration occurring through the former reservoir and upstream to the exhumed crib dam that now acts as a grade control. Similar to other removals, the bed aggraded (20 cm) and fined (~50%) downstream in the initial year, with subsequent coarsening (~ 10-20%) in Years 2 and 3, but with D50 still significantly finer than the pre-removal armored bed. The initial fining and subsequent coarsening, unlike previous studies, does not reflect erosion of former reservoir fill but represents the re-connected upstream sediment supply. Ecologically, our monitoring has further underscored the importance of restoring sediment supply and removing barriers to movement to the diversity and abundance of the native fish assemblage. The observed fining has had major implications for Sea lamprey that require fine gravel for spawning, allowing them to spawn in previously unoccupied below-dam sections. Dam removal has also allowed three additional native species to rapidly expand their upstream distribution up to, but not beyond the exhumed dam. Downstream abundances of some species in the first year were markedly reduced in dam-adjacent sections in response to the major geomorphic changes associated with removal and a subsequent flood. Since then, abundances have generally stablilized or increased, demonstrating the resilience of these species, and the importance of a long-term approach.",

            "abstract": "CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary formations is a promising means of reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions but the rate and extent of mineral trapping remains difficult to predict. Reactive transport models provide predictions of mineral trapping based on laboratory mineral reaction rates, which have been shown to have large discrepancies with field rates. This, in part, may be due to poor quantification of mineral reactive surface area in natural porous media. Common estimates of mineral reactive surface area are ad hoc and typically based on grain size, adjusted several orders of magnitude to account for surface roughness and reactivity. This results in orders of magnitude discrepancies in estimated surface areas that directly translate into orders of magnitude discrepancies in model predictions. Additionally, natural systems can be highly heterogeneous and contain abundant nano- and micro-porosity, which can limit connected porosity and access to mineral surfaces. In this study, mineral-specific accessible surface areas are computed for a sample from the reservoir formation at the Nagaoka pilot CO2 injection site (Japan). Accessible mineral surface areas are determined from a multi-scale image analysis including X-ray microCT, SEM QEMSCAN, XRD, SANS, and SEM-FIB. Powder and flow-through column laboratory experiments are performed and the evolution of solutes in the aqueous phase is tracked. Continuum-scale reactive transport models are used to evaluate the impact of reactive surface area on predictions of experimental reaction rates. Evaluated reactive surface areas include geometric and specific surface areas (eg. BET) in addition to their reactive-site weighted counterparts. The most accurate predictions of observed powder mineral dissolution rates were obtained through use of grain-size specific surface areas computed from a BET-based correlation. Effectively, this surface area reflects the grain-fluid contact area, or accessible surface area, in the powder dissolution experiment. In the model of the flow-through column experiment, the accessible mineral surface area, computed from the multi-scale image analysis, is evaluated in addition to the traditional surface area estimates.",

This system is reliant on winter snows in the Sierra Nevada that gradually melt through the spring, but over the last 4 years California has been in the grip of its worst drought of the last 150 years. The question remains, however, how unusual is this drought when compared to previous events over longer time scales?\nWe used moisture sensitive tree-ring chronologies from the Living Blended Drought Atlas of Cook et al. (2010) to reconstruct annual discharges over the last 2000 years for the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern rivers in the southern Sierra and routed this discharge into a Tulare Lake water balance model to simulate lake-level fluctuations over this same time period. Although the current drought represents the driest consecutive four year period over the past 2000 years, in terms of discharge volumes, there are multiple periods of more severe, longer term drought represented by extended periods of low lake levels. Significant low-lake periods (< 61 m) include 793-814, 906-933, and 1140-1158, all of which occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Conversely, lake levels were predominately high during the ensuing Little Ice Age, separated by brief periods of low lake levels. Under natural flow conditions, the 1923-1935 drought would have lowered lake level to about 58 m, which is about 2 m lower than where lake level would have been in the current drought.\nWavelet analyses of the streamflow and lake-level records reveal different periodicities of drought and wet conditions because lake-level is a state variable that changes relatively slowly, depending on inflow, precipitation on the lake, evaporation rate, and the hypsometry of the basin, whereas streamflow is a flux that responds immediately to climate perturbations. The streamflow records have a dominant period of 2-8 yrs but lake-level fluctuations follow longer periods of >32 yrs, primarily prior to 1300. While the 2-8 yr periodicity may reflect ENSO cycles, the causes of the longer periods in the lake-level record remain unknown.",

            "abstract": "Electrons in the solar wind are often observed as two distinguishable components; a thermal dense core and a suprathermal halo. The relative drift and anisotropy of these two electron components determine the electron heat flux, which can excite various electromagnetic instabilities. Among these, the whistler has been found to be one of the most commonly-observed and important instabilities. The electron parameters derived from the measured solar wind are comparable to the threshold values predicted by the linear Vlasov theory of the whistler heat flux instability. The enhanced magnetic field fluctuations driven by the heat flux instability, in turn, prevent the drift speed difference between the two populations from increasing. This indicates that the electron heat flux is constrained and regulated by heat flux instabilities through the wave-particle scattering. Such electron heat flux regulation has widely been observed and in best agreement with the whistler heat flux instability. Here we present the growth of the electron heat flux instability in the solar wind condition using 1D PIC simulation with a periodic boundary condition. The two Maxwellian electron components are found to predominantly excite the whistler waves. We examine the growth rates of the whistle instability with respect to various plasma parameters such as the difference in drift speeds between the two components and temperature of the halo, to show the electron heat flux regulation by the whistler.",

            "abstract": "EPA estimates that future mine tailings remediation costs will exceed US $50 billion using present technologies based on constructing an inert or biological cap on the tailings. Both approaches require large amounts of capping materials that can be difficult and expensive to obtain especially for sites several thousand hectares in size. An alternative technology is direct planting into tailings. However, direct planting alone is not feasible for many legacy sites due to extreme acidity and high metal content which prevent plant germination and growth. Therefore the process must be “assisted” through the addition of amendments such as compost. Here we present results from the first four years of a field study at the Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund site demonstrating the feasibility of compost-assisted direct planting. Parameters measured during the field study included: canopy cover, pH, nutrient content, plant metal uptake, metal(loid) speciation, mineral analysis, microbiome analysis, and plant root-metal-microbe interactions. Integrated analysis of these parameters suggests that even in this “worst-case scenario” mine tailings site (pH 2.5; As and Pb each exceeding 2 g kg-1), we have created a sustainable system. In this system, phyto-catalyzed stabilization of inorganic contaminants in the root zone is driven by plant root exudates and the associated rhizosphere microbial community. The results of this research will be put into context of a larger topic- that of ecological engineering of mine tailings sites - a technique being proposed to prevent creation of acidic conditions and metal(loid) mobilization in the first place.",

MF-OWHM fully links the movement and use of groundwater, surface water, and imported water for consumption by agriculture and natural vegetation on the landscape, and for potable and other uses within a supply-and-demand framework. MF-OWHM is based on the Farm Process for MODFLOW-2005 combined with Local Grid Refinement, Streamflow Routing, Surface-water Routing Process, Seawater Intrusion, Riparian Evapotranspiration, and the Newton-Raphson solver. MF-OWHM also includes linkages for deformation-, flow-, and head-dependent flows; additional observation and parameter options for higher-order calibrations; and redesigned code for facilitation of self-updating models and faster simulation run times.\nThe next version of MF-OWHM, currently under development, will include a new surface-water operations module that simulates dynamic reservoir operations, the conduit flow process for karst aquifers and leaky pipe networks, a new subsidence and aquifer compaction package, and additional features and enhancements to enable more integration and cross communication between traditional MODFLOW packages.\nBy retaining and tracking the water within the hydrosphere, MF-OWHM accounts for “all of the water everywhere and all of the time.” This philosophy provides more confidence in the water accounting by the scientific community and provides the public a foundation needed to address wider classes of problems such as evaluation of conjunctive-use alternatives and sustainability analysis, including potential adaptation and mitigation strategies, and best management practices.\nBy Scott E.

This method is rapid and cost effective when compared to the more conventional procedure used ate the site, where VOCs are collected on sorbent cartridges in the field followed by thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation, and quantitation by mass spectroscopy in the laboratory (TD-GC-MS analysis). Using the conventional method, more than sixty distinct compounds have been identified in the 110-m deep unsaturated zone vapor phase, and the changing nature of the VOC mix over a 15-yr timeframe has been recorded. Analyses to date have identified chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chlorinated ethenes, chlorinated ethanes, gasoline-range hydrocarbons, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride as the main classes of VOCs present. The VOC plumes emanating from the various subgroups of trenches are characterized by different relative abundances of the compound classes, and total VOC concentrations that cover several orders of magnitude. One of the photoionization detectors, designed for industrial compliance testing, lacked sufficient dynamic range and sensitivity to be useful. The other, a wide range (1 ppb–20,000 ppm) research-grade instrument with a 10.6 eV photoionization detector (PID) lamp, produced promising results, detecting roughly half of the non-CFC VOCs present. The rapid and inexpensive photoionization method is envisioned as a screening tool to supplement, expedite, and direct the collection of additional samples for TD-GC-MS analyses at this and other VOC-contaminated sites.

Here, we develop an empirical uncertainty assessment of water security indicators that characterize scarcity and vulnerability, based on a multi-model and resampling framework. We consider several uncertainty sources including those related to: i) observed streamflow data; ii) hydrological model structure; iii) residual analysis; iv) the definition of Environmental Flow Requirement method; v) the definition of critical conditions for water provision; and vi) the critical demand imposed by human activities. We estimate the overall uncertainty coming from the hydrological model by means of a residual bootstrap resampling approach, and by uncertainty propagation through different methodological arrangements applied to a 291 km² agricultural basin within the Cantareira water supply system in Brazil. Together, the two-component hydrograph residual analysis and the block bootstrap resampling approach result in a more accurate and precise estimate of the uncertainty (95% confidence intervals) in the simulated time series. We then compare the uncertainty estimates associated with water security indicators using a multi-model framework and provided by each model uncertainty estimation approach. The method is general and can be easily extended forming the basis for meaningful support to end-users facing water resource challenges by enabling them to incorporate a viable uncertainty analysis into a robust decision making process.",

            "abstract": "MAI data processing methods report different precisions, sometimes for the same data; we investigate these discrepancies here. MAI, a method to obtain phase-based along-track displacements from InSAR data, has been used for measuring volcanic, glacier, and earthquake displacements. However, different applications show vastly different precisions, ranging from a few millimeters to tens of centimeters per interferogram. While some spatial variability in precision is expected due to the InSAR phase noise dependence on terrain, some reports show different precisions for the same data. Here, I address the following questions: What is the true precision of MAI measurements? What are the MAI noise sources, and how do we mitigate them?\n We use data from 11 Envisat, 2 ERS, and 1 ALOS interferograms to analyze and quantify the MAI noise sources and their dependence on the method’s implementation. To do that, we implement various processing steps with the JPL/Caltech InSAR data processor ROI_PAC. We find that there are several (sometimes surprising) nuances in data processing that together can reduce scatter noise by half, and other corrections that can reduce topography-related noise by up to 25 centimeters. We find that even with all the optimized data processing steps, the actual MAI errors (relative accuracy) are higher then the theoretical ones by a factor that depends on filter window size. We present an updated MAI data processor, which is capable of achieving relative accuracy and precision levels of 6 to 2 centimeters, respectively, in low to medium coherence terrains (correlation coefficient of 0.4 to 0.8), and provides error estimates that better reflect the actual relative accuracy of the measurement.",

            "abstract": "Plate rigidity is the central tenet of plate tectonics. Mounting evidence suggests, however, that significant intraplate deformation occurs in oceanic lithosphere due to horizontal thermal contraction, the rate of which decreases as ≈ 1/age [Kumar & Gordon 2009]. Support for this hypothesis comes from the azimuths of submarine transform faults, which are fit significantly better assuming shrinking plates than by assuming rigid plates [Mishra & Gordon 2015].\nPreviously we estimated the intraplate velocity field of the Pacific plate accounting for horizontal thermal contraction. The ≈2 mm/yr southeastward motion predicted for the northeastern part of the plate relative to the Pacific-Antarctic Rise may contribute to the non-closure of the Pacific–North America plate motion circuit. In a reference frame in which fix the oldest portion of the Pacific plate, some sites on the plate move up to ≈2 mm/yr [Kreemer & Gordon 2014].\nHere we present intraplate velocity fields of the Cocos and Nazca plates and discuss their implications for the non-rigidity of plates and the non-closure of the Pacific-Cocos-Nazca plate circuit, which fails closure by a stunning 14 ±5 mm/yr [DeMets et al. 2010]. If we fix the oldest part of the Cocos plate, intraplate velocities of up to ≈2 mm/yr are estimated, with the fastest motion occurring at the northern end of the plate. If we fix the oldest part of the Nazca plate, displacement rates up to 2 mm/yr are estimated, with the fastest motion occurring in the northeasternmost portion of the plate. In the velocity fields for both plates, the lithosphere adjacent to transform faults along the East Pacific Rise tends to move to the south, which would skew the azimuths of the transform faults clockwise of the values expected for rigid plates, which is the same as the sense of misfit between observed azimuths of transform faults and the azimuths calculated from the MORVEL global set of relative angular velocities [DeMets et al. 2010].\nDirect observation of oceanic thermal contraction by GPS measurements is not possible with the existing network (given its sparse and non-ideal distribution), and seafloor geodesy may be needed to test our predictions geodetically. Further implications of horizontal thermal contraction for the non-closure of the Pacific-Cocos-Nazca plate circuit will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Airless bodies like the Moon are time capsules of planetary and solar system evolution. Lunar polar ices, in particular, record a history of volatile delivery, orbital dynamics, and solar system chemistry. However, despite two decades of orbital geochemistry measurements, the observed abundances and spatial distribution of lunar polar volatiles (likely water ice, as inferred by epithermal neutron deficits) remain unexplained. The observed deposits do not correlate with measured surface temperatures or thermal models of ice stability and are notably asymmetric about the lunar poles, with the peak abundance offset from the present-day pole by 5°. Here we show, for the first time, that polar volatile deposits at the North and South pole are antipodal, displaced equally from each each pole along opposite longitudes. These off-polar volatiles likely represent fossilized cold-traps, formed when the moon had a different spin pole. Reorientation of the Moon from this paleopole to the present pole (i.e. true polar wander) altered the locations of cold-traps and resulted in the asymmetric, but antipodal, polar hydrogen distribution. Since true polar wander results from changes in the distribution of mass within a planet, the direction and magnitude of this wander can be used to constrain the evolution of the lunar interior. We find a causal link between this paleopole and the unique thermal evolution of the nearside Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT). Radiogenic heating within this province not only resulted major mare volcanism, but also altered the Moon's moments of inertia. We use a combination of analytical, and numerical 3-D thermochemical convection models to show that the evolution of the PKT naturally produces the correct direction and magnitude of polar wander (albeit early in lunar history, when the PKT was most active). This work provides a self-consistent explanation for the spatial distribution of lunar polar volatiles and opens a deeper connection to the evolution of the lunar interior. Our hypothesis will be readily testable with forthcoming lunar missions, including high-resolution orbital geochemistry instruments, in-situ and returned sample analysis, and geophysical networks.",

            "abstract": "The water retention curve (WRC) of hydrate-bearing sediments is critically important to understand the behaviour of hydrate dissociation for gas production. Most gas hydrates in marine environment have been formed from an aqueous phase (gas-dissolved water). However, the gas hydrate formation from an aqueous phase in a laboratory requires long period due to low gas solubility in water and is also associated with many experimental difficulties such as hydrate dissolution, difficult hydrate saturation control, and dynamic hydrate dissolution and formation. In this study, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is chosen to form THF hydrate because the formation process is faster than gas hydrate formation and hydrate saturation is easy to control. THF hydrate is formed at water-excess condition. Therefore, there is only water in the pore space after a target THF hydrate saturation is obtained. The pore habit of THF hydrate is investigated by visual observation in a transparent micromodel and X-ray computed tomography images; and the water retention curves are obtained under different THF hydrate saturation conditions. Targeted THF hydrate saturations are Sh=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. Results shown that at a given water saturation the capillary pressure increases as THF hydrate saturation increases. And the gas entry pressure increases with increasing hydrate saturation. The WRC obtained by experiments is also compared with the results of a pore-network model simulation and Lattice Boltzmann Method. The fitting parameters of van Genuchten equation for different hydrate saturation conditions are suggested for the use as input parameters of reservoir simulators.",

Current operational forecasting systems are able to predict the MJO up to 3-4 weeks with the mean of ensembles, while the skill is still below the theoretical estimates of the predictability (6-7 weeks). It is well accepted that MJO prediction skill in operational systems is distinctly better when the MJO is well organized with having strong amplitude at the beginning of the forecast compared to when it starts with weak or nonexistent MJOs. However, while initially strong MJOs have better skill than weak/non MJOs, the ‘initial amplitude-skill’ relationship is not linear. It is not every initially strong MJO that has high skill, and not every weak/non MJO that has low skill. What physical mechanism drives some MJOs to be more predictable than others? Using dynamical MJO reforecasts, this study will show that the skill of highly predictable MJOs depends on the background environment that influence on MJO evolution. The favorable conditions for highly predictable MJOs (starting with moderate amplitude) support for stronger ocean-atmosphere coupling, and for sufficient heat and low-tropospheric moisture supply for better MJO propagation, particularly for the MJO crossing over the Maritime Continent. Understanding the characteristics of predictable MJOs may provide insights into the overall predictability of MJO, thus advance the prediction of 3-4 weeks towards its theoretical limit.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are prominent features of the global water cycle. On long-term average, 20%–50% of annual precipitation over California is attributed to several AR events in the cool season that produce heavy precipitation. Local and trans-Pacific dust has been found to interact with ARs and affect clouds and precipitation along the US West Coast. The impacts of dust on clouds and precipitation are dependent on dust distributions and its sizes and mineral compositions. Therefore, local and long-range transported dust from different sources may modulate clouds and precipitation differently. In this study, a state-of-the-art model WRF-Chem is used to characterize the dust distributions and sources during AR events that made landfall in the western U.S. in 2010-2014. Quasi-global WRF-Chem simulations are evaluated with reanalysis and observations. The model simulations successfully capture the AR events and aerosol distributions in 2010-2014. During AR landfall in the cool season (September-March), a higher fraction of dust mass is associated with trans-Pacific dust than local dust compared to the average conditions, suggesting that the circulation patterns associated with ARs may enhance transport of dust across the Pacific Ocean. Over the West Coast, local source dominates the total dust amount below 2 km and to the south of 40oN during the AR landfall. East Asian, African, and Central Asian dust have comparable contributions above 2 km. The contribution of East Asian dust mass is higher during the AR landfall than the average conditions.",

            "abstract": "Future projections of the strength of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the largest source of year-to-year global climate extremes, are highly uncertain. Potential shifts towards stronger and more frequent ENSO extremes (Cai et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2015) would have a profound effect on climate globally. However, the instrumental record of ENSO activity is too short in time to resolve potential anthropogenic trends in ENSO properties, and limits our understanding of the ENSO phenomenon. Thus, we must rely on high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions of ENSO that extend through the last centuries to millennia to provide a comprehensive view of ENSO variability. Coral δ18O records from the heart of the ENSO region, in the central tropical Pacific, provide monthly-resolved reconstructions of ENSO activity over the last 7000 years. Here, we quantify ENSO variability in 10 new monthly-resolved fossil coral δ18O records from Kiritimati Island (2°N, 157°W) that are U/Th-dated to the 2-6kyBP interval. When combined with previously published coral δ18O records from Cobb et al., 2013, the new coral δ18O records support a prolonged reduction of ~60% in ENSO variability during the 3-5kyBP interval, as compared to the late 20th century. In comparison, ENSO variability during the last millennium was ~30% reduced compared to the late 20th century. These results are consistent with foraminifera and mollusk records from the eastern tropical Pacific (Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Carre et al., 2014), implying that the observed 3-5kyBP reduction in ENSO variability was not confined to the central Pacific. Taken together, these new records represent a new target – both in terms of amplitude and timing – for modeling efforts designed to uncover the mechanisms governing past ENSO variability. Such data-model comparisons are critical to refining the simulation of ENSO in simulations of future climate change.",

The simulations have been compared against SNOTEL precipitation gauge measurements, which has shown that at most SNOTEL sites the WRF simulations represent the precipitation quite well.

            "abstract": "Poplars are an important agro-forestry product used for both biofuel and paper production. Importantly, all poplars are not created equal – some have the potential to produce isoprene, a compound thought to aid plants under temperatures and water stress conditions. Isoprene production, then, would be an important feature in a plant’s response to projected climatic changes of warmer temperatures and longer inter-storm periods of drought. Our project observed how drought conditions modulated photosynthetic rates in two lineages of Populus trees, those that produce isoprene and those that have had isoprene gene knocked out.\nWe measured leaf-level photosynthesis and thermal sensitivity from the two lineages under high and low soil water conditions in a common garden experiment. We found that both lines had similar photosynthetic rates over the range of temperatures and water exposure levels measured. However, we wondered if some of the variation we found in our data was due to the time of day of the measurements. Subsequent measurements of photosynthetic rates in the morning and afternoon on the same leaves illustrated that poplars reached higher rates of photosynthesis in the morning, but ultimately decreased faster than observed in the afternoon measurements (indicative of an eased thermal sensitivity in the afternoon). Also, we used measures of soil moisture and leaf water potential to determine that the “drought” treatment we had induced didn’t actually yield any differences in the moisture status among the trees. Ultimately, our experiment showed that isoprene did not aid in photosynthesis under heat stressed conditions and that the common garden setting was not able to currently induce a water stress condition in the plants. We have begun exploring the use of low-altitude remote sensing by an unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with thermal and multi-spectral cameras to quantify patterns of transpirational water loss, NDVI, leaf browning due to moisture stress, and overall leaf status to determine if isoprene production is creating a yet unobserved benefit for the trees.",

As the terrain continues to change – with the growth and expansion of glacial lakes, along with accumulation of pollutants on snow at higher altitudes – this training program presents an excellent opportunity for long-term data collection in sensitive alpine regions.\nIn association with GlacierWorks and Midwest ROV LLC, skill training has included gigapan high-resolution photography, installing (and downloading) multiple time lapse cameras to track hour-by-hour glacial lake changes; lake bathymetry mapping using side-scan sonar from an unmanned towed platform; installing and managing weather stations; collecting and analyzing data from ASD field spectrometers; and collecting/filtering snow samples to look for contaminants (pollutants) affecting snow melt from 4000 – 6000 meters. A field manual documenting this work and intended to raise awareness of glacial trekking hazards has been disseminated to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park.\nIn 2016-17, in collaboration with Vanguard Diving and Exploration, OpenROV, and Midwest ROV LLC, efforts will include SCUBA diving into glacial lakes to collect scientific data, with continued Sherpa training on how to assemble and use portable remotely piloted submersibles to aid in the assessment of glacial lake hazards.",

These uncertainties strongly depend on the meteoroids' composition and consequentially on their mass. Classical mass computation techniques relies on single instrument observations, mainly optical and radar data, which give high error bounds on the mass estimate due to the use of luminous efficiency τ (for optical) and ionization probability β (for radar) parameters. In the following talk we will show the results from our experiments at the poker flat facility and highlight the benefits of using multiple data collection instruments. We will present an automated technique for detection of meteoroids in the acquired data and use it to cross calibrate τ and β and thus better infer meteorids' mass and bound their error.",

            "abstract": "In the subsurface energy community there is increasing interest in identifying and characterizing fractures (both natural and engineered) in reservoirs using field seismic techniques. The threshold of detection depends on fracture specific stiffness, acoustic impedance, and attenuation (both intrinsic and scattering) in the surrounding medium. The frequency of the probing seismic wave is therefore important. The simplest way to estimate detection conditions is by computing reflection and transmission coefficients and how they change with varying stiffness. In this setting we imagine that the stiffness is dominated by the asperity contact area, which is in turn a function of effective stress.\nWe have adapted a low-frequency (1-64 Hz) sub-resonance torsional shear system, capable of measuring shear modulus and attenuation, to explore the seismic signature of fractures in order to interpret field data from fractured reservoirs. Since the apparatus operates quasi-statically, we eliminate scattering effects. Our instrument is unique in its ability to measure at low normal stresses, simulating 'open' fractures in shallow or high fluid pressure reservoirs. We present calibration data that shows the accuracy of our instrument, and measurements from artificially fractured dry granite and rhyolite samples. By measuring the samples before and after fracturing under various normal stresses, we can separate the compliance of the rock from the compliance of the fracture. This method allows us to study well mated 'closed' fractures (stiffness about 40% of the intact shear modulus), until they are nearly open (<1%). With this data we calculate the reflectivity of the fracture in a field setting with varying effective stress, showing at what conditions we would expect to be able to detect fractures seismically.",

            "abstract": "We will present results from an algorithm that is being developed to produce climate-quality atmospheric profiling earth system data records (ESDRs) for application to hyperspectral sounding instrument data from Suomi-NPP, EOS Aqua, and other spacecraft. The current focus is on data from the S-NPP Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) instruments as well as the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) on EOS Aqua. The algorithm development at Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) has common heritage with the optimal estimation (OE) algorithm operationally processing S-NPP data in the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), but the ESDR algorithm has a flexible, modular software structure to support experimentation and collaboration and has several features adapted to the climate orientation of ESDRs. Data record continuity benefits from the fact that the same algorithm can be applied to different sensors, simply by providing suitable configuration and data files. The radiative transfer component uses an enhanced version of optimal spectral sampling (OSS) with updated spectroscopy, treatment of emission that is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), efficiency gains with “global” optimal sampling over all channels, and support for channel selection. The algorithm is designed for adaptive treatment of clouds, with capability to apply “cloud clearing” or simultaneous cloud parameter retrieval, depending on conditions. We will present retrieval results demonstrating the impact of a new capability to perform the retrievals on sigma or hybrid vertical grid (as opposed to a fixed pressure grid), which particularly affects profile accuracy over land with variable terrain height and with sharp vertical structure near the surface. In addition, we will show impacts of alternative treatments of regularization of the inversion. While OE algorithms typically implement regularization by using background estimates from climatological or numerical forecast data, those sources are problematic for climate applications due to the imprint of biases from past climate analyses or from model error.",

In South Korea, more than 90% of damage due to natural disasters has been caused by extreme events like strong wind and heavy rainfall. Most studies regarding the impact of extreme events on flood damage have focused on a single heavy rainfall event. But several heavy rainfall events can be occurred continuously and these events will affect occurring huge flood damage. This study explores the impact of the continuous extreme events on the flood damage. Here we call Mega flood for this type of flood which is caused by the continuous extreme events. Inter Event Time Definition (IETD) method is applied for making Mega flood scenarios depending on independent rainfall event scenarios. Flood inundations are estimated in each situation of the Mega flood scenarios and the flood damages are estimated using a Multi-Dimensional Flood Damage Analysis (MD-FDA) method. As a result, we expect that flood damage caused by Mega flood leads to much greater than damage driven by single rainfall event. The results of this study can be contributed for making a guideline and design criteria in order to reduce flood damage.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and grant funded by the Korean government (MEST; No. 2011-0028564).",

BAID is a cyberinfrastructure (CI) that details much of the historic and extant research undertaken within in the Barrow region in a suite of interactive web-based mapping and information portals (geobrowsers). The BAID user community and target audience for BAID is diverse and includes research scientists, science logisticians, land managers, educators, students, and the general public. BAID contains information on more than 12,000 Barrow area research sites that extend back to the 1940’s and more than 640 remote sensing images and geospatial datasets. In a web-based setting, users can zoom, pan, query, measure distance, save or print maps and query results, and filter or view information by space, time, and/or other tags. Additionally, data are described with metadata that meet Federal Geographic Data Committee standards. Recent advances include the addition of more than 2000 new research sites, the addition of a query builder user interface allowing rich and complex queries, and provision of differential global position system (dGPS) and high-resolution aerial imagery support to visiting scientists. Recent field surveys include over 80 miles of coastline to document rates of erosion and the collection of high-resolution sonar data for bathymetric mapping of Elson Lagoon and near shore region of the Chukchi Sea. A network of five climate stations has been deployed across the peninsula to serve as a wireless net for the research community and to deliver near real time climatic data to the user community. Local GIS personal have also been trained to better make use of scientific data for local decision making. Links to Barrow area datasets are housed at national data archives and substantial upgrades have been made to the BAID website and web mapping applications to include the public release of a new multi-temporal Imagery Viewer that allow users to interact with and compare imagery of the Barrow area from 1949 to present.",

First, future climate change projections (RCP8.5 forcing scenario, 2081–2100 period) from five CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) are dynamically downscaled. These projections reveal that future warming leads to a shift toward earlier snowmelt and surface runoff timing throughout the Sierra Nevada region. Relationships between warming and surface runoff timing from the dynamical simulations are used to build a simple statistical model that mimics the dynamical model’s projected surface runoff timing changes given GCM input or other statistically-downscaled input. This statistical model can be used to produce surface runoff timing projections for other GCMs, periods, and forcing scenarios to quantify ensemble-mean changes, uncertainty due to intermodel variability and consequences stemming from choice of forcing scenario. For all CMIP5 GCMs and forcing scenarios, significant trends toward earlier surface runoff timing occur at elevations below 2500m. Thus, we conclude that trends toward earlier surface runoff timing by the end-of-the-21st century are inevitable. The changes to surface runoff timing diagnosed in this study have implications for many dimensions of climate change, including impacts on surface hydrology, water resources, and ecosystems.",

Power spectra based on weak or strong magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), or kinetic Alfven wave (KAW) turbulence are then used to study turbulent heating.

            "abstract": "Upper-plate seismicity in the Puget Lowland, away from and oblique to known fault structures, challenges our understanding of active tectonics and seismic hazards of the region. The challenge arises in part from the thick glacial sediments and extensive water bodies that obscure active faults. Multichannel seismic reflection data in waterways, combined with aeromagnetic and gravity data, can effectively map fault structures throughout the Puget Lowland. Seismic reflection data indicate a NE-SW zone of recent high-angle faulting and shallow sediment deformation crossing the Seattle Uplift and the Seattle Basin, distinct from previously interpreted E-W fault systems including the main Seattle Fault. These NE-SW faults correlate with a zone of active seismicity, cut or deform sediments at the seafloor, and trend across the central Puget Lowland at an oblique angle to major regional structures. Aeromagnetic data show that the trend continues southeastward across the Seattle Uplift and connects deformation of shallow sediment in the Puget Sound with deformation of shallow sediment in Hood Canal. Two additional zones of faulting have NW-SE trend and cut through the Seattle Basin and Kingston Arch. Though strike-slip motion is a new interpretation for deformation along the southern edge of the Seattle Basin, it is not anomalous in the Puget Lowland; it is observed to the north along the southern Whidbey Island Fault (Sherrod et al., 2008) and Darrington-Devils Mountain Fault (Personius et al., 2014) and to the south along the Mount St. Helens seismic zone. Strike-slip motion accompanying regional compression and thrust-faulting occurs elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest including in south-central Washington (Blakely et al., 2014). Oblique strike-slip faults may contribute more significantly to deformation and seismicity within the Puget Lowland than previously recognized. Future work will evaluate the impact of deformation along these structures in tectonic models and seismic hazard assessments.",

Understanding hinges critically on the kinetic physics that allows reconnection to take place. The Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) provides electron and ion distribution functions at 4.5s cadence and, for select periods of time, at cadences of 30ms for electrons and 150ms for ions. These select time periods are chosen after in situ acquisition based on inspection of the low resolution data. Thus the FPI provides, independent of spacecraft spin rate, the time resolution needed to resolve the small, fast-moving reconnection diffusion regions. The first mission phase focuses on the dayside magnetopause and this presentation is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of FPI to resolve the important spatial scales relevant to the reconnection process. Magnetopause and other boundary crossings will be examined and the phase-space trajectories identified at the tetrahedral satellite locations through analysis of the 3D distribution functions.",

This understanding has lead to a push to improve subsurface hydrologic parametrization in Earth System Models. Here we present results related to improving the implementation of soil moisture distribution, groundwater recharge/discharge, and subsurface drainage in the Community Land Model (CLM) which is the land surface model in the Community Earth System Model. First we identified geo-climatically different locations around the world to develop test cases. For each case we compare the vertical soil moisture distribution from the different implementations of 1D Richards equation, considering the boundary conditions, the treatment of the groundwater sink term, the vertical discretization, and the time stepping schemes. Generally, large errors in the hydrologic mass balance within the soil column occur when there is a large vertical gradient in soil moisture or when there is a shallow water table within a soil column. We then test the sensitivity of the algorithmic parameters that control temporal discretization and error tolerance of the adaptive time-stepping scheme to help optimize its computational efficiency. In addition, we vary the spatial discretization of soil layers (i.e. quantity of layers and their thicknesses) to better understand the sensitivity of vertical discretization of soil columns on soil moisture variability in ESMs. We present multivariate and multi-scale evaluation for the different model options and suggest ways to move forward with future model improvements.",

            "abstract": "The Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) (ca. 17 to 14 Ma) is generally considered as the warmest episode of the Neogene based on deep marine oxygen isotope records and terrestrial plant fossils. To date, however, reasonable resolution high-quality sea surface temperature (SST) proxy records spanning its onset are scarce at best. For the remainder of the MMCO, reliable SST records are absent from the tropics and very scarce in temperate and polar regions. This leaves the question if the MMCO was truly associated with global warming and if this warming was associated with biotic change.\nWe use organic biomarker paleothermometry (Uk'37 and TEX86) to reconstruct SST across the MMCO at four locations along a pole-to-pole transect in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Additionally, we use marine palynology (mostly dinoflagellate cysts) to assess ecosystem change at these locations. This study includes the first tropical biomarker-based SST records of the MMCO. Together with new and existing SST records from higher latitudes and the corresponding palynological records, they provide new insights in the temporal and spatial development of the MMCO. Our results indicate that Mid-Miocene warming was most prominent in the Norwegian Sea, showed a more complex, perhaps upwelling-related pattern in a tropical location, and was small in the Southern Hemisphere.",

These evolutions, which strongly impact the physical and mechanical properties of snow (e.g. Srivastava et al, 2010; Calonne et al, 2014) need to be considered in details for an accurate snowpack modeling. However, some of the physical mechanisms involved in metamorphism are still poorly understood.\nTo address this problem, several investigations combining X-ray tomography and 3D micro-modeling have been carried out (e.g. Flin et al, 2003; Kämpfer and Plapp, 2009; Pinzer et al, 2012) but precise comparisons between experimentation and modeling remain difficult. One of the difficulties comes from the lack of high resolution time-lapse series for experiments occurring with very well-defined boundary conditions, and from which precise measurements of the interfacial growth rates can be done.\nThanks to a recently developed cryogenic cell (Calonne et al, 2015), we conducted in situ time-lapse tomographic experiments on several snow and ice samples under various conditions (isothermal metamorphism at -7°C, temperature gradient metamorphism at -2°C under a TG of 18 K/m, air cavity migration in a single crystal at -4°C under a TG of 50 K/m). The non-destructive nature of X-ray microtomography yielded series of 8 micron resolution images that were acquired with a 2 to 12 h time step. An image analysis method was then developed to estimate the normal growth rates on each point of the ice-air interface and applied to the series obtained.\nThe analysis of the results and their comparison to those of existing models (e.g. Flin et al, 2003; Flin and Brzoska, 2008) give interesting outlooks for the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in snow metamorphism.\n",

The area of Socorro is a segment of the Rio Grande Rift that display a broad seismic anomaly and ground deformation. The seismic reflector is imaged at 19 km depth coinciding with the occurrence of numerous small earthquake swarms. Broad crustal uplift was also observed above this reflector and led to the hypothesis of the presence of a large mid-crustal sill-like magma body. Previous geodetic studies over the area reveal ground deformation at the rate of 2-3 mm/yr from 1992 to 2006. The magma body was modeled as a penny-shaped crack of 21 km radius at 19 km depth based on InSAR results [Finnegan et. al., 2009].\nIn this study we expand the uplift measurement period over the SMB to two decades by using additional InSAR and GPS observations. We extended the InSAR observation record by analyzing 27 Envisat scenes acquired during the years 2006-2010. Continuous GPS observation acquired by the SC01 station since 2001 and three more recent Plate Boundary Observatory stations, which were installed between 2005 and 2011, provide high temporal record of uplift over the past decade and a half. We analyzed the InSAR data using ROI_PAC software package and calculated the temporal evolution of the vertical displacement using time series analysis. Preliminary results of 2006-2010 Envisat data show no significant deformation above the 1-2 mm noise level, which disagree with the previous ERS-1/2 results; 2-3 mm/yr during 1992-2006. This disagreement suggests a time dependent uplift of the SMB, which is also supported by GPS observations. The average uplift rate of the SC01 station is 0.9±0.02 mm/yr for 2001-2015 and 0.6±0.08 mm/yr for 2006-2010. Furthermore the SC01 time series exhibits episodic uplift events. The observed time dependent uplift suggests that magma supply in the middle crust may also occur episodically, as in shallow magmatic systems.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zone magmatism primarily occurs due to flux melting of the mantle wedge that has been metasomatized by the slab component. The latter is enriched in volatiles and fluid-mobile elements and derived mainly from subducted sediments and altered oceanic crust (AOC). Subduction input has been linked to arc output in many studies, but this relationship is especially well documented in sedimented arc-trench systems. However, the Izu-Bonin system is sediment-poor, therefore the compositional and latitudinal variations (especially in Pb isotopes) of its arc magmas must be sourced from the subduction component originating primarily from the AOC. Pb is a very good tracer of recycled AOC that may contribute 50% or more of arc magma Pb. Izu-Bonin arc chemistry suggests a subduction influx of Indian-type crust, but the subducting crust sampled at ODP Site 1149 is Pacific-type. The discrepancy between subduction input and arc output calls into question the importance of the AOC as a source of the subduction component, and raises major concerns with our understanding of slab input. During the R/V Revelle 1412 cruise in late 2014, we successfully dredged vertical fault scarps at several sites from 27.5 N to 34.5 N, spanning a range of crustal ages that include a suggested compositional change at ~125 Ma. Major element data show an alkali enrichment towards the north of the study transect. Preliminary incompatible trace element data (e.g. Ba, Zr and Sr) data support this enrichment trend. Detailed mass balance calculations supported by Sr, Nd, Hf and especially Pb isotope analyses will be performed to evaluate whether the AOC controls the Pb isotope chemistry of the Izu-Bonin volcanic arc.",

Modeling studies of the air quality impacts of the Eagle Ford rely on emission inventories that may underestimate emissions from such operations, and air quality monitoring in the area remains limited. We conducted an air quality study on a ranch in Dimmit County, Texas, which was ranked 6th in Texas for natural gas production and 10th in Texas for oil production as of April 2015. An automated GC-FID was used to measure the concentration of hydrocarbons (C3 – C14), with concurrent measurements of CO, CO2, H2O, O3, NO/NOx. In addition, the concentration and sizing of aerosols ranging from 0.6 to 20 µm aerodynamic diameter were measured with a GRIMM aerosol spectrometer (GRIMM 1.108), and meteorological variables including wind speed, direction, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and insolation were recorded. We report on local air quality and changes during the process as observed during the measurement campaign. Local drilling on the ranch began in May 2015 and production started in June 2015, at a site approximately 5 km southeast of the air quality trailer. Local air quality showed typically low, near background abundances of CO and NOx early during the campaign, and more frequent local NOx plumes during the drilling and production phases. Aerosol mass measurements were also relatively low and well within attainment of NAAQS particulate matter standards. We assess OH radical reactivity of individual and/or groups of VOCs using observed concentrations and their reaction rate coefficient with OH, the dominant VOC sink in the troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Since the start of the space era, spacecraft have recorded many extremely fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which have resulted in severe geomagnetic storms. Accurate and timely forecasting of the space weather effects of these events is important for protecting expensive space assets and astronauts and avoiding communications interruptions. Here, we will introduce a newly developed global, three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model (G3DMHD). The model takes the solar magnetic field maps at 2.5 solar radii (Rs) and intepolates the solar wind plasma and field out to 18 Rs using the algorithm of Wang and Sheeley (1990, JGR). The output is used as the inner boundary condition for a 3D MHD model. The G3DMHD model is capable of simulating (i) extremely fast CME events with propagation speeds faster than 2500 km/s; and (ii) multiple CME events in sequence or simultaneously. We will demonstrate the simulation results (and comparison with in-situ observation) for the fastest CME in record on 23 July 2012, the shortest transit time in March 1976, and the well-known historic Carrington 1859 event.",

One way to approach the study of the hyporheic zone is to define facies, which are elements of a (hydrobio) geologic classification scheme that groups components of a complex system with high variability into a manageable set of discrete classes.\nIn this study, we try to classify the hyporheic zone based on the geology, geochemistry, microbiology, and understand their interactive influences on the integrated biogeochemical distributions and processes. A number of measurements have been taken for 21 freeze core samples along the Columbia River bank in the Hanford 300 Area, and unique datasets have been obtained on biomass, pH, number of microbial taxa, percentage of N/C/H/S, microbial activity parameters, as well as microbial community attributes/modules. In order to gain a complete understanding of the geological control on these variables and processes, the explanatory variables are set to include quantitative gravel/sand/mud/silt/clay percentages, statistical moments of grain size distributions, as well as geological (e.g., Folk-Wentworth) and statistical (e.g., hierarchical) clusters. The dominant factors for major microbial and geochemical variables are identified and summarized using exploratory data analysis approaches (e.g., principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, factor analysis, multivariate analysis of variance). The feasibility of extending the facies definition and its control of microbial and geochemical properties to larger scales is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Looking toward the assessment of a multi-parametric system for dynamically updating seismic hazard estimates and earthquake short term (from days to weeks) forecast, a preliminary step is to identify those parameters (chemical, physical, biological, etc.) whose anomalous variations can be, to some extent, associated to the complex process of preparation of a big earthquake.\nAmong the different parameters, the fluctuations of Earth’s thermally emitted radiation, as measured by sensors on board of satellite system operating in the Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) spectral range, have been proposed since long time as potential earthquake precursors. Since 2001, a general approach called Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) has been used to discriminate anomalous thermal signals, possibly associated to seismic activity from normal fluctuations of Earth's thermal emission related to other causes (e.g. meteorological) independent on the earthquake occurrence. Thanks to its full exportability on different satellite packages, RST has been implemented on TIR images acquired by polar (e.g. NOAA-AVHRR, EOS-MODIS) and geostationary (e.g. MSG-SEVIRI, NOAA-GOES/W, GMS-5/VISSR) satellite sensors, in order to verify the presence (or absence) of TIR anomalies in presence (absence) of earthquakes (with M>4) in different seismogenic areas around the world (e.g. Italy, Turkey, Greece, California, Taiwan, etc.).\nIn this paper, a refined RST (Robust Satellite Techniques) data analysis approach and RETIRA (Robust Estimator of TIR Anomalies) index were used to identify Significant Sequences of TIR Anomalies (SSTAs) during eleven years (from May 2004 to December 2014) of TIR satellite records, collected over Italy by the geostationary satellite sensor MSG-SEVIRI. On the basis of specific validation rules (mainly based on physical models and results obtained by applying RST approach to several earthquakes all around the world) the level of space-time correlation among SSTAs and earthquakes (with M≥4) occurrence has been evaluated. Achieved results will be discussed, also in the framework of a multi-parametric approach to time-Dependent Assessment of Seismic Hazard (t-DASH).",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is the dominant component of organic aerosol in many urban areas during the summertime. On-road light duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV) have been indicated as a major source of SOA precursors. Emissions of the SOA-forming non methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) from on-road LDGV have been substantially reduced along with more stringent emission standards, leading to reduced potential for SOA formation. However, recent smog chamber measurements reported that the reductions in SOA formation were less than those in NMHC emissions, indicating that newer, low emitting vehicles may emit a more efficient of SOA precursors. Vehicles that meet the ultra-low, super ultra-low and partial zero emission standards have substantially lower NMHC emissions than vehicles tested in past studies. To better understand the effects of more stringent emission controls on the SOA formation, we conducted experiments 13 vehicles recruited from the Southern California vehicle fleet (five ultra-low emission vehicles, four super ultra-low emission vehicles and four partial zero emission vehicles) at the California Air Resources Board Haagen-Smit Laboratory. In addition, we investigated several vehicles compliant with older emission standards have also been investigated here to bridge the previous studies. Dilute vehicle exhaust were photo-oxidized in a smog chamber with the VOC-to-NOx ratio adjusted to simulate the photochemistry in urban air. Application of literature data from single-ring aromatic compounds cannot explain the observed SOA during chamber experiments. The average ratios between estimated and measured SOA for vehicles under different emission standards ranged from 0.04 to 0.71. Comprehensive measurements of SOA precursor emissions were made, including NMHCs, intermediate volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds. This study presents results of SOA production from these low emitting vehicles and compares the results with recently published data. This study also investigates the roles of the photochemistry and SOA precursors in SOA formation. The results from this study provide insight into SOA formation in urban air in the future and provide a basis for assessing the future impacts of low-emitting LDGV fleet.",

            "abstract": "The less fluid injected to induce fracturing means less fluid needing to be produced before gas is produced. One method is to inject as fast as possible until the desired fracture length is obtained. Presented is an alternative injection strategy derived by applying optimal system control theory to the macroscopic mass balance. The picture is that the fracture is constant in aperture, fluid is injected at a controlled rate at the near end, and the fracture unzips at the far end until the desired length is obtained. The velocity of the fluid is governed by Darcy’s law with larger permeability for flow along the fracture length. Fracture growth is monitored through micro-seismicity.\nSince the fluid is assumed to be incompressible, the rate at which fluid is injected is balanced by rate of fracture growth and rate of loss to bounding rock. Minimizing injected fluid loss to the bounding rock is the same as minimizing total injected fluid\nHow to change the injection rate so as to minimize the total injected fluid is a problem in optimal control. For a given total length, the variation of the injected rate is determined by variations in overall time needed to obtain the desired fracture length, the length at any time, and the rate at which the fracture is growing at that time.\nOptimal control theory leads to a boundary condition and an ordinary differential equation in time whose solution is an injection protocol that minimizes the fluid used under the stated assumptions. That method is to monitor the rate at which the square of the fracture length is growing and adjust the injection rate proportionately. ",

As a result, the sample-to-sample memory performance degrades over time and frequent cleaning is required to maintain the peripheral performance and integrity.\nTo address this issue, earlier work showed that adding a metallic mesh liner into the injection port of the vaporizer could capture salt solids and protect the vaporizer chamber without affecting the sample’s isotopic composition and the measurement performance.\nAdditional long-term tests have been recently conducted with the new commercially available Salt Liner accessory to assess its efficacy. We demonstrated the longer stability of the sample-to-sample memory performance on various brine water measurements when compared to a system without the Salt Liner.

            "abstract": "MSL began investigating a contact between Murray formation, (fine grained lake deposits) and the younger Stimson formation at Marias Pass in May 2015, on the lower slopes of Mt. Sharp. Images show that the Murray formation, with numerous calcium sulfate veins compared to the Stimson, is truncated at an erosional contact. MAHLI images show a white layer a few mm thick at the contact that might be calcium sulfate. The lowermost beds of the Stimson unit in the Missoula area comprise horizontally laminated or cross-laminated sandstones. The sandstones are poorly sorted with floating granules and very coarse sand grains set in a fine- medium-grained sand ‘matrix’. This material directly above the contact is a resistant, basal ledge-forming layer that also forms numerous blocks of float on top of the eroded Murray. This basal layer contains light toned fragments, possibly calcium sulfate, eroded from the Murray. The poor sorting and presence of sub-angular grains, together with the absence of preferential sorting into size sorted layers would seem to rule out eolian processes for the lowermost beds of the Stimson and suggest fluvial processes were responsible for deposition of these beds. For chemostratigraphy, the distance of each ChemCam or APXS observation above or below the contact was determined from images and the NavCam stereo mesh. The top of the Murray near the Missoula area is variable in composition, and additional analyses are planned to determine if weathering occurred at the eroded surface. Above the contact, the lowest 2 cm of the resistant slab is higher in SiO2, and lower in Al2O3, K2O and Na2O, relative to other Stimson analyses. In a few points with low totals, there is a correlation between Ca and missing components (presumed to be mostly S). These points could be connected to calcium sulfate in the form of cements and/or incorporation of eroded clasts of Murray vein materials.",

The National Phenology Database, maintained by the USA-NPN, is experiencing steady growth in the number of data records it houses. Since 2009, over 5,500 participants in Nature’s Notebook, the national-scale, multi-taxa phenology observation program coordinated by the USA-NPN, have contributed nearly 6 million observation records of plants and animals.\nThe phenology data curated by the USA-NPN are being used in a rapidly growing number of applications for science, conservation and resource management. Data and data products generated by the USA-NPN have been used in 17 peer-reviewed publications to date. Additionally, phenology data collected via Nature’s Notebook is actively informing decisions ranging from efficiently scheduling street-sweeping activities to keep dropped leaves from entering inland lakes, to timing the spread of herbicide or other restoration activities to maximize their efficacy. We demonstrate several types of questions that can be addressed with this observing system and the resultant data, and highlight several ongoing local- to national-scale projects as well as some recently published studies. Additional data-mining and exploration by interested researchers and resource managers will undoubtedly continue to demonstrate the value of these data.",

            "abstract": "Hydrated sulfate minerals provide conclusive evidence that a hydrologic cycle was once active on the surface of Mars. Two classes of hydrated sulfate minerals have been detected by robotic instruments on Mars: monohydrated sulfate minerals comprised of kieserite and gypsum, and various polyhydrated sulfates with Fe-Ca-Na-Mg-rich compositions. These minerals are found in various locations on Mars, including large surface exposures in valley settings of Valles Marineris. However, the sulfate sources and formation mechanisms of these minerals are not yet well understood.\nRecently, it has been suggested that the sulfate minerals in Valles Marineris might have formed in a manner similar to sulfate efflorescences found in dry environments on Earth. In this study, we use sulfate effloresences from the Rio Puerco Watershed, New Mexico as a terrestrial analogue to assess major factors that might have led to deposition of sulfate minerals in Valles Marineris. In different seasons indicative of dry and wet conditions, we collected field photographs and sediment samples for chemical and stable isotopic analyses (sulfur content, δ34S) to determine major sources of sulfate ions for efflorescences and to assess how the seasonal changes in surface/groundwater activity affect their formation.\nPreliminary sulfur isotope results suggest that oxidation of bedrock sulfides (0.01-0.05 wt. S %) is a major source of sulfate ion for efflorescences formation because their δ34S varied in negative range (-28 to -20‰) similar to sulfides (average -32‰). Using field photographs collected in Oct 2006, Feb and Nov 2012, May 2013, Mar and Oct 2014, we infer that the highest surface accumulation of sulfate efflorescences in the studied analog site was observed after summer monsoon seasons when more water was available for surface and subsurface transport of solutes from chemical weathering. Conversely, spring snow melt led to enhanced dissolution of sulfate efflorescences.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this research is to combine DMSP-OLS nighttime light data with Landsat imagery and use spatio-temporal analysis methods to evaluate the relationships between urbanization processes and temperature variation in Phoenix metropolitan area. The urbanization process is a combination of both land use change within the existing urban environment as well as urban sprawl that enlarges the urban area through the transformation of rural areas to urban structures. These transformations modify the overall urban climate environment, resulting in higher nighttime temperatures in urban areas compared to the surrounding rural environment. This is a well-known and well-studied phenomenon referred to as the urban heat island effect (UHI). What is unknown is the direct relationship between the urbanization process and the mechanisms of the UHI. To better understand this interaction, this research focuses on using nighttime light satellite imagery to delineate and detect urban extent changes and utilizing existing land use/land cover map or newly classified imagery from Landsat to analyze the internal urban land use variations. These data are combined with summer and winter land surface temperature data extracted from Landsat. We developed a time series of these combined data for Phoenix, AZ from 1992 to 2013 to analyze the relationships among land use change, land surface temperature and urban growth.",

            "abstract": "Despite the large body of scientific work focused on bedload transport, it remains difficult to predict accurately. Most empirical formulations cast the bedload flux rate as a function of shear stress acting on the bed in excess of a defined threshold value. This critical stress divides the hydrograph into two portions, an above threshold regime associated with bedload transport and a below threshold regime, where transport does not occur. The bulk of previous studies have concentrated on the portion of the hydrograph above threshold, leaving the below threshold region largely unexplored. A small number of previous studies suggest that increased time between transport events results in decreases in bedload flux rates. In many cases, these decreases in transport are attributed to compaction of the bed. Compaction potentially decreases mobility by increasing the friction on individual grains and the friction angle of particles that have settled into pockets. However, changes in bed topography during low flow have not been explicitly linked to changes in subsequent behavior during transport events.\nIn this study, we carry out flume experiments to examine the impact of sub-critical threshold flow duration on surface grain size, bed topography, and bedload flux rates. Preliminary experimental findings using a 5 m tilting flume with an 8 mm D50 grain size mixture indicate that transport rate is very sensitive to low flow duration, consistent with previous studies. We generate high-resolution topographic maps of the bed surface using Structure from Motion photogrammetry. Analysis of bed topography indicates that reduced transport rates are associated with lower mean bed elevation and standard deviation of bed topography. Specifically, we document reductions in transport rates of ~30% associated with reductions in bed topography on the order of 50% of D50 and changes in the standard deviation of bed topography on the order of 100% of D50. Automated analysis of median surface grain size does not show a significant increase during low flow periods, suggesting armoring is not the cause of the observed changes in transport rate. These results have implications for river restoration efforts where controlled dam releases govern the recurrence interval of sediment transport events.",

Accelerographic records, however, are not commonly saturated after major earthquakes. Taking advantage of the wide coverage of the Mexican Accelerographic Network, we use accelerograms observed in real time to compute moment tensor solutions after the occurrence of an earthquake. In our study, we compute the double-couple moment tensor inversion as a least squares problem by minimizing the misfit between synthetic waveforms in three components and observed waveforms. Synthetic Receiver Green’s Tensors for each station of the network within the model were previously calculated using a three-dimensional model of South-central Mexico. The database has horizontal spatial resolution of 20 km and a depth spatial resolution of 5 km. Our procedure fits windows containing the P and S waves to compute a fast first-solution. A revised solution is then calculated by fitting the full record. A first solution can be obtained seconds after the P-wave recorded in the station closest to the epicenter. Our results show that it is possible to obtain the moment tensor solution quickly and accurately. Furthermore, we show the resolution and range of uncertainty of the moment tensor solutions compared with that reported by specialized agencies for 30 selected strong earthquakes in Mexico from 2010 to 2014.

The range of plausible climate sensitivities, derived from ever improving generations of GCMs, however, remains essentially unchanged.\nHere we present a new approach to multi-model uncertainty quantification (UQ) using a reduced-form simple climate model, tuned to reproduce relevant physics of different global climate models (GCMs). Rather than focusing on the discrete projections made by individual GCMs, our simple model allows us to smoothly interpolate between the dynamics of the multi-model ensemble by forming a continuous probability distribution over a reduced model parameter space.\nWe will discuss an early version of the simple model, an idealized ocean-atmosphere energy balance model (EBM). The EBM is fit to surface temperature, ocean heat content and top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes of GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 by varying several parameters, including climate sensitivity and feedback. We obtain distributions of these parameters and update the uncertainties associated with them using observations of surface temperature, ocean heat uptake and top-of-atmosphere radiative flux in a Bayesian inference framework.",

In order to quantify the radiative impact of contrails, one must assess their macro and microphysical properties (e.g. contrail temperature, optical depth and effective particle size) as well as the characteristics of the environment in which they occur (e.g. background radiation field and cloud properties). In-situ measurements of contrail microphysical properties are limited, and hence the retrieval of such properties from remotely sensed satellite data is useful. This paper details the ongoing progress being made to retrieve contrail properties and calculate the contrail radiative forcing from 2 years of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua and Terra data. Contrail microphysical properties from the seasonal months (January, April, July, October) of 2006 and 2012 are derived using an infrared-only heritage algorithm developed at NASA Langley for the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) program. Results are subset by day/night, although the same retrieval algorithm will be used for all granules. Contrail properties and background cloud properties are then used as input into the Fu-Liou radiative transfer model to compute the overall contrail radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Space weathering is a diverse set of processes that occur on the surfaces of airless bodies due to exposure to the space environment. One of the effects of space weathering is the generation of nanophase iron particles in glassy rims on mineral grains due to sputtering of iron-bearing minerals. These particles have a size-dependent effect on visible and near infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra with smaller diameter particles (< 50 nm) causing both reddening and darkening of the spectra with respect to unweathered material (Britt-Pieters particle behavior), while larger particles (> 300 nm) darken without reddening. Between these two sizes, a gradual shift between these two behaviors occurs.\nIn this work, we present results from the Multiple Sphere T-Matrix (MSTM) scattering model in combination with Hapke theory to explore the particle size and iron content parameter spaces with respect to VNIR (700-1700 nm) spectral slope. Previous work has shown that the MSTM-Hapke hybrid model offers improvements over Mie-Hapke models. Virtual particles are constructed out of an arbitrary number of spheres, and each sphere is assigned a refractive index and extinction coefficient for each wavelength of interest. The model then directly solves Maxwell’s Equations at every wave-particle interface to predict the scattering, extinction and absorption efficiencies. These are then put into a simplified Hapke bidirectional reflectance model that yields a predicted reflectance. Preliminary results show an area of maximum slopes for iron particle diameters < 80 nm and iron concentrations of ~1-10wt% in an amorphous silica matrix. Further model runs are planned to better refine the extent of this region.\nCompanion laboratory work using mixtures of powdered aerogel and nanophase iron particles provides a point of comparison to modeling efforts. The effects on reflectance and emissivity values due to particle size in a nearly ideal scatterer (aerogel) are also observed with comparisons to model data.",

DEM uses previously established procedure for modeling the strength and deformation parameters of quasi-brittle rocks with the Bonded Particle Model (Itasca, 2004). A series of simulations of laboratory tests on granite in DEM serve as a reference for synthetic rock behavior. Fracturing is enabled by breaking parallel bonds between DEM particles as a result of the local stress state. Subsequent bond breakage induces fracture propagation during a time-stepping procedure. Hydraulic fracturing occurs when pressurized fluid induces hoop stresses around the wellbore which cause rock fracturing and serves for geo-reservoir permeability enhancement in oil, gas and geothermal industries. In DEM, a network of fluid pipes and reservoirs is used for mathematical calculation of fluid flow through narrow channels between DEM particles, where the hydro-mechanical coupling is fully enabled. The fluid flow calculation is superimposed with DEM stress-strain calculation at each time step. As a result, the fluid pressures during borehole pressurization in hydraulic fracturing, as well as, during the fracture propagation from the borehole, can be simulated. The objective of this study is to investigate numerically a hypothesis that fluid pressurization rate, or the fluid flow rate, influences upon character, shape and velocity of fracture propagation in rock. The second objective is to better understand and define constraints which are important for successful fracture propagation in quasi-brittle rock from the perspective of flow rate, fluid density, viscosity and compressibility relative to the rock physical properties. Results from this study indicate that not only too high fluid flow rates cause fracture arrest and multiple fracture branching from the borehole, but also that the relative compressibility of fracturing fluid and rock plays a significant role in fracture propagation velocity. Fluid viscosity effects are similar to the loading rate effects, because in both cases the rapid buildup of the pressure in the wellbore in absence of the inflow of the fluid into initiated fracture causes induction of multiple simultaneous fracture branches at the wellbore wall.",

This status quo relies on the assumption of Poiseuille flow in the fracture, which transmissivity varies as cube of the aperture. We re-evaluate this assumption in the vicinity of the fracture tip, where the aperture roughness and/or branching of the fracture path may lead to very significant deviations from the cubic law. Existing relationships suggest rough fracture transmissivity power laws ~ wr with 4.5 ≤ r ≤ 6, when aperture w is smaller than the roughness. Solving for the tip region of a steadily propagating hydraulic fracture with the “rough fracture” transmissivity, we are able to show (a) larger energy dissipation than predicted by the Poiseuille flow model; (b) localization of the fluid pressure drop into the low-transmissivity, rough tip region; and (c) emergence of potentially preeminent “toughness-dominated” fracture propagation regime where most of the energy is dissipated at the tip and can be described in the context of classical fracture mechanics by invoking the effective fracture toughness dependent upon the details of the pressure drop in the rough tip. We establish that the ratio of the roughness scale wc to the viscous aperture scale wμ = μVE / σ02, controls the pressure drop localization. (Here V - propagation speed, μ - fluid viscosity, E - rock modulus, and σ0 - in-situ stress). For a range of industrial fracturing fluids (from slick-water to linear gels) and treatment conditions, wc/wμ is large, suggesting a fully-localized pressure drop and energy dissipation. The latter is adequately described by the effective toughness - a function of the propagation velocity, confining stress and material parameters, which estimated values are much larger than the “dry” rock fracture toughness measured in the lab. Using the effective, velocity-dependent fracture toughness to predict the evolution of a penny-shape fracture, we are able to show how/when the classical viscosity-dominated and toughness-dominated solutions based upon the Poiseuille law and the “dry”, laboratory fracture toughness values, respectively, may become inadequate.",

            "abstract": "A wide variety of river science applications require remote estimation of discharge. Flow in steep rivers often approach critical flow (Froude number equal to one), as evidenced by trains of standing waves either perpendicular or at a high angle relative to the flow direction. Previous work has demonstrated that where such waves are present, water depth can be estimated without the need for a roughness coefficient such as Manning’s n.\nWe extend this prior work to remotely calculate river discharge. The wavelength of standing waves can be measured using high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Velocity can then be calculated from wavelength using the Kennedy wave equation. Assuming critical flow allows depth to be calculated using the modified Froude number equation, and with an additional measurement of imaged river width, river discharge can be computed directly as the product of these three values. We test this approach using high-resolution Google Earth imagery of rivers with standing waves near existing stream gages. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by extracting a drainage area-to-discharge relationship for a large watershed.\nThere are certain challenges with this approach, the greatest being the need for high resolution (meter-scale or better) imagery to see and measure standing waves. Such waves are also easily confused with wind waves, turbulence or other surface effects. Nevertheless, this approach offers promise for both estimating discharge in places without extensive gage networks, and also estimating discharge in archival imagery. Repeat imaging of the same areas might also be used to construct at-a-station and downstream hydraulic geometry relationships.",

In this study, we present a validation method that projects the difference between posterior and prior CO2 error variances to the spatiotemporal difference between posterior and prior fluxes. We will show theoretically that the posterior fluxes are more accurate than the prior fluxes over the regions that contribute to the changes of CO2 errors when the posterior CO2 is more accurate. We will show the performance of this method using both results from Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) and results from assimilating real ACOS-GOSAT XCO2 observations. The method is an advancement compared to the current practice of only calculating the CO2 errors, since it shows where and when the posterior fluxes improve the fitting to independent observations and the relative accuracy between the posterior fluxes and the prior fluxes over the regions that affect the CO2 error variance changes. The method can also apply in other trace gas flux inversions, such as methane and CO.",

            "abstract": "In the subsurface, the vast majority of microorganisms are found in biofilms attached to mineral surfaces. The fickle nature of these environments (chemically and physically) likely causes dynamic ecological shifts in these microbial communities. We used laboratory biofilm reactors (inoculated with a diverse subsurface community) to explore the role of mineralogy as part of a microbe-mineral-water ecosystem under variable pressures (mineralogy, pH, carbon, phosphate). Following multivariate analyses, pH was identified as the key physicochemical property associated with variation in both phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity as well as overall community structure (P<0.05). In particular, the ability of minerals, media, or a combination of the two to buffer metabolically generated acidity impacted community structure under oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions. Additionally, we found that media phosphate limitations were significantly correlated to greater biofilm accumulation (P<0.002), but lower species richness (P<0.001) and Shannon diversity (P<0.001); while mineral-bound phosphate limitations were significantly correlated to lesser biofilm accumulation (P<0.05) but not to species richness or diversity. Carbon (as acetate, lactate, or formate) added to the media was correlated with a significant increase in biofilm accumulation (P<0.04), and overall Shannon diversity (P<0.006), but not significantly correlated with overall species richness.\nAlthough variable in magnitude, the effect of surface chemistry on microbial diversity (both phylogenetic and taxonomic) was statistically significant, in all reactors, regardless of environmental pressures. Phylogenetically, surface type (carbonate, silicate, or Al-silicate) controlled ~70-90%, meaning that organisms attached to similar surfaces were significantly more genetically similar. Taxonomy and proportional abundance was significantly sensitive to variations in media chemistry with consistent patterns emerging among specific clades (sulfur-oxidizers, sulfur-reducers, Gram-positives, Acidophiles). Furthermore, planktonic communities were phylogenetically distant from those in biofilms. All reactors harbored structurally, taxonomically, and phylogenetically distinct microbial communities.",

            "abstract": "Linking sediment transport to landscape evolution is fundamental to interpreting climate and tectonic signals from topography and sedimentary deposits. Most geomorphic process laws consist of simple continuum relationships between sediment flux and local topography. However, recent work has shown that nonlocal formulations, whereby sediment flux depends on upslope conditions, are more accurate descriptions of sediment motion, particularly in steep topography. Discriminating between local and nonlocal processes in natural landscapes is complicated by the scarcity of high-resolution topographic data and by the difficulty of measuring sediment flux. To test the validity of local formulations of sediment transport, we use an experimental erosive landscape that combines disturbance-driven, diffusive sediment transport and surface runoff. We conducted our experiments in the eXperimental Landscape Model at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory a 0.5 x 0.5 m test flume filled with crystalline silica (D50 = 30μ) mixed with water to increase cohesion and preclude surface infiltration. Topography is measured with a sheet laser scanner; total sediment flux is tracked with a series of load cells. We simulate uplift (relative baselevel fall) by dropping two parallel weirs at the edges of the experiment. Diffusive sediment transport in our experiments is driven by rainsplash from a constant head drip tank fitted with 625 blunt needles of fixed diameter; sediment is mobilized both through drop impact and the subsequent runoff of the drops. To drive advective transport, we produce surface runoff via a ring of misters that produce droplets that are too small to disturb the sediment surface on impact. Using the results from five experiments that systematically vary the time of drip box rainfall relative to misting rainfall, we calculate local erosion in our experiments by differencing successive time-slices of topography and test whether these patterns are related to local topographic metrics. By examining these patterns over different timescales, we are able to assess whether there is a signature of nonlocal transport in long-term topographic evolution or if, instead, local formulations are appropriate over timescales much greater than individual transport events.",

            "abstract": "The impact of grazing on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from subtropical pastures and thus on the climate system is uncertain, although these systems account for a substantial portion of global carbon storage. We investigated how cattle grazing affects net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and CH4 emissions in subtropical pastures using the eddy covariance technique over two complete wet-dry seasonal cycles. Grazing increased soil wetness but did not affect soil temperature. By removing aboveground biomass, grazing consistently decreased gross primary productivity (16% and 8 % in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015) and reduced ecosystem respiration (Re, 20% and 38% in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015). Lower Re in grazed (GP) than in ungrazed pasture (UP) was also explained by decreased soil and heterotrophic respiration and root biomass. Grazing increased the net CO2 sink strength of the pasture (-86 ± 5 gC m-2 yr-1 in GP vs. -76 ± 6 gC m-2 yr-1 in UP in 2013-2014; -118 ± 9 gC m-2 yr-1 in GP vs. +142 ± 6 gC m-2 yr-1 UP in 2014-2015). Over both wet-dry seasonal cycles, both ecosystems were net sources of CH4, and variations in fluxes without cattle present were driven by changes in soil wetness and temperature. The presence of cattle and greater soil moisture cased by the removal of aboveground biomass, caused greater total net ecosystem CH4 emissions from GP than from UP (16% and 8 % in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015). Wetter soils under GP were responsible for 21-56% of the difference in net CH4 emissions between pastures, suggesting that enhanced CH4 production from wetter soils due to cattle presence can be a major contributor to annual CH4 fluxes. Combining CO2 and CH4 to calculate a C budget revealed that grazing increased the net C sink strength of the pasture (-72 gC m-2 yr-1 in GP vs. -66 gC m-2 yr-1 in UP in 2013-2014; -114 gC m-2 yr-1 in GP vs. +144 gC m-2 yr-1 in UP in 2014-2015). Accounting for NEE and the radiative forcing of CH4, grazing increased the net global warming potential (GWP) of the pasture in 2013-2014, but decreased it in 2014-2015 when GP was a net sink for greenhouse gases (GHGs) but UP was a net source. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying CO2 fluxes in tandem with CH4 fluxes in grazing lands, suggest that grazing profoundly alters net ecosystem GHG fluxes and GWP of subtropical pastures and indicate that grazing could enhance the C accumulated in pastures.",

Historical instrumental measurements (direct data) extend from present day to the late Middle Age, and, prior the 19th century, consist mainly of declination values. Further back in the past, field reconstructions rely exclusively on the magnetization acquired by archaeological artefacts and rocks or sediments (indirect data). The major challenges for a reliable inversion approach are the inhomogeneous data distribution, the highly variable data quality, and inconsistent quality parameters. Available historical, archeomagnetic and volcanic records have been integrated into a single database together with corresponding metadata. This combination of compilations enables a joint evaluation of geomagnetic field records from different origins. In particular, data reliability and quality of indirect records are investigated using a detailed comparison with their direct counterparts. The collection forms the basis for combined inverse modeling of the geomagnetic field evolution. The iterative Bayesian inversion approach targets the implementation of reliable error treatments, which allow to combine data from different sources. Furthermore, a verification method scrutinizing the limitations of the applied inversion scheme and the used datasets is developed. Here, we will present strategies for the integration of different data types into the modeling procedure. The obtained modeling results and their validity will be discussed.",

Recent coordinated observational studies [e.g., Fritts et al. 2014, Taylor et al. 2015, Bossert et al. 2015 ] have identified numerous cases where small-scale waves (~10s km wavelength, minute periods) are found to be propagating within strong medium-scale wave fields (~100s km wavelength and intrinsic periods of approximately hours). Despite this, it is unclear to what extent the small-scale waves are generated from the same source, are ambient in the atmosphere as generated by other sources, or are generated in-situ by the medium-scale wave and its interactions. A 2D compressible, nonlinear model is used to simulate cases of (1) the refractive effects of medium scale wave-like wind and temperature fields in addition to (2) the full dynamic interactions between small scale and medium scale waves under realistic atmospheric conditions. We investigate possible mechanisms for the medium scale wave to provide favorable regions of propagation for smaller scale waves from other sources in contrast to scenarios favoring in-situ wave generation or the generation of smaller-scale wavelike features. We also examine the propagation of small-scale waves generated from the same source location as the medium-scale waves, and how the propagation characteristics of waves determine which parts of the gravity wave spectrum may be susceptible to possible interactions. Small scale waves are shown to have a significant impact on the momentum and energy budget of the MLT through dissipation, filtering, and instability mechanisms [e.g. Fritts and Alexander 2003, Fritts et al. 2014]. Understanding and separating the roles of larger scale waves in refracting, interacting with, or generating smaller scale waves will be crucial in predicting the location and distribution of small-scale wave energy and momentum depositions and the resulting local variability of the MLT.",

            "abstract": "Semi-volatile organic molecules bound to particles are difficult to measure, especially if they are reactive in nature. Any technique based on aerosol collection onto a substrate generates sampling artifacts due to surface reactions and ad- and desorption of semi-volatile analytes. On-line sampling without sample pre-collection, as for example implemented in the AMS, has greatly reduced many sampling artifacts. AMS measurements of organics do, however, suffer from the drawback that molecular-level information is, in most cases, lost during hard ionization events. As a consequence, only little speciated and thus mechanistically informative data on organic matter is obtained. PTR-ToF-MS is a well-established on-line measurement technique for gas-phase organics. Soft ionization via gas-phase hydronium ions preserves, to a large extent, molecular-level information and thus allows identifying organic compounds at an elemental composition level. We have recently developed a particle inlet system for PTR-ToF-MS instruments (doi:10.5194/amt-8-1353-2015). The CHARON (“Chemical Analysis of Aerosol On-line”) inlet consists of a gas-phase denuder, an aerodynamic lens and a thermodesorption unit. In its latest version, it includes a heatable tube upstream of the denuder to form a thermodenuder. Over the last year, the CHARON PTR-ToF-MS system has been successfully used in a series of measurement campaigns to characterize i) POA emitted from a marine diesel engine, ii) SOA generated from the photo-oxidation of toluene, iii) SOA generated from the photo-oxidation of selected amines, iv) ambient aerosol in two major European cities and v) SOA generated from the photo-oxidation of biogenic VOCs. These measurements have demonstrated that the CHARON PTR-ToF-MS system i) generates on-line and real-time elemental composition information of semi-volatile organics in submicron particles (both POA and SOA), ii) detects 80-100 % of the organic mass as measured by the AMS and iii) generates volatility information of semi-volatile organics at an elemental composition level.

            "abstract": "Previous projections of the contemporary forest carbon balance in the western US showed uncertainties associated with impacts of climate extremes and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution implemented over heterogeneous mountain regions. We modified the Community Land Model (CLM) 4.5 to produce 4km resolution forest carbon changes with drought, fire and management in the western US. We parameterized the model with species data using local plant trait observations for 30 species. To quantify uncertainty, we evaluated the model with data from flux sites, inventories and ancillary data in the region. Simulated GPP was lower than the measurements at our AmeriFlux sites by 17-22%. Simulated burned area was generally higher than Landsat observations, suggesting the model overestimates fire emissions with the new fire model. Landsat MTBS data show high severity fire represents only a small portion of the total burnt area (12-14%), and no increasing trend from 1984 to 2011. Moderate severity fire increased ~0.23%/year due to fires in the Sierra Nevada (Law & Waring 2014). Oregon, California, and Washington were a net carbon sink, and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) declined in California over the past 15 years, partly due to drought impacts. Fire emissions were a small portion of the regional carbon budget compared with the effect of harvest removals. Fossil fuel emissions in CA are more than 3x that of OR and WA combined, but are lower per capita. We also identified forest regions that are most vulnerable to climate-driven transformations and to evaluate the effects of management strategies on forest NECB. Differences in forest NECB among states are strongly influenced by the extent of drought (drier longer in the SW) and management intensity (higher in the PNW).",

            "abstract": "In rivers throughout the world, anthropogenic impacts related to large dams have altered or eliminated the habitat necessary for many aquatic organisms. Flow experiments, both planned and unplanned, provide unique opportunities to evaluate the extent to which alternative dam operations can provide downstream ecological benefits. Here we use an unanticipated, reservoir release on the Santa Ynez River in southern California to investigate how a large flood influenced river ecosystem processes. We directly measured the flood-induced, topographic changes over 80 km of the river and floodplain using two high-resolution field and remote sensing data sets that bracketed the flood event. DEM-differencing of the pre- and post-flood topography was used to calculate shifts in the active channel planform and the net volumetric fluxes in gravel storage along the channel and floodplain. LiDAR and image-based habitat mapping was conducted to quantify the proportion of different habitat units before and after the flood. Large-scale geomorphic changes were observed as a result of the flood, including lateral migration of the river channel, gravel bar formation and the development of off-channel chute habitat. Spatial patterns of gravel storage changed with distance from the dam, with the upper 20 km experiencing a net sediment deficit and the lower 60 km undergoing net deposition. The longitudinal trends in gravel transport and storage reflect differences in the channel gradient, valley confinement and density of floodplain vegetation. We found that the flood nearly doubled the extent of pool habitat, primarily by converting runs to pools and by incising new pools adjacent to valley walls and terraces. The increase in the number of pools was predicted to have positive impacts on steelhead habitat, by providing a broader range of water depths and micro-habitats utilized by different age classes. Results from this study highlight the value of using flow pulses as opportunities to learn about river behavior, and for testing the degree to which physical processes can help restore the form and function of river ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal variability of relative humidity (RH) condition during southwest monsoon (SWM) is strongly related with availability of moisture for rainfall over the continental region. There are ongoing efforts to reconstruct the past monsoonal condition based on geochemical and isotopic records as proxies [1]. However, limited archives have been successfully retrieved for reconstructing moisture condition during SWM [2].\nPotential of plants as climate archives and the mechanism involved in transfer of climate signature to the stable isotope composition of oxygen (δ18O) has been demonstarted successfully [3]. Here we are introducing δ18O of rice grain bulk organic matter (δ18OOM) as a new proxy for precise determination of RH during SWM. Rice is a seasonal crop and widely cultivated over the Indian subcontinent during SWM. Here we present δ18OOM of rice grains collected from 15 locations from different climatic zones over the Indian subcontinent, ranging from semi-arid to humid-perhumid. These samples were collected from the harvest of the crop grown at the time of SWM for the period 2012-2014. Each of these climatic zones are characterized by unique range of RH values, which is expected to leave distinct oxygen isotopic signature in the rice grain OM. We compared the δ18OOM values with δ18O of precipitation water, RH and temperature during the period of cultivation. Precipitation δ18O values were obtained from were obtained from OPIC [4]. Our observations document a significant relationship between δ18OOM and RH (R2 =0.62, p<0.001). When the RH level fluctuated from 65% to 88%, δ18OOM tended to vary between 31.5 ‰ to 15.4‰. However, the humid regions with rainfed crop showed significant relationship between δ18OOM and precipitation δ18O. Remaining stations being fed by the both rain and irrigation from river/ groundwater, dampen the rainfall isotope signature in δ18OOM.\nThis approach can be extended in deriving RH of regions of rice cultivation by measuring δ18O of grain OM. The study also demonstrated that δ18O of well-preserved rice grains can serve as a proxy for RH condition of ancient agrarian civilisations, with confidence.\n[1] Ghosh and Brand, Int. J.

            "abstract": "The geometry of brittle fault zones in shale rocks, as well as their frictional properties at reservoir conditions, are still poorly understood. Nevertheless, these factors may control the very low recovery factors (25% for gas and 5% for oil) obtained during fracking operations. Extensional brittle fault zones (maximum displacement < 3 m) cut exhumed oil mature black shales in the Cleveland Basin (UK). Fault cores up to 50 cm wide accommodated most of the displacement, and are defined by a stair-step geometry. Their internal architecture is characterised by four distinct fault rock domains: foliated gouges; breccias; hydraulic breccias; and a slip zone up to 20 mm thick, composed of a fine-grained black gouge. Hydraulic breccias are located within dilational jogs with aperture of up to 20 cm. Brittle fracturing and cataclastic flow are the dominant deformation mechanisms in the fault core of shale faults. Velocity-step and slide-hold-slide experiments at sub-seismic slip rates (microns/s) were performed in a rotary shear apparatus under dry, water and brine-saturated conditions, for displacements of up to 46 cm. Both the protolith shale and the slip zone black gouge display shear localization, velocity strengthening behaviour and negative healing rates, suggesting that slow, stable sliding faulting should occur within the protolith rocks and slip zone gouges. Experiments at seismic speed (1.3 m/s), performed on the same materials under dry conditions, show that after initial friction values of 0.5-0.55, friction decreases to steady-state values of 0.1-0.15 within the first 10 mm of slip. Contrastingly, water/brine saturated gouge mixtures, exhibit almost instantaneous attainment of very low steady-state sliding friction (0.1), suggesting that seismic ruptures may efficiently propagate in the slip zone of fluid-saturated shale faults. Stable sliding in faults in shale can cause slow fault/fracture propagation, affecting the rate at which new fracture areas are created and, hence, limiting oil and gas production during reservoir stimulation. However, fluid saturated conditions can favour seismic slip propagation, with fast and efficient creation of new fracture areas. These processes are very effective at dilational jogs, where fluid circulation may be enhanced, facilitating oil and gas production.",

            "abstract": "A remarkable combination of meteorological and catalytic chemical factors place the summertime lower stratosphere over the U.S. in a unique position at the intersection of climate forcing and potential ozone loss in the stratosphere. The factors that conspire to establish this circumstance engages four independent considerations. First is the occurrence of severe storms in the U.S. Mid-West caused by the intersection of moist airflow from the Gulf of Mexico with airflow from higher latitudes in spring and summer. These storms are characterized by a combination of tornadoes, hail, heavy precipitation and high winds, the frequency and intensity of which are increasing with increased forcing of the climate system by the addition of CO2, CH4, N2O CFCs, and other infrared active species to the atmosphere associated with human activity. Second is the recognition that these severe storms are capable of injecting water vapor deep into the stratosphere over the U.S., with injection depths reaching the altitude of increasing inorganic halogen species formed by the photolytic breakdown of organic chorine and bromine transported into the stratosphere. Third is the recognition that the catalytic conversion of inorganic halogen species to radicals, specifically ClO and BrO, that are the rate limiting catalytic species that destroy ozone, occurs on ubiquitous sulfate-water aerosols wherever and whenever the temperature-water vapor conditions are met. These conditions are met in the Antarctic and Arctic winter vortices by virtue of temperatures below 200K at 5 ppmv water vapor, and in the summertime lower stratosphere over the U.S. by virtue of temperatures between 200 and 205K in combination with convectively injected water vapor concentrations in the range of 8 ppmv or greater. Fourth, is the recognition that the flow pattern of the lower stratosphere over the U.S. in summer is repeatedly under the control of the North American monsoon that forms an anti-cyclonic (clockwise) gyre that captures the combination of chemical species within it, retaining that chemical mix for periods up to three weeks during the months of July and August. It is within this gyre over the U.S. that the catalytic reactions can occur potentially reducing the column concentration of ozone in summer.",

Previous studies carried out in South America did not map clearly some areas of the continent, such as the southern part of the Paraná basin, because of insufficient number of crossing paths. To describe the crustal structure of the whole Paraná basin, in addition to data obtained by the analysis of Andean earthquakes, we used dispersion curves from ambient noise correlation between pairs of seismographic stations, a technique known by Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT). The obtained group velocity maps for South America correspond well with the main geological provinces of the continent: low velocities under the Andes and sedimentary basins and high velocities in cratonic regions. Inversion of the group velocities for the Paraná Basin were carried out with the following results: a) crustal thicknesses tend to be 45 km; b) high velocity anomalies for the uppermost mantle, which agree with previous studies consistent with the presence of a cratonic nucleus in the basin, particularly beneath its northern part. However, our surface wave tomography had no resolution to say whether such a nucleus is intact.",

Here we report permeability evolutions observed in core-flood experiments using CO2-charged fluids under various formation conditions. Temperature-series experiments on consolidated dolomite cores show a permeability increase due to dissolution, followed by a two-step permeability decrease due to CO2 exsolution and secondary dolomite precipitation, as temperature is increased from 21 to 50°C and then to 100°C, respectively. CO2 mass balance calculations suggest that, under dynamic steady-state conditions, CO2 saturation and its relative permeability can only reach up to ~0.5 and ~0.0065, respectively. Permeability reductions of ~1/3 and mass losses of ~2% are observed both in a 52-day recycling and in two 3-day single-pass experiments with K-feldspar-rich sandstone (150°C, 200 bar). Water chemistry, SEM, and XRCT data suggest feldspar dissolution and precipitation of either boehmite (recycling) or kaolinite (single-pass) during the experiments. These observations indicate that permeability can decrease with increasing porosity due to mineral precipitation in critical pore throats. Single-pass experiments on nine dolomite cores (150°C and 150 bar with NaCl) reveal permeability enhancements and dissolution patterns at different flow rates. Permeability-porosity data indicate an increase in permeability enhancement rate per increase in porosity with reaction progress as dissolution channels lengthen along the core. These experimental observations provide the requisite data for informing up-scaled, fully-coupled reactive transport simulations of CO2 sequestration in interbedded siliclastic-carbonate sedimentary reservoirs, which we present.",

            "abstract": "Prior to 4.6 Ma, SST proxy data has identified a 2° SST gradient from east to west across the equatorial Pacific, much smaller than the Holocene E-W gradient near 6°. The reduced Miocene gradient should have significantly reduced atmospheric Walker circulation and reduced the forcing for eastern Pacific upwelling. However, abundant data on biogenic deposition has found that, if anything, eastern equatorial Pacific productivity was higher in the Miocene and was still centered at the equator. The eastern equatorial Pacific is also marked by abrupt order-of-magnitude changes in production that last for 50-200 kyr throughout the middle and late Miocene. The latest (but not largest) of these productivity intervals began abruptly (<5 kyr onset) at 4745 ka at ODP Site 849, then at 0.6°S, and ended more gradually around 4555 ka. The high production interval can be traced as far north as Site U1337 at a paleolatitude of 2.5°N. Much higher relative diatom production occurs near the equator than at sites further north; instead they have high carbonate production, presumably by coccolithophorids. The opal and carbonate distributions will ultimately provide information on plankton response to changes in nutrient delivery.\nWe explore why the equatorial Pacific was more productive in the Miocene than in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. Since the thermocline was warmer and the SST gradient with depth was more gradual in the Miocene, less wind stress is needed to lift the same nutrient load. Also, under warmer climates the ocean was probably more heterotrophic. Changes in organic carbon burial suggest that plankton decomposed higher in the water column in the Miocene than in the Pleistocene, and there was less cycling of particulate organic matter deep into the ocean interior. Nevertheless, abrupt but long lasting changes in production are a challenge to understand without abrupt dynamic changes in linkages between nutrient reservoirs. In the eastern Pacific the longer term evolution of biogenic sedimentation is associated with the closure of the Central American Seaway between 10 and 4 Ma.",

            "abstract": "The incidence of low-intensity natural and managed fire is on the rise, especially in the arid and semi-arid parts of the U.S. Southwest. Yet, there is little understanding of the ramifications of such burns on soil characteristics and their associated ecological processes. In particular, effects of low-intensity fires on soil structure have generally been ignored because such fires have little effect on soil organic matter. Recently, we showed that soil aggregates subjected to rapid low-intensity heating (<200°C) deteriorate more than aggregates subjected to the same temperature but at slow heating rate. We hypothesized that rapid heating rate results in high internal gas pressure due to vaporization of pore water that exerts disruptive mechanical stress that exceeds the internal strength of the aggregates. Here, we present in situ measurements of gas pressure of aggregates subjected to low-intensity burns. We compared a wide range of aggregate wetness and temperature levels. In addition, we report direct visualization of aggregate breakdown during rapid gas expansion using dynamic environment scanning electron microscopy. Our observation to date show that the interior gas pressure of moist aggregates rise rapidly to 1.5-4kPa, whereas the pressure inside dry aggregates remain unchanged during rapid heating. These observations show that weakly aggregated soils of arid and semi-arid regions are very vulnerable to low-intensity burns.",

            "abstract": "Obion River, is located in the northwestern Tennessee region, and discharges into the Mississippi River. In the past, the river system was largely channelized for agricultural purposes that resulted in increased erosion, loss of wildlife habitat and downstream flood risks. These impacts are now being slowly reversed mainly due to wetland restoration. The river system is characterized by a large network of “loops” around the main channels that hold water either from excess flows or due to flow diversions. Without data on each individual channel, levee, canal, or pond it is not known where the water flows from or to. In some segments along the river, the natural channel has been altered and rerouted by the farmers for their irrigation purposes. Satellite imagery can aid in identifying these features, but its spatial coverage is temporally sparse. All the alterations that have been done to the watershed make it difficult to develop hydraulic models, which could predict flooding and droughts. This is especially true when building one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models compared to two-dimensional (2D) models, as the former cannot adequately simulate lateral flows in the floodplain and in complex terrains. The objective of this study therefore is to study the performance of 1D and 2D flood models in this complex river system, evaluate the limitations of 1D models and highlight the advantages of 2D models. The study presents the application of HEC-RAS and HEC-2D models developed by the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC), a division of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The broader impacts of this study is the development of best practices for developing flood models in channelized river systems and in agricultural watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Multiple compositional mantle domains are represented by primitive basalts of the Poison Lake chain (PLC), located east of the Lassen Volcanic Center in the southern Cascades and on the western margin of the Basin and Range. Four of the nine compositional groups of PLC basalts include primary basalt samples that represent distinct mantle compositions from which other samples are likely derived. Primitive basalts from two of the groups, the old railroad grade (bg; 102.1 +/- 11.4 ka) and the basalts of Poison Butte (bp; 105.0 +/- 6.0 ka), spatially and chronologically overlap. Both groups are primitive basalts that have phenocrysts of olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene. However, bg has larger, more euhedral olivine while bp has fewer, smaller, anhedral and embayed olivine phenocrysts. Compositionally, bg has higher whole-rock MgO (9.2-12.2 %) and Ni (189-238 ppm) and lower Zr (57-89 ppm) than bp (MgO = 5.3-7.8 %; Ni = 35-89 ppm; Zr = 98-153 ppm), suggesting bp has undergone more fractionation than bg. MELTS and REE models predict that the most primitive unit of bg (bg3) could have fractionated to produce the other three bg units. Similarly, MELTS and REE models suggest that four of the six units of bp can be derived by fractional crystallization from bg3. However, those models require that bg3 would need to fractionate between 40-50% in order to generate the bp compositions. Unreasonably high % fractionation suggests that the relationship between bg and bp groups is more complex than simple fractionation allows, but their similar Cr spinel compositions (bg Cr# =32.9-50.9 and bp Cr# = 44.0-56.3) suggest bg and bp are likely derived from a common mantle source. Additional petrogenetic modeling and isotope analyses will help clarify the relationship between PLC primitive basalt groups. The combination of small scale mantle heterogeneities along with detailed examination of magma processing are only recognized in the PLC with high density sampling, which may be useful for recognizing similar petrogenetic processes in other regions of the Cascades arc.",

            "abstract": "Dawn Survey mapping of Ceres at ~400 m pixel scales reveals a rich variety of well-preserved impact crater morphologies. Pre-arrival studies predicted that impact craters might resemble those on the midsize icy moons of Saturn (of similar size and density to Ceres), and might constitute a direct observational test of whether Ceres had an ice-rich interior. Central peak craters occur down to 10-15 km diameter, consistent with those predictions. Freshest crater depths on Ceres are also consistent with those on ice-rich Dione and Tethys. Scaling from Saturn’s moons suggested that central pit craters would not occur on Ceres. Central pit craters do occur on Ceres at ~50-150 km diameters, consistent with gravity scaling from the larger Galilean satellites. Pit dimensions (~0.15 of crater diameter) are indeed very similar to those on Ganymede, though they appear to be ~50% shallower on Ceres. The lack of pits on Saturn moons may be the anomaly, related to low internal temperatures or paucity of non-ice materials. Crater morphologies on Ceres thus indicate that the rheology of the outer layers of Ceres are dominated by ice (or materials that behave similarly; the contribution from non-ice phases is indeterminate). Impact morphologies deviate from pit morphology at >200 km diameters, indicating either impact into the core or effects of viscous relaxation. Arcuate crater chains, some likely secondary chains, extend from the large crater rims. More subtle differences between craters on Ceres and Ganymede/Dione/Tethys are expected as resolution increases during the mission, and indeed floor fractures and ‘smooth’ embayment materials are observed on Dantu and Occator. “Bright spot” crater Occator itself has no superposed impact craters at 400m pixel scales and likely formed or was resurfaced <100 myr ago. The largest bright spot within Occator is located within the central pit (fainter bright material also occurs within the central pit of Dantu crater and on the central peak of Urvara crater). The association of the most prominent bright spots with central pit structures suggests that either uplift or localized extraction of compositionally distinct material is involved in bright spot formation in the most strongly uplifted zones of large craters on Ceres, the details of which (currently) remain obscure.",

The main goal of the HICE-PR (Human Impacts to Coastal Ecosystems in Puerto Rico (HICE-PR): the Río Loco Watershed (southwest coast PR) project which was funded by NASA is to evaluate the impacts of land use/land cover changes on the quality and extent of coastal and marine ecosystems (CMEs) in two priority watersheds in Puerto Rico (Manatí and Guánica).The main objective of this study is to set up a physically based spatially distributed hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the analysis of hydrological processes in the Rio Grande de Manati river basin. SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) is a spatially distributed watershed model developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds. For efficient use of distributed models for hydrological and scenario analysis, it is important that these models pass through a careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. The model was calibrated and validated using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) calibration and uncertainty analysis algorithms. The model evaluation statistics for streamflows prediction shows that there is a good agreement between the measured and simulated flows that was verified by coefficients of determination and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.5.

Our recent paleotsunami investigations are specially focused on unusual large magnitude earthquake and tsunamis in the south coast of Andaman. Our detailed study on the foraminifers preserved in the near sub surface stratigraphy and AMS ages show a strong signature of the tsunami event very much similar to the modern tsunami of December 2004. We found that foraminifer is an ideal geological key to bracket paleotsunami events. The AMS ages of these foraminifers supports the ages given by corals of Sumatra with a small error bar. The recent research approach to identify the ruptures and tsunami based on the corals of south Sumatra suggests a large time span of 1000 years for such mega events. Our foraminiferal archives obtained from 10g soil samples from the 2.5m deep Holocene stratigraphy suggests four seismic predecessors similar to the 2004 event with ~Mw9 with huge rupture. Huge foraminiferal population in the sedimentary stratigraphy is an indicative of sea level changes and the signatures of abrasion in the foraminifer’s test (180µm) indicate strong wave surges and bead load transport during tsunami events. Spontaneous death of organisms due to tsunami waves gives an exact time frame with a narrow age limit than the charcoal. Sediment stratigraphy of south Andaman had such changes in each millennium. Sediment stratigraphy sections shows the huge population and assemblages and the AMS dates of this foraminifera in south Andaman shows four mega events. This kind of fossil assemblages are commonly associated with the sea regression and transgressions in the geological time scale. Tamil ‘Sangam literatures’ one of the oldest literature available in Indian main land and the corals ages from Sumatra are also emphasizes the predecessors of such unusual large magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis in the Indian Ocean. All these signatures are indicators of sea level fluctuations associated with tsunamis due to large magnitude Earthquakes (~Mw9).",

            "abstract": "The mobility of arsenic in soils is linked to biogeochemical redox processes. The presence of wetland plants in riparian wetlands has a significant impact on the biogeochemical dynamics of the soil/sediment-redoxcline due to the release of root exudates and root turnover and oxygen transfer from the roots into the surrounding sediment. Micro-environmental redox conditions in the rhizosphere affect As, Fe, and S speciation as well as Fe(III) plaque deposition, which affects arsenic transport and uptake by plants.\nTo investigate the dynamics of As coupled to S and Fe cycling in wetlands, mesocosms were operated in a greenhouse under various conditions (high and low Fe, high and low sulfate, with plant and without plants) for four months. Results show that the presence of plants, high Fe, and high SO42- levels enhanced As sequestration in these soils. We hypothesize that this compounding effect is because plants release biodegradable organic carbon, which is used by microorganism to reduce ferrihydrite and SO42- to generate FeS, FeS2, and/or orpiment (As2S3). Over the concentration range studied, As immobilization in soil and uptake by Scirpus actus was mainly controlled by SO42- rather than Fe levels. Under high sulfate levels, As immobilization in soil increased by 50% and As concentrations in plant roots increased by 97%, whereas no significant changes in plant As levels were seen for varying Fe concentrations. More than 80% of As was sequestrated in soils rather than plant uptake. Pore water As speciation analyses indicate that 20% more As(V) was reduced to As(III) under high sulfate as than low sulfate levels and that low Fe was more favorable to the As dissimilatory reduction. More dissimilatory arsenate-respiring bacteria (DARB) under high sulfate were confirmed by quantitative PCR.\nArsenic distribution in plant leafs and roots after 30 days of exposure to As was analyzed via Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence analyses. The uptake of As by plants was distributed along leaf veins. The distribution of As in roots was correlated with the distribution of Fe in the roots, rather than with Ca or Zn. These observations expand our understanding of how Fe and S influences microbial As redox metabolisms and provide insights into the biogeochemical coupling between As and S as well as Fe in As contaminated wetlands.",

            "abstract": "Today's low prices mean that unconventional oil and gas development requires ever greater efficiency and better development decision-making. Inter and intra-field variability in well productivity, which is a major contemporary driver of uncertainty regarding resource size and its economics is driven by factors including geological conditions, well and completion design (which companies vary as they seek to optimize their performance), and uncertainty about the nature of fracture propagation. Geological conditions are often not be well understood early on in development campaigns, but nevertheless critical assessments and decisions must be made regarding the value of drilling an area and the placement of wells. In these situations, location provides a reasonable proxy for geology and the “rock quality.” We propose a spatial Bayesian model for forecasting acreage quality, which improves decision-making by leveraging available production data and provides a framework for statistically studying the influence of different parameters on well productivity.\nOur approach consists of subdividing a field into sections and forming prior distributions for productivity in each section based on knowledge about the overall field. Production data from wells is used to update these estimates in a Bayesian fashion, improving model accuracy far more rapidly and with less sensitivity to outliers than a model that simply establishes an “average” productivity in each section. Additionally, forecasts using this model capture the importance of uncertainty—either due to a lack of information or for areas that demonstrate greater geological risk. We demonstrate the forecasting utility of this method using public data and also provide examples of how information from this model can be combined with knowledge about a field’s geology or changes in technology to better quantify development risk.\nThis approach represents an important shift in the way that production data is used to guide development decisions. Additionally, this method will enable other researchers to make better use of public production data—some of the largest datasets available on unconventional oil and gas development today—to evaluate the statistical impact of different geological and completion factors influencing production.",

In this work, we present details and results from the development of a transfer technique which allows natural and lab-grown ice and snow crystals to be captured, preserved, and transferred into the ESEM for 3D imaging.\nIce crystals were gathered from 1) natural snow, 2) a balloon-borne cirrus particle capture device, and 3) lab-grown ice crystals from a diffusion chamber. Ice crystals were captured in a pre-conditioned small-volume (~1 cm3) cryo-containment cell. The cell was then sealed closed and transferred to a specially-designed cryogenic dewer (filled with liquid nitrogen or crushed dry ice) for transport to a new Hitachi Field Emission, Variable Pressure SEM (SU-5000). The cryo-cell was then removed from the dewer and quickly placed onto the pre-conditioned cryo transfer stage attached to the ESEM (Quorum 3010T).\nQuantitative 3D topographical digital elevation models of ice surfaces are reported from SEM for the first time, including a variety of objective measures of statistical surface roughness. The surfaces of the transported crystals clearly exhibit signatures of mesoscopic roughening that are similar to examples of roughness seen in ESEM-grown crystals. For most transported crystals, the habits and crystal edges are more intricate that those observed for ice grown directly on substrates within the ESEM chamber. Portions of some crystals do appear smooth even at magnification greater than 1000x, a rare observation in our ESEM-grown crystals. The transported crystals hint at some significant differences in roughness morphology, but they do provide evidence that crystals grown in air/water mixtures and with minimal substrate influence also exhibit mesoscopic roughness with similarity to that observed in ESEM-grown crystals.",

The 576 spatial pixels across OMI’s 2-D CCD are binned into 60 “rows.” Starting in June 2007 and continuing to the present, two rows ceased to provide useful data. On three occasions between May 2008 through January 2009, eighteen additional spatial rows became affected by what is now called the “row anomaly” effect. Since 2010 the row anomaly effect has been roughly constant at eliminating 20-30% of the otherwise useful data, with some minor variability, especially at the ends of the main block of anomaly-effected rows. When including other data quality factors, approximately 45-50% of all daily zonal mean data collected by OMI is considered “useful” or valid for all science applications. While this means that total global ozone maps are now available every two days, as opposed to each day in the two years after launch, this is still more than adequate to fulfill overall mission science requirements.\n<span\">OMI science data users need to know which exact data points are valid and which are flagged as contaminated by the row anomaly effect. Not all of the pixels in the main block of eighteen spatial rows yield spurious data all the time. The main driver of row anomaly variability is the orientation of the OMI instrument with respect to the Sun, specifically when at high Northern latitudes in the boreal winter. Variations in the row anomalies make the exact prediction of good (valid data) vs. bad (anomaly-affected) data impossible. Therefore, the daily zonal mean total ozone is constantly evaluated for data quality to identify which rows and 5-degree zonal bands provide anomaly-free total ozone data. The temporal and spatial variation in the row anomaly for the period 2007-present, including its current impact on the availability of “useful” data, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We present MMS observations of dipolarization fronts. Dipolarization fronts commonly observed in Earth’s plasma sheet are characterized by intense gradients in the current sheet-normal component of the magnetic field and plasma/magnetic pressure across the front. These fronts are often embedded within fast earthward flows, i.e., bursty bulk flows. Analysis using data from all four spacecraft shows the presence of both typical and atypical dipolarization fronts. Typically dipolarization fronts propagate earthward and their normals point radially inward, however, we have identified dipolarization fronts propagating tailward with normals pointing significantly away from the radial direction. Atypical dipolarization fronts observed on 7 May 2015 and 21 July 2015 are preceded or accompanied by a rapid decrease in the Bx or By components of the magnetic field. These decreases indicate that the magnetotail is first thinning and then thickening. The resulting magnetic pile-up can cause the local Bz to increase rapidly, indicating propagation tailward, as observed. These new high time resolution field and plasma observations from MMS provide exciting new insights about the dynamical changes of magnetotail topology.",

These same areas are critical to protecting the landscape from global environmental change: enhanced tropical cyclones, flooding, drought and a range of other environmental change impacts. Byrne (2014) adapted a multidisciplinary methodology for climate adaptation capacity definition for the population of Nicaragua. A wide array of adaptive capacity skills and resources were integrated with agricultural crop modeling to define regions of the country where adaptive capacity development were weakest and should be improved. In Matanzas province, we are developing a series of multidisciplinary mitigation and adaptation programs that builds social science and science knowledge to expand capacity within the ESCM and the provincial population. We will be exploring increased risk due to combined watershed and tropical cyclone flooding, stresses on crops, and defining a range of possibilities in shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The program will build ongoing interactions with thousands of Matanzas citizens through site visits carried out by numerous Cuban and visiting students participating in a four-month education semester with a number of Lethbridge and Matanzas faculty. These visits will also provide local citizens with better access to web-based interactions. We will evaluate mitigation and adaptive capacities in three municipalities and some rural areas across the province. Furthermore, we will explore better ways and means to communicate between the research and conservation staff and the larger population of the province.",

Site selection of landfill for Municipal solid waste is an important concern for the urban government in whole world. Dhaka city is highly dense populated city in Bangladesh and municipal solid waste generation rate is increase rapidly day by day. These large amount of generated municipal waste needs appropriate landfill considering environmental, geological, social and technical aspect of the region. The traditional process of site selection process is much difficult, time consuming and costly and needs to replace by a new approaches. An integration of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Multi-criteria Evaluation (MCE) method is best combination to solve complex decision and used to select suitable site. Analytical Hierarchy process (AHP) is world widely most popular decision making MCE technique. In this study AHP used as a multi-criteria decision making to compare five suitability attributes with each other and evaluate weight according to attributes potentiality. Various type raster map layer created using GIS tool for this study. Five suitability raster was assigned with the AHP calculated weight value. A combined weighted spatial layer obtained name as suitability map which is overlapped with a restriction raster map, as result a final suitable map was obtained. The result shows that 12.2% of the area is suitable for constructing landfill site where 4.9% is very high suitable, 2.6% is moderate suitable and 4.7% is low suitable. The final site is constructed after detail field investigation, other technical investigation, land ownership status and public acceptancy. Suitable site selection for non-hazardous landfill is not easy and its needs to consider many environmental factor at time. GIS tool combining with many decision making tool such as multi-criteria evaluation can solve this problem. A combining method of GIS tool and multi-criteria decision making tool (AHP) is more consistently good in quality to solve complex problem, can acquisition many data at time and performed a reliable result. So finally its shows that the methodology of this research and objective can make impressive solve in global environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Following the discovery of the evolution of tremor response to tidal stress over the duration of ETS slip at a spot (Houston 2015; Royer et al 2015;Yabe et al 2015), we investigate whether and how it may evolve between major large ETSs, which occur quasi-periodically in several subduction zones. Preliminary results show that tidal response does evolve over the average interETS period in northern Cascadia - decaying over the first quarter of the cycle to lowest values then climbing back up in the second half of the cycle part of the way toward the strong response seen late during major ETSs. Thus far, we have ignored the possible role of transient stresses during interETS tremor because tremor bursts are mostly small.\nWe explore a strength-threshold model where tidal influence is stronger when stress is close to strength and weaker when they are farther apart. Shortly after a major ETS, both stress and strength are presumed to have fallen over the large region where slow slip occurred. Then, however, stress rebuilds quasi-linearly by plate tectonic loading, whereas strength rebuilds as the logarithm of time (e.g., Vidale et al 1994). Thus, model stress and strength diverge the most midway through the interETS cycle, the period of weakest tidal sensitivity. Tidal stresses become more effective in triggering tremor later in the cycle as the linearly-growing stress approaches the logarithmically-growing strength. This model broadly fits our observed evolution of tidal response. However, the tendency of ETSs to initiate downdip may require an additional process that varies along dip. This approach illuminates the competition between healing on the plate interface and reloading with tectonic stress, and can help constrain and perhaps even monitor physical conditions on the deep subduction interface.\nThe figure shows the evolution of two measures of tidal influence on tremor, consistency and sensitivity (right), and the data on which they are based - probability distributions of stress at the times of tremor and the strength of the exponential relation between tremor rate and tidal stress (left). Tremor and stress data for 6 normalized interETS time periods are averaged together.",

Food security is complicated by a diversity of factors whose relative influence varies across scales, such as the nature of transportation infrastructure, the variety of agricultural practices, and the relative importance of food production versus food access. Efforts to model food security often focus on local-level dynamics (agricultural decision-making) or regional/coarse scale dynamics (e.g. GCM output + generalized equilibrium models of food trade) – both scales are of paramount importance to food security. Yet models of food security rarely span this scale divide.\nWe present work linking agent-based models of agricultural decision-making to regional and global dynamics of environmental change, food movement and virtual water trade in sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically we investigate the heterogeneity of environmental factors and agricultural decisions within the context of droughts of different duration and spatial extent. Drivers of meteorological drought manifest in agricultural drought through the complexity inherent in agricultural management. But efforts to model food security are often challenged by a lack of local-level empirical data to characterize the relationship between meteorological drought and agricultural drought. Our agent-based model is built using detailed information on household farm assets and individual farmer decisions, combined with crop yield estimated developed using the DSSAT cropping system model run with bias-corrected meteorological data. We then address food access through a analysis of food trade data given the increasing relevance of food movement to mitigate local and regional drought. We discuss the analytical challenges and opportunities in linking these cross-scale dynamics in food security modeling.",

Circulation forecasts are often validated with GPS-tracked drifter paths, but how accurately do these drifters actually move with ocean currents? Drifters are not only moved by water, but are also forced by wind and waves acting on the exposed buoy and transmitter; this imperfect movement is referred to as drifter slip. The quantification and further understanding of drifter slip will allow scientists to differentiate between drifter imperfections and actual computer model error when comparing trajectory forecasts with actual drifter tracks. This will avoid falsely accrediting all discrepancies between a trajectory forecast and an actual drifter track to computer model error. During multiple deployments of drifters in Nantucket Sound and using observed wind and wave data, we attempt to quantify the slip of drifters developed by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s (NEFSC) Student Drifters Program. While similar studies have been conducted previously, very few have directly attached current meters to drifters to quantify drifter slip. Furthermore, none have quantified slip of NEFSC drifters relative to the oceanographic-standard “CODE” drifter. The NEFSC drifter archive has over 1000 drifter tracks primarily off the New England coast. With a better understanding of NEFSC drifter slip, modelers can reliably use these tracks for model validation.",

Conception to the Mexican border). Using a framework of circulation, wave, analytical, and Bayesian models at different geographic scales, high-resolution results are translated as relevant hazards projections at the local scale that include flooding, wave heights, coastal erosion, shoreline change, and cliff failures. Ready access to accurate, high-resolution coastal flooding data is critical for further validation and refinement of CoSMoS and improved coastal hazard projections. High-resolution Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) provides an exceptional data source as appropriately-timed flights during extreme tides or storms provide a geographically-extensive method for determining areas of inundation and flooding extent along expanses of complex and varying coastline. Landward flood extents are numerically identified via edge-detection in imagery from single flights, and can also be ascertained via change detection using additional flights and imagery collected during average wave/tide conditions. The extracted flooding positions are compared against CoSMoS results for similar tide, water level, and storm-intensity conditions, allowing for robust testing and validation of CoSMoS and providing essential feedback for supporting regional and local model improvement.",

In Africa many governments use mid-growing season household surveys to get an on-the-ground assessment of current agricultural conditions. But these efforts are cost prohibitive over large scales and only offer a one-time snapshot at a particular time point. They also rely on farmers to recall past decisions and farmer recall may be imperfect when answering retrospectively on a decision made several months back (e.g. quantity of seed planted).\nWe introduce a novel mobile-phone based approach to acquire information from farmers over large spatial extents, at high frequency at relatively low-cost compared to household survey approaches. This system makes compromises in number of questions which can feasibly be asked of a respondent (compared to household interviews), but the benefit of capturing weekly data from farmers is very exciting. We present data gathered from farmers in Kenya and Zambia to understand key dimensions of agricultural decision making such as choice of seed variety/planting date, frequency and timing of weeding/fertilizing and coping strategies such as pursuing off-farm labor. A particularly novel aspect of this work is reporting from farmers of what their expectation of end-season harvest will be on a week-by-week basis. Farmer’s themselves can serve as sentinels of crop failure in this system. And farmers responses to drought are as much driven by their expectations of looming crop failure that may be different from that gleaned from remote sensing based assessment. This work is one piece of a larger design to link farmers to high-density meteorological data in Africa as an additional tool to improve crop failure early warning systems and understand adaptation to climate variability.",

            "abstract": "A number of numerical dynamo models have successfully represented basic characteristics of the geomagnetic field in the last twenty years. However, parameters in the current dynamo model are far from realistic for the Earth's core. To approach a realistic parameters for the Earth's core in geodynmo simulations, extremely large spatial resolutions are required to resolve convective turbulence and small-scale magnetic fields. To assess the next generation dynamo models on a massively parallel computer, we performed performance and accuracy benchmarks from 15 dynamo codes which employ a diverse range of discretization (spectral, finite difference, finite element, and hybrid methods) and parallelization methods. In the performance benchmark, we compare elapsed time and parallelization capability on the TACC Stampede platform, using up to 16384 processor cores. In the accuracy benchmark, we compare required resolutions to obtain less than 1% error from the suggested solutions.\nThe results of the performance benchmark show that codes using 2-D or 3-D parallelization models have a capability to run with 16384 processor cores. The elapsed time for Calypso and Rayleigh, two parallelized codes that use the spectral method, scales with a smaller exponent than the ideal scaling. The elapsed time of SFEMaNS, which uses finite element and Fourier transform, has the smallest growth of the elapsed time with the resolution and parallelization. However, the accuracy benchmark results show that SFEMaNS require three times more degrees of freedoms in each direction compared with a spherical harmonics expansion. Consequently, SFEMaNS needs more than 200 times of elapsed time for the Calypso and Rayleigh with 10000 cores to obtain the same accuracy. These benchmark results indicate that the spectral method with 2-D or 3-D domain decomposition is the most promising methodology for advancing numerical dynamo simulations in the immediate future.",

Geologists utilize hardware such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) connected to mobile computing platforms such as tablets that include software such as ESRI’s ArcPad and other software to produce maps and figures for a final analysis and report. Hand written field notes contain important information and drawings or sketches of specific areas within the field study. Our goal is to collect and geo-tag final and raw field data into a cyber-infrastructure environment with an ontology that allows for large data processing, visualization, sharing, and searching, aiding in connecting field research with prior research in the same area and/or aid with experiment replication. Online searches of a specific field area return results such as weather data from NOAA and QuakeML seismic data from USGS. These results that can then be saved to a field mobile device and searched while in the field where there is no Internet connection. To accomplish this we created the GeoField ontology service using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Protégé software. Advanced queries on the dataset can be made using reasoning capabilities can be supported that go beyond a standard database service. These improvements include the automated discovery of data relevant to a specific field site and visualization techniques aimed at enhancing analysis and collaboration while in the field by draping data over mobile views of the site using augmented reality. A case study is being performed at University of Texas at El Paso's Indio Mountains Research Station located near Van Horn, Texas, an active multi-disciplinary field study site. The user can interactively move the camera around the study site and view their data digitally. Geologist’s can check their data against the site in real-time and improve collaboration with another person as both parties have the same interactive view of the data.",

            "abstract": "Highly complex patterns of ice motion and deformation were captured by fifteen satellite-telemetered GPS buoys (known as Ice Trackers) deployed near Barrow, Alaska, in spring 2015. Two pentagonal clusters of buoys were deployed on pack ice by helicopter in the Beaufort Sea between 20 and 80 km offshore. During deployment, ice motion in the study region was effectively zero, but two days later the buoys captured a rapid transport event in which multiyear ice from the Beaufort Sea was flushed into the Chukchi Sea. During this event, westward ice motion began in the Chukchi Sea and propagated eastward. This created new openings in the ice and led to rapid elongation of the clusters as the westernmost buoys accelerated away from their neighbors to the east. The buoys tracked ice velocities of over 1.5 ms-1, with fastest motion occurring closest to the coast indicating strong current shear. Three days later, ice motion reversed and the two clusters became intermingled, rendering divergence calculations based on the area enclosed by clusters invalid. The data show no detectable difference in velocity between first year and multiyear ice floes, but Lagrangian timeseries of SAR imagery centered on each buoy show that first year ice underwent significant small-scale deformation during the event.\nThe five remaining buoys were deployed by local residents on prominent ridges embedded in the landfast ice within 16 km of Barrow in order to track the fate of such features after they detached from the coast. Break-up of the landfast ice took place over a period of several days and, although the buoys each initially followed a similar eastward trajectory around Point Barrow into the Beaufort Sea, they rapidly dispersed over an area more than 50 km across. With rapid environmental and socio-economic change in the Arctic, understanding the complexity of nearshore ice motion is increasingly important for predict future changes in the ice and the tracking ice-related hazards contaminants entrained in the ice. This work demonstrates the ability of low-cost easily-deployable Ice Trackers to generate to generate data of both scientific and operational value.",

Geochemical records derived from paleosols provide insights into paleoenvironmental conditions in MB during the evolution of the Great Plains C4 grassland ecosystem. We measured carbon isotopes in pedogenic carbonates, plant waxes, and bulk sedimentary organic matter (OM) from the same stratigraphic level to directly compare the paleovegetation signal recorded in each proxy; to further understand carbon isotope systematics; and to estimate the relative proportions of C3 plant versus C4 grass biomass. Carbon isotope (δ13C) records were derived from OM preserved in the paleosol matrix and occluded in large carbonate nodules, and used to estimate %C3 plant versus %C4 grass biomass on the landscape. Carbonate δ13C records show a steady increase in C4 grass dominance in MB from <10% C4 biomass in the Miocene to near modern (~80%) levels by the mid Pleistocene. Leaf wax %C4 estimates were more variable, and also generally higher than the carbonate estimates. Our δ13C records of OM occluded in carbonate nodules are highly variable; much more so than the carbonate record generated from the same nodules, and the OM record does not show a clear increase in C4 grass dominance over time. We are able to rule out incomplete removal of carbonate as the source of high variability in OM δ13C values. A potential explanation is that OM occluded in nodules provides a spatial and temporal “snapshot” of aboveground biomass, while nodule carbonate reflects an integrated signal of paleovegetation. When combined, these proxies yield a more comprehensive landscape reconstruction. Specifically, the OM dataset gives insight into changes in paleovegetation heterogeneity over time. Our new understanding of the paleovegetation history in MB is being paired with paleoclimate records such as MAP (from elemental and magnetic proxies) and temperature (from clumped isotope paleothermometry) estimates for an integrated view of ecosystem evolution.",

Electricity generation is a significant source of both greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions that harm human health. Previous studies have shown that air quality co-benefits can be substantial compared to the costs of limiting carbon emissions in the energy system. The EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan seeks to impose carbon intensity limits for each state, but allows states to cooperate in order to meet combined limits. We explore how such cooperation might produce trade-offs between lower costs, widespread pollution reductions, and local reductions. We employ a new state-level model of the US energy system and economy to examine the costs and emissions as states reduce demand or deploy cleaner generation. We use an advanced air quality impacts modeling system, including SMOKE, CAMx, and BenMAP, to estimate health-related air quality co-benefits and compare these to costs under different levels of cooperation.

            "abstract": "In disaster risk reduction, there is still a lack of methods capturing the dynamics of risk emerging from the complex interplay between physical and social processes. Two examples of these dynamics are the learning and levee effects. The learning effect is about the empirical evidence that more frequent hazardous events are often associated with decreasing societal vulnerability, e.g. human adaptation. The levee effect is about the stylized fact (discussed already by White in the 1940s) that less frequent hazardous events (sometimes paradoxically due to the implementation of risk prevention structures, such as levees) often lead to increasing societal vulnerability. We posit that current projections of future flood risk are not realistic because most analytical frameworks do not capture the aforementioned dynamics. Then, we propose an interdisciplinary approach whereby two-way interactions and feedbacks between social and physical processes are explicitly accounted for (Di Baldassarre et al., 2014; 2015). Here we show an application of this approach with a focus on flood risk changes, and demonstrate its capability to capture and explain the dynamics emerging from socio-techno-nature interactions. Lastly, the potentials and limitations of the proposed approach to assess risk dynamics in a rapidly changing environment are critically discussed.",

However, development of the oil sands resource has led to increasing emission of nitrogen oxides, which are then returned to regional ecosystems as elevated atmospheric N deposition. Given the nutrient deficient nature of bogs and poor fens, elevated N deposition from oil sands development could potentially affect peatland ecosystem structure and function. To evaluate the ecosystem-level effects of N deposition, since 2011, we have experimentally applied N to a bog and a poor fen near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, located far enough from the OSAA to be unaffected by oil sands emissions. Treatments include simulated rainfall equivalent to N deposition of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg/ha/yr, plus control plots receiving no added water (3 replicate plots per site per N treatment). Concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3- N, and DON at the top of the peatland water table did not increase with increasing N deposition, averaging 0.61, 0.09, and 1.07 mg/L, respectively, in the bog, and 0.53, 0.10, and 0.81 mg/L, respectively, in the poor fen. Ericaceous shrub abundance increased with increasing N deposition in both the bog and the poor fen, although plot-scale greenness (hand-held spectral measurement of the Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE) index) increased with N deposition in the poor fen, but not in the bog. Segmented regression indicated that in the poor fen, at N deposition above 14-16 kg/ha/yr, total microbial, bacterial, and fungal biomass in the top 5 cm of peat increased with N deposition, with no effect at lower N deposition. No effect of N deposition on microbial, bacterial, or fungal biomass was observed at 5-10 cm in the poor fen, or at either 0-5 or 5-10 cm in the bog. In the poor fen, microbial, bacterial, and fungal biomass increased with NDRE, but the effect was not significant in the bog. These findings suggest that in the poor fen, N deposition may stimulate ericaceous shrub growth and growth of the microbial community in surface peat, either as a direct effect, or as an indirect effect of enhanced root growth. These responses were less apparent in the bog, suggesting that poor fens may be more responsive to elevated N deposition in the oil sands region.",

Their heterogeneous character, rapid flow through conduits, high permeability zones, and strong storage capacity in the rock porous-matrix pose a high risk of exposure over large areas and temporal scales. To achieve effective remedial actions for TCE removal, it is important to understand and quantify the fate and transport process of trichloroethylene in these systems. This research studies the fate, transport, and distribution of TCE Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) and associated dissolved species in KGWSs. Experiments are conducted in a karstified limestone physical model, a limestone rock mimicking a saturated confined karst aquifer. After injecting TCE solvent into a steady groundwater flow field, samples are taken spatially and temporally and analyzed for TCE NAPL and dissolved phases. Data analysis shows the rapid detection of TCE NAPL and high aqueous concentrations along preferential pathway, even at distances far away from the injection point. Temporal distribution curves exhibit spatial variations related to the limestone rock heterogeneity. Rapid response to TCE concentrations is associated with preferential flow paths. Slow response with long tailing indicates rate-limited diffusive transport in the rock matrix. Overall, results indicate that karstified limestone has a high capacity to rapidly transport pure and dissolved TCE along preferential flow paths, and to store and slowly release TCE over long periods of time.",

            "abstract": "The West Coast represents the longest coastline in North America, stretching from Panama all the way northward to the Aleutians. Key advances in the carbon cycling of this margin have been made since the North American Continental Margins report (Hales et al., 2008), notably the convergence of models and observations on air-sea fluxes; more sophisticated coastal carbon cycle models; and increased observational coverage in space and time, allowing for more data synthesis and model-data comparison. The coast was divided up into sub-regions based on differences in oceanographic drivers of coastal carbon cycling. Those sub-regions include the Gulf of Alaska, the Central American Isthmus, and the California Current System (CCS), which is further subdivided into northern, central, and southern sectors. The carbon budget for the Pacific Coast of North America identifies the best-known fluxes as the air-sea exchange of CO2 and terrestrial inputs. The least constrained fluxes include respiration, cross-shelf exchange, and carbon metabolism in estuaries. Spatial trends were typically consistent among models and observations, but the magnitude of the fluxes varied widely. While more modeling and observational studies exist than are presented here, relevant fluxes for the carbon budget were often unreported. In the long-term, investments in research and monitoring will be needed to better constrain the fluxes of many of the highly variable regions described in this study. In addition to the budget, this synthesis identifies gaps and priorities for future research.",

During this winter season, a large area of the eastern North Pacific Ocean had extremely high sea surface temperatures. These high sea surface temperatures influenced weather patterns on the west coast of North America producing very mild temperatures inland. Further, in alpine environments precipitation that normally arrives in the form of snow instead fell as rain. This research examines the climate characteristics of the winter of 2015 in greater detail for three ski resorts in British Columbia, Canada: Mount Washington, Cypress Mountain and Hemlock Valley. For these resorts, historical (1901 to 2013) and IPCC AR5 climate model forecasted climate data (RCP8.5 for 2025, 2055, and 2085) was generated for the variable winter degree days < 0°C (a measure of winter season coldness) using the spatially interpolated climate database ClimateBC. A value for winter degree days < 0°C was also estimated from recorded climate data at nearby meteorological stations for comparative analysis. For all three resorts, the winter of 2015 proved to be warmer than any individual year in the period 1901 to 2013. Interpolations involving the multi-model ensemble forecast means suggest that the climate associated with winter of 2015 will become the average normal for these resorts in only 35 to 45 years under the RCP8.5 emission scenario.",

They reduced this model to a two-dimensional equation of global mean temperature and a latitudinal ice-line. With this conceptual model, we now include dynamics of the ablation and accumulation of ice, to form a three-dimensional system that partitions the regions of the Earth latitudinally into an accumulation zone, ablation zone, and ice-free zone. Motivated by the findings of Abe-Ouchi et al that the fast retreat of ice-sheets is due to an increased rate of ablation via the effects of delayed isostatic rebound, we incorporate a simple switching mechanism to the model which increases the rate of ablation during periods of glacial retreat. This forms a discontinuous system of the Earth's temperature and ice-volume in which we find a stable periodic orbit. This can be interpreted as a intrinsic cycling of the Earth's climate in the absence of Milankovitch forcing.",

Sediments of the 3.2 Ga Fig Tree Group in the Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) represent first significant uplift after almost 300 Ma of tectonic quiescence during the Onverwacht time. The rocks are now exposed in isolated structural belts, which are separated by belts of faulted older Onverwacht and younger Moodies strata. A systematic comparative provenance study of Fig Tree Group utilizing sandstone petrography and detrital zircon geochronology assesses the evolution in the provenance of different isolated structural belts to test a possible correlation and evaluating the nature of tectonic uplifts that sourced the sediments. Samples were obtained from the ICDP drill cores BARB4 and BARB5 of the Mapepe Formation in the Manzimnyama Syncline (MS) and the Barite Valley (BV) structural belts, respectively.\nThe framework mode of the MS and basal BV sandstones represents a composite of common silicified BGB rocks. In contrast, sandstones from the middle and top of the BV are composed of exclusively sedimentary or intermediate volcanic rock fragments. They were derived locally by shallow erosion of immediately underlying sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Detrital zircon spectra show four main age clusters at 3.26-3.24, 3.00, 3.45, and 3.55 Ga. The 3.26-3.24, 3.45, and 3.55 Ga clusters correspond to major magmatic episodes of volcanism of the Fig Tree Group, as well as Hooggenoeg Formation (H6), and the Theespruit Formation, respectively. A cluster of Mendon Formation-age zircons at 3.30 Ga represents a source that has been eroded or is not exposed on the surface. MS sediments and basal BV sandstones were exclusively sourced from H6. Towards the middle of the BV section, sediments erodeds first into Mendon sediments, and then into Fig Tree Formation felsic volcanics.\nThe sandstones in the MS and BV structural belts represent first-cycle sediments derived from local uplifts of different parts of the greenstone sequence, as well as, penecontemporaneous volcanism. Different provenance signatures towards the stratigraphic middle and top in the MS and BV belts indicate distinct evolution in the source areas of these structural belts. Erosion did not reach deper-seated plutonic or metamorphic rocks.",

            "abstract": "Biomineralization of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as crystalline calcite or amorphous CaCO3 (ACC) occurs in the exoskeletons of all crustaceans. These cuticles are complex composites of inorganic mineral and organic macromolecules with highly divergent morphologies that are adapted to the extreme variations in environmental pressures within their diverse ecological niches. The remarkable variations and adaptations that form, infer a highly efficient and regulated mechanism for biomineralization that is most likely orchestrated by a myriad of biomacromolecules (Ziegler A 2012).\nThe roles of these peptides and organic metabolites during CaCO3 biomineralization are not well understood. In part, this is due to a lack of knowledge of crustacean homeostasis. In a step toward understanding cuticle mineralization in crustaceans, this study asks: Which molecules affect biomineralization? Do the biomineral-active molecules vary greatly between species and body parts? Recent studies of polysaccharide controls on mineralization also raise the question of whether small heterogeneities in chitin, the most abundant biopolymer of the composite, could be primarily responsible for differences in CaCO3 crystallinity.\nThis study used a novel spectroscopic approach to characterize the mineral and organic components of exoskeletons from three Malacostraca organisms — American Lobster (Homarus americanus), Dungeness Crab (Metacarcinus magister), and Red Rock Crab (Cancer productus). Using high-energy x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, the cuticles of three major body parts from these organisms were analyzed for the structure and bulk chemistry of its chitin and CaCO3 components. The findings indicate that Raman spectroscopy provides adequate resolution to show that crystallinity of chitin and the CaCO3 mineral component are chemically independent of each other, although their crystallinities co-vary for Brachyura species (Dungeness and Red Rock Crabs). Insights from this study suggest chitin provides the structural framework of the cuticle, without direct chemical control on the biomineralization of CaCO3. Peptides and small metabolites are likely to be more directly involved in the mechanisms controlling polymerization, crystallization, and composition of both chitin and CaCO3.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical proxies are increasingly being used to unravel ancient ecosystems and environmental perturbations back to the earliest rock record on Earth. Along with more traditional fossils (stromatolites) and other biosignatures (e.g., lipids), the geochemical record is used specifically to evaluate biogenecity and to understand oxygenation of the atmosphere and ocean in the Archean and Paleoproterozoic. However, the effects of diagenesis, metamorphism, and other modes of secondary alteration are still poorly constrained, particularly as technological advances allow us to expand farther across the periodic table.\nOur study focused on the robustness and preservation of rare earth element (REE) and Fe isotope compositions of two stromatolitic units that have undergone contact and regional metamorphism. 18 samples were collected from cores, open pit mines, and field locations in Minnesota and Ontario from silicified iron formation (Biwabik-Gunflint formations). The samples were carefully constrained to one of two meter-scale stromatolitic units. Metamorphic grade ranged from essentially unmetamorphosed through prehnite-pumpellyite up to amphibolite (fayalite+hypersthene). Samples were also collected that represented deep secondary weathering, likely related to Cretaceous climatic extremes.\nPolished samples were first analyzed by electron microprobe and selected samples were further analyzed via laser ablation HR-ICP-MS to constrain trace element (n=13) and Fe isotopic variations (n=8). Preliminary results indicate that transition metal concentrations are surprisingly resilient to high-temperature metamorphic recrystallization. REE concentrations were analyzed in individual iron oxide grains, with full resolution (La to Lu) achieved for some samples and partial resolution (La to Nd) achieved for all samples. Core samples exhibited a relatively stable positive Ce anomaly occurring from low to extremely high alteration. Outcrop and mine samples indicate a shift from a negative Ce anomaly in less altered samples, to a positive Ce anomaly in highly altered samples. Collectively, our results imply that caution is warranted when making paleo-environmental inferences from samples with significantly different alteration histories.",

            "abstract": "Boreal and arctic regions represent the largest reservoir of carbon among terrestrial biomes. Most of this carbon is stored deep in the soil in permafrost where frozen organic matter is protected from decomposition. The vulnerability of soil carbon stocks to a changing climate in high latitudes depends on a number of physical and ecological processes. The importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of soil carbon stocks vary across regions because of variability in vegetation composition, drainage condition, and permafrost characteristics.\nTo better understand the main drivers of the vulnerability of soil carbon stocks to climate change in Alaska, we ran a process-based ecosystem model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model. This model explicitly simulates interactions between the carbon cycle and permafrost dynamics and was coupled with a disturbance model and a model of biogenic methane dynamics to assess historical and projected soil carbon dynamics in Alaska, from 1950 to 2100.\nThe uncertainties related to climate, fire regime and atmospheric CO2projections on soil carbon dynamics were quantified by running simulations using climate projections from 2 global circulation models, 3 fossil fuel emission scenarios and 3 alternative fire management scenarios.\nDuring the historical period [1950-2009], soil carbon stocks increased by 4.7 TgC/yr in Alaska. Soil carbon stocks decreased in boreal Alaska due to substantial fire activity in the early 2000’s. This loss was offset by carbon accumulation in the arctic. Changes in soil carbon stocks from 2010 to 2099 ranged from 8.9 to 25.6 TgC/yr, depending on the climate projections. Soil carbon accumulation was slower in lowlands than in uplands and slower in the boreal than in the arctic regions because of the negative effect of fire activity on soil carbon stocks. Tundra ecosystems were more vulnerable to carbon loss from fire than forest ecosystems because of a lower productivity. As a result, the increase in fire frequency in Western Alaska induced a net soil carbon loss for half of the future climate projections.\nOverall, these results have implications for land management strategies and illustrate the importance of taking into account permafrost dynamics and disturbance regimes in assessing responses of soil carbon in high latitude ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU poster V8.pdf\nNovel trace gas sensors based on open-path Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy (CRDS) are being developed to enable remote and mobile deployments including on small unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Relative to established closed-path CRDS instruments, the use of open-path configurations allows removal of the bulky and power hungry vacuum and flow system, potentially enabling lightweight and low power instruments with high sensitivity. However, open path operation introduces new challenges including the need to maintain mirror cleanliness, mitigation of particle optical effects, and the need to measure spectral features that are relatively broad. The present submission details open-path CRDS instruments for ammonia and methane and their planned use in UAS studies. The ammonia sensor uses a quantum cascade laser at 10.3 mm in a configuration in which the laser frequency is continuously swept and a trigger circuit and acousto-optic modulator (AOM) extinguish the light when the laser is resonant with the cavity. Ring-down signals are measured with a two-stage thermoelectrically cooled MCT photodetector. The cavity mirrors have reflectivity of 0.9995 and a noise equivalent absorption of 1.5 ppb Hz-1/2 was demonstrated. A first version of the methane sensor operated at 1.7um with a telecom diode laser while the current version operates at 3.6 um with an interband cascade laser (stronger absorption). We have performed validation measurements against known standards for both sensors. Compact optical assemblies are being developed for UAS deployment. For example, the methane sensor head will have target mass of <4 kg and power draw <40 W. A compact single board computer and DAQ system is being designed for sensor control and signal processing with target mass <1 kg and power draw <10 W. The sensor size and power parameters are suitable for UAS deployment on both fixed wing and rotor style UAS. We plan to deploy the methane sensor to measure leakage and emission of methane from natural gas infrastructure, and to deploy both sensors together to study emissions from dairies and feedlots. The latter measurement campaign will also examine ammonia deposition to the ground, and bi-directional ammonia fluxes, using methane as a conservative tracer and examining the change in the ratio of ammonia to methane as a function of downwind position.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Broader Impacts of the Cascadia Initiative, a seismic study of the Cascadia margin, and the Magnetotelluric Observations of Cascadia using a Huge Array (MOCHA) collaboration we have developed school- and museum/library-based networks of TC-1 educational seismometers. The TC-1 is constructed such that its ‘guts’ are visible through an transparent acrylic outer cylinder, thus it is an excellent demonstration of how fundamental physics constructs can be leveraged to design and operate a vertical-channel seismometer capable of recording signals from large earthquakes world-wide. TC-1 (aka ‘slinky seismometer’) networks therefore serve as the application for projects-based learning (PBL) physics and data science instruction in Oregon and Thai classrooms.\nThe TC-1 acts as a simple harmonic oscillator, employing electromagnetic induction of a moving magnet within a wire coil. Movement of the lower magnet within an electrically conductive pipe dampens motion such that P-, S- and Surface wave phases can be identified. Further, jAmaSeis software can be configured to simultaneously show live signals from three TC-1s and has tools necessary to pick phases for earthquake signals and, thus, locate earthquake epicenters.\nLeveraging a long-standing collaboration between the Royal Thai Distance Learning Foundation and the University of Oregon, we developed five, 2-hour, two-way teacher professional development sessions that were transmitted live to Thai K-12 teachers and others starting mid-August, 2015. As an example, one session emphasized hands-on activities to analyze the effect of spring stiffness, inertial mass and initial displacement on the resonance frequency of a simple oscillator. Another pedagogical goal was to elucidate how math is important to understanding the analysis of seismic data, for example, how cross-correlation is useful for distinguishing between genuine earthquake signals and, say, a truck rolling by a TC-1 station. UO graduate and undergraduate physics majors played critical roles in this outreach effort. We will report on: lessons learned around developing and staging international outreach sessions; how outreach development impacted UO students; and how this teacher professional development was received by our Thai colleagues.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between channel bed morphology, flow conditions and sediment transport are important for a wide range of fluvial processes and practical applications. With increasing stream gradient, the bed morphology changes (from pool riffle, to step-pool and cascade morphology) and thus the transport characteristics of water and sediments also change.\nWe investigated bed roughness, flow velocity and sediment transport rates in a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream (Riedbach, Ct. Valais, Switzerland) with almost flume-like boundary conditions. The streambed gradient increases along the 1-km study reach by roughly one order of magnitude (S=3-41%), with a corresponding increase in streambed roughness, while flow discharge and width remain approximately constant due to the glacial runoff regime. Streambed roughness was determined by characteristic grain-sizes and point cloud surface parameters (semi-variogram, standard deviation) derived from terrestrial laser scanning. Reach-averaged flow velocities were derived from dye tracer breakthrough curves measured with 10 Fluorometers along the channel. Sediment transport rates were determined using “Bunte bedload traps” and the “Swiss plate geophone” system, respectively. Finally, the measurement values were compared with the predictions of commonly used flow resistance- and sediment transport equations.\nWe found that the mean flow velocity and the sediment transport rates remain approximately constant although the bed gradient increases by roughly one order of magnitude along the study reach. By accounting for the increasing bed roughness within the flow resistance and sediment transport equations, it was possible to explain the constancy of flow velocities and sediment transport rates with increasing bed gradients. This observation shows that flow resistance and sediment transport behavior across this large range of steep slopes agree with patterns established in previous studies for both lower-gradient and steep reaches and confirm the applicability of the equations also at very steep slopes.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster Furlanetto.pdf\nThe Wernecke Supergroup was deposited when the northwestern margin of Laurentia was undergoing major adjustments related to the assembly of the supercontinent Columbia (Nuna) in the late Paleoproterozoic. The succession was deposited between ca. 1663 and ca. 1620 Ma in two clastic to carbonate grand cycles. The detrital zircon population is bimodal, reflecting derivation from cratonic Laurentia. Basin shallowing at the end of the second grand cycle corresponds to a significant younging of detrital zircon populations. Specifically, the late Paleoproterozoic peak of zircon ages shifted from ca. 1900 Ma to ca. 1825 Ma, and the proportion of Archaean and early Paleoproterozoic zircon decreased. These shifts were caused by a change in drainage pattern in northern Laurentia during an early phase of the Forward orogeny, farther inland. The orogeny also led to inversion of the broadly correlative Hornby Bay Group. Zircon younger than 1.75 Ga is present throughout the sedimentary succession and may have originated from small igneous suites in northern Laurentia or larger magmatic arc terranes of the Yavapai and early Mazatzal orogenies in southern Laurentia. Eastern and southern Australia and the intervening Bonnetian arc may have contributed. The Wernecke Supergroup shares similar detrital zircon age and Nd isotope signatures with the Hornby Bay, Muskwa, Athabasca and Thelon successions of Canada; the Tarcoola Formation, Willyama Supergroup, and Isan Supergroup of Australia; and of the Dongchuan-Dahongshan-Hondo successions of South China. These similarities are compelling evidence for a shared depositional system in the late Paleoproterozoic. Western Columbia may have had a dynamic SWEAT-like configuration with Australia, East Antarctica and South China moving in a complex manner near the margin of western Laurentia. All of the continents except for South China underwent post-Wernecke tectonism during the Racklan, Forward, Olarian, Isan, Mazatzal and related orogenies, ca. 1.6-1.5 Ga.",

Vertically resolved aerosol backscatter profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission and extinction profiles from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) have been used to infer the spatial and temporal distributions of the ATAL since the late 90’s. We found that aerosol optical thickness between 13-18km have increased by a factor of 2-3 over the past 16 years likely related to raising pollution levels in South East Asia occuring during the same period. Modelling studies of the ATAL using WACCAM 3 and GEOS-Chem have provided conflicting information on its origin and a better representation of in-cloud SO2 and aerosol lifetime in GOES-Chem seems to be key to obtain consistent results with the few SO2 measurements available in the UTLS during the Asian Monsoon. In situ measurements of aerosol and trace gases in the UTLS from several balloon campaigns which took place in summer 2014 and 2015 in Asia will be presented and discussed with combined satellite and modelling analysis.",

Scientific drilling and coring is crucial for the advancement of the Earth Sciences, unlocking new frontiers in the geologic record. Open Core Data will utilize and link existing data systems, services, and expertise of the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO), the Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO), the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) data facility, and the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (OL). Open Core Data will leverage efforts currently taking place under the EarthCube GeoLink Building Block and other previous efforts in Linked Open Data around ocean drilling data coordinated by OL.\nThe OCD architecture for data distribution blends Linked Data Platform approaches with web services and schema.org use. OCD will further enable integration and tool development by assigning and using vocabularies, provenance, and unique IDs (DOIs, IGSN, URIs) in scientific drilling resources.\nA significant focus of this effort is to enable large scale automated access to the data by domain specific communities such as MagIC and Neotoma. Providing them a process to integrate the facility data into their data models, workflows and tools. This aspect will encompass methods to maintain awareness of authority information enabling users to trace data back to the originating facility.\nInitial work on OCD is taking place under a supplemental awarded to IEDA.

            "abstract": "The terrestrial carbon cycle plays a critical role in regulating the amount of anthropogenic emissions that remain in the atmosphere. Yet, land-atmosphere carbon dynamics are one of the largest sources of uncertainty in projections of future climate. Reducing this uncertainty requires understanding the relative role of various drivers to land carbon uptake. We use an ensemble of land surface models to quantify the influence of climate, land use history, atmospheric CO2, and nitrogen deposition on the strength of the net land sink over the past 110 years. Each model can be thought of as one realization of terrestrial carbon cycling and the factors most important in controlling land sink strength. Using a series of sensitivity simulations, we identify the dominant drivers to the net land sink that emerge consistently across models, both globally and regionally. We find that the relative importance of external forcing factors on the strength of net land carbon uptake varies considerably across models and depends strongly on whether nitrogen cycling is explicitly simulated. Models without a nitrogen cycle estimate cumulative land carbon uptake (since 1959) that is 3 times greater (93.3 ± 84.1 PgC) than global mass balance constraints (34.6 ± 41.6 PgC). Surprisingly, the greatest impacts are seen in the tropics, where coupled carbon-nitrogen cycle models estimate CO2 fertilization and climate affects that are ~60% weaker than models without a nitrogen cycle. The results highlight the importance of model structure on the inferred sensitivity of land carbon uptake to external forcing factors. The range in sensitivity across models is important for future climate projections since the differences in the processes that explain trends in net land sink strength between models with and without nitrogen dynamics can lead to very different future trajectories of atmospheric CO2 and thus climate.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining precise and accurate dates at archaeological sites beyond the range of radiocarbon dating is challenging but essential for understanding human origins. Eggshells of ratites (large flightless birds including ostrich, emu and others) are common in many archaeological sequences in Africa, Australia and elsewhere. Ancient eggshells are geochemically suitable for the U-Th technique (1), which has about ten times the range of radiocarbon dating (>500 rather than 50 ka), making eggshells attractive dating targets. Moreover, C and N isotopic studies of eggshell provide insights into paleovegetation and paleoprecipitation central to assessing past human-environment interactions (2,3). But until now, U-Th dates on ratite eggshell have not accounted for the secondary origin of essentially all of their U. We report a novel approach to U-Th dating of eggshell that explicitly accounts for secondary U uptake that begins with burial.\nUsing ostrich eggshell (OES) from Pleistocene-Holocene east African sites, we have measured U and 232Th concentration profiles across OES by laser ablation ICP-MS. U commonly peaks at 10s to 100s of ppb and varies 10-fold or more across the ~2 mm thickness of OES, with gradients modulated by the layered structure of the eggshell. Common Th is high near the shell surfaces, but low in the middle “pallisade” layer of OES, making it optimal for U-Th dating. We determine U-Th ages along the U concentration gradient by solution ICP-MS analyses of two or more fractions of the pallisade layer. We then estimate OES burial dates using a simple model for diffusive uptake of uranium. Comparing such “U-Th burial dates” with radiocarbon dates for OES calcite from the same shells, we find good agreement in 7 out of 9 cases, consistent with rapid burial and confirming the accuracy of the approach. The remaining 2 eggshells have anomalous patterns of apparent ages that reveal they are unsuitable for U-Th dating, thereby providing reliability criteria innate to the U-Th data. The oldest OES we have analyzed yields a U-Th burial date of ~140 ka, indicating that U-Th burial dating of OES may be applicable throughout the Late Pleistocene.\n1. Magee, J.W. et al.

            "abstract": "Determining the initial conditions for predictive models remains a challenge due to the uncertainty in measurement/identification of the state variables at the scale of interest. However, the characterization of uncertainty in initial conditions has arguably attracted less attention compared with other sources of uncertainty in hydrologic modelling (e.g, parameter, data, and structural uncertainty). This is perhaps because it is commonly believed that: (1) hydrologic systems (relatively rapidly) forget their initial conditions over time, and (2) other sources of uncertainty (e.g., in data) are dominant.\nThis presentation revisits the basic principles of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems in the context of hydrologic systems. Through simple example case studies, we demonstrate how and under what circumstances different hydrologic processes represent a range of attracting limit sets in their evolution trajectory in state space over time, including fixed points, limit cycles (periodic behaviour), torus (quasi-periodic behaviour), and strange attractors (chaotic behaviour). Furthermore, the propagation (or dissipation) of uncertainty in initial conditions of several hydrologic models through time, under any of the possible attracting limit sets, is investigated. This study highlights that there are definite situations in hydrology where uncertainty in initial conditions remains of significance. The results and insights gained have important implications for hydrologic modelling under non-stationarity in climate and environment.",

            "abstract": "Autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration are large components of the terrestrial C cycle, yet are among the most poorly constrained fluxes in C budgets. We partitioned the soil CO2 flux into its respective Ra and Rh components in an old growth, temperate-boreal forest (Howland Forest AmeriFlux site in Maine, USA). We used two different partitioning methods combined with automated chamber measurements of the soil CO2 flux: (1) a classic root trenching experiment and (2) an isotopic mass balance approach, using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike. We then assessed the “value” of the soil CO2 flux data and partitioning results as observational constraints for simulating current and future C fluxes and stocks using a simple ecosystem model (FöBAAR) and a model-data fusion approach.\nWe found generally greater Rh with the trenching experiment and greater Ra with the 14C approach. Over the growing season, Rh accounted for 53 ± 11% of the total soil CO2 flux in the trenching experiment, while the mean Rh from the four 14C sampling time points was 42 ± 9%.\nFor both current and future model runs, incorporating the partitioning data as constraints reduced the uncertainties of Ra and Rh fluxes by at least 60% (and as much as 85%) compared to the model runs where only the soil CO2 fluxes were used as constraints. Moreover, with best-fit model parameters, the two partitioning methods yielded fundamentally different estimates of the relative contributions of Ra and Rh to total soil CO2 flux. Surprisingly, however, modeled soil C and biomass C pool trajectories did not differ significantly between model runs, indicating that the model parameters compensated for these differences in partitioning with changes in allocation and decomposition rates.\nOur findings show that incorporating constraints on the partitioning of soil CO2 flux dramatically reduces model uncertainties; however, the results are sensitive to the method used, and the impact on modeled pool sizes may be small.",

            "abstract": "Rifted continental margins share a transition from a thickened crust to thinned transitional crust that can span either modest (i.e. 10’s of km) to large (i.e. 100’s of km) distances. A longstanding question surrounding rifted margins concerns how the fault-restored extension in the upper crust from fault-heave measurements does not match that expected from crustal thinning observed in seismic data or thinning factors calculated using uniform pure-shear subsidence models, the so-called “extension discrepancy”. Here, we revisit this issue at the lithosphere scale drawing on recently completed numerical results. We extract thinning profiles from four end-member geodynamic models with varying width and asymmetry, and propose tectonic models that best explain those results. Moreover, we relate the spatial and temporal evolution of crustal thinning to mantle thinning, something difficult to achieve only by using observations due to the lack of geologic relationships that constrain thinning at different stages between continental rift and lithospheric breakup. Our results support the hypothesis that the upper to lower crust extension discrepancy is overestimated because of the difficulty to recognize both polyphase sequential faulting, and detachment faults in seismic data. But, more importantly, the results support that depth-dependent stretching is likely to predominate at specific stages of rift evolution because crustal and mantle thinning distributions are not always spatially coincident, and at times are not even balanced by an equal magnitude of thinning in two-dimensions. Thus, depth-dependent stretching is an important controlling factor on rifted margins evolution, but not in the manner historically proposed, and its implications in subsidence and thermal histories of margins will likely require integrating results of geodynamic models into kinematic subsidence and heat flow studies.",

The SMR simulations have varying sizes of the statically refined meshes (geometry-based) while the AMR simulations use a potential vorticity (PV) threshold to adaptively refine the mesh to the evolving TC. Numerical simulations are conducted for four cases: (i) TC-like vortex advecting in a uniform flow, (ii) binary vortex interaction, (iii) barotropic instability of a PV ring, and (iv) barotropic instability of a thin strip of PV. For each case, a high resolution “truth” simulation is compared to two different SMR simulations and three different AMR simulations for accuracy and efficiency. The multiple SMR and AMR simulations have variations in the number of fully-refined elements in the vicinity of the TC. For these idealized cases, it is found that the SMR and AMR simulations are able to resolve the vortex dynamics as well as the “truth” runs, with no significant loss in accuracy in the refined region in the vortex vicinity and with significant speed-ups (factor of 2-5). The overall accuracy is enhanced by a greater area of fully refined mesh in both the SMR and AMR simulations. While these results are highly idealized, they demonstrate the potential for static and adaptive mesh refinement for the numerical simulation of TCs in three dimensions and more complex models.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite was successfully launched on January 31, 2015. It carries an L-band radar and L-band radiometer that provide global radar backscatter and brightness temperature measurements every 2-3 days. SMAP retrieves the soil moisture content of the upper ~5 cm of soil with three different retrieval methods and inherent spatial resolutions: passive (L2/3_SM_P at 36 km), active (L2/3_SM_A at 3 km), and active/passive (L2/3_SM_AP at 9 km). Besides their distinct spatial resolutions, the three soil moisture products have other varying attributes that depend on the inputs to geophysical inversion, sensitivity to soil moisture, and the general retrieval approach.\nCalibration and validation of the data products are critical to provide the accuracy assessments and credibility required for widespread product usage. These assessments include quantitative estimates of uncertainty based on direct comparisons with independent measurements. SMAP will use a wide range of methodologies in calibrating and validating the mission science products including in situ soil moisture networks, satellite products, model-based products and measurements in field experiments.\nIn this presentation, we focus on the comparison of the SMAP L2/3 soil moisture products with other satellite products including primarily SMOS and Aquarius, to understand the similarities and differences and to thereby potentially improve the performance of the SMAP science algorithms. The SMAP mission is linked by a common L-band frequency with the SMOS and Aquarius missions, and by its soil moisture products with the GCOM-W and ASCAT missions that operate at higher frequencies. These satellite missions produce operational soil moisture products that overlap in time and space with SMAP. The comparison will be conducted with close attention to limiting factors such as the quality of the alternative products, differences in overpass times, instrument resolution, operating frequencies, and differences in retrieval algorithms. The results of the comparison and an evaluation of the lessons learned will be presented at the talk.",

            "abstract": "The fjords of Southeast-Greenland are among the most remote areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Access to this area is hampered by a broad belt of sea ice floating along the East-Greenland coast from North to South. Consequently, the majority of those fjords have never been surveyed in detail until now. During an expedition by the Center of GeoGenetics of the University of Copenhagen in summer of 2014 we were able to map the Skjoldungen Fjord system with multibeam bathymetry. The topsail schooner ACTIV, built 1951 as a cargo ship to supply remote settlements in Greenland was chosen for the expedition. Though a vintage vessel, the ACTIV was well suited to cross the belt of sea ice and to cruise the ice covered fjords. A portable ELAC-Seabeam 1050 multibeam system was temporarily installed on the vessel. The two transducer of the system were mounted at the lower end of a 6 m long pole attached outboard at port side to the hull of the vessel. Though the installation was quite demanding without any winches or cranes, the construction was sufficiently stable and easy to manage throughout the entire cruise.\nNearly the entire fjord system, leaving only a small gap of 5 km at the innermost part and small stripes close to the shorelines could be surveyed during the cruise. For the first time, a comprehensive map of Skjoldungen Fjord is now available. The map displays water depths from close to zero up to 800 m, the deepest part along a stretch of about 10 km in the Southwest. The bathymetry of the northern fjord is remarkably different from the southern fjord: the southern fjord features an outer deep part showing water depths between 500 m and 800 m and a shallow inner part with depths less than 300 m and a prominent sill in between. The northern fjord shows a more gradual increase of water depths from 200 m in the inner part to 600 m at the entrance.",

            "abstract": "The winters from 2013-2015 had exceptionally low snow-packs in much of western North America. In particular, the winter of 2014/2015 had the lowest peak snow-water-equivalent (SWE) depths ever recorded in many areas of the Pacific Northwest. These low snow-packs have contributed to drought conditions from British Columbia to California. Along with the low SWE values, the snow covered area (SCA) of the previous two winters has been a significant departure from normal conditions. SCA is related to SWE, rain-on-snow events and the seasonal water supply, provides insulation for plant root systems from late season frost, and is an important factor in forest fire hazard, delaying the start of soil and fuel drying. Remote sensing can be a useful tool to monitor SCA over large regions, with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments providing a suitable temporal (twice daily), and spatial resolution (500m) to create detailed maps, even with high frequencies of cloud covered days. While comparison of SWE at snow monitoring sites to historical values is a standard analysis, doing the same for SCA has been difficult due to the technical and logistical problems related to processing the large amounts of spatial data required to determine a 'normal' annual SCA cycle. Through the use of new cloud-based computation methods from Google Earth Engine, we have calculated the monthly median (from 2002-2015) MODIS SCA, at a 500 m resolution, for all of the major Pacific draining watersheds of North America. Determining the 'normal' SCA cycle of the past 13 years allowed us to compare the past two winters to the median SCA levels, showing which basins have seen the most significant departures from normal SCA levels. Results indicate more significant departures from normal in basins with significant maritime-influenced snow-packs.",

Climate change is expected to contribute to increased variability of river runoff due to changes in the climatic variables as well as the melting of snow glaciers. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underpinnings of hydro-climatic variability in order to assess the effects of climate changes. This study therefore provides the analysis of observed variability and change in temperature, precipitation, snow cover and its response to streamflow of Langtang River Basin of Nepal. Langtang River basin which lies in Langtang Valley of Rasuwa district is glacier-fed and provides sustained flow during dry seasons to fulfill the water requirements for downstream.The observed hydro-meteorological data for the period 1988 to 2009 was used for this study.\nTrend analysis of temperature data using non parametric Mann-Kendall test revealed that there is increasing trend of temperature and was more pronounced in winter season (December, January, February). Also observation shows that the total number of days per year below 0oC has been decreasing. Similarly, total annual precipitation showed increasing trend but have large interannual variation. Pre monsoon, post monsoon and winter precipitation also showed increasing trend whereas the monsoon precipitation was observed to have decreasing trend. Monsoon precipitation in the region amounts 84.78% of total annual precipitation. Snow cover area (2002-2014) examined using the data acquired from MODIS snow data showed decreasing trend. Seasonal variation in the snow cover with two peaks in most of the years is observed. This variation is explained by temporal variation of temperature and precipitation. The annual stream flow showed decreasing trend. The streamflow at monsoon and post monsoon seasons were found to be decreasing and winter and pre monsoon streamflow showed increasing trend. The streamflow was observed to start increasing in June and reach peak in July and August. In the post-monsoon period and winter, snowmelt contribution to the total discharge is large. This study would be useful in understanding how the hydrological regime has been changing with climate change in mountainous watershed and would be helpful for water resources management.",

River intakes used to divert water from the main course to the power plant are at the base of such practice. A key issue concern with finding innovative concepts to both design and manage such structures in order to improve classic operational rules. Among these, the Minimal Flow Release (MFR) concept has long been used in spite of its environmental inconsistency.\nIn this work, we show that the economical and ecological efficiency of diverting water for energy production in small hydropower plants can be improved towards sustainability by engineering a novel class of flow-redistribution policies. We use the mathematical form of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution to define non-proportional dynamic flow-redistribution rules, which broadens the spectrum of dynamic flow releases based on proportional redistribution. The theoretical background as well as the economic interpretation is presented and applied to three case studies in order to systematically test the global performance of such policies. Out of numerical simulations, a Pareto frontier emerges in the economic vs environmental efficiency plot, which show that non-proportional distribution policies improve both efficiencies with respect to those obtained from some traditional MFR and proportional policies. This picture is shown also for long term climatic scenarios affecting water availability and the natural flow regime.\nIn a time of intense and increasing exploitation close to resource saturation, preserving natural river reaches requires to abandon inappropriate static release policies in favor of non-proportional ones towards a sustainable use of the water resource.",

            "abstract": "Environmental research infrastructures and big data integration networks require common data policies, standardized workflows and sophisticated e-infrastructure to optimise the data life cycle. This presentation summarizes the experiences in developing the data life cycle for the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), a European Research Infrastructure. It will also outline challenges that still exist and visions for future development.\nAs many other environmental research infrastructures ICOS RI built on a large number of distributed observational or experimental sites. Data from these sites are transferred to Thematic Centres and quality checked, processed and integrated there. Dissemination will be managed by the ICOS Carbon Portal. This complex data life cycle has been defined in detail by developing protocols and assigning responsibilities.\nSince data will be shared under an open access policy there is a strong need for common data citation tracking systems that allow data providers to identify downstream usage of their data so as to prove their importance and show the impact to stakeholders and the public.\nMore challenges arise from interoperating with other infrastructures or providing data for global integration projects as done e.g. in the framework of GEOSS or in global integration approaches such as fluxnet or SOCAt. Here, common metadata systems are the key solutions for data detection and harvesting. The metadata characterises data, services, users and ICT resources (including sensors and detectors). Risks may arise when data of high and low quality are mixed during this process or unexperienced data scientists without detailed knowledge on the data aquisition derive scientific theories through statistical analyses.\nThe vision of fully open data availability is expressed in a recent GEO flagship initiative that will address important issues needed to build a connected and interoperable global network for carbon cycle and greenhouse gas observations and aims to meet the most urgent needs for integration between different information sources and methodologies, between different regional networks and from data providers to users.\n ",

            "abstract": "Shifts in ecological communities in response to environmental change have implications for biodiversity, ecosystem function, and feedbacks to global climate change. Community composition is fundamentally the product of demography, but demographic processes are simplified or missing altogether in many ecosystem, Earth system, and species distribution models. This limitation arises in part because demographic data are noisy and difficult to synthesize. As a consequence, demographic processes are challenging to formulate in models in the first place, and to verify and constrain with data thereafter. Here, we used a novel analysis of the USFS Forest Inventory Analysis to improve the representation of demography in an ecosystem model. First, we created an Empirical Succession Mapping (ESM) based on ~1 million individual tree observations from the eastern U.S. to identify broad demographic patterns related to forest succession and disturbance. We used results from this analysis to guide reformulation of the Ecosystem Demography model (ED), an existing forest simulator with explicit tree demography.\nResults from the ESM reveal a coherent, cyclic pattern of change in temperate forest tree size and density over the eastern U.S. The ESM captures key ecological processes including succession, self-thinning, and gap-filling, and quantifies the typical trajectory of these processes as a function of tree size and stand density. Recruitment is most rapid in early-successional stands with low density and mean diameter, but slows as stand density increases; mean diameter increases until thinning promotes recruitment of small-diameter trees. Strikingly, the upper bound of size-density space that emerges in the ESM conforms closely to the self-thinning power law often observed in ecology. The ED model obeys this same overall size-density boundary, but overestimates plot-level growth, mortality, and fecundity rates, leading to unrealistic emergent demographic patterns. In particular, the current ED formulation cannot capture steady state dynamics evident in the ESM. Ongoing efforts are aimed at reformulating ED to more closely approach overall forest dynamics evident in the ESM, and then assimilating inventory data to constrain model parameters and initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "Thermo-erosion from abrupt permafrost thaw is a key pulse disturbance in the Arctic that may impact the global carbon cycle. Abrupt thaw can occur when the permafrost active layer expands in response to climate warming and/or increased wildfire activity. Understanding these drivers of thermo-erosion is necessary to anticipate feedbacks in the Arctic, where summer temperature and fire frequency are predicted to increase. We examine modern and late-Holocene thermo-erosion in high-fire (Noatak) and low-fire (North Slope) tundra ecoregions of Alaska using a combination of remote-sensing and paleo-records. Lakes with active thaw features were identified through Landsat-7 image classification and time-series analysis based on observed 0.52-0.60 μm reflectance peaks following slump formation. We identified 1067 and 1705 lakes with active features between CE 2000-2012 in the Noatak and North Slope ecoregions, respectively. The density of features was higher in the highly flammable Noatak (0.04 versus 0.01 features km-2, respectively), suggesting that warmer climate and/or fires likely promote high thermo-erosional activity at present. To assess modern signals of thermo-erosion and identify past events, we analyzed soil profiles and lake-sediment cores from both ecoregions using X-ray fluorescence. The ratios of Ca:K and Ca:Sr increased with depth in permafrost soils, were higher in soils from younger versus older slump surfaces, and were significantly correlated with the ratio of carbonate to feldspar and clay minerals in lake sediments (r=0.96 and 0.93, P<0.0001, n=15). We interpret past increases in Ca:K, Ca:Sr, and δ13C as enhanced weathering of carbonate-rich permafrost soils associated with thermo-erosion. At the North Slope site, we identified ten episodes of thermoerosion over the past 6000 years and found strong correspondence to summer temperature trends. Events were more frequent at the Noatak site, where 15 thermo-erosional episodes and 26 fires occurred over the past 4000 years. Superposed epoch analysis shows a significant response (90% CI) of Ca:K to catchment fires within 45-50 years, suggesting that fires promote positive feedbacks that facilitate thermo-erosion. Our results suggest that tundra fire regimes may play a key role in Arctic permafrost dynamics as climate continues to warm.",

            "abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems rely on complex interactions between biological, biogeochemical, and physical processes to ensure their survival and resilience. However, both human interaction and anthropogenic climate change have negatively impacted the prosperity of these regions, resulting in a crucial need to understand and predict the future of important biogeochemical and physical stressors. Contemporary changes to these relationships and environmental conditions in coral reef ecosystems are a mixture of anthropogenic contributions and natural variability (e.g. ENSO) of the climate system. To better quantify the uncertainty in future projections, it is exceedingly necessary to differentiate between these two contributors. In this study we look at acidification and warming stressors in the Galapagos, Coral Triangle, and Hawaiian islands regions. We use a suite of hindcast simulations (a 30-member large initial condition ensemble) done with an Earth Systems Model (GFDL-ESM2M) in order quantify the degree to which natural variability alters the emergence time-scales of anthropogenically-induced changes to ecosystem drivers such as pH, ΩArag, and SST. A comparison of output from a suit of CMIP5 models will be used to evaluate model uncertainty for the same regions. Simulated trends and variability in these ecosystem drivers were then compared to observed trends over the three Pacific regions. Evidently the models and observed trends proved invaluable for testing the hypothesis addressing the presence of a temporal hierarchy between emergence, defined by a signal-to-noise ratio, of acidification stressors and temperature as a stressor. Furthermore, challenges in deconvolving anthropogenic and natural contributions to stressor trends will be discussed for each of the three sites.",

            "abstract": "The idea that extrasolar planets should emit radiation in the low-frequency radio regime is a generalization of the observation of decametric and kilometric radio emissions from magnetic planets in our own solar system, yet none of these emissions have been observed. Such radio emissions are a result of the interactions between the host star’s magnetized wind and the planet’s magnetosphere that accelerate electrons along the field lines, which leads to radio emissions at the electron gyrofrequency. To understand why these emissions had not yet been observed, and to guide in target selection for future detection efforts, we took a statistical approach to determine what the ideal location in parameter space was for these hypothesized exoplanetary radio emissions to be detected.\nWe derived probability distribution functions from current datasets for the observably constrained parameters (such as the radius of the host star), and conducted a review of the literature to construct reasonable probability distribution functions to obtain the unconstrained parameters (such as the magnetic field strength of the exoplanet). We then used Monte Carlo sampling to develop a synthetic population of exoplanetary systems and calculated whether the radio emissions from the systems were detectable depending on the angle of beaming, frequency (above the ionospheric cutoff rate of 10 MHz) and flux density (above 5 mJy) of the emission. From millions of simulations we derived a probability distribution function in parameter space as a function of host star type, orbital radius and planetary or host star radius. The probability distribution function illustrated the optimal parameter values of an exoplanetary system that may make the system’s radio emissions detectable to current and currently under development instruments such as the SKA.\nWe found that detection of exoplanetary radio emissions favor planets larger than 5 Earth radii and within 1 AU of their M dwarf host.",

            "abstract": "The rate of bed load transport under steady flow is known to vary both spatially and temporally due to various hydrologic and granular phenomena. Grain size distributions and riverbed properties (packing, imbrication, etc.) are known to affect flux for a particular value of applied flow stress, while hydrology is mainly assumed to control the magnitude of the applied bed stress above the threshold for bed material entrainment. The prediction of bed load sediment transport in field settings is further complicated by the inherent transience in flood hydrology, but little is known about how such flood transience influences bed load flux over a range of applied bed stress. Here we investigate the role of flood transience for gravel bed load transport through controlled laboratory experiments in a 28 m long 0.5 meter wide flume. We explore transient flow as the combination of unsteady and intermittent flow, where unsteady flow varies in magnitude over a given duration, and intermittent flow is characterized by turning the flow on and off. We systematically vary these details of flood hydrographs from one experiment to the next, and monitor the bed load as it varies with water discharge in real time by measuring sediment flux and tracking particles. We find that even with a narrow unimodal grain size distribution and constant sediment supply we observe hysteresis in bed load flux, different thresholds for entrainment and distrainment for the rising and falling limbs of a flood, and a threshold of entrainment that can vary one flood hydrograph to the next. Despite these complex phenomena we find that the total bed load transported for each flood plots along a linear trend with the integrated excess stress, consistent with prior field results. These results suggest that while the effects of transient flow and the shape of the hydrograph are measurable, they are second-order compared to the integrated excess stress.",

At the undergraduate and graduate level today, most programs do a good job of this preparation, and employers are finding qualified applicants. However, with workforce needs in the geosciences projected to steadily outstrip supply in coming decades, and with many employers having to do substantial additional training on arrival for new hires, research informing curriculum design and skills development needs to be a priority. The projected retirement of seasoned professionals exacerbates this need and underscores the need to better understand the nature and structure of geoscience skills and competencies at the expert level.\n A workshop on Synthesizing Geoscience Education Research at the inaugural Earth Educator’s Rendezvous began work on assembling a community-wide inventory of research progress. Groups began an assessment of our understanding of key skills in the geosciences as well as curricular approaches to maximize teaching effectiveness and recruitment and retention. It is clear that we have made basic progress on understanding spatial and temporal thinking, as well as systems thinking and geologic problem solving. However, most of this research is in early stages, limited to local populations, disciplines or contexts. Curricular innovations in the integration of quantitative, field-specific and computational techniques are also mostly local or limited in scope. Many programs also locally incorporate an explicit non-technical component, e.g. writing, business, and legal content or experience in team-based project-driven work.\nDespite much good practitioner wisdom, and a small but growing research base on effectiveness and best practices, we have much yet to learn about geoscience education, especially at the graduate and professional level. We remain far from a universal understanding of these skills and competencies, let alone how they should be most effectively taught to all geoscience students. We do understand universal geoscience skills and competencies better than ever before, but as a community we have a long way yet to go to construct and implement a broad strategy for meeting the geoscience workforce needs for the decades ahead.",

The dynamics of such flows can be studied experimentally at conditions inaccessible to computational modeling. However, accurately measuring the mean and time-varying flows noninvasively presents a technical challenge, particularly in opaque liquids. In this study, we tackle the problem of mapping zonal flow profiles in spherical Couette flows, shear flows in a core-like geometry. These rotating flows induce shifts and splittings in the spectrum of the acoustically resonant fluid-filled cavity. The azimuthal component of flow can be estimated from the spectra of the acoustic modes, using inversion procedures adapted from Helioseismology.\nHere, we present a technique for reconstructing the mean velocity field using modal analysis by way of the Finite Element Method, which is used to compute the forward model accurately, taking into account structural geometries associated with the experimental setups, such as shafts and axles. Accurate forward modeling is crucial for reliable mode identification, and we demonstrate that it allows us to identify many more modes than is possible when using the spherically symmetric approximation. We model flow geometry as a superposition of low order basis flow patterns, each of which affects mode frequency splittings and shifts through advection and Coriolis forces.",

            "abstract": "Mudrocks and shales are currently a significant source of natural gas and understanding the basic transport properties of these formations is critical to predicting long-term production, however, the nanoporous nature of mudrocks presents a unique challenge. Mudrock pores are predominantly in the range of 1-100 nm, and within this size range the flow of gas at reservoir conditions will fall within the slip-flow and early transition-flow regime (0.001 < Kn < 1.0). Therefore, flow-rates will significantly deviate from Navier-Stokes predictions. Currently, the study of slip-flows is mostly limited to simple tube and channel geometries, but the geometry of mudrock pores is often sponge-like (organic matter) and/or platy (clays). Here we present a local effective viscosity lattice Boltzmann model (LEV-LBM) constructed for flow simulation in the slip- and early-transition flow regimes, adapted here for complex geometries. At the macroscopic scale the LEV-LBM is parameterized with local effective viscosities at each node to capture the variance of the mean free path of gas molecules in a bounded system. The LEV-LBM is first validated in simple tube geometries, where excellent agreement with linearized Boltzmann solutions is found for Knudsen numbers up to 1.0. The LEV-LBM is then employed to quantify the length effect on the apparent permeability of tubes, which suggests pore network modeling of flow in the slip and early-transition regime will result in overestimation unless the length effect is considered. Furthermore, the LEV-LBM is used to evaluate the predictive value of commonly measured pore geometry characteristics such as porosity, pore size distribution, and specific solid surface area for the calculation of permeability. We show that bundle of tubes models grossly overestimate apparent permeability, as well as underestimate the increase in apparent permeability with decreasing pressure as a result of excluding topology and pore shape from calculations.",

            "abstract": "Debate over characterization of the transport mechanism(s) of long-runout landslide deposits, specifically the role of water or fluids in their initiation and transport, has occurred over the past several decades. Using the Elm, Blackhawk, Sherman, and Martian landslides as examples, turbulent grain flow, air-layer lubrication, mechanical fluidization, basal lubrication, and acoustic fluidization have been proposed as emplacement mechanisms. A key component missing from this body of work is an in-depth geological analysis of a well-preserved and well-exposed long-runout landslide deposit. Here, we analyze in detail the geomorphology and structure of a long-runout landslide in southeastern Eureka Valley, California in order to constrain the previously proposed hypotheses for mechanisms of long-runout landslide emplacement. Based on integrated field, photogeologic, spectral, and luminescence dating investigations of the extremely well-preserved Eureka Valley landslide deposit, we interpret its initiation to be the result of normal-fault-generated fracture in the Upper Cambrian strata of the bounding Last Chance Range western margin. The long-distance transport of the Eureka Valley landslide is proposed to be translational and likely due to lubrication of the fluidized landslide mass through the presence of basal clays, which resulted in 3D simple shear internal deformation within the landslide sheet. Post-emplacement, the landslide deposit is interpreted to have undergone fluvial modification and rotation. We determine the minimum landslide emplacement age and the maximum age of post-emplacement rotation to be early to mid Holocene (8275 +/- 300 yr BP to 9465 +/- 380 yr BP). Our analysis of features related to long-distance transport may be applied to other long-runout landslides with similar morphologies, including those on other planetary surfaces, providing continued insight into these prominent yet enigmatic natural hazards.",

Supraglacial rivers are important for estimating surface water storage and transport into moulins and into the en-, sub-, and proglacial environments. Yet, little is known about their role in the GrIS cryo-hydrologic system. To that end, supraglacial river discharge in a large river, the “Rio Behar” (67.05°, -49.02°; ~75 km from the Kangerlussuaq International Airport), was measured in situ over 300 times: approximately four times per hour over three consecutive days from July 19 – 22, 2015. The Rio Behar drains a ~ 70 km2 ice catchment and enters a large moulin in the Watson River land-ice watershed in western Greenland. River discharge was measured using a Sontek M9 Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Each profile records water temperature, depth-integrated velocity, channel width and channel bathymetry. This novel dataset can be used to assess diurnal variations in river discharge, slope, velocity, stream power, and channel incision in order to enhance process-level understanding of GrIS meltwater routing, storage and transport. Future work will compare supraglacial river discharge in the Rio Behar with in situ estimates of proglacial river outflow upstream of the Watson River bridge in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.",

How an earthquake would have been associated with long-range effect on geological environment of deep groundwater is a question of interest to the scientific community and general public. The massive Richter 8.1 Nepal Earthquake (on April 25, 2015) provided a rare opportunity to test the response of deep groundwater systems. Deep ground waters at elevated temperature would naturally flow to ground surface along preferential flow path such as a deep fault, forming geothermal water flows. Geothermal water flows are susceptible to stress variation and can reflect the physical conditions of supercritical hot water kilometers deep down inside the crust. This paper introduces the monitoring work on the outflow in Xijiang Geothermal Field of Xinyi City, Guangdong Province in southern China. The geothermal field is one of typical geothermal fields with deep faults in Guangdong. The geothermal spring has characteristic daily variation of up to 72% in flow rate, which results from being associated with a north-south run deep fault susceptible to earthquake event. We use year-long monitoring data to illustrate how the Nepal earthquake would have affected the flows at the field site over 2.5 thousand kilometers away. The irregularity of flow is judged by deviation from otherwise good correlation of geothermal spring flow with solid earth tidal waves. This work could potentially provide the basis for further study of deep groundwater systems and insight to earthquake prediction.",

            "abstract": "Human activities increasingly dominate biogeochemical cycles of limiting nutrients on Earth. Urban and agricultural landscapes represent the largest sources of excess nutrients that drive water quality degradation. The physical structure of both urban and agricultural watersheds has been extensively modified, and these changes have large impacts on water and nutrient transport. Despite strong physical controls over nutrient transport in human dominated landscapes, biological processes play important roles in determining the fates of both nitrogen and phosphorus. This talk uses examples from research in urban and agricultural watersheds in the Midwestern USA to illustrate interactions of physical and biological controls over nutrient cycles that have shifted nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources and cycling in unexpected ways in response to management changes. In urban watersheds, efforts to improve water quality have been hindered by legacy sources of phosphorus added to storm water through transport to drainage systems by vegetation. Similarly, reductions in field erosion in agricultural watersheds have not led to major reductions in phosphorus transport, because of continued release of biological sources of P. Where management of phosphorus has been most effective in reducing eutrophication of lakes, decreases in N removal processes have led to long term increases in N concentration and transport. Together, these examples show important roles for biological processes affecting nutrient movement in highly modified landscapes. Consideration of the downstream physical and biological responses of management changes are thus critical toward identification of actions that will most effectively reduce excess nutrients watersheds and coastal zones.",

            "abstract": "Global inundation estimates are needed to answer major questions such as where, when, how often and for how long does freshwater inundate the continental land surface, along with what volume is stored. Over the last three years numerical models have been developed that facilitate global scale simulations of inundation dynamics at <1 km resolution. Fundamental to the accuracy of these models and our understanding of the non-linear transform between runoff and inundation is the bankfull discharge at which the floodplain inundates. However for most of the world’s rivers bankfull discharge is unknown because the necessary data on river geometry are extremely poor or absent. Methods that estimate bankfull discharge using model inversion, given remote observations of surface water dynamics, are therefore needed if simulation accuracy is to improve.\nHere, a number of approaches for bankfull discharge estimation from ICEsat and Envistat altimeter data are evaluated using a hydrodynamic model of the Inner Niger Delta in Mali. Previous models of this site parameterised the river channel using downstream hydraulic geometry theory, which related the reach averaged channel width to depth via two calibrated parameters. This approach achieved at best a 1.2 m RMSE to 126 ICEsat overpasses. Directly estimating reach averaged depth for a number of reaches was shown to reduce these errors by over 50%, however it was not clear how this applied to bifurcating channels on the delta. Therefore, a novel approach where geometry was determined based on estimating bankfull discharge return-period was also evaluated.\nAfter calibration to the altimeter data, simulated inundation from 2002-2009 was evaluated against optical imagery from Landsat. After which, historical gauge records were used to simulate the inundation history from the 1960’s and 70’s when peak discharge on the Niger was over twice that of the past two decades because of different land use practices upstream. The analysis significantly extends the inundation record that can be obtained from the remotely sensed archive alone.",

Operational experience suggests that, while generally unbiased for most events, the MEFP precipitation ensembles tend to underforecast extreme observed precipitation. In this presentation, we describe two recent efforts to diagnose and address the conditional bias using the GEFS reforecast dataset for selected basins in California: 1) a regionalization approach to MEFP calibration whereby data are pooled from other locations with sufficiently similar statistical properties to increase sample size for extreme events and 2) analysis of sensitivity of MEFP ensembles to differently prescribed precipitation forcing and parameters in MEFP calibration. Also presented are the findings and possible research directions.",

            "abstract": "The distribution and changes in Earth’s forests impact hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy fluxes, as well as ecosystems’ capacity to support biodiversity and human economies. Long-term records of forest cover are needed across a broad range of investigation, including climate and carbon-cycle modeling, hydrological studies, habitat analyzes, biological conservation, and land-use planning. Satellite-based observations enable mapping and monitoring of forests at ecologically and economically relevant resolutions and continental or even global extents. Following early forest-mapping efforts using coarser resolution remote sensing data such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), forests have been mapped regionally at < 100-m resolution using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). These “Landsat-class” sensors offer precise calibration, but they provide observations only over the past three decades—a relatively short period for delineating the long-term changes of forests. Starting in 1971, the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) was the first generation of sensors aboard the Landsat satellites. MSS thus provides a unique resource to extend observations by at least a decade longer in history than records based on Landsat TM and ETM+. Leveraging more recent Landsat-based forest-cover products developed by the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) as reference, we developed an automated approach to detect forests using MSS data by leveraging the multispectral and phenological characteristics of forests observed in MSS time-series. The forest-cover map is produced with layers representing the year of observation, detection of forest-cover change relative to 1990, and the uncertainty of forest-cover and –change layers. The approach has been implemented with open-source libraries to facilitate processing large volumes of Landsat MSS images on high-performance computing machines. As the first result of our global mapping effort, we present the forest cover for North America. More than 25,000 Landsat MSS scenes were processed to provide a 120-meter resolution forest cover for North America, which will be made publicly available on the GLCF website (http://www.landcover.org).",

            "abstract": "Nominally anhydrous minerals (such as olivine, pyroxene and garnet) present in mantle xenoliths have been found to contain up to hundreds of ppm wt H2O, bonded as H to their mineral structure. However, it is not well understood whether these H2O contents are representative for the hydrous state of the deep mantle where they formed, or if they are the result of interactions between the xenoliths and metasomatic fluids or magmas during their travel to the surface. Given the fact that trace amounts of H2O can alter the physical and chemical properties of mantle materials and therefore affect Earth’s dynamics, it is important to accurately determine the H2O content of deep mantle minerals.\nNatural diamonds can contain mineral inclusions that formed at high depths (>5 GPa) and are representative for the deep and inaccessible portions of the mantle where they originated. This is because the strong and inert diamond prevents the inclusions to react with any fluid or melt that get in contact with it. Therefore, valuable information regarding the H2O content of the deep mantle can be obtained by studying these minerals trapped in diamonds.\nIn this study we measured the H2O contents of 10 olivine and garnet inclusions in diamonds from the Udachnaya kimberlite (Siberian craton) by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Olivine crystals contain 1-5 ppm wt H2O while garnets do not show absorption bands indicating the presence of detectable H in their structure and are therefore considered dry. The H2O contents of olivine and garnet inclusions in diamonds presented here are considerably lower than those found in xenoliths or xenocrists from the same locality. Based on these new results, we discuss the presence of H2O in the cratonic mantle and its importance in stabilizing these areas during geological time, as well as the volatile signature of diamond forming melts in the Siberian craton.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and various changes in the landscape itself, such as permafrost thaw, may trigger and mediate substantial changes in the inland water system of the Arctic. Although connections between permafrost degradation and hydrological changes in thermokarst landscapes have been established, the linkages between permafrost degradation, thermokarst-lake changes (initiation, expansion, drainage) and changes in hydrological fluxes are still not fully understood. We investigate patterns of lake-area (with both increasing and decreasing trends) and hydro-climatic change in Arctic river basins, and possible influence of permafrost change reflected in such patterns. Analysis of lake-change patterns indicates permafrost thaw as a main change driver of some change patterns. However, clear indication of basin-wide influence of permafrost thaw on hydrological discharge dynamics is only found in two relatively small out of total six investigated permafrost basins of different scales. Further, both permafrost and non-permafrost basins exhibit large-scale lake-area changes. A salient change pattern emerging across all investigated basins is an opposite direction of runoff change to that of precipitation change. This contrast is explainable by apparent evapotranspiration changes that may be due to observed changes in surface water (lake) area and associated water-storage changes. Patches of local lake-area change can thus add up to considerable large-scale effects on evapotranspiration and runoff changes.",

            "abstract": "The asymmetric geometry of dip-slip faults (i.e., thrust and normal faults) leads to greater slip and greater peak slip rate near the free surface (e.g., the surface of the Earth) [Nielsen, 1998; Oglesby et al., 1998; Oglesby and Archuleta, 2000, Oglesby et al., 2000] than analogous vertical faults. Furthermore, when rupture travels updip along a dip-slip fault and reaches the free surface, it produces a Rayleigh-wave breakout phase, a pulse traveling back downdip and along the free surface [Savage, 1965; Burridge and Halliday, 1971; Oglesby et al., 1998; Madariaga, 2003; Kozdon and Dunham, 2013] that has the potential to be readily observed. Properties of the Rayleigh-wave breakout phase are undoubtedly related to the fault slip distribution, the details of this relationship are not well understood. In particular, these breakout phases may be correlated to fault slip near the free surface, which efficiently generates tsunamis when submarine faults rupture [Okal, 1988; Geist and Bilek, 2001]. We propose to constrain 2-D earthquake source parameters from characteristics of the Rayleigh-wave field by running suites of 2-D dynamic rupture forward models on dip-slip faults that vary in dip angle and fault curvature, and with equivalent prestress conditions such as constant traction across the fault and stochastic prestress distributions. We will compare traveling Rayleigh-wave breakout properties (e.g., amplitude) with fault rupture parameters (e.g., slip distribution) for a variety of fault geometries and prestress conditions. Preliminary results on thrust faults indicate that shallower dip angles produce slip distributions that are more preferentially weighted updip, and larger amplitude breakout phases, with implications for early estimation of far-field tsunami amplitude.",

            "abstract": "Often times science communication is reactive and it minimizes the perceptions of the general public. The Tsunami of New Dreams is a film with the testimonies of survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Production of the film spanned over five years and dozens of interviews, and is based on a unique geographic, demographic and experiential sampling of the local population.\nThis documentary feature film underscores the importance of Earth science and science communication in building sustainable communities. The film is a lesson in survival and sustainability, and it provides a simple but powerful testimony of what to do and what not to do before and during a tsunami. The film also highlights the direct relationship that exists between disaster survival rates and the knowledge of basic Earth science and preparedness facts.\nWe hope that the human stories presented in the film will serve as a strong motivator for general audiences to learn about natural hazards, preparedness, and Earth science. These engaging narratives can touch the minds and hearts of general audiences much faster than technical lectures in a classroom. Some of the testimonies are happy and others are sad, but they all present the wide range of beliefs that influenced the outcomes of the natural disaster. The interviews with survivors are complemented with unique archival footage of the tsunami and unique footage of daily life in Aceh. Hand-drawn illustrations are used to recreate what survivors did immediately after the earthquake, and during the extreme moments when they faced the tsunami waves. Animated visuals, maps and diagrams enhance the understanding of earthquake and tsunami dynamics.\nThe film is a production of the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) in collaboration with the International Center for Aceh and Indian Ocean Studies (ICAIOS) in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The film is scheduled for release in late 2015.\nThis is a unique work about what we can do to minimize casualties with simple strategies and tactics grounded on Earth science. It is also a case study about the devastating impact of natural hazards in communities with limited awareness of Earth science and the ingenuity and courage necessary to recover from them.\nhttp://art-science-media.com/tsunami-of-new-dreams/",

Next, we develop a multiple regression model of the average hiss magnetic field intensity as a function of Kp, L, magnetic latitude and magnetic local time.

A dynamic Arctic landscape has the potential to alter ecosystems across a broad range of scales.\nAccurate characterization is useful to understand the properties and organization of the landscape, optimal sampling network design, measurement and process upscaling and to establish a landscape-based framework for multi-scale modeling of ecosystem processes.\nThis study seeks to delineate the landscape at Seward Peninsula of Alaska into ecoregions using large volumes (terabytes) of high spatial resolution satellite remote-sensing data.\nDefining high-resolution ecoregion boundaries is difficult because many ecosystem processes in Arctic ecosystems occur at small local to regional scales, which are often resolved in by coarse resolution satellites (e.g., MODIS).\nWe seek to use data-fusion techniques and data analytics algorithms applied to Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR), Satellite for Observation of Earth (SPOT), WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and QuickBird-2 to develop high-resolution (∼5m) ecoregion maps for multiple time periods. Traditional analysis methods and algorithms are insufficient for analyzing and synthesizing such large geospatial data sets, and those algorithms rarely scale out onto large distributed- memory parallel computer systems. We seek to develop computationally efficient algorithms and techniques using high-performance computing for characterization of Arctic landscapes. We will apply a variety of data analytics algorithms, such as cluster analysis, complex object-based image analysis (COBIA), and neural networks. We also propose to use representativeness analysis within the Seward Peninsula domain to determine optimal sampling locations for fine-scale measurements. This methodology should provide an initial framework for analyzing dynamic landscape trends in Arctic ecosystems, such as shrubification and disturbances, and integration of ecoregions into multi-scale models.",

It is controlled by a complex interplay of physical, biological, and chemical processes. Examining the trends of the surface water pCO2 and its drivers in CMIP5 ESMs can help identify the sources of the model bias of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink rate from the atmosphere. In this study, we first examined the long-term growth rates of Southern Ocean surface pCO2 and its four drivers (sea surface temperature, salinity, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon, and alkalinity) in all available CMIP5 ESMs during all seasons (annually), winter, and summer. We then tested the sensitivity of the trends to the temporal and spatial time spans.\nOur preliminary results show that the existing CMIP5 ESMs show significantly different long-term trends from the observations, particularly in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. In the Pacific-Indian sectors (295E:0) of the Southern Ocean, only two of the existing nine ESMs reproduce the weakly decreasing sink from 1995 to 2008 found in the observational analysis, with other seven models showing equivalent or slightly smaller trends of oceanic pCO2 than the atmospheric pCO2. In the Atlantic sector (65W:0) of the Southern Ocean, none of the existing nine ESMs show little or no trend from 2001 to 2008 found in the observed oceanic pCO2. In addition, our results show that the model trends in the Atlantic sector vary significantly with the selection latitudes and years, a finding also true in the observational analysis, owing to the aliasing of the internal variability in the ocean or the forced variability by the atmosphere. Possible processes that explain these biases in ESMs will also be addressed.",

Using GPS-tracked ocean drifters, various educational institutions can provide students with hands-on experience in physical oceanography, engineering, and computer science. In building drifters many high school and undergraduate students may focus on drifter construction, sometimes designing their own drifter or attempting to improve current NEFSC models. While learning basic oceanography younger students can build drifters with the help of an educator and directions available on the studentdrifters.org website. Once drifters are deployed, often by a local mariner or oceanographic partner, drifter tracks can be visualised on maps provided at http://nefsc.noaa.gov/drifter. With the lesson plans available for those interested in computer science, students may download, process, and plot the drifter position data with basic Python code provided. Drifter tracks help students to visualize ocean currents, and also allow them to understand real particle tracking applications such as in search and rescue, oil spill dispersion, larval transport, and the movement of injured sea animals. Additionally, ocean circulation modelers can use student drifter paths to validate their models. The Student Drifters Program has worked with over 100 schools, several of them having deployed drifters on the West Coast. Funding for the program often comes from individual schools and small grants but in the future will preferably come from larger government grants. NSF, Sea-Grant, NOAA, and EPA are all possible sources of funding, especially with the support of multiple schools and large marine education associations. The Student Drifters Program is a unique resource for educators, students, and scientists alike.",

However, climate models have strong biases in this region, so it is critical to assess whether the key processes are correctly represented in prediction systems. In this study, the mechanisms leading to the prediction of a strong El Niño are analyzed in the hindcasts (1982-2010) from the NCEP CFSv2 model and are compared to the 2015-16 forecasts. We focus on the differences in the evolution of the members that produce the largest and smallest warming in the ensemble runs in both the hindcasts and forecasts, particularly on the differences in the drivers or precursors that lead to the ensemble spread, like the zonal wind stress predictor in boreal fall that has been proposed to be determinant for strong El Niño (Takahashi & Dewitte, 2015). Preliminary results indicate that the ocean heat content plays a larger role for the development of El Niño in CFSv2 than in nature, such that the hindcast of the 2009-2010 central Pacific event was similar to that of the strong El Niño of 1997-98, while the response to the zonal wind stress predictor is weaker than observed. This study provides some insights into the processes or mechanisms in the model that need to be better represented in order to improve the prediction of a strong El Niño event.",

Understanding the mechanisms resulting in soil organic carbon stabilization is necessary for predicting the fate of this carbon and potential feedbacks to climate change. Here, we explore how soil carbon depth gradients are influenced by factors such as age, parent material, mean annual temperature (MAT) and a modeled moisture/leaching index (LI). Specifically, we calculate a quantitative metric reflecting the depth gradient of organic carbon, z*, described by Rosenbloom et al. 2006, which describes the depth attenuation of C turnover by fitting the %C by depth relationship with an exponential decay function. We compare z* across several soil chronosequences (n=33) spanning a broad array of ecosystems and climates.\nThe compiled chronosequence data were collected from previously published studies and ongoing USGS work. Each sequence consisted of at least two soils spanning a developmental age gradient and each soil included depth resolved carbon concentrations, with at least four different depths sampled in vertical profile. When the soil profile data were integrated across all depths, we found only weak relationships between total C in these profiles with various soil forming factors. Comparing depth resolved concentrations provided an opportunity to determine the significance of depth resolved gradients and particularly the importance of deep soil C.\nWe found a significant positive relationship between z* and age, (R2=0.57, p=4.0*10-13), a significant negative relationship between z* and LI (R2=0.02, p=0.02), a significant relationship between (age x LI) and z* (R2=0.02, p=0.02, a positive relationship between z* and MAT (R2=0.1 p=0.01), and no relationship between z* and general parent material type (felsic, mafic, calcareous ; R2=0.04, p=0.01). These findings aid in determining the drivers of soil carbon storage across sites.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem models have largely been built to reflect environmental controls such as changing climate on ecosystem carbon cycling at time scales that range from minutes to days. However, the natural complexity of ecosystems can cause environmental drivers of long-term and large-scale carbon to be drastically different from the underlying constraints of temperature and precipitation on physiology. Comparison of climate sensitivities among multiple models and empirical data sources can reveal systemic weaknesses in ecosystem representation of the carbon cycle.\nCoordinated collection of multiple types empirical data is essential to determine whether inconsistencies between model and data sensitivity to climate is an artifact of model parameterization or systemic weaknesses in model structures. The PalEON Project has gathered 10 terrestrial ecosystem models to simulate monthly carbon pools and fluxes from 850 to 2010 A.D. at six data-rich sites in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States. These sites were chosen for their potential to construct multiple long-term empirical data records from tree-rings, flux towers, and pollen that could then be compared to model simulations.\nThe primary drivers of temporal variation in carbon storage and flux vary by ecosystem model and often change with the spatial and temporal scale of analysis. However, agreement between model and empirical data sensitivity to climate is poor. In some cases, models and tree rings even differ in the directionality of climate effect. Several explanations exist for poor model-data agreement. One leading hypothesis is that poor representation of interactions among ecosystem components may cause the drivers of one process such as NPP to differ from a downstream carbon cycle component such as change in aboveground biomass. Within individual ecosystem models, correlations among carbon cycle components were very low (mean R2 = 0.10 SD 0.10 across all models) and generally decreased with coarser temporal resolution. Further comparisons with empirical data will reveal whether similar components of the carbon cycle in natural systems are similarly disjointed.",

Operating as an integrated observing system, DISCOVER-AQ has employed multiple aircraft and ground instrumentation to conduct multi-perspective observations of the distribution of gaseous and particulate pollution in the lower atmosphere over contrasting regions of the U.S. that are currently in violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The four study areas include Maryland (Baltimore-Washington corridor), California (southern San Joaquin Valley), Texas (Greater Houston area), and Colorado (Denver/Northern Front Range). The DISCOVER-AQ observations are actively being used to promote improvements in remote sensing in the following ways: Characterizing vertical structure in the atmosphere and its diurnal patterns to develop improved a priori information for satellite retrievals; Examining horizontal variability to assess the spatial scales needed to resolve emissions and photochemistry; Determining correlative relationships between remotely sensed and in situ observations; Assessing the value of ground-based remote sensing to provide information on impact of boundary layer dynamics and mixing on air pollution. Current progress on analysis of these datasets and their relevance to future geostationary satellite observations as well as augmentation of air quality monitoring networks with ground-based remote sensing will be discussed.",

The patterns and controls of soil organic carbon storage are critical for understanding the coupled interactions between biosphere behavior and climate change. Although soil carbon stocks are positively correlated with mean annual precipitation at global scale, moisture is considered to promote carbon decomposition in most macroscale soil carbon models, which include a scaling factor that increases with water content. Therefore, more mechanistic understanding of soil moisture effects on carbon accumulation and cycle are needed. The microbial activity, substrate availability, and gas transfer in soil react differently with water content, and their interactions result in an optimal water content for carbon decomposition. We develop a physical based microscale model to study the effects of soil texture and heterogeneity on the optimal moisture as well as the carbon destabilization. X-ray computed tomography of soil samples with different clay content and pore distribution are used to study the impact of soil texture and heterogeneity on the optimal water content and carbon release. After thorough modeling studies, we introduce a scaling factor, which reflects the optimal effect of water moisture, to the macroscale carbon model. This scaling factor exhibits a strong physical mechanism and can improve the accuracy of predicting carbon storage and cycle in soil.",

            "abstract": "Two-stage Gifford-McMahon helium-gas cryocoolers have been used for the past 40+ years in a wide variety of cryogenic applications, including reducing the liquid helium consumption of SRMs. However, the cooling efficiency depends greatly on the friction of the displacement pistons, which need to be replaced every few years. This and the rising cost of liquid helium are major headaches in the operation of modern paleomagnetic laboratories. Although the development of efficient pulse-tube cryocoolers has eliminated the need for liquid helium in new superconducting magnetometers, there are still nearly 100 older SRMs around the globe that use liquid helium.\nIn a failed attempt to replace the Gifford-McMahon unit on one of Caltech’s SRMs with a pulse-tube, we irreversibly contaminated the cylindrical surfaces of the stainless-steel heat exchanger with a thin film of gallium, a non-toxic metal that has a melting temperature of ~ 30˚C. Liquid gallium will diffuse into other metals, altering their surface properties. We noticed that the next cryocooler-assisted cool down of the SRM went nearly twice as fast as in previous cycles, and the helium boiloff rate for the past 2 years has stabilized at less than half of its average over the past 30 years. It seems that the thin layer of gallium may be reducing the sliding friction of the Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers. We recently tested this on a second SRM, with similar results. We found that the inner cryocooler surface reached its equilibrium temperature in about 1/3 of the time that it took in previous cool-down cycles. WSGI also confirmed that this cool-down was unusually efficient compared to other instruments they have built. Subsequent records of the helium gas boiloff show that this system is also running at about half of its former loss rate. Based on these two results, we tentatively recommend this simple procedure any time cold-head swaps are performed on these cryocoolers.",

            "abstract": "The flocculation process has the potential to alter the settling velocity of mud in buoyant river mouth discharges as a function of distance from shore due to continual decreases in turbulent shearing and increases in salinity. In this study, we measure the change in floc size in a decaying shear field and compare the results to steady-state experiments conducted on the same batch of sediment. The primary questions we explore are: (1) whether or not flocs are at their equilibrium size throughout the duration of the decay, and (2) whether or not the change in size is all that significant in terms of alterations to settling velocity. These questions are examined in the laboratory using a camera system that allows for flocs to be sized within a turbulent suspension. We also test the ability of current flocculation models to capture data trends, and we examine how inclusion of various floc modeling approaches in a simple river-mouth discharge model impacts plume concentration and deposit location. The data shows that changes in floc size (due only to changes in turbulence) can lead to a 4 or greater fold increase in settling velocity within the first few km of the river mouth. No floc settling velocity model was able to perfectly match the experimental time series; though the basic functionality was captured with the non-equilibrium model of Winterwerp (1998). The plume modeling analysis highlights the strong dependence of the mud deposition rate on the method chosen to account for flocs. In general, inclusion of flocculation shifts the mud depocenter landward. Interestingly, inclusion of flocculation through most current modeling methods often leads to only a marginal change in the local plume concentration due to the strong influence of entrainment on concentration.",

However, in remote locations where line power is unavailable and unattended operation is a requirement, passive warming using solar energy is often the only viable approach. Current open topped passive warming approaches are unable to elevate enclosure air temperatures by more than 2°C. Existing full enclosure designs are capable of reaching higher air temperatures but can experience undesirable high temperature excursions. The ability to simulate future climate conditions using modulated temperature manipulations is critical to understand the acclimation of plant functional and structural traits to rising temperature and to enable improved model projections of a warming planet. This is particularly true for the Arctic—our target environment—where projected temperature increases far surpass those possible to achieve using current passive warming technology. To meet the research need for improved passive warming technology we have designed and tested a Zero Power Warming (ZPW) chamber capable of unattended temperature elevation and modulation. The ZPW chamber uses a novel system of internal and external heat exchangers that allow differential actuation of pistons in coupled cylinders that control chamber venting. This allows the ZPW chamber to heat the enclosed plot to a higher temperature than an open topped chamber but avoid the overheating typical of fully enclosed chambers. Here we describe the technology behind the ZPW and present data from a temperate prototype that was able to elevate and modulate the internal air temperature by 8°C, a marked increase over existing passive warming approaches. We also present new data from a recently deployed Arctic prototype. Whilst the ZPW chambers were designed for the Arctic, the concept described here can be adapted for many research environments.",

One problem is the poor characterization of federally-protected (<10,000 ppm TDS) water in the state. Another is the lack of publically-accessible information about the hydrological properties of confining strata adjacent to injection zones.\nIn effort to better understand these two problems, we have begun studying the archived oil and gas well records collected by the California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). These scanned records contain two useful sources of information. First, geophysical well logs, such those measuring resistivity and porosity, can be used to determine aquifer salinity. This allows a three-dimensional understanding of the distribution of protected groundwater. Second, driller’s logs contain lithological descriptions at depth. These lithologies can be used to construct a three-dimensional texture model, which can then be used in a groundwater flow model.\nA large number of undergraduate researchers at CSU Sacramento and CSU Long Beach have been collecting information on well records in the Ventura Basin and the Southern San Joaquin Valley. Each well record is examined with basic metadata entered into an online database in an effort to identify appropriate geophysical well logs and driller’s logs. High-quality driller’s logs are coded and used to create three-dimensional framework models for each well field. The geophysical logs are digitized and will be used to determine aquifer salinity.\nIn addition, we are using information from the DOGGR well records to investigate wellbore integrity, waste disposal and waterflood injection volumes, and the possibility of induced seismicity.\nThis project is part of the broader effort of the California State Water Resources Control Board to implement Senate Bill 4.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of volcanic activity on atmospheric chemistry have dominantly been viewed in relation to sulphur and halogen gas and aerosol emissions, while volcanic ash has been largely overlooked. However, solid particles in the atmosphere are increasingly recognised to be important in providing surfaces for heterogeneous reaction with trace gases such as SO2, NOx, O3 and organic compounds. Average annual emissions of ash, the <2 mm aluminosilicate particles generated during explosive eruptions, correspond to a surface area roughly equivalent to one-third to one-half of Earth’s geometric surface area. Despite the substantial surface presented by airborne ash particles, interactions between ash and gases at ambient temperature have seldom been investigated. Laboratory studies with volcanic ash similar to those conducted with mineral dust from arid and semi-arid regions are much needed to understand and quantify the kinetics and mechanisms involved in heterogeneous reactions. Addressing this gap in knowledge is fundamental to better assess the capacity of ash emissions to affect atmospheric chemistry. We determined the initial uptake coefficient (γM) and the total uptake capacity (NiM) for gaseous SO2 and O3 by a compositional range of ash and glass powders in a Knudsen flow reactor. The volcanic materials exhibited γSO2 and NiSO2 values ranging from 10-3 to 10-2 and from 1011 to 1013 molecules cm-2, respectively. The solids samples also showed γO3 and NiO3 values ranging from 10-3 to 10-2 and from 1012 to 1013 molecules cm-2, respectively. Results of sequential exposure trials (SO2 then O3, O3 then SO2) suggest that SO2 and O3 do not compete for surface sites on the aluminosilicate materials, although O3 may participate in redox reactions with surface adsorbed sulphur species, enhancing the total capacity for O3 uptake by the solid. Differences in reactivity of the samples towards SO2 and O3 may be interpreted in light of variations in types and abundances of chemical functional groups on the ash and glass materials, as dictated by their unique surface generation and alteration histories. Extrapolation of our results to quantify the potential SO2 and O3 sink generated by ash emissions from a large explosive eruption will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are important trace gases that impact atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate. In order to help constrain NOx source contributions, the nitrogen (N) stable isotope composition of NOx (δ15N-NOx) may be a useful indicator for NOx source partitioning. However, despite anthropogenic emissions being the most prevalent source of NOx, there is still large uncertainty in the δ15N-NOx values for anthropogenic sources. To this end, this study provides a detailed analysis of several fossil-fuel combustion NOx sources and their δ15N-NOx values. To accomplish this, exhaust or flue samples from several fossil-fuel combustion sources were sampled and analyzed for their δ15N-NOx that included airplanes, gasoline-powered vehicles not equipped with a catalytic converter, gasoline-powered lawn tools and utility vehicles, diesel-electric buses, diesel semi-trucks, and natural gas-burning home furnace and power plant. A relatively large range of δ15N-NOx values were measured from -28.1 to 0.3‰ for individual exhaust/flue samples with cold started diesel-electric buses contributing on average the lowest δ15N-NOx values at -20.9‰, and warm-started diesel-electric buses contributing on average the highest values of -1.7‰. The NOx sources analyzed in this study primarily originated from the “thermal production” of NOx and generally emitted negative δ15N-NOx values, likely due to the kinetic isotope effect associated with its production. It was found that there is a negative correlation between NOx concentrations and δ15N-NOx for fossil-fuel combustion sources equipped with catalytic NOx reduction technology, suggesting that the catalytic reduction of NOx may have an influence on δ15N-NOx values. Based on the δ15N-NOx values reported in this study and in previous studies, a δ15N-NOx regional and seasonal isoscape was constructed for the contiguous United States. The constructed isoscape demonstrates the seasonal importance of various NOx sources to particular regions and will be helpful in evaluating the N isotopes in nitrate deposition studies.",

            "abstract": "Concentration-discharge relationships for silica in granitic landscapes vary throughout the critical zone network. In the Rio Icacos, Puerto Rico silica concentrations show strong dilution effects (Shanley et al., 2011). At the Boulder Creek CZO the Gordon Gulch catchment shows nearly constant dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations over three orders of magnitude change in discharge (Q). A major question is what controls the range of dilution to chemostatic behavior in catchments with similar lithology. Given that anything but perfect dilution behavior implies an increase in silica flux with increasing Q, we infer that different sources of DSi may be activated at different Q. Tracer data (Ge/Si) indicate that sources of DSi do change with Q in some systems (Kurtz et al., 2011). The CZO sites at Luquillo (LCZO), Boulder (BCCZO), Southern Sierra (SSCZO) and Santa Catalina-Jemez (SCCZO) share similar granitoid bedrock composition. We want to understand how the variation in climate, hydrology and weathering have influenced their regolith development and reach a better understanding of the DSi-Q patterns.\nData from the SSCZO and BCCZO sites indicate that these systems have chemostatic C-Q behavior for Si and other major weathering products. However, Ge/Si and Si relationships between sites vary drastically. At the SSCZO Ge/Si ratios are very low, but increase at lower Si concentrations. This behavior is consistent with release of Si from plagioclase weathering and strong control of DGe by clay neoformation. At BCCZO, Ge/Si increases with increasing Si. In Boulder, DSi (as defined operationally by filtering at 0.45 µm) includes transport as colloidal particles that are important under certain hydrologic states. Thus the hydrochemical mechanisms responsible for chemostatic behavior of DSi differ significantly between the two locations despite similar lithologies and climate. Current work in soil and rock samples from BCCZO and SSCZO will help elaborate how mineralogical assemblages affect C-Q patterns in the critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Climate change causes significant changes to temperature regimes and precipitation patterns across the world. Such alterations in climate pose serious risks for not only inland freshwater ecosystems but also groundwater systems, and may adversely affect numerous critical services they provide to humans. All groundwater results from precipitation, and precipitation is affected by climate change. Climate change is also influenced by land use / land cover (LULC) change and vice versa. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, climate change is caused by global warming which is generated by the increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. LULC change is a major driving factor causing an increase in GHG emissions.\nLULC change data (years 2006-2100) will be produced by the Land Transformation Model (LTM) which simulates spatial patterns of LULC change over time. MIROC5 (years 2006-2100) will be obtained considering GCMs and ensemble characteristics such as resolution and trend of temperature and precipitation which is a consistency check with observed data from local weather stations and historical data from GCMs output data. Thus, MIROC5 will be used to account for future climate change scenarios and relationship between future climate change and alteration of groundwater quality in this study.\nFor efficient groundwater resources management, integrated aquifer vulnerability assessments (= intrinsic vulnerability + hazard potential assessment) are required. DRASTIC will be used to evaluate intrinsic vulnerability, and aquifer hazard potential will be evaluated by Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) which can simulate pollution potential from surface and transport properties of contaminants. Thus, for effective integrated aquifer vulnerability assessment for LULC and climate change in the Midwestern United States, future projected LULC and climate data from the LTM and GCMs will be incorporated with DRASTIC and SWAT.\nIt is hypothesized that: 1) long-term future hydrology and water quality in surface and subsurface drainage areas will be influenced by LULC and climate change, and 2) this approach will be useful to identify specific areas contributing the most pollutants to aquifers due to LULC and climate change.",

            "abstract": "Wintertime Arctic sea ice extent has been declining since the late 20th century, particularly over the Atlantic sector that encompasses the Barents-Kara Seas and Baffin Bay. This sea-ice decline is attributable to various Arctic environmental changes, such as enhanced downward infrared radiation (IR), preseason sea-ice reduction, enhanced inflow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean, and sea-ice export. However, their relative contributions are uncertain. Utilizing ERA-Interim reanalysis and satellite-based data, it is shown here that a positive trend of downward IR accounts for nearly half of the sea-ice concentration (SIC) decline during the 1979-2011 winter over the Atlantic sector. Furthermore, we find that the Arctic downward IR increase is driven by horizontal atmospheric water flux and warm air advection into the Arctic, and not by evaporation and surface heat flux from the Arctic Ocean. These horizontal heat fluxes are linked to La-Nina-like tropical convection. In all CMIP5 climate models that are analyzed here, high pattern correlations are found between the surface air temperature trend and downward IR trend. However, there are two groups of CMIP5 models: one with small correlations between the Arctic surface air temperature trend and the surface heat flux trend (Group 1), and the other with large correlations (Group 2) between the same two variables. There is evidence that the Group 1 models are consistent with the aforementioned observation-based finding that the Arctic warming is closely related to large-scale circulation changes. In contrast, the Group 2 models are at odds with this observation in that their Arctic warming is more closely tied to surface heat fluxes than with the large-scale circulation change. Interestingly, while Group 1 models have a warm or weak bias, Group 2 models have large cold biases in the Arctic. This difference suggests that deficiencies that cause the cold bias of the mean state may contribute to the surface heat flux being an important warming factor in the Group 2 models, and that while ensemble model projections are widely used, the underlying warming mechanism may widely differ from model to model. These findings also underscore the need to improve our understanding of the mechanism that maintains the mean state of the Arctic in both nature and models.",

Since 1939, the year it revealed itself, and until the volcano-seismic unrest of 2015 July 11-25 , the volcano has erupted 12 times. Only two eruptions breached the surface: 1939, 1974. The volcano has an average eruption cycle of about 10-11 years. Excluding the Montserrat, Soufrière Hills, KeJ is the most active volcano in the Lesser Antilles arc. The University of the West Indies, Seismic Research Centre (SRC) has been monitoring KeJ since 1953. On July 23 and 24 at 1:42 am and 0:02 am local time, respectively, the SRC recorded T-phase signals , considered to have been generated by KeJ. Both signals were recorded at seismic stations in and north of Grenada: SRC seismic stations as well as the French volcano observatories in Guadeloupe and Martinique, Montserrat Volcano Observatory, and the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. These distant recordings, along with the experience of similar observations in previous eruptions, allowed the SRC to confirm that two explosive eruptions occurred in this episode at KeJ. Up to two days after the second eruption, when aerial surveillance was done, there was no evidence of activity at the surface. During the instrumental era, eruptions of the KeJ have been identified from T-phases recorded at seismic stations from Trinidad, in the south, to Puerto Rico, in the north. In the 2015 July eruption episode, the seismic station in Trinidad did not record T-phases associated with the KeJ eruptions. In this study we compare the T-phase signals of 2015 July with those recorded in KeJ eruptions up to 1974 to explore possible causative features for the T-phase recording pattern in KeJ eruptions. In particular, we investigate the potential role played by the Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) layer in influencing the absence of the T-phase on the Trinidad seismic station during this eruption.",

The objective of this research is to determine the existence of a relationship between lava morphology and composition. Researchers from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) recorded morphologic observations and collected samples for geochemical analysis during ROV dives at the Alarcon Rise in 2012 and 2015. The Alarcon Rise is a unique spreading ridge environment where composition ranges from basaltic to rhyolitic, making it an ideal location to examine the compositional-morphologic relationship of lava flows. Preliminary interpretation of field data indicates that high-silica lavas are typically associated with 3-5 m, blocky pillows at the heavily faulted north end of the Alarcon. Visual analysis of multibeam bathymetry and side-scan sonar backscatter from MBARI AUV D. Allen B. and gridded at 1 m suggests that lava flow morphology (pillow, lobate, sheet) can be distinguished by seafloor roughness. Bathymetric products used by ANFIS to quantify the morphologic-compositional relationship were slope, aspect, and bathymetric position index (BPI, a measure of local height relative to the adjacent terrain). Sonar backscatter intensity is influenced by surface roughness and previously used to distinguish lava morphology. Gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) were applied to backscatter to create edge-detection filters that recognized faults and fissures. Input data are slope, aspect, bathymetric value, BPI at 100 m scale, BPI at 500 m scale, backscatter intensity, and the first principle component of backscatter GLCM. After lava morphology was classified on the Alarcon Rise map, another classification was completed to detect locations of high-silica lava. Application of an expert classifier like ANFIS to distinguish lava composition may become an important tool in oceanic ridge exploration.",

            "abstract": "A new model of the compact intracloud discharge (CID) is suggested. CID is considered as a result of coupling of two (or more) bipolar streamer structures developed in the strong large-scale electric field inside the thundercloud. The model implies two stages of the CID development. At the preliminary stage, in the region of local enhancement of the electric field (between the main negative and upper-positive charge regions or between the upper-positive and overlying negative screening charge regions of the thundercloud) two or more bipolar streamer structures appear successively. The streamer structures are described in the framework of the self-consistent fractal model. The formation time of the structures depends on the properties of the constituent conducting channels and can reach tens of milliseconds. The spatial and time synchronization of the streamer structures is provided by significant altitude variation of the electric field with a scale height of a few hundred meters. As possible physical mechanisms of such variation, the large-scale turbulence of the cloud medium or flow instability can be considered. It is shown that a single streamer structure accumulates significant electric charges of both signs near the ends of the structure during its development. The main stage of CID starts when the electric coupling arises between the developed streamer structures. Then the accumulated electric charges at the adjacent ends of the structures are neutralized for the time, which is substantially less than duration of the preliminary stage. It is shown that parameters of the current pulse at the main stage of the model event are in a good agreement with known properties of the CID current obtained in the transmission line approximation. Taking into account the small-scale fast electric processes at the preliminary and main stages of CID, the model also naturally explain the basic properties and synchronization of the CID emission in the LF/VLF and HF/VHF frequency ranges.",

Ground based measurements can yield high temporal resolution and detailed information about a specific location, but due to the inaccessibility of most of the Arctic to date in situ measurements have been made at very few sites. In August 2013, a small aircraft, flying low over the surface (5-30 m), and carrying an air turbulence probe and spectroscopic instruments to measure methane, carbon dioxide, and their isotopologues, flew over the North Slope of Alaska. During the ten flights multiple comparisons were made with a ground based Eddy Covariance tower as well as three region surveys of fluxes over three areas each approximately 2500 km2. We present analysis using the Flux Fragment Method and surface landscape classification maps to relate the fluxes to different surface land types.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface system behavior is driven and controlled by the interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes which occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Capabilities to monitor, understand and predict this behavior in an effective and timely manner are needed for both scientific purposes and for effective subsurface system management. Such capabilities require three elements: Models, Data and an enabling cyberinfrastructure, which allow users to use these models and data in an effective manner. Under a DOE Office of Science funded STTR award Subsurface Insights and LBNL have designed and implemented a cloud based predictive assimilation framework (PAF) which automatically ingests, controls quality and stores heterogeneous physical and chemical subsurface data and processes these data using different inversion and modeling codes to provide information on the current state and evolution of subsurface systems. PAF is implemented as a modular cloud based software application with five components: (1) data acquisition, (2) data management, (3) data assimilation and processing, (4) visualization and result delivery and (5) orchestration. Serverside PAF uses ZF2 (a PHP web application framework) and Python and both open source (ODM2) and in house developed data models. Clientside PAF uses CSS and JS to allow for interactive data visualization and analysis. Client side modularity (which allows for a responsive interface) of the system is achieved by implementing each core capability of PAF (such as data visualization, user configuration and control, electrical geophysical monitoring and email/SMS alerts on data streams) as a SPA (Single Page Application). One of the recent enhancements is the full integration of a number of flow and mass transport and parameter estimation codes (e.g., MODFLOW, MT3DMS, PHT3D, TOUGH, PFLOTRAN) in this framework.  This integration allows for autonomous and user controlled modeling of hydrological and geochemical processes. In our presentation we will discuss our software architecture and present the results of using these codes and the overall developed performance of our framework  using hydrological, geochemical and geophysical data from the LBNL SFA2 Rifle field site.",

            "abstract": "Subduction, terrane accretion, and arc magmatism leave a complex and sometimes incomplete record of metamorphism and deformation. The range of metamorphic temperatures and assemblages produced throughout the tectonic evolution of a single orogen often requires multiple isotopic systems to date distinct events. Lu-Hf geochronology, notably, has proven successful for dating metamorphism from a variety of bulk compositions spanning temperatures <350-850 C.\nWe review the success of applying Lu-Hf geochronology in combination with other isotopic systems to date metamorphism from range of metamorphic conditions within convergent margins. We then discuss some complexities of Lu-Hf geochronology when dating samples with complicated metamorphic histories. Garnet and lawsonite isochrons often exhibit excess scatter (high MSWD's) that can be attributed to a number of factors: secondary mineral inclusions, prolonged garnet growth durations, disequilibrium at low temperatures, and polyphase metamorphic histories. Samples with high-Hf inclusions in isotopic equilibrium host phases can lead to decreased precision, but still produce meaningful ages. At high temperatures Lu-Hf ages may date peak metamorphism, cooling from peak temperatures, or result in spurious ages because of preferential retention of 176Hf over 176Lu in garnet.\nDespite these complexities, and perhaps because of them, new aspects of the metamorphic history may be revealed that are not readily recorded by other isotopic systems. Minerals other than garnet and lawsonite, particularly apatite, and perhaps epidote, offer exciting new possibilities for Lu-Hf geochronology. Careful fieldwork, detailed petrology and geochemistry, and collaborative efforts using multiple isotopic systems offer the best approach to solving tectonic problems in convergent orogens.",

            "abstract": "Rainfed subsistence agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for approximately 96% of all cropland. This, combined with strong intra-seasonal and interannual variability of rains makes food production sensitive to climate variations, and increases the potential and frequent occurrence of climate-triggered famines. Farmers often identify the timing of the onset of the growing season (in many areas dependent predominantly on rainfall) as a key climate characteristic which influences crop yields, influences planting activities, and can be used to adapt to changing seasonal conditions without requiring additional resources. It is thus important to understand factors affecting the timing of the onset of rains, particularly how anthropogenic climate change may increase the risk of later onsets.\nHere, we present a study designed to assess the level of influence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on the risk of late onset in southern Africa. Considering numerous definitions of rainy season onset, we use one that describes onset related to the growing of maize, as it is the most wide-ranging and consumed staple in the region. Attribution is done using a risk-based event attribution methodology in which we use dedicated simulations by AGCMs (HadAM3p-N96 and CAM5.1-1degree) performed in the framework of the Climate of the 20th Century Plus (C20C+) Detection and Attribution Project. These simulations enable comparison of event (in our case the timing of the onset of a particular rainy season) probabilities under real world climates with those under a climate that might have been had human activities not emitted greenhouse gases. The fraction of risk of later onsets, attributable to an increase in greenhouse gases, is done in a spatially-explicit way for onset events derived from observed and reanalysis data for the 2007-2014 period.",

            "abstract": "Calcium is an essential nutrient in forest ecosystems that is susceptible to leaching loss and depletion. Calcium depletion can affect plant and animal productivity, soil acid buffering capacity, and fluxes of carbon and water. Excess nitrogen supply and associated soil acidification are often implicated in short-term calcium loss from soils, but the long-term role of nitrogen enrichment on calcium sources and resupply is unknown. Here we use strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) as a proxy for calcium to investigate how soil nitrogen enrichment from biological nitrogen fixation interacts with bedrock calcium to regulate both short-term available supplies and the long-term sources of calcium in montane conifer forests. Our study examines 22 sites in western Oregon, spanning a 20-fold range of bedrock calcium on sedimentary and basaltic lithologies.\nIn contrast to previous studies emphasizing abiotic control of weathering as a determinant of long-term ecosystem calcium dynamics and sources (via bedrock fertility, climate, or topographic/tectonic controls) we find instead that that biotic nitrogen enrichment of soil can strongly regulate calcium sources and supplies in forest ecosystems. For forests on calcium-rich basaltic bedrock, increasing nitrogen enrichment causes calcium sources to shift from rock-weathering to atmospheric dominance, with minimal influence from other major soil forming factors, despite regionally high rates of tectonic uplift and erosion that can rejuvenate weathering supply of soil minerals. For forests on calcium-poor sedimentary bedrock, we find that atmospheric inputs dominate regardless of degree of nitrogen enrichment. Short-term measures of soil and ecosystem calcium fertility are decoupled from calcium source sustainability, with fundamental implications for understanding nitrogen impacts, both in natural ecosystems and in the context of global change. Our finding that long-term nitrogen enrichment increases forest reliance on atmospheric calcium helps explain reports of greater ecological calcium limitation in an increasingly nitrogen-rich world.",

            "abstract": "Comparisons between earthquake source parameters as determined by InSAR and the global centroid moment tensor (GCMT) catalogue show discrepancies between locations derived using these independent methods (Ferreira et al., 2011; Weston et al., 2011, 2012). Earthquake centroid location determination using InSAR data (named the ‘InSAR Centroid Moment Tensor’, or ‘ICMT’ location) is more robust, since it is independent of Earth velocity structure errors that impact on longperiod surface wave inversions used in the GCMT method. Ferreira et al (2011) showed that these discrepancies cannot be resolved at present by applying more detailed 3D Earth velocity structures from mantle tomography models. Earthquake location determination is dependent on the assumed velocity structure, not only in the GCMT method, but also in all of the seismic based earthquake source parameter inversions. Velocity structures are typically produced by seismic tomography, which itself depends on seismic phase travel times. These travel times are a function of source location and origin time, plus the path between the source and receivers. Errors in source location can therefore be compounded as errors in the velocity structure.\nIn a preliminary study we analyze longperiod seismic data for four shallow continental earthquakes studied with InSAR – Zarand Mw 6.5 (Iran, 2005), Eureka Valley Mw 6.1 (California, 1993), Aiquile Mw 6.5 (Bolivia, 1998) and Wells Mw 6.0 (Nevada, 2008). We use the spectral element wave propagation package, SPECFEM3D GLOBE, and Earth model S40RTS (Ritsema et al., 2010) to calculate Green’s functions and synthetic seismograms for these events using their ICMT source locations. Using a cross-correlation method we were able to estimate phase shifts for each source-receiver pair between synthetic and observed long period waveforms. We believe these phase shifts may correspond to unmodeled heterogeneity in the S40RTS model, and if systematically documented could provide additional constraints on seismic tomographic models in future. GCMT-style source inversions that account for these phase shifts show much better agreement with the ICMT mechanisms than inversions where they are not accounted for. We show that source mechanism and moment can also be sensitive to these unknown heterogeneities in some cases.",

            "abstract": "Tide gauge records of mean sea level are some of the most valuable instrumental time series of oceanic variability and change. Yet these time series sometimes have short record lengths and intermittently missing values. Such issues can limit the utility of the data, for example, precluding rigorous analyses of return periods of extreme mean sea level events and whether they are unprecedented.\nWith a view to filling gaps in the tide gauge mean sea level time series, we describe a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. The model, which is predicated on the notion of conditional probabilities, comprises three levels: a process level, which casts mean sea level as a field with spatiotemporal covariance; a data level, which represents tide gauge observations as noisy, biased versions of the true process; and a prior level, which gives prior functional forms to model parameters. Using Bayes' rule, this technique gives estimates of the posterior probability of the process and the parameters given the observations.\nTo demonstrate the approach, we apply it to 2,967 station-years of annual mean sea level observations over 1856-2013 from 70 tide gauges along the United States East Coast from Florida to Maine (i.e., 26.8% record completeness). The model overcomes the data paucity by sharing information across space and time. The result is an ensemble of realizations, each member of which is a possible history of sea level changes at these locations over this period, which is consistent with and equally likely given the tide gauge data and underlying model assumptions.\nUsing the ensemble of histories furnished by the Bayesian model, we identify extreme events of mean sea level change in the tide gauge time series. Specifically, we use the model to address the particular hypothesis (with rigorous uncertainty quantification) that a recently reported interannual sea level rise during 2008-2010 was unprecedented in the instrumental record along the northeast coast of North America, and that it had a return period of 850 years. Preliminary analysis suggests that this event was likely unprecedented on the coast of Maine in the last century.",

            "abstract": "In order to gain a better understanding of geodynamic processes in the Hellenic subduction zone (HSZ), in particular in the eastern part of the HSZ, we analyze a cluster of intermediate deep events in the region of Nisyros volcano. The events were recorded by the temporary seismic network EGELADOS deployed from September 2005 to March 2007. The network covered the entire Hellenic subduction zone and it consisted of 23 offshore and 56 onshore broadband stations completed by 19 permanent stations from NOA, GEOFON and MedNet. The cluster of intermediate deep seismicity consists of 159 events with local magnitudes ranging from magnitude 0.2 to magnitude 4.1 at depths from 80 to 200 km. The events occur close to the top of the slab at an about 30 km thick zone. The spatio-temporal clustering is studied using three component similarity analysis.\nSingle event locations obtained using the nonlinear location tool NonLinLoc are compared to relative relocations calculated using the double-difference earthquake relocation software HypoDD. The relocation is performed with both manual readings of onset times as well as with differential traveltimes obtained by separate cross-correlation of P- and S-waveforms. The three-component waveform cross-correlation was performed for all the events using data from 45 stations. The results of the similarity analysis are shown as a function of frequency for individual stations and averaged over the network. Average similarities between waveforms of all event pairs reveal a low number of highly similar events but a large number of moderate similarities. Interestingly, the single station similarities between the event pairs show (1) in general decreasing similarity with increasing epicentral distance, (2) reduced similarities for paths crossing boundaries of slab segments, and (3) the influence of strong local heterogeneity leading to a considerable reduction of waveform similarities e.g. in the center of the Santorini volcano.",

In particular, the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is influenced by changes in global-scale temperature and pressure gradients and is responsible for spatial changes in summertime rainfall in Mesoamerica impacting regional water resources and the strength of upwelling. In October 2014, aboard the Research Vessel El Puma, a 3.9 meter long core (G14-P12) was recovered from the Northeast flank of the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California within the oxygen minimum zone (27˚52.11’N, 111˚41.51’W, water depth of 677m) to investigate changes in seasonal upwelling and Central Mexico rainfall over the last ~1000 years. The age model was developed using Pb210, C14 and lamination counting. The time interval includes the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. Biological productivity and precipitation proxy records were produced using an X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core-scanner and a color line scanner to generate a record of bulk chemistry and color reflectance. The records indicate marked decadal and centennial scale variability in the lithologic composition of the sediment superimposed on millimeter-scale variability that reflects the presence of seasonally laminated sediments. Nitrogen isotopic and nitrogen weight % measurements were used, in combination with the scanned data, to interpret changes in nitrate utilization and biological productivity. These new records will have broad implications on the link between regional coastal environmental conditions in the Gulf of California and global climate change.",

Exposure to 222Rn is likely the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking via inhalation; however, exposure through untreated groundwater is also a contributing factor to both inhalation and ingestion routes. A land use regression (LUR) model for groundwater 222Rn with anisotropic geological and 238U based explanatory variables is developed, which helps elucidate the factors contributing to elevated 222Rn across North Carolina. Geological and uranium based variables are constructed in elliptical buffers surrounding each observation such that they capture the lateral geometric anisotropy present in groundwater 222Rn. Moreover, geological features are defined at three different geological spatial scales to allow the model to distinguish between large area and small area effects of geology on groundwater 222Rn. The LUR is also integrated into the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) geostatistical framework to increase accuracy and produce a point-level LUR-BME model of groundwater 222Rn across North Carolina including prediction uncertainty. The LUR-BME model of groundwater 222Rn results in a leave-one out cross-validation of 0.46 (Pearson correlation coefficient= 0.68), effectively predicting within the spatial covariance range. Modeled results of 222Rn concentrations show variability among Intrusive Felsic geological formations likely due to average bedrock 238U defined on the basis of overlying stream-sediment 238U concentrations that is a widely distributed consistently analyzed point-source data.",

            "abstract": "Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a vital tool for probing the Earth’s interior and enhancing our knowledge of the underlying dynamical processes [e.g., Liu et al., 2012]. Using the adjoint tomography method, we have successfully obtained a first-generation global FWI model named M15 [Bozdag et al., 2015]. To achieve higher resolution of the emerging new structural features and to accommodate azimuthal anisotropy and anelasticity in the next-generation model, we expanded our database from 256 to 4,224 earthquakes. Previous studies have shown that ray-theory-based Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) inversion algorithms can produce systematic biases in earthquake source parameters due to tradeoffs with 3D crustal and mantle heterogeneity [e.g., Hjorleifsdottir et al., 2010]. To reduce these well-known tradeoffs, we performed CMT inversions in our current 3D global model before resuming the structural inversion with the expanded database.\nInitial source parameters are selected from the global CMT database [Ekstrom et al., 2012], with moment magnitudes ranging from 5.5 to 7.0 and occurring between 1994 and 2015. Data from global and regional networks were retrieved from the IRIS DMC. Synthetic seismograms were generated based on the spectral-element-based seismic wave propagation solver (SPECFEM3D GLOBE) in model M15. We used a source inversion algorithm based on a waveform misfit function while allowing time shifts between data and synthetics to accommodate additional unmodeled 3D heterogeneity [Liu et al., 2004]. To accommodate the large number of earthquakes and time series (more than 10,000,000 records), we implemented a source inversion workflow based on the newly developed Adaptive Seismic Data Format (ASDF) [Krischer, Smith, et al., 2015] and ObsPy [Krischer et al., 2015]. In ASDF, each earthquake is associated with a single file, thereby eliminating I/O bottlenecks in the workflow and facilitating fast parallel processing. Our preliminary results indicate that errors in the elements of the moment tensor and source location are small on average, although source depths generally become 3–5 km shallower.",

We used an ecosystem experiment at a savanna-forest boundary to compare the importance of seasonal drought and soil nutrients for limiting forest expansion. We set up twelve 70m x 10 plots, each extending across the biome boundary. Water and nutrient treatments were randomly assigned to these plots in a factorial experiment. The water treatment consisted of a control (no added water) or irrigation (60 mm per week throughout the dry season to eliminate soil water deficit), and the nutrient treatment consisted of a control (no added nutrients or a complete NPK + micronutrients added twice per year to minimize nutrient deficits). After four years, the study site was burned, allowing us to examine interactions with the primary disturbance at savanna-forest boundaries.\nTree growth and forest expansion were strongly limited by nutrients, but not water. Nutrient addition doubled rates of tree diameter growth over 4 years (2.4 mm/yr versus 1.1 mm/yr) growth, but irrigation had no detectable effect (1.9 mm/yr versus 1.7 mm/yr). Long-term fire suppression at the site had allowed forest tree species to establish in savanna, and these had more than a 3-fold greater growth rate than savanna species. The higher productivity of forest species was offset by greater biomass loss during fire, but within 3 years these losses were largely recovered. Nutrient limitation, combined with the slow growth of savanna tree species, greatly slows canopy closure in this environment, predisposing the savanna to remain in an open state under occasional burning. These results challenge the perception that rainfall is the primary factor limiting the natural distribution of tropical forest. Climate change is likely to cause a shift in the biome boundary only it is accompanied with a changing fire regime.",

One of the main goals of the study was to gain a better understanding of small electrical discharges in volcanic eruptions.\nPrior studies of volcanic lightning have shown that there are several types of electrical discharges that can occur in volcanic eruption clouds. One of these is referred to as continuous RF, which manifests itself as a continual production of VHF emissions that typically last several seconds to a minute during the initial, active phase of an eruption. Its nature and origins are not well understood. Another type of discharge are small, discrete lightning flashes, which start occurring later on within the eruption cloud and are similar to atmospheric lightning.\nDuring the 2015 field program we studied the characteristics of continuous RF and discrete flashes during volcanic eruptions of Sakurajima volcano using a comprehensive set of instrumentation. This included a 10-station 3-D Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) that operated in 10 μs high time resolution mode, slow and fast ΔE antennas, a VHF flat-plate antenna operating in the 20-80 MHz band, log-RF waveforms within the 60-66 MHz band, an infra-red video camera, a high-sensitivity Watec video camera, two high-speed video cameras, and still cameras.\nWe present correlated LMA, waveform, photographs and video recordings of continuous RF and discrete volcanic lightning flashes. We discuss the nature of continuous RF and its possible origins, and how it compares to VHF emissions from regular, discrete flashes.

            "abstract": "Many volcanoes produce some level of precursory activity prior to a large eruption. However, this activity may only be detected depending on the available monitoring system in place. In certain cases, precursors can be interpreted to make forecasts about the timing and magnitude of the impending eruption. Furthermore, changes in this activity are used to determine the style of the eruption provided the mechanics producing these precursory signals are properly understood. One important precursory measurement is the rate of volcanic gas exsolution. In particular CO2 and SO2 are measured to predict changes in the magma depth as well as its composition. Another important precursory measurement is the thermal flux discharged from summit vents. For example, three precursory periods at Kliuchevskoi volcano in 2005, 2007, and 2009 were studied using thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data obtained from both the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. TIR data is also sensitive to the spectral absorbance of volcanogenic SO2. Software to detect and model SO2 flux has now been applied to previously-acquired ASTER data of these three eruptions at Kliuchevskoi. By directly comparing the measured thermal flux and the modelled SO2 flux during the precursory period, the mechanisms leading to the larger eruption are better resolved. Applying these same techniques to future precursory activity would allow the type and duration until onset of the impending eruption to be better predicted in the precursory phase.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The measurement of stable isotope ratios of water has become fundamental in advancing our understanding of environmental patterns and processes, particularly with respect to understanding the movement of water within the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. While considerable research has explored the temporal variation in stable isotope ratios of water in the environment, our understanding of the spatial variability of these isotopes remains poorly understood.\nMethods: We collected spatially explicit samples of throughfall and soil water (n=150 locations) from a 1 ha plot delineated in a mixed deciduous forest in the northern Alps of Switzerland. We complemented this with fully sunlit branch and leaf samples (n = 60 individuals) collected from Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica between 14:00 and 16:00 on the same day by means of a helicopter. Soil and plant waters were extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation and all samples were analyzed for δ18O using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.\nResults: The mean δ18O of throughfall (-3.3 ± 0.8‰) indicated some evaporative enrichment associated with passage through the canopy, but this did not significantly differ from the precipitation collected in nearby open sites (-4.05‰). However, soil was depleted (-7.0 ± 1.8‰) compared to throughfall and there was no significant relationship between the two, suggesting that the sampling for precipitation inputs did not capture all the sources (e.g. stream water, which was -11.5‰) contributing to soil water δ18O ratios. Evaporative enrichment of δ18O was higher in leaves of Fagus (14.8 ± 1.8‰) than in leaves of Picea (11.8 ± 1.7‰). Sampling within crowns of each species (n = 5 branches each from 5 individuals) indicated that variability in a single individual is similar to that among individuals.\nDiscussion: Stable isotopes of water are frequently engaged for studies of ecohydrology, plant ecophysiology, and paleoclimatology. Our results help constrain the variability within different water sources across space (e.g. when vizualized as isoscapes), as well as the extent of fractionation among those sources as water moves through the critical zone. In doing so, we also provide insight into how environment shapes this fine-scale variation in order to inform future applications of water isotopes.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to propose a methodology combing multi-temporal\nX-band SAR images (TerraSAR-X) with continuous ground thetaprobe measurements, for the retrieval of surface soil moisture and texture at a high spatial resolution. Our analysis is based on seven radar images acquired at a 36° incidence angle in the HH polarization, over a semi-arid site in Tunisia (North Africa). All ground measurements of surface soil parameters were carried out over several bare soil reference fields located at the Kairouan site. Between November 2013 and January 2014 (three months), ground campaigns were carried out at the same time as the seven satellite acquisitions. The soil moisture estimations are based on an empirical change detection approach using TerraSAR-X data and ground auxiliary thetaprobe network measurements. Two assumptions were tested: (1) roughness variations during the three-month radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. For the two considered approaches, the soil moisture estimations were validated using ground measurements acquired over fifteen test fields, under different moisture conditions. These comparisons lead to a volumetric moisture RMSE equal to 3.8% and 3.3%, and a bias equal to 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively.\nBy considering the estimated temporal dynamics of soil moisture, a methodology is proposed for the retrieval of clay and sand content (expressed as percentages) in soil. Two empirical relationships were established between the mean moisture values retrieved from the seven acquired radar images and the two soil texture components over 36 test fields. Validation of the proposed approach was carried out over a second set of 34 fields, showing that highly accurate clay estimations can be achieved. For clay and sand, we retrieve an rms error equal to 10.8% (equivalent to 108 g/kg) and 18.6% (equivalent to 186 g/kg), respectively.\nMaps of soil moisture, clay and sand percentages at the studied site are derived.",

In this study we investigated ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and the possible factors that control these fluxes, such as the water level soil temperature and the soil redox potential. Trace gas fluxes were measured using an eddy covariance system installed on a 28 m tall tower. The study area was chosen because it is densely vegetated and experiences a seasonal flood pulse of about 6 months, which is typical for the Northern Pantanal. The measurements were performed over two flood cycles, from December to June 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Methane fluxes showed a seasonal progression, with higher emission rates during the flooding period and near zero fluxes prior to inundation and again after recession. Major peaks of CH4 (0.30 µmol m-2 s-1) were observed after the soil became completely flooded and soil redox values were < -200 mV. The average (± sd) values of CH4 flux for the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons were 0.10 ± 0.06 µmol m-2 s-1 and 0.14 ± 0.04 µmol m-2 s-1, respectively. In contrast, CO2 fluxes are strongly negative during the flooded period, indicating net CO2 uptake by the forest, with average (± sd) values of -4.12 ± 3.34 µmol m-2 s-1 for 2013/2014 and -4.14 ± 2.62 µmol m-2 s-1 for 2014/2015. These data indicate that seasonally flooded forests of the Pantanal are potentially large sinks for CO2 but strong sources for CH4, especially during the flood pulse when anaerobic soil conditions concomitantly enhance CH4 production and limit CO2 production",

To help meet the strategic needs of the U.S. SEARCH-AON program and facilitate the development of SAON and other related initiatives, the Arctic Observing Viewer (AOV;\nhttp://ArcticObservingViewer.org\n) has been developed. This web mapping application compiles detailed information pertaining to U.S. Arctic Observing efforts. Contributing partners include the U.S. NSF, USGS, ACADIS, ADIwg, AOOS, a2dc, AON, ARMAP, BAID, IASOA, INTERACT, and others. Over 7700 observation sites are currently in the AOV database and the application allows users to visualize, navigate, select, advance search, draw, print, and more. During 2015, the web mapping application has been enhanced by the addition of a query builder that allows users to create rich and complex queries. AOV is founded on principles of software and data interoperability and includes an emerging \"Project\" metadata standard, which uses ISO 19115-1 and compatible web services. Substantial efforts have focused on maintaining and centralizing all database information. In order to keep up with emerging technologies, the AOV data set has been structured and centralized within a relational database and the application front-end has been ported to HTML5 to enable mobile access. Other application enhancements include an embedded Apache Solr search platform which provides users with the capability to perform advance searches and an administration web based data management system that allows administrators to add, update, and delete information in real time. We encourage all collaborators to use AOV tools and services for their own purposes and to help us extend the impact of our efforts and ensure AOV complements other cyber-resources. Reinforcing dispersed but interoperable resources in this way will help to ensure improved capacities for conducting activities such as assessing the status of arctic observing efforts, optimizing logistic operations, and for quickly accessing external and project-focused web resources for more detailed information and access to scientific data and derived products.",

New data from continuous GPS stations (cGPS) and re-occupied campaign GPS stations (eGPS) obtained between 2014 and 2015 allowed us to update the velocity field of the PRVI GPS Network and redefine the existing plate kinematics model of the PRVI microplate from previous measurements (Jansma et al., 2000; Jansma & Mattioli, 2005). Geodetic datasets for this epoch were processed with GIPSY/OASIS II (v.6.2) using an absolute point positioning strategy with final, precise orbits and clocks from JPL (IGS08). Results of sites velocity in the PRVI block are presented with respect to North America and Caribbean reference frames in ITRF08. The horizontal velocity components were used to calculate baseline lengths changes between selected GPS stations that span on-land faults and microplate boundaries, thus allowing quantification of internal deformation within the PRVI block. This enables us to locate zones of active deformation and faulting in order to understand how the relative motion between geological structures is accommodated. Our updated velocity field constrains intraplate deformation to 1-3 mm/yr across the PRVI microplate and active extension of 1-2 mm/yr in the Anegada passage eastern boundary. In addition, counterclockwise rotation has been observed and may be related to the deformation in southwestern Puerto Rico continuing offshore to the Muertos Trough along PRVI’s southern boundary. Despite the PRVI microplate slow motion and small deformation, increasing velocities from east to west coincides with the most active microseismic zone and ongoing deformation in southwestern Puerto Rico suggesting independent motion along this segment of the PRVI block.",

Integrated models are needed to elucidate how shifts in vegetation communities driven by soil moisture can predict plant community composition and biomass changes that alter the balance of carbon cycling and export to aquatic systems. Soil saturation has long been recognized as an important control on many ecological and biogeochemical relationships in coastal rainforests. However, the lack of working models for soil drainage with enough precision to provide accurate site assessments has limited interpretations of biogeochemical fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems to coastal zones. We have established a hydropedological model that can be used to identify the spatial distribution and seasonal fluctuations of soil saturation and associated anaerobic conditions in soils. Periods of critical DOC loading and peak export associated with these conditions highlight the ability of rainforest soils to produce copious quantities of dissolved organic carbon export to streams. The loading of dissolved organic carbon to streams is closely coupled to seasonal temperature cycles, but constrained by the flow of water through the soil matrix. Episodic storm surges produce varying amounts of dissolved organic carbon flow depending on antecedent conditions. The largest amount of dissolved organic carbon loading to streams occurs after peak temperature and coincident with higher storm surges. Dissolved organic carbon flows more frequently and in higher quantities from wetland soils, but is also produced in large quantities from upland soils. These advances in modeling hydropedologic functions and dissolved organic carbon export establish a framework for climate change vulnerability assessments in rainforest soils.",

Despite these ecosystem effects, the drivers of shrub expansion have not been precisely established at the landscape scale. This project examined two proposed anthropogenic drivers: global climate change and local infrastructure development, a press disturbance that generates high levels of dust deposition. Effects of global change were studied using dendrochronology to establish a relationship between climate and annual growth in Betula and Salix shrubs growing in the Alaskan low Arctic. To understand the spatial heterogeneity of shrub expansion, this analysis was replicated in shrub populations across levels of landscape properties including soil moisture and substrate age. Effects of dust deposition on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photosynthetic rate were measured on transects up to 625 meters from the Dalton Highway. Dust deposition rates decreased exponentially with distance from road, matching previous models of road dust deposition. NDVI tracked deposition rates closely, but photosynthetic rates were not strongly affected by deposition. These results suggest that dust deposition may locally bias remote sensing measurements such as NDVI, without altering internal physiological processes such as photosynthesis in arctic shrubs. Distinguishing between the effects of landscape properties, climate, and disturbance will improve our predictions of the biogeochemical feedbacks of arctic shrub expansion, with potential application in climate change modeling.",

            "abstract": "Wettability of reservoir minerals along pore surfaces plays a controlling role in capillary trapping of supercritical (sc) CO2 in geologic carbon sequestration. The mechanisms controlling scCO2 residual trapping are still not fully understood. We studied the effect of pore surface wettability on CO2 residual saturation at the pore-scale using engineered high pressure and high temperature micromodel (transparent pore networks) experiments and numerical modeling. Through chemical treatment of the micromodel pore surfaces, water-wet, intermediate-wet, and CO2-wet micromodels can be obtained. Both drainage and imbibition experiments were conducted at 8.5 MPa and 45 °C with controlled flow rate. Dynamic images of fluid-fluid displacement processes were recorded using a microscope with a CCD camera. Residual saturations were determined by analysis of late stage imbibition images of flow path structures. We performed direct numerical simulations of the full Navier–Stokes equations using a volume-of-fluid based finite-volume framework for the primary drainage and the followed imbibition for the micromodel experiments with different contact angles. The numerical simulations agreed well with our experimental observations. We found that more scCO2 can be trapped within the CO2-wet micromodel whereas lower residual scCO2 saturation occurred within the water-wet micromodels in both our experiments and the numerical simulations. These results provide direct and consistent evidence of the effect of wettability, and have important implications for scCO2 trapping in geologic carbon sequestration.",

            "abstract": "Radiosondes are balloon-borne meteorological sensors used to acquire profiles of temperature and humidity. Radiosonde data are essential inputs for numerical weather prediction models and are used for climate research, particularly in the creation of reanalysis products. However, radiosonde programs are costly to maintain, in particular in the remote regions of the Arctic (e.g., $440,000/yr at Summit, Greenland), where only 40 of approximately 1000 routine global launches are made. The climate of this data-sparse region is poorly understood and forecast data assimilation procedures are designed for global applications. Thus, observations may be rejected from the data assimilation because they are too far from the model expectations. For the most cost-efficient deployment of resources and to improve forecasting methods, analyses of the effectiveness of individual radiosonde programs are necessary. Here, we evaluate how radiosondes launched twice daily (0 and 12 UTC) from Summit Station, Greenland, (72.58⁰N, 38.48⁰W, 3210 masl) influence the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) operational forecasts from June 2013 through May of 2015. A statistical analysis is conducted to determine the impact of the observations on the forecast model and the meteorological regimes that the model fails to reproduce are identified. Assimilation rates in the inversion layer are lower than any other part of the troposphere. Above the inversion, assimilation rates range from 85%-100%, 60%-98%, and > 99% for temperature, humidity, and wind, respectively. The lowest assimilation rates are found near the surface, possibly associated with biases in the representation of the temperature inversion by the ECMWF model at Summit. Consequently, assimilation rates are lower near the surface during winter when strong temperature inversions are frequently observed. Our findings benefit the scientific community who uses this information for climatological analysis of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and thus further analysis is warranted.",

While photoperiod often acts as an ultimate control on phenological events, recent studies have shown that environmental cues such as temperature and soil water content can modify the direction and rate of senescence processes. Warmer temperatures have resulted in an observed trend towards delayed senescence across temperate latitudes. However, Arctic regions are characterized by extreme seasonality and rapidly decreasing photoperiod, and consequently senescence may not shift as climate warms. We monitored the timing of Arctic plant community senescence for three years under the framework of an experimental manipulation that altered seasonal phenological cues through warming and earlier snowmelt. Alternative models of senescence were tested to determine if microclimate (air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture) or start of season phenology affect the timing and rate of community senescence. We found that all three microclimate predictors contributed to explaining variation in timing of senescence, suggesting that photoperiod is not the sole control on timing of senescence in Arctic plant communities. Rather, increased air and soil temperatures along with drier soil conditions, led to acceleration in the onset of senescence at a community level. Our data suggest that (1) multiple climate drivers predict timing of plant community senescence, and (2) climate change could result in a shorter peak season due to earlier onset of senescence, which would decrease the potential carbon uptake in moist acidic tundra.",

            "abstract": "Shallow ground ice in the equatorial region on Mars would be quickly lost to sublimation under current Martian climate conditions; however, it may persist at depth since its suggested formation during the most recent high obliquity of 32º approximately 500 ka ago when ice is believed to have been stable here. Ground‑based measurements by Curiosity Rover’s Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) enable a detailed study of the processes that determine the rate of sublimation and the subsurface transport of heat and water vapor at Gale Crater. This study is prompted by an analogous investigation in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica where ground ice is currently unstable but has persisted ~0.5 m below the surface for over 1 Ma. A heat and vapor diffusion model is developed to understand the ground thermal regime and the persistence of potential ground ice in the equatorial region of Mars using the first year of data collected by Curiosity. Based on the derived thermal properties of dry regolith, including thermal inertia values ranging from 300 to 450 J m–2 K–1 s–1/2, diurnal and annual temperature variations propagate to depths of 0.05 m and 1.3 m, respectively. The modeled rate of water‑vapor escape from the ground ice to the atmosphere corresponds to a sublimation rate of ~350 m Ma−1 for ice at the ground surface; however, the sublimation rates increasingly deceases with depth as overlying dry regolith thickens. We explore whether interstitial ground ice that formed at Gale Crater ~500 ka ago during the last high obliquity period could currently exist at shallow depths. While this study does not account for the effects of replenishing processes, adsorption, diffusion-advection, and climate change influenced by obliquity, it highlights the potential persistence of ground ice and implications for future missions on Mars.",

            "abstract": "Textbooks show a simple picture of the tectonics of the North Pacific, with discrete deformation along the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates along the Aleutian megathrust and Fairweather/Queen Charlotte fault system. Reality is much more complex, with a pattern of broadly distributed deformation. This is in part due to a number of studies and initiatives (such as PBO) in recent years that have greatly expanded the density of GPS data throughout the region. We present an overview of the GPS data acquired and various tectonic interpretations developed over the past decade and discuss a current effort to integrate the available data into a regional tectonic model for Alaska and northwestern Canada.\nRather than discrete plate boundaries, we observe zones of concentrated deformation where the majority of the relative plate motion is accommodated. Within these zones, there are major fault systems, such as the Fairweather-Queen Charlotte transform and the Aleutian megathrust, where most of the deformation occurs along a main structure, but often motion is instead partitioned across multiple faults, such as the fold-and-thrust belt of the eastern St. Elias orogen. In zones of particular complexity, such as the eastern syntaxis of the St. Elias orogen, the deformation is better described by continuum deformation than localized strain along crustal structures. Strain is transferred far inboard, either by diffuse deformation or along fault system such as the Denali fault, and outboard of the main zones of deformation. The upper plate, if it can be called such, consists of a number of blocks and deforming zones while the lower plate is segmented between the Yakutat block and Pacific plate and is also likely undergoing internal deformation.",

            "abstract": "In future projections the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle is a hotspot for changes driven by rising CO2 emissions. Concomitantly, the Arctic Ocean hydrodynamic regime undergoes substantial shifts so the net effect on the carbon cycle is not intuitively clear. In the high CO2 scenario RCP8.5 extended until 2300 in projections of the Max Planck Institute's Earth System Model, the averaged Arctic Ocean surface temperature rises by 4°C in 2100 and by 10°C in 2300, respectively. The Arctic becomes free of summer sea ice in the second half of the 21st century, whereas winter sea ice disappears at the beginning of the 23rd century. Owing to increased sea ice melting and runoff, fresh water content increases gradually until the end of the 22nd century and then drops abruptly as a result of an intensification of the saline Atlantic water inflow. Accumulation of Atlantic water collapses the halocline in the central basin of the Arctic Ocean by the first half of the 23rd century. Ongoing warming enhances thermal stratification and the mixed layer shoales. In contrast, halocline erosion and the cooling of the ice free water act in concert to favor formation of convection cells in the central basin. Freshening in the Canada basin and transport of salty water into the Eurasian basin generate a dipole structure in the anomalies of surface salinity. Driven by the rising CO2, the averaged dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is growing. Changes in the averaged total alkalinity (TA) go along with the fresh water content evolution and decreasing carbonate ion concentration so that TA drops below preindustrial values. Yet, along with salinity, the Eurasian basin receives waters with higher DIC and TA from the Atlantic. As a result, the distributions of TA and DIC anomalies resemble the dipole pattern projected for salinity. We show that while future changes in the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle proceed at rates determined by atmospheric CO2 levels, the regional patterns are driven by shifts in the hydrodynamic regime. ",

            "abstract": "The chemical composition of the Earth is traditionally explained in terms of evolution from a solar-like composition, similar to that found in primitive ‘chondritic’ meteorites. It now appears, however, that the silicate Earth is not ‘chondritic’, but depleted in incompatible elements, including refractory lithophile and heat-producing elements. Either Earth lost material during planet-building due to collisional erosion or else internal differentiation processes produced a hidden reservoir deep in the early Earth.\nSulfide in the core may provide a reservoir capable of balancing the composition of the silicate Earth. Recent experimental work suggests that the core contains a significant proportion of sulfide, added during the final stages of accretion and new data suggests that at high pressures sulfide can incorporate a substantial amount of refractory lithophile and heat-producing elements [1]. Pioneering work using the short-lived 146Sm-142Nd system strongly suggests that Earth’s silicate mantle is non-chondritic [e.g. 2]. The drawback of such radiogenic isotope systems is that it is not possible to distinguish the fractionation of Sm/Nd that occurs during silicate melting from that occurring during the segregation of a sulfide-melt to form the core.\nNeodymium stable isotopes have the potential to provide just such a tracer of sulfide segregation, because there is a significant contrast in bonding environment between sulfide and silicate, where heavy isotopes should be preferentially incorporated into high force-constant bonds involving REE3+ (i.e. the silicate mantle). Preliminary data indicate that mantle rocks do indeed possess heavier 146Nd/144Nd values than chondritic meteorites, consistent with the removal of light Nd into sulfide in the core, driving the residual mantle to heavy values. Overall, our isotope and elemental data indicate that the rare earths and other incompatible elements are substantially incorporated into sulfide. While Nd Stable isotope data for chondritic meteorites and mantle rocks, are consistent with the segregation of sulfide to the core.\n[1] Wohlers &Wood, Nature 520, 337 (2015) [2] Boyet & Carlson, Science 309, 576 (2005)",

Pre-event astrometry allowed for an in-flight update to the SOFIA team with the result that SOFIA was deep within the central flash zone. Combined analysis of the data sets leads to the result that Pluto's middle atmosphere is essentially unchanged from 2011 and 2013 (Person et al. 2013; Bosh et al. 2015); there has been no significant expansion or contraction of the atmosphere. Additionally, we find that a haze component in the atmosphere is required to reproduce the light curves obtained. This haze scenario has implications for understanding the photochemistry of Pluto's atmosphere.\nThis work was supported by NASA grants NNX15AJ82G (Lowell Observatory), NNX10AB27G (MIT), and NNX12AJ29G (Williams), and by the National Research Foundation of South Africa.

We demonstrate techniques for indirectly and nondestructively retrieves foliage elements’ orientation and distribution from point cloud data (PCD) obtained using a terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) approach.\nAn equation with a single parameter for characterizing the leaf angular distribution of crowns was developed. The TLS-based algorithm captures 97.4% (RMSE =1 .094 degrees, p<0.001) variation of the leaf inclination angle compared to manual measurements for an artiﬁcial tree. When applied to a live tree seedling and a mature tree crown, the TLS-based algorithm predicts 78.51% (RMSE =1 .225 degrees, p<0.001) and 57.28% (RMSE =4 .412 degrees, p<0.001) of the angular variability, respectively. Furthermore we demonstrate our approach for retrieve of biophysical characteristics of the forest canopy including extinction coefﬁcient, gap fraction, overlapping effect, and effective leaf area Index (ELAI). Out ELAI model captures 88.7% (rmse =0 .007, p<0.001, andn = 30) variation of the destructive-sample-based leaf area measurement results and 89.1% (rmse =0 .01; p<0.001) of the variation in results from digital hemispherical photographs. Finally we demonstrate how scanner setup which includes lateral scans can reduce effects of occlusion in terrestrial laser data collection.",

Several previous studies have used SuperDARN mesospheric wind measurements to study planetary wave activity, tidal activity and long term analysis of mean winds. Here, we focus on examining interannual variability in the mean zonal winds due to Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) using 13 years of mesospheric wind data collected by mid-latitude Saskatoon SuperDARN radar. Previous studies have reported\nthat easterly phase of mesospheric QBO leads to increased planetary wave activity in high-latitude mesosphere. However,we find that the Holton Tan effect extends into the mesosphere as easterly phase of stratospheric QBO leads to high mesospheric planetary wave activity such that there is an increase in late winter westerly winds and spring easterly winds. We speculate that altering of gravity waves through stratospheric winds plays a major role for producing the QBO modulation of the winds in the mid-latitude mesosphere, thereby vertically and latitudinally coupling the equatorial stratospheric winds and high latitude mesospheric winds during late winter and spring.",

Considering this, it is important that ozone levels are monitored. While municipal air quality monitors are present in cities like Boulder, Colorado, these monitors often only consider regional analysis, neglecting the variability of compounds, such as ozone or carbon monoxide, over smaller distances. Small-scale (approximately 1 kilometer) spatial variability in ozone is important because humans experience these small scales on a daily basis. Using low-cost, next-generation air quality monitors (“pods”) developed at the University of Colorado-Boulder, we assessed small-scale spatial variability of surface ozone in Boulder, Colorado. This was done by placing clusters of 4-5 pods within approximately 1 kilometer of each other at specific sites in the city of Boulder. We collected data at two sites: one on the University of Colorado-Boulder campus (i.e., an urban site) and one outside of the city (i.e., a rural site). Pods were left in their positions for one to two weeks allowing for observation of ozone trends. As expected the typical diurnal trend was observed; however, further analysis revealed differences between these daily trends. Data collected by the pods allows for better understanding of small-scale spatial variability of surface ozone and how this may be driven by nearby sources.",

            "abstract": "To better understand equable paleoclimates, Arctic amplification of winter warming, and the high-latitude lapse-rate feedback, we investigate the process of Arctic air formation, wherein a high latitude maritime air mass is advected over land during polar night and strongly cooled from the surface up. We extend previous work done using a single-column model (Cronin and Tziperman, PNAS, in press) by performing two-dimensional idealized cloud-resolving simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Quantitatively consistent with previous results, we find that as the initial atmospheric state is warmed, increases in low cloud amount reduce the average surface cooling over a 14-day period by roughly a degree for each degree of warming of the initial atmospheric state, with the feedback strength increasing with warming. This is primarily attributed to a monotonic increase in surface cloud radiative forcing of approximately 2 W m-2 for each degree that the initial atmospheric sounding is warmed. The use of a two-dimensional model as opposed to a single-column model shows that the lower-tropospheric cloud layer becomes more turbulent and dominated by cumulus clouds as the climate is warmed, yet the cloud fraction remains high owing to the continued prevalence of stratus and fog layers. These results are robust across a variety of cloud microphysics schemes and are not sensitive to the horizontal or vertical resolution of the model. We also explore the vertical structure and horizontal variability of the bulk horizontal flow, the sensitivity of the results to subsidence and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and the contrasting roles of top-of-atmosphere and surface cloud radiative effects.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between some of the leading atmospheric teleconnections and Greenland temperature, precipitation, and surface mass balance (SMB) are investigated for the last 36 summers (1979-2014) based on MERRA-2 reanalyses and GPCP precipitation. The results show that the negative phase of both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO), associated with warm and dry conditions, lead to SMB decreases by 0-1 months. Furthermore, the positive phase of the East Atlantic (EA) pattern often lags the negative NAO, reflecting a dynamical linkage between these modes that acts to further enhance the warm and dry condition over Greenland, leading to a favorable environment for enhanced ice mass loss. The most significant relationships between these teleconnections and temperature (precipitation) occur predominantly over southwestern (southern) Greenland.\nA combination of the NAO, AO, and EA (referred to as the NAE) explains the Greenland summer climate variation somewhat better than the NAO alone (corr.= 0.66 versus 0.60). The NAE, however, fails to account for the recent cool summers of 2009, 2011, as well as those of the early 1990’s (following the eruption of Pinatubo). During 2009 and 2011, westward shifted (compared to what occurred during the severe ice mass loss cases of 2010 and 2012) local high pressure blocking produced colder northerly flow over Greenland inhibiting ice mass melting, despite the occurrence of a strong negative NAO. In general, anomalous anticyclonic or cyclonic circulation cells over Greenland produce advective temperature changes that primarily impact western Greenland, while changes in net surface radiative fluxes account for both western and eastern Greenland temperature changes. The NAE faithfully captures the observed SMB and runoff variability such that smaller (larger) SMB and larger (smaller) runoff than average occurs in severe (modest) ice loss summers.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands can be effective carbon sinks due to limited decomposition rates in anaerobic soil. As such there is a growing interest in the use of restored wetlands as biological carbon sequestration projects for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs. However, using wetlands to offset emissions requires accurate accounting of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange since wetlands are also sources of CH4. To date few studies have quantified CO2 and CH4 exchange from restored wetlands or assessed how these fluxes vary during ecosystem development. In this study, we report on multiple years of eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from two restored freshwater marshes of differing ages (one restored in 1997 and the other in 2010) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, CA. Measurements at the younger restored wetland started in October 2010 and began in April 2011 at the older site.\nThe younger restored wetland showed considerable year-to-year variability in the first 4 years following restoration, with CO2 uptake ranging from 12 to 420 g C-CO2 m-2 yr-1. Net CO2 uptake at the older wetland was overall greater than at the younger site, ranging from 292 to 585 g C-CO2 m-2 yr-1. Methane emissions were on average higher at the younger wetland (46 g C-CH4 m-2 yr-1) relative to the older one (33 g C-CH4 m-2 yr-1). In terms of the GHG budgets (assuming a global warming potential of 34), the younger wetland was consistently a GHG source, emitting on average 1439 g CO2 eq m-2 yr-1, while the older wetland was a GHG sink in two of the years of measurement (sequestering 651 and 780 g CO2 eq m-2 yr-1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively) and a source of 750 g CO2 eq m-2 yr-1 in 2014. This study highlights how dynamic CO2 and CH4 fluxes are in the first years following wetland restoration and suggests that restored wetlands have the potential to act as GHG sinks but this may depend on time since restoration.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial magnetosphere has the capability to rapidly accelerate charged particles up to very high energies over relatively short times and distances. These energetic particles are injected from the magnetotail into the inner magnetosphere through two primary mechanisms. One transport method is the potential-driven convection during periods of southward IMF, which allows part of the dawn-to-dusk solar wind electric field to effectively map down to the polar ionosphere. The second transport process, substorm activity, involves a sudden reconfiguration of the magnetic field and the creation of transient induced electric fields.\nHowever, it is not possible to distinguish the two terms by only measuring the electric field, which is typically just the potential field. Assessing the relative contribution of potential versus inductive electric fields at the energization of the hot ion population in the inner magnetosphere is only possible by thorough examination of the time varying magnetic field and current systems using global modeling of the entire system.\nWe calculate the induced electric field via a 3D integration over the entire magnetosphere domain. This full volume integration approach removes the need to trace independent field lines and lifts the assumption that the magnetic field lines can be treated as frozen in a stationary ionosphere. We quantify the relative contributions of potential and inductive electric fields at driving plasma sheet ions into the inner magnetosphere during disturbed conditions. The consequence of these injections on the distortion of the near-Earth magnetic field and current systems have been rarely separated in order to determine their relative effectiveness from a global perspective.",

Apart from its ability to change the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, methane is also a significant precursor to the formation of formaldehyde, an important radical source. Thus, emissions of methane from facilities need to be understood since they can have air quality implications through alteration of the radical budget and hence, the oxidation capacity of the air mass. Methane was measured, along with other gases, via a cavity ring-down spectroscopy instrument installed on the Convair-580 aircraft. In total, there were 22 flights with 82 hours of measurements in the vicinity of oil sands facilities between August 13 and September 7, 2013. Various tools have been used to visualize the spatial and temporal variation in mixing ratios of methane and other trace gases in order to identify possible sources of methane. Enhancements of methane from background levels of 1.9 ppm up to ~4 ppm were observed close to energy mining facilities in the oil sands region. Sources of methane identified include open pit mining, tailings ponds, upgrader stacks and in-situ mining operations. Quantification of the emission rates of methane from distinct sources has been accomplished from box flights and downwind screen flights by identifying the ratios of trace gases emitted and through use of the Top-down Emission Rate Retrieval Algorithm (TERRA). Methane emission rates for some of these sources will be presented.",

Future flood risk is estimated using population and GDP exposures consistent with the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. Population and GDP are defined as being affected by a flood when a grid cell receives any depth of flood inundation.\nThe earthquake hazard is quantified using a 10,000-year stochastic catalog of over 15.8 million synthetic earthquake events of at least magnitude 5. Ground motion prediction and estimates of local site conditions are used to determine PGA. Future earthquake risk is estimated using population and GDP exposures consistent with all five SSPs. Population and GDP are defined as being affected by an earthquake when a grid cell experiences ground motion equaling or exceeding MMI VI.\nFor most countries, changes in exposure alter flood risk to a greater extent than changes in climate. For both flood and earthquake, the spread in risk grows over time. There are large uncertainties due to the methodology; however, the results are not meant to be definitive. Instead they will be used to initiate discussions with governments regarding efforts to manage disaster risk.",

            "abstract": "Regional warming and increases in tree growth are contributing to increased productivity near the western forest margin in Alaska. The effects of warming on seedling recruitment has received little attention, in spite of forecasted forest expansion near western treeline. Here, we used stand structure and environmental data from white spruce (Picea glauca) stands (n = 95) sampled across a longitudinal gradient to explore factors influencing white spruce growth, establishment and recruitment in southwest Alaska. Using tree-ring chronologies developed from a subset of the plots (n = 30), we estimated establishment dates and basal area increment (BAI) for trees of all age classes across a range of site conditions. We used GLMs (generalized linear models) to explore the relationship between tree growth and temperature in undisturbed, low elevation sites along the gradient, using BAI averaged over the years 1975-2000. In addition, we examined the relationship between growing degree days (GDD) and seedling establishment over the previous three decades. We used total counts of live seedlings, saplings and live and dead trees, representing four cohorts, to evaluate whether geospatial, climate, and measured plot covariates predicted abundance of the different size classes. We hypothesized that the relationship between abundance and longitude would vary by size class, and that this relationship would be mediated by growing season temperature. We found that mean BAI for trees in undisturbed, low elevation sites increased with July maximum temperature, and that the slope of the relationship with temperature changed with longitude (interaction significant with 90% confidence). White spruce establishment was positively associated with longer summers and/or greater heat accumulation, as inferred from GDD. Seedling, sapling and tree abundance were also positively correlated with temperature across the study area. The response to longitude was mixed, with smaller size classes (seedlings, small saplings) most abundant at the western end of the gradient, and larger size classes (trees) most abundant to the east, suggesting a moving front of white spruce establishment near western treeline.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - McNicol_AGU2015_FINAL.pdf\nSeminal wetland research in the 1990s demonstrated that annual methane (CH4) fluxes scaled positively with ecosystem production across distinctive wetlands globally. This relationship implies a model of flooded wetland ecosystems as ‘methanogenic black-boxes’; poised at a low redox state, and tending to release a fixed fraction of incoming annual productivity as CH4. In contrast, recent studies have reported high ratios of carbon dioxide (CO2) to CH4 emissions, and are adding to a body of evidence suggesting wetlands can vary more widely in their redox state. To explore this apparent incongruence we used principles of redox thermodynamics and laboratory experiments to develop predictions of wetland greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes under different redox regimes. We then used a field study to test the hypothesis that ecosystem seasonality in gross primary productivity (GPP) and temperature would drive changes in GHG emissions, mediated by a dynamic - as opposed to static - redox regime.\nWe estimated wetland GHG emissions from an emergent marsh in the Sacramento Delta, CA from March 2014-2015. We measured CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions via diffusion and ebullition with manual sampling, and whole-ecosystem fluxes of CO2 and CH4 using eddy-covariance. Ebullition and diffusive CH4 fluxes were strongly seasonal, with minimum rates (0.86 and 0.35 mg C-CH­­4 m-2 yr-1, respectively) during winter, and maximum rates (1.3 and 1.8 g C-CH­­4 m-2 yr-1, respectively) during the summer growing season. In contrast, winter diffusive CO2 fluxes (494 g C-CO2 m-2 yr-1) and fall bubble CO2 concentrations (1.49%) were highest, despite being seasons of lower GPP, temperature, and CH4 flux. Further, diffusive and ebullition fluxes of N2O showed zero net flux only during spring and summer months, whereas the wetland was a significant source of N2O during winter (81.2 ± 24.4 mg N-N2O m-2 yr-1). These seasonal flux dynamics contradict a ‘methanogenic black box’ model of wetland redox, which predicts carbon limitation of, and concurrent maxima in, heterotrophic CO2 and CH4 emissions, and no significant N2O emissions. Rather these results suggest that wetlands can function as dynamic redox environments where GHG emission rate and composition varies predictably in time with seasonal changes in GPP and temperature.",

            "abstract": "Climate models suffer from long-standing biases including the double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) problem and the excessive westward extension of the equatorial Pacific cold tongue. An atmospheric general circulation model is used to investigate how model biases in the mean state affect the projection of tropical climate change. The model is forced with a pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) increase derived from a coupled simulation of global warming but uses an SST climatology derived from either observations or a coupled historical simulation. The comparison of the experiments reveals that the climatological biases have important impacts on projected changes in the tropics. Specifically, during February-April when the climatological ITCZ displaces spuriously into the Southern Hemisphere, the model overestimates (underestimates) the projected rainfall increase in the warmer climate south (north) of the equator over the eastern Pacific. Furthermore, the global warming-induced Walker circulation slowdown is biased weak in the projection using coupled model climatology, suggesting that the projection of the reduced equatorial Pacific trades may also be under-estimated. This is related to the bias that the climatological Walker circulation is too weak in the model, which is in turn due to too weak mean SST gradient in the zonal direction. Our results highlight the importance of improving the climatological simulation for more reliable projections of regional climate change.",

Using both G. sulfurreducens PCA and D. desulfuricans ND132 strains, we investigated the factors affecting export and distribution of MeHg in mercury [Hg(II)] methylation as well as MeHg sorption and desorption assays. Thiols, such as cysteine, were found to greatly facilitate desorption and export of MeHg, particularly by G. sulfurreducens PCA cells. In short-term cysteine-free assays, we found that >90% of the synthesized MeHg was associated with PCA, among which ~73% was sorbed on the cell surface and 19% remained inside the cells, leaving only a small fraction in the phosphate buffered solution. However, MeHg export by PCA increased with increasing cysteine concentrations (0.05–50 mM), and nearly 100% of the MeHg was in solution in the presence of 50 mM cysteine. In comparison, ND132 cells were much more efficient than PCA in producing and exporting MeHg. In the absence of cysteine, a majority of the MeHg (~70%) was exported in 4 h, leaving about 20% of the MeHg sorbed on the surface and 10% inside the cells. When MeHg was directly added to the cell suspensions, ND132 adsorbed much lower MeHg than PCA cells; however, ND132 cells took up more MeHg (20%) inside cells than PCA did (8%). Taken together, our results demonstrate that MeHg export efficiency is bacteria strain-specific and is influenced by the ligand concentration and complexation, which could be important in facilitating MeHg synthesis and bioavailability in anoxic water and sediments.",

Microbes introduced into the atmosphere can drift, primarily by wind, into natural environments different from their point of origin. Although bioaerosols can impact atmospheric dynamics as well as the ecology and biogeochemistry of terrestrial systems, very little is known about the composition of bioaerosols collected from marine and freshwater environments. The first step to determine composition of airborne microbes is to successfully extract environmental DNA from air filters. We asked 1) can DNA be extracted from quartz (SiO2) air filters? and 2) how can we optimize the DNA yield for downstream metagenomic sequencing? Aerosol filters were collected and archived on a weekly basis from aquatic sites (USA, Bermuda, Israel) over the course of 10 years. We successfully extracted DNA from a subsample of ~ 20 filters. We modified a DNA extraction protocol (Qiagen) by adding a beadbeating step to mechanically shear cell walls in order to optimize our DNA product. We quantified our DNA yield using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 1000). Results indicate that DNA can indeed be extracted from quartz filters. The additional beadbeating step helped increase our yield - up to twice as much DNA product was obtained compared to when this step was omitted. Moreover, bioaerosol DNA content does vary across time. For instance, the DNA extracted from filters from Lake Tahoe, USA collected near the end of June decreased from 9.9 ng/µL in 2007 to 3.8 ng/µL in 2008. Further next-generation sequencing analysis of our extracted DNA will be performed to determine the composition of these microbes. We will also model the meteorological and chemical factors that are good predictors for microbial composition for our samples over time and space.",

Our traveltime datasets include 2100 local earthquakes P-wave arrival times and 5,062 P-wave relative arrival time residuals of teleseismic earthquakes. The local earthquake phase picking was manually corrected and the relative arrival time residuals were estimated using the Multi-Channel Cross-Correlation method. All earthquakes occurred between 2006 and 2007 and were recorded by seismic stations deployed during the Mapping the Rivera Subduction Zone (MARS) experiment. The temporal seismic network consisted of 50 stations equipped with Streckeisen STS-2 and Quanterra Q330. We use an iterative nonlinear tomographic procedure and the fast marching method to map the residual patterns as P wave velocity anomalies. We followed an inversion scheme consisting of: (1) selection of a local and teleseismic earthquake, (2) estimation of improved 1-D reference velocity model, and (3) checkerboard testing to determine the optimum configuration of the velocity nodes, and inversion parameters, finally (4) perform final tomography and results analysis.",

            "abstract": "As anthropogenic climate change warms the Arctic, organic carbon (C) trapped in permafrost is at an increased risk of being released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). At the same time, higher rates of decomposition may increase nutrient availability and enhance plant growth, leading to an uptake of C that may offset respiratory losses. Arctic tundra ecosystems are highly nitrogen (N) limited, and the indirect effects of warming on nutrient availability will be the most likely outcome of increased temperature on plant productivity. This study aims to understand the effects of nutrient addition on arctic CO2 and H2O exchange in a tundra ecosystem at Toolik Lake Field Station, Alaska. The nutrient addition experiment, which began in 2006, is comprised of 7 fertilization treatments: 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 g m-2 of N as NO3- and NH4+ (1:1) with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 g m-2 of phosphorus as PO43-; 5 g m-2 of N as NO3-; 5 g m-2 of N as NH4+, and one control plot. Plot-level CO2 and H2O exchange was measured at 5 light levels 7 times over a four-week period in June and July 2015. We measured ecosystem CO2 and H2O exchange using a rectangular plexiglass chamber (0.49 m2) that was connected to an infrared gas analyzer (LI-840). Other ecosystem variables measured include thaw depth, soil moisture and temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index. After 10 years of nutrient addition, fertilization significantly altered ecosystem C cycling. Soil respiration was greatest in the highest fertilization treatment (2.97 μmol m-2 s-1), increasing linearly with nutrient level at a rate of 0.133 μmol m-2 s-1 per g m-2 of N added (R2=0.914). Net CO2 uptake was greatest under highest fertilization (-2.06 μmol m-2 s-1), decreasing linearly with nutrient addition at a rate of -0.068 μmol m-2 s-1 per g m-2 of N added (R2=0.687). These results suggest that as nutrients become more available under a warmer climate, plant productivity increases may not offset respiratory losses, leading to a positive feedback to global climate.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the microbial impact on C and nutrient cycles is one of the most important challenges in terrestrial biogeochemistry. Transformation of low molecular weight organic substances (LMWOS) is a key step in all biogeochemical cycles because 1) all high molecular substances pass the LMWOS pool during their degradation and 2) only LMWOS can be taken up by microorganisms intact. Thus, the transformations of LMWOS are dominated by biochemical pathways of the soil microorganisms. Thus, understanding fluxes and transformations in soils requires a detailed knowledge on the microbial metabolic network and its control mechanism.\nTracing C fate in soil by isotopes became on of the most applied and promising biogeochemistry tools but studies were nearly exclusively based on uniformly labeled substances. However, such tracers do not allow the differentiation of the intact use of the initial substances from its transformation to metabolites. The novel tool of position-specific labeling enables to trace molecule atoms separately and thus to determine the cleavage of molecules - a prerequisite for metabolic tracing. Position-specific labeling of basic metabolites and quantification of isotope incorporation in CO2 and bulk soil enabled following the basic metabolic pathways of microorganisms. However, the combination of position-specific 13C labeling with compound-specific isotope analysis of microbial biomarkers and metabolites like phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) or amino sugars revealed new insights into the soil fluxome: First, it enables tracing specific anabolic pathways in diverse microbial communities in soils e.g. carbon starvation pathways versus pathways reflecting microbial growth. Second, it allows identification of specific pathways of individual functional microbial groups in soils in situ.\nTracing metabolic pathways and understanding their regulating factors are crucial for soil C fluxomics i.e. the unravaling of the complex network of C transformations. Quantitative models to assess microbial group specific metabolic pathways can be generated and parameterized by this approach. The knowledge of submolecular C transformation steps and its regulating factors is essential for understanding C cycling and long-term C storage in soils.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster.pdf\nWe present observations of substorm onset at Tromsø, Norway. This event was unusually well observed by ground magnetometers, incoherent scatter radar, satellites, an allsky camera and a scintillation monitor in the vicinity of the onset location. At onset, ground magnetometer observations indicate the formation of a westward electrojet above Tromsø and, at the same location, allsky camera images show an arc brightening and moving poleward. Satellite observations are consistent with an onset location at Tromsø, followed by a westward surge of dipolarization. Two features of the ionospheric response are observed by the incoherent scatter radar at Tromsø: 1) At onset, ion drift velocities reduce sharply from 100-400 m/s to roughly zero, consistent with a field-aligned potential drop shielding the ionosphere from magnetospheric convection. 2) There is a two-stage enhancement of the westward electrojet, with each stage directly preceded by an increase of ionization. Both these features are consistent with the theory that the inner magnetosphere acts neither as a current nor a voltage generator during substorm onset.\nFigure shows EISCAT observations of line-of-sight ion drifts, electron and ion temperatures. There is a transition from ExB drift, indicated by a decrease in ion velocity in panel (a), to electron precipitation indicated by increased electron temperatures in panel (b). Substorm onset occurs at the transition time, around 20:02:30 UT. ",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms for high elevation and large-scale deformation of the western U.S. Cordillera have long been a source of controversy. Lowry and Pérez-Gussinyé (2011) suggested abundant quartz in the Cordilleran crust, evidenced by low seismic velocity ratio vP/vS, might be one clue. Here we examine thermal transfer processes to look for additional insight. We calculate temperature at the Moho by modeling the conductive 1D geotherm from observed surface heat flow, and compare these estimates to measurements derived from Pn velocity tomography and mineral physics (Schutt et al., 2015). Moho temperature is moderately sensitive to assumptions regarding crustal radiogenic heating and thermal conductivity, but differences between modeled and measured temperatures exceed the range consistent with reasonable variations in these parameters. Residual (measured minus modeled) Moho temperatures are “cold” in regions deformed during the Laramide flat-slab subduction event. A simple model of transient cooling by cold subducting slab at the base of the lithosphere chills the Moho by a small fraction (<20%) of the observed anomaly.\nIntriguingly, the “cold-Moho anomaly” strongly correlates (R = 0.71) to high elevation (opposite the relationship expected) and also correlates with crustal vP/vS, which in turn correlates to surface heat flow. Recent analyses (Guerri et al., 2015) suggest low crustal vP/vS and density may signal hydration. Geotherm models are sensitive to assumed advective thermal transfer, and we modeled advection consistent with lithospheric extensional strain (i.e., increasing with depth). If instead volatile transfer dominates advection, geotherm modeling predicts a better match of surface heat flow to Moho temperature. We hypothesize that the “cold-Moho anomaly” actually reflects enhanced volatile flux and advective heat transfer from fluids derived from Laramide subduction, and associated volumetric expansion of the crust contributes to high elevation.",

It is a realization of the Bayes’ rule, which gives an approximation to the probability of the snow/soil parameters in condition of the measured microwave TB signals at different bands. Although this method could solve all snow parameters including depth, density, snow grain size and temperature at the same time, it still needs prior information of these parameters for posterior probability calculation. How the priors will influence the SWE retrieval is a big concern. Therefore, in this paper at first, a sensitivity test will be carried out to study how accurate the snow emission models and how explicit the snow priors need to be to maintain the SWE error within certain amount. The synthetic TB simulated from the measured snow properties plus a 2-K observation error will be used for this purpose. It aims to provide a guidance on the MCMC application under different circumstances. Later, the method will be used for the snowpits at different sites, including Sodankyla, Finland, Churchill, Canada and Colorado, USA, using the measured TB from ground-based radiometers at different bands. Based on the previous work, the error in these practical cases will be studied, and the error sources will be separated and quantified.",

FWI is generally recast as the iterative optimization of an\nobjective function that measures the distance between modeled and recorded\ndata. In the framework of local descent methods, FWI requires to perform at\nleast two seismic modelings per source and per FWI iteration.\nDue to the resulting computational burden, applications of elastic FWI have been usually\nrestricted to 2D geometries. Despite the continuous growth of high-performance\ncomputing facilities, application of 3D elastic FWI to real-scale problems\nremain computationally too expensive.\nTo perform elastic seismic modeling with a reasonable amount of time, we\nconsider a reduced computational domain embedded in a larger background model\nin which seismic sources are located. Our aim is to compute repeatedly the\nfull wavefield in the targeted domain after model alteration, once the\nincident wavefield has been computed once for all in the background model. To\nachieve this goal, we use a grid injection method referred to as the Total-Field/Scattered-Field (TF/SF) technique in the\nelectromagnetic community. We implemented the Total-Field/Scattered-Field approach in the\nDiscontinuous Galerkin Finite Element method (DG-FEM) that is used to perform\nmodeling in the local domain. We show how to interface the DG-FEM with any modeling engine (analytical solution, finite difference or finite elements methods) that is suitable for the background simulation.\nOne advantage of the Total-Field/Scattered-Field approach is related to the\nfact that the scattered wavefield instead of the full wavefield enter the\nPMLs, hence making more efficient the absorption of the outgoing waves at the\nouter edges of the computational domain. The domain reduction in which the\nDG-FEM is applied allows us to use modest computational resources opening the\nway for high-resolution imaging by full waveform inversion when the sources\n(and/or receivers) are outside the target zone corresponding to the\ncomputational domain updated during each iteration of the imaging\nprocedure.This modeling strategy finds natural application in target-oriented imaging such as time-lapse imaging.",

            "abstract": "Trace levels of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are increasingly being found in municipal drinking water and natural streams around the world. PhACs enter natural water systems after passing through wastewater treatment plants that have proven to be relatively inefficient at removing them. Once they are released into the environment, they can undergo (1) soil sorption, (2) photodegradation, and/or (3) chemical transformation into structurally similar compounds. The overarching goal of this study is to understand the geochemical fate of common PhACs in the environment. Here we report on our studies with naproxen (NAP) and ibuprofen (IBP) in soils and water. Both compounds are complex nonpolar (aromatic) organic molecules with polar (carboxylic acid) functional groups. The carboxylic functional groups are likely to be deprotonated at environmentally relevant pHs (~4-8).\nSorption studies of both compounds were conducted in clean and relatively acidic (soil pH ~4.5-6.5) natural soils that contained varying levels of organic matter (OM), clay minerals, and Fe oxides. OM was observed to play an important role in each of the above three processes. Sorption was observed to be stronger and nonlinear in higher OM soils, while weaker but still significant in lower OM, higher clay soils; the amphiphilic nature of NAP and IBP combined with the complex charged and nonpolar surfaces available in the soil was observed to control the sorption behavior. Both NAP and IBP underwent rapid photodegradation in aqueous suspensions when exposed to simulated sunlight. The degradation rates were observed to change in the presence of humic acid or fulvic acid. During sorption and photodegradation experiments, common transformation products were observed for both NAP and IBP. The transformation products produced were indicative of chemical transformation and not biological factors. Concentrations of the transformation products were significantly higher in the photoexposed aqueous suspensions compared to that formed in soil solutions. This study also helped in understanding the important role OM plays in geochemical fate of PhACs. The transformation products identified here are known to have higher ecotoxicity than the parent PhACs.",

We tested the application of newly available 1013 Ohm resistors to ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb geochronology using a range of natural and synthetic reference materials. The TritonPlus-RPQ at the Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, ETH Zurich, is equipped with five new 1013 Ohm resistors and one MasCom secondary electron multiplier, allowing to measure the 202-204-205-206-207-208Pb masses in static mode. U is measured subsequently as U-oxide (265-267-270UO2) during a second step, also in static Faraday mode. The gain calibration of the 1013 Ohm resistors was performed using the procedure of Trinquier (2014), with 144Nd-146Nd being measured using 1011 Ohm resistor and 142-143-145-148-150Nd being measured using 1013 Ohm resitors (Trinquier, 2014; Koornneef et al., 2014). Standard deviations of the noise in all five new 1013 Ohm resistors are lower than 5.0 x 10-6 over a 6 month period, with no shift occurring over this time interval.\nThis new detector set-up was tested by analyzing natural zircon standard materials and synthetic U/Pb solutions (www.earthime.org), ranging in age from ~2 Ma to ~600 Ma. All natural zircon standards were chemically abraded (Mattinson, 2005) and all samples were spiked with the ET2535 tracer solution. U-Pb dates obtained using the static measurement routine are compared to measurements employing dynamic peak jumping routines on the MasCom multiplier. This study illustrates the benefits and current limitations of using high gain amplifiers to measure small ion beams for zircon U-Pb geochronology compared to conventional dynamic ion counting techniques.\nMattinson, J.M.

            "abstract": "Most soil property representations in large scale hydrological and atmospheric models are derived from empirical relationships of soil texture, wherein the average hydraulic, thermal and thermodynamic processes are described for each layer of the soil column. Of all the soil hydraulic properties, hydraulic conductivity is one of the most difficult to estimate, particularly in permafrost environments. This is because, for large-scale models, it is estimated from soil properties that are originally estimated from other empirical relationships of soil texture, such as residual soil moisture content. Residual soil moisture content determines the amount of available moisture for evapotranspiration and drainage in unsaturated flow. In cold regions, it is also important to estimate the depth of the freezing front by estimating the antecedent soil moisture status before the soils freeze for the winter. This will have direct and indirect effects on the freeze-thaw depth and runoff generation the following spring. Therefore, inaccurate data on residual soil moisture will impact on hydrological modeling of the discontinuous permafrost watersheds in Interior Alaska, where soil water content is highly variable even within a given soil texture. The main objective of this study is to test the sensitivity of models to variation in residual soil moisture for runoff, evaporation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture simulations in discontinuous permafrost watersheds of Interior Alaska. We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, a meso-scale hydrological model, and HYDRUS 1D, a software package for simulating water, heat and solute movement, to estimate the soil hydraulics properties at the two contrasting sub-basins of the Caribou Poker Creek Research Watershed. . Preliminary modeling results show that small variations in the residual soil moisture content results in significant differences in the timing and amount of runoff, evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage. Our analysis reveals that, although residual soil moisture is sensitive for both sub-basins, the low permafrost sub-basin is more sensitive than the high permafrost dominated sub-basin. This may be due to the dry mineral soil layer and higher transpiration by the deciduous plants in the low-permafrost ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The subtropical precipitation decline and extratropical precipitation increase are robust anthropogenic responses from current climate models. These precipitation changes have considerably different spatial structures than the changes in precipitation minus evaporation (P – E). Contrary to the changes in P – E, the subtropical precipitation decline is not directly associated with the increase in moisture. This is supported by the fact that the subtropical precipitation decline is independent of the global mean sea surface temperature (SST) warming, which dominates the increase in moisture. Instead, the subtropical precipitation decline is primarily driven by the atmospheric radiative forcing, land-sea warming contrast and the pattern of SST change. The increasing CO2 suppresses evaporative moisture supply directly by stabilizing the lower troposphere and reduces convection over subtropical oceans indirectly through land-sea warming contrast. The pattern of SST change also plays an important role in the subtropical precipitation decline due to the reduced warming in the subtropics. One the other hand, the extratropical precipitation increase is primarily driven by the mean SST warming.\nBecause the radiative forcing of CO2 and the adjustments in land surface and SST patterns generally have much shorter timescales than the mean SST warming, the subtropical precipitation decline is a much faster response than the extratropical precipitation increase. In the abrupt CO2 quadrupling simulation, the subtropical precipitation decreases immediately upon CO2 quadrupling whereas the extratropical precipitation increases slowly following the warming of the SST.",

            "abstract": "The active layer thickness (ALT) – the annual maximum depth of soil with above 0°C temperatures – in part determines the volume of carbon-rich stores available for decomposition and therefore potential greenhouse gas release into the atmosphere from Arctic tundra. However, understanding and predicting ALT in polygonal tundra landscapes is difficult due to the complex nature of hydrothermal atmospheric-surface-subsurface interactions in freezing/thawing soil. Simply deconvolving effects of single environmental controls on ALT is not possible with measurements alone as processes act in concert to drive thaw depth formation. Process-rich models of thermal hydrological dynamics, conversely, are a valuable tool for understanding the dominant controls and uncertainties in predicting permafrost conditions. By integrating observational data with known physical relationships to form process-rich models, synthetic experiments can then be used to explore a breadth of environmental conditions encountered and the effect of each environmental attribute may be assessed. Here a process rich thermal hydrology model, The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator, has been created and calibrated using observed data from Barrow, AK. An ensemble of 1D thermal hydrologic models were simulated that span a range of three environmental factors 1) thickness of organic rich soil, 2) snow depth, and 3) soil moisture content, to investigate the role of each factor on ALT. Results show that organic layer thickness acts as a strong insulator and is the dominant control of ALT, but the strength of the effect of organic layer thickness is also dependent on the saturation state. Using the ensemble results, the effect of peat thickness on ALT was then examined on a 2D domain.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster-2015-AGU.pdf\nThe Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) engages the plastic zone and softening effects at the fracture tip in a quasi-brittle rock, e.g. shale, which concludes a more precise fracture geometry and pumping pressure compared to those from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Nevertheless, this model, namely planar CZM, assumes a predefined surface on which the fractures propagate and therefore, restricts the fracture propagation direction. Notably, this direction depends on the stress interactions between closely spaced fractures and can be acquired integrating CZM as the segmental contact interaction model with a fully coupled pore pressure-displacement, extended finite element model (XFEM). This later model simulates the fracture initiation and propagation along an arbitrary, solution-dependent path.\nIn this work, we modeled double- and triple-cluster 3D hydraulic fracturing in a single-layer, quasi-brittle shale formation using planar CZM and XFEM-based CZM including slit flow and poro-elasticity for fracture and matrix spaces, respectively, in Abaqus. Our fully-coupled pore pressure-stress Geomechanics model includes leak-off as a continuum-based fluid flow component coupled with the other unknowns in the problem. Having compared the triple-cluster fracturing results from planar CZM with those from XFEM-based CZM, we found that the stress shadowing effect of multiple hydraulic fractures on each other can cause these fractures to rationally propagate out of plane; this also demonstrates the advantages of the second method compared to the first one. We investigated the effect of this arbitrary propagation direction on not only the fractures’ length, aperture, and the required injection pressure, but also fractures’ connection to the wellbore. Depending on the spacing and the number of clusters per stage, this connection can be gradually disrupted with time due to the near-wellbore fracture closure which may embed proppant particles on the fracture wall, or screen out the fracture at early stimulation times. Comparing all studied cases, we concluded that the double-cluster, simultaneous fracturing with 100-ft spacing provides the most viable fracture set for long-term production.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have found that the seasonal forests in semi-arid region are more susceptible to severe drought events and the persistent effect of these climate extremes can last for 2 to 4 years. However, the Amazonian forests, where the plant available water is often abundant, seasonal forests are considered more drought-tolerant as water deficits coincide with seasonal peaks of solar radiation. But the interactions between climate and anthropogenic changes have made the scenario of these forests in the “arc of deforestation” complicated. The tight coupling between extreme droughts and fire intensity can cause widespread fire-induced tree mortality across southeastern Amazon forests. The legacy effects of droughts, as well as the frequent revisit of these extremes in the recent decade (e.g. the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts) have made the projection of forest recovery unclear. In this study, we use satellite proxies of canopy structure, skin temperature and water content from observations of MODIS NIR reflectance, land surface temperature and QSCAT radar backscatter to define the seasonality in the Amazonian forests. It is further calibrated using the measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence from GOSAT, terrestrial water storage from GRACE, as well as the structural metrics from GLAS waveforms. We delineate the post-drought effects of Amazon forests using seasonality-derived phenological regions. The results are expected to have a better understanding of the inter-annual variation of forest seasonality under the influence of both climate extremes and human-induced changes.",

Yet there is an inherent limitation in how widely the method can be applied due to the computational demands of searching large signal archives quickly. In this study, we investigate the applicability of Kernelized Locality-Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) to significantly decrease the computational requirements to the point that searches can be done on a commodity desktop computer. KLSH probabilistically interrogates the database such that much of the database is ignored when searching for closest matches, thereby dramatically reducing the number of correlations that need to be calculated. We evaluate KLSH using data from the IMS primary station MKAR. First we built a KLSH indexed archive using all associated signals from the IDC LEB catalog for 2002-2013 (~308,000 signals). We then tested the signal matching capability using the ~26,000 IDC-detected signals from 2014, including a variety of regional and teleseismic phases (56% are teleseismic P). We used the LEB phase assignments as ground-truth to score the results. Using a simple 0.60 correlation threshold, requiring at least two archive matches, and applying screening criteria based on consistency of metadata of archive matches, we were able to robustly identify 12% of the 2014 signals, including many teleseismic P phases from a variety of locations. Comparing KLSH against a full search, we established a recall rate of > 0.9, with search time on the order of 10 ms.",

            "abstract": "State and federal regulatory authorities currently rely upon the US National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Reports (HMRs) to determine probable maximum precipitation (PMP) estimates (i.e., rainfall depths and durations) for estimating flooding hazards for relatively broad regions in the US. PMP estimates for the contributing watersheds upstream of vulnerable facilities are used to estimate riverine flooding hazards while site-specific estimates for small water sheds are appropriate for individual facilities such as nuclear power plants.\nThe HMRs are often criticized due to their limitations on basin size, questionable applicability in regions affected by orographic effects, their lack of consist methods, and generally by their age. HMR-51 for generalized PMP estimates for the United States east of the 105th meridian, was published in 1978 and is sometimes perceived as overly conservative. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), is currently reviewing several flood hazard evaluation reports that rely on site specific PMP estimates that have been commercially developed. As such, NRC has recently investigated key areas of expert judgement via a generic audit and one in-depth site specific review as they relate to identifying and quantifying actual and potential storm moisture sources, determining storm transposition limits, and adjusting available moisture during storm transposition.  \nThough much of the approach reviewed was considered a logical extension of HMRs, two key points of expert judgement stood out for further in-depth review. The first relates primarily to small storms and the use of a heuristic for storm representative dew point adjustment developed for the Electric Power Research Institute by North American Weather Consultants in 1993 in order to harmonize historic storms for which only 12 hour dew point data was available with more recent storms in a single database. The second issue relates to the use of climatological averages for spatially interpolating 100-year dew point values rather than a more gauge-based approach. Site specific reviews demonstrated that both issues had potential for lowering the PMP estimate significantly by affecting the in-place and transposed moisture maximization value and, in turn, the final controlling storm for a given basin size and PMP estimate.",

The current curricula (B.S. and B.A. in Geology, B.S. in Geophysics) were put into place in 1997, following the merger of two separate departments. The needs and capabilities of the Department and the student body have changed significantly since that time: more than 50% turnover of the faculty, a rapidly-changing job climate for geologists and geophysicists, and a nearly five-fold increase in the undergraduate population to over 500 majors in Fall 2015. Surveys of former students, employers and faculty at other universities revealed more reasons to address the curriculum. Some of the most desired skills are also those at which our graduates feel and are perceived to be least prepared: oral communication and the ability to learn software packages (skills that are most challenging to teach with growing class sizes). The challenge facing the Department is to accommodate growing student numbers while maintaining strength in traditional instructor-intensive activities such as microscopy and field mapping, and also improving our graduates’ non-geological skills (e.g., communication, software use, teamwork, problem-solving) to insulate them from volatility in the current job market.\nWe formed the Curriculum Study Group, consisting of faculty, graduate students, advisors and curriculum experts, to gather and analyze data and define the knowledge and skill base a graduate of our department must have. In addition to conducting external surveys, this group interviewed current students and faculty to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our program. We developed program learning goals that were further specified into over fifty criteria. For each criteria we defined several assessable measures of proficiency from novice to exemplary. From this matrix of measures, we are building the course descriptions that will define the new curricula, and will be developing assessment tools to gauge the success of our new program. We will present both the new curriculum and the design process.",

In Australia, grassy eucalyptus woodlands dominated by kangaroo grasses (Themeda trianda) were widely cleared during European settlement for agriculture, with only fragments remaining of this now threatened ecosystem. As remnant grassland fragments are used for livestock grazing, Themeda transitions through states of degradation, starting with red grasses (Bothriochloa spp) and then proceeding to less productive, increasingly degraded states dominated by either annual exotic weeds or native wallaby grasses (Rytidosperma spp) and spear grasses (Austrastipa spp). The aim of our experiment was to determine how soil organic matter dynamics (including erosion, root biomass, C storage and turnover) have been altered by the transition from deeply-rooted Themeda grass systems to more shallowly-rooted annual exotic weeds and wallaby/spear grass states. We sampled soils in five depth-based increments (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 cm) across this ecosystem transition at five sites across New South Wales, Australia. Caseium-137 analysis indicated erosion rates were similar among all ecosystems and were consistent with levels for grasslands in the region. Compared to the remnant Themeda grass systems, the degraded states had lower root biomass, lower carbon stocks and C:N ratios in the coarse fraction (> 50 µm), lower fungal : bacterial ratios, higher available phosphate, higher alkyl : O-alkyl C ratios, and faster mineralization of synthetic root-exudate carbon. All these metrics indicate the surprising finding of more microbially processed OM and faster turnover of newly added C in the degraded sites. Compared to one another, the two degraded sites differed in both C and N turnover, with the exotic weeds having higher dissolved organic N, inorganic N, and coarse fraction N, higher fine fraction C stocks, and greater microbial biomass. These differences likely arise from the greater aboveground productivity of exotic weeds relative to the wallaby and spear grasses. Although microbial C turnover through depth is altered with grassland degradation in both states, the trajectory of the soil organic matter dynamics with degradation is also impacted by plant community dynamics.",

An integral part of the broader, NSF-funded Inter-university Training for Continental-scale Ecology (ITCE) project, the course is an intensive two-week field, classroom and laboratory experience with internationally-known researchers as instructors. The course focuses on stable isotope geochemistry coupled with spatial analysis techniques. Participants do not typically know each other or this research community well upon entering. One of the stated goals of the overall project is to build a community of practice around these techniques. This design is common in many professional fields, but is not often applied at the graduate level nor formally assessed in the earth sciences.\nPaired pre- and post-tests were administered before the start and after the close of the short courses over 3 years. The survey is a set of instruments adapted from social-cognitive psychology measuring changes in identity and community with other items to measure content knowledge outcomes. We see a subtle, consistent convergence of identities between large-scale isotope geochemistry and participants’ research areas. Results also show that the course generates an increase in understanding about stable isotopes’ use and application. The data show the SPATIAL course is very effective at bringing students together socially with each other and with faculty to create an environment that fosters community and scientific cooperation.\nSemi-structured pre-and post- interviews were conducted to understand the program elements that generated gains in learning and community. Participants were selected based on initial responses on the pre-survey to capture the range of initial conditions for the group. Qualitative analysis shows that the major factors for participants were 1) ready access to researchers in an informal setting during the course with many substantial opportunities to discuss research, 2) scaffolded, guided-inquiry group research designed to build group cohesion and skills, 3) just-in-time teaching at key junctures during lab and field exercises, and 4) access to curated sets of research literature from disparate fields relevant to SPATIAL content.",

            "abstract": "Small-scale plasma irregularities and turbulence are common phenomena in the F layer of the ionosphere, both in the equatorial and polar regions. A common approach in analyzing data from experiments on space and ionospheric plasma irregularities are power spectra. Power spectra give no information about the phases of the waveforms, and thus do not allow to determine whether some of the phases are correlated or whether they exhibit a random character. The former case would imply the presence of nonlinear wave-wave interactions, while the latter suggests a more turbulent-like process. Discerning between these mechanisms is crucial for understanding high latitude plasma irregularities and can be addressed with bispectral analysis and higher order statistics.\nIn this study, we use higher order spectra and statistics to analyze electron density data observed with the ICI-2 sounding rocket experiment at a meter-scale resolution. The main objective of ICI-2 was to investigate plasma irregularities in the cusp in the F layer ionosphere. We study in detail two regions intersected during the rocket flight and which are characterized by large density fluctuations: a trailing edge of a cold polar cap patch, and a density enhancement subject to cusp auroral particle precipitation. While these two regions exhibit similar power spectra, our analysis reveals that their internal structure is different. The structures on the edge of the polar cap patch are characterized by significant coherent mode coupling and intermittency, while the plasma enhancement associated with precipitation exhibits stronger random characteristics. This indicates that particle precipitation may play a fundamental role in ionospheric plasma structuring by creating turbulent-like structures.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate an empirical method for preliminary tsunami hazard assessment of near-field fault sources that lack long historic records, paleoseismic/paleotsunami data and/or adequate tsunami modelling studies. Along the Pacific coast of Canada, the North America plate boundary is characterized by varying degrees of convergence with adjacent oceanic plates and microplates. The 1700 M~9 Cascadia earthquake ruptured at least the full extent of Juan de Fuca plate subduction as far north as central Vancouver Island; paleoseismic data show that similar events have occurred approximately every 500 years throughout the Holocene, accompanied by large tsunamis. Further north along the margin, the paleoseismic and paleotsunami histories of the Explorer, Winona, and Haida Gwaii segments of the margin are unknown. The Explorer plate is subducting beneath Vancouver Island at about half the rate of the Juan de Fuca plate; this locked segment may rupture independently or it may slip concurrently with the rest of the Cascadia subduction zone system to the south. The tsunamigenic potential of the Winona segment off northern Vancouver Island is poorly understood. The occurrence of the 2012 M7.8 thrust earthquake off southern Haida Gwaii confirmed the tsunamigenic nature of partitioned convergent slip on this dominantly transform margin segment. Parts of the coastline face additional tsunami hazard from submarine crustal faults. For potentially tsunamigenic faults with unknown history, we use (1) geophysical data to constrain fault rupture area, (2) empirical relations to estimate earthquake magnitude from the rupture area, (3) plate motion models and geodetic data to constrain convergence and thrust earthquake recurrence rates, and (4) empirical relations to estimate near-field tsunami runup at coastal sites, given distance from the rupture. The success of this approach is demonstrated by general agreement between expected and observed earthquake magnitude and near-field tsunami runup in the 2012 M7.8 Haida Gwaii event. However, this example also highlights that sites of extreme runup cannot be predicted without detailed tsunami modelling of a range of rupture scenarios. We also compare tsunami runup estimated using our approach with runup modelled for scenario ruptures of the Cascadia subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Coastal winds and upwelling of deep water along Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (EBUS) yield some of the ocean’s most productive ecosystems, but the effect of coastal wind shape and ocean-atmosphere interactions on regional Net Primary Production (NPP) is not well known. Here, we first show how the spatial and temporal variability of nearshore winds in EBUS is affected by orography, coastline shape, and air-sea interaction. Using regional atmospheric simulations over the US West Coast, we determine monthly characteristics of the wind drop-off, and show that when the mountain orography is combined with the coastline shape of a cape, it has the biggest influence on wind drop-off. Then, using a realistic ocean model of the California Current System, we show that the slackening of the winds near the coast has little effect on near-shore phytoplankton productivity, despite a large reduction in upwelling velocity. On a regional scale, the wind drop-off leads to a substantially higher NPP, especially when it occurs over a broad swath, even when the total upwelling rate remains the same. This partial decoupling of NPP from upwelling is effected by alongshore currents and the eddies they generate. When peak winds extend all the way to the coast, alongshore current shear is stronger, and a more energetic eddy field subducts nutrients offshore and out of the photic zone, reducing overall productivity. This causal sequence is supported by satellite remote sensing. Finally, using a interanual coupled simulation over the US West Coast, we show the ocean-atmosphere interactions can also reduce the eddy activity by pumping energy out from the eddies, reducing their amplitude and rotation speed, and leading to more realistic eddies characteristics. This may also reduce the eddy quenching and therefore increase the NPP. This complex ocean-atmosphere-land interactions imply that simple wind indices are incomplete predictors of productivity in EBUS.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in zircon U-Pb geochronology can yield radioisotopic 206Pb/238U dates with nominal precisions that approach the thousand year level for young samples, most often achieved by pooling several analyses. These advances are prompting a reevaluation of a number of aspects of the geology and the radioisotopic systematics of zircon that are only relevant at the scale of thousands of years, and must be addressed in order to extract a meaningful age that reflects a geological event. For example, in young volcanic rocks, individual crystals may take more than 1 ka to crystallize and growth events may take place over 10s or 100s of ka prior to an eruption. In order to best leverage this chronological information for stratigraphic purposes, e.g., where eruption is the key, we require tools to predict the timescales of zircon crystallization relative to eruption and to quantitatively extract this from measured dates. In this context it is also important to study the petrographic and petrologic relations of zircon contained in volcanic rocks. Recent studies suggest that, in some cases, the majority of zircon crystals are armored and thus cease to crystallize prior to an eruptive event. In addition to geological complexities, the systematics of short lived radionuclides with respect to initial disequilibrium and open system, including 230Th, 226Ra, 222Rn and 234U, are not fully understood, and may contribute to uncertainty in 206Pb/238U dates at timescales of 1 ka or greater. Potential additional effects from a subtle miscalibration of l238U have no bearing when 206Pb/238U ages are compared internally but must be considered for comparison with ages derived from other isotopic systems (most prominently 40Ar/39Ar). Efforts are currently underway to address some of these issues whereas others have been neglected. The combined effects of these limiting factors have yet to be fully understood, but must be quantified before analytical precision and accuracy of a reported weighted mean 206Pb/238U can be adequately translated to the age of a geological event such as a volcanic eruption.",

            "abstract": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a key component of the eastern Pacific ocean-atmosphere system and its variability on seasonal to inter-annual and longer time scales. This feature is generally misrepresented in climate models, which show an excessively strong branch south of the equator. On the other hand, there is debate on what is the structure of the ITCZ in nature, particularly whether the latent heating and vertical velocity profiles are top or bottom-heavy. This knowledge is probably key to validate and improve the models.\nMost methods for estimating the vertical structure of the rate of latent heating rely on profiles from field campaigns in other regions, combined with convective/stratiform fractions from the TRMM satellite. In this study we use the precipitation profiles from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), with approximations to the moisture conservation equation and the first law of thermodynamic, to directly estimate the vertical profiles of latent heating and vertical air velocity, respectively, in the ITCZ for the period 1998-2010.\nDue to limitations in the PR sensitivity and the inability to quantify solid precipitation, our results are restricted to the layer between the altitudes of 2 and 2.75 km. Nevertheless, we show that our results provide a strong constraint on the profiles and help determine which of the other estimates are more realistic.\nOur preliminary results for the northern hemisphere ITCZ in austral winter/spring are closer to the top-heavy estimations using TRMM-based algorithms (CSH, SLH and PRH) than to the bottom-heavy atmospheric reanalysis (ERA Interim and NCEP-NCAR), providing indirect evidence for a top-heavy profile. However, using the meridional wind measurements during the EPIC field campaign we find evidence that shallow ascent does exist below 2 km, consistent with the previously reported shallow meridional circulation but not as strong as the Reanalysis products indicate. Thus, our results support the existence of a dual circulation structure in the eastern Pacific ITCZ consisting in both shallow (1000-800 hPa) and deep overturning (450-350 hPa).",

            "abstract": "Southern Greenland is characterized by a number of low-level high wind speed weather systems that are the result of topographic flow distortion. These systems include tip jets, barrier winds and katabatic flows. Global atmospheric reanalyses have proven to be important tools in furthering our understanding of these winds and their role in the climate system. However, there is evidence that the mesoscale characteristics of these systems may be poorly resolved in these global products. Here results from the high-resolution regional Arctic System Reanalysis (ASRv1–30 km and ASRv2–15 km) are compared to the global ERA-Interim Reanalysis (ERAI), Danish Meteorological Institute surface stations and research aircraft flights from the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment (GFDex). With respect to the observations, the ERAI reanalyses shows a bias that results in an underestimation of high wind speeds that is reduced in ASRv1 and nearly eliminated in ASRv2. In addition, there is a systematic reduction in the root mean square error between the observed and the reanalysis wind speeds as one transitions from the ERAI to the ASRv2. Case studies from GFDex reveal that mesoscale features of the winds are better captured in ASRv2 as compared to the ERAI or ASRv1. These include the development of a mesoscale low in the lee of the topography near Cape Farewell during an easterly tip jet event that results in an onshore extension of the region of high winds. The gradient in wind speed along the marginal ice zone is tighter in ASRv2 as well, with localized areas of higher wind speeds associated with katabatic flow and wind speed nadirs downstream of the fjords in the region depicted with greater detail. The decorrelation length scale for the 10m wind speeds in southeast Greenland also indicates that the ASRv2 is better able to resolve the structure in the surface wind field that is the result of complexities in the region’s topography.",

            "abstract": "The considerable contribution of northern lakes and wetlands to global methane emissions is likely to increase as the Arctic warms and carbon within permafrost becomes labile. However, large uncertainties are still present in baseline flux estimates. Satellite remote sensing promises a way to constrain fluxes at continental and hemispheric scales as it is spatially comprehensive and has, or promises, temporal depth. The GOSAT team (Japan) recently released the first global dataset of methane fluxes informed by satellite data. Here, for the Arctic (>66°N), we compare methane flux values from the GOSAT product with up-scaled flux values derived from field observations working in concert with pertinent GIS layers. Upscaling was done within the context of a novel geographic lake classification that recognizes regional differences in lake type and geomorphic history, which, in turn, reflect availability of organic carbon in the catchment/lake ecosystem. The up-scaled (bottom-up) approach yielded an annual flux of 3.89-13.0 Tg CH4 yr -1, with 58-68 percent of the fluxes derived from lakes. This estimate flanks the remotely sensed (top-down) range of 5.36-7.15 Tg CH4 yr -1. Furthermore, both estimates show similar spatial variation in fluxes. The convergence of results from these two independent methods underlines the potential of remotely-sensed methane observation as a new tool in estimating carbon budgets and the importance of regional variation in upscaling flux estimates. Though a first pass attempt at a spatially explicit pan-Arctic methane emission estimate, the results of this work are promising and could aid in closing the global methane budget.",

            "abstract": "This paper reports about important upgrades of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface elevation and elevation-change database obtained with our Surface Elevation And Change detection (SERAC) software suite. We have developed SERAC to derive information from laser altimetry data, particularly time series of elevation changes and their partitioning into changes caused by ice dynamics. This allows direct investigation of ice dynamic processes that is much needed for improving the predictive power of ice sheet models. SERAC is different from most other change detection methods. It is based on detecting changes of surface patches, about 1 km by 1 km in size, rather than deriving elevation changes from individual laser points.\nThe current database consists of ~100,000 time series with satellite laser altimetry data from ICESat, airborne laser observations obtained by NASA’s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) and the Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS). The upgrade is significant, because not only new observations from 2013 and 2014 have been added but also a number of improvements lead to a more comprehensive and consistent record of elevation-changes. First, we used the model that gives in addition to ice sheet also information about ice caps and glaciers (Rastner et al., 2012) for deciding if a laser point is on the ice sheet or ice cap. Then we added small gaps that exist in the ICESat GLA12 data set because the ice sheet mask is not wide enough. The new database is now more complete and will facilitate more accurate comparisons of mass balance studies obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment system (GRACE). For determining the part of a time series caused by ice dynamics we used the new firn compaction model and Surface Mass Balance (SMB) estimates from RACMO2.3.\nThe new database spans the time period from 1993 to 2014. Adding new observations amounts to a spatial densification of the old record and at the same time extends the time domain by two years. Our presentation will show the improvement of the reconstruction of the total changes, those caused by SMB and ice dynamic during the ICESat mission (2003-2009). Moreover we will review changes on scales from individual outlet glaciers to drainage basins and the entire ice sheet.",

Due to the high leaching capacity of hot waters, geothermal waters in areas with As-rich bedrock, often contain high concentrations of As. This water can reach the surface\u0005 through fractures and cracks that manifest through diffuse seeps and hot springs. The Soda Dam area in the Jemez Mountains of northwestern NM, with frequent hot springs and seeps, has long been of interest due to the hot spring's high discharge (1500L/s) of geothermal waters into the Jemez River. Although the species of As highly controls its mobility and toxicity, previous studies have focused exclusively on the total amounts of As in the waters, while little is known about the species occurring along the river. We collected water and \u0004sediment\u0005 from 14 sites along the Jemez river to study factors governing \u0005spatial and temporal variations of As in hot springs and river water; the interrelationship between As(III) and As(V) and to calculate mass flows during the summer monsoon months of 2015. We found that As(V) is the dominant species along the river stretch of interest except for in the hot springs. As(III) occurs at all sites, and the fraction of total As(III) varies both on a spatial and temporal scale, ranging between 1–7 % upstream of Soda Dam, and 12 - 21 % below it. We also found that hot spring water in the beginning of the southwest monsoon season only contains As(III), but further into the season explicitly As(V), possibly due to a heavy rainfall occurring two days before sampling. \u0004The fraction of As(III) correlates well with alkalinity (R2 =0.98-0.59) and temperature (R2 = 0.86-0.46) although \u0005differently at different sampling occasions. Since As(III) is generally more toxic and mobile in water than As(V), our results emphasizes that risks associated with As may change over the season due to season-related changes in As speciation.",

            "abstract": "A spatio-temporal estimation of the ocean surface level poses a challenging problem for reasons including non-stationarity, non-uniformly smooth spatial boundaries and a short range in the temporal dimension of the densely measured satellite altimeter dataset. Gaussian processes using a non-stationary covariance function have shown promise for such a task, as the covariance function adapts to the variable smoothness of the underlying distribution. We present a novel framework which employs the intrinsic non-stationary covariance function for a Gaussian process regression. The intrinsic non-stationary covariance function evaluates intrinsic statistics of the local distribution by assuming that the distribution lies on a Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices; thereby, the non-stationarity and the non-uniformly spatial variability of the data are captured. Additionally, the framework improves the short range temporal estimates by assimilating data from a correlated process of a temporally longer range dataset. For such a data-assimilation technique, we used the dataset of tide gauge records that measure coastal sea bed levels at a geospatially sparse distribution of global sites. Experiments on satellite altimeter measurements of ocean surface level across the world from 1993 onwards demonstrate improvements in the error metrics for the regression estimates when using our novel framework. Furthermore, assimilating the tide gauge measurements from 1802 onwards gives better estimates for the long-term trends of the ocean surface level. These spatio-temporal estimates of past records of the ocean surface level will enable us to more accurately assess risks arising due to climate change.",

Due to large and frequent events of burning biomass in Brazil there is a need to improve the aerosol representation in this model, mainly during the dry season (September – November) in Northern and Central Brazil. The standard aerosol representation in this model is inadequate to capture these events. It is based on the mean monthly climatological horizontal visibility with latitudinal values based on coarse global observation data. To improve the aerosol representation, climatological data of daily horizontal visibility from National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) was used to generate monthly averages from 1999 to 2012. To do a better representation of aerosols from burning biomass events, from megacities aerosol generation, and from transport processes, horizontal visibility estimates performed using aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm data from MACC Project Reanalysis model were used to adjust the aerosol representation in regions were the simple horizontal visibility fails. A methodology to generate these new visibility data from the Reanalysis was made and the resulting data was compared with the average horizontal visibility to implement a new corrected database. The solar irradiation simulated by the model using this new aerosol representation proved to be better than the previous version of the model in all regions with high aerosol loading.",

Observations at the T3 site in Manacapuru during the second Intensive Operating Period (dry season, August-October 2014) using a Switchable Reagent Ion (SRI)-ToF-MS will be presented to investigate isoprene oxidation processes in a wide spectrum of anthropogenic influences. The SRI capability was utilized to quantify ratios of Methyl Vinyl Ketone (MVK) to Methacrolein (MACR) in order to assess photochemical age of air masses at T3 and examine isoprene peroxy radical reaction pathways as a function of NO levels. Given recently identified ISOPOOH interference to MVK and MACR measurements, the current analysis focus on high NOx conditions when the contribution of ISOPOOH was small. In addition, the results will be critically compared with previously reported relationships between MVK, MACR and isoprene to explore potential systematic analytical interferences that may affect regional OH level estimations. These OH estimates will be evaluated using in-situ OH observations.",

            "abstract": "The eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains produce the majority of Alberta’s surface water supply. While land disturbance affects hydrologic processes governing runoff and water quality, groundwater-surface water interactions may be an important component of catchment resistance to hydrological change. The objectives of this study were to describe reach and sub-catchment coupling of groundwater and surface water processes and to characterize the role of groundwater contribution to surface discharge across spatial and temporal scales.\nThis research is part of Phase II of the Southern Rockies Watershed Project investigating the hydrological effects of three forest harvest treatments (clear-cutting with retention, strip cutting, and partial-cutting) in the front-range Rocky Mountains in the Crowsnest Pass, Alberta. Six nested hydrometric stations in Star Creek (10.4 km2) were used to collect pre-disturbance stream discharge and water quality data (2009-2014). Instantaneous differential streamflow gauging was conducted on reaches ~700 m in length to define stream reaches that were gaining or losing water. Constant rate tracer injection was conducted on gaining reaches to further refine regions of groundwater inputs during high flows, the recession limb of the annual hydrograph, and summer baseflows.\nDespite being a snow-dominated catchment, groundwater is a major contributor to annual streamflow (60 – 70 %). In general, locations of gaining and losing reaches were consistent across spatial and temporal scales of investigation. A strong losing reach in one sub-basin was observed where underflow may be responsible for the loss of streamflow along this section of the stream. However, strong groundwater upwelling was also observed in a reach lower in the catchment likely due to a “pinch-point” in topographic relief. Spatial and temporal variations in groundwater-surface water interactions are likely important factors in hydrologic resistance to land disturbance.",

            "abstract": "Hydro-Period Influence on Kettle Hole Biogeochemistry in NE Germany\nKettle holes are glacially created ponds (<0.01 km2) that form within landscape depressions and, while small, they are numerous across young moraine landscapes in Europe and North America. Kettle holes are only seasonally connected to streams or groundwater and therefore they undergo pronounced short-term changes in the hydro-periods, i.e. water level fluctuations that include complete desiccation and rewetting. Little is known about kettle hole biogeochemistry in NE Germany, especially with regards to the hydro-period. We hypothesized that a connection exists between kettle hole hydro-period and sediment biogeochemistry. We surveyed kettle hole water in NE Germany over several years to capture the seasonal isotopic composition (δD, δ18O). Within a subset of the surveyed kettle holes we measured the δ13C and δ15N composition of sediments at two different depths from one season. Our objective was to link the abiotic influences demarked by the evaporative isotopic signal from kettle hole water, to biotic processes, such as microbial turnover and contributions of vegetation, imprinted in the δ13C and δ15N signals in sediment organic matter. Based on the upper sediment isotopic signal, we were able to classify two categories: permanently and temporarily filled kettle holes. Other kettle holes, for example those found in forests, were not as easily classified. Within the deeper sediment layers we found a distinct curve linear response between δ15N and C/N ratios, where temporarily filled kettle holes were consistently enriched, indicating a higher level of microbial transformation. We evaluated our evaporation estimates against the sediment-based classification to test evaporation as a major mechanism behind kettle hole biogeochemistry. While the temporarily filled kettle holes are the most biogeochemically dynamic, due in large part to their hydro-period, the mechanisms underlying the hydro-period and the concurrent effects on biogeochemical cycles are diverse.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes, which will very likely mount over the next several decades, would add to a set of shifts that have appeared in snow and runoff during recent decades over western North America. Water from mountain snow has historically provided a vital portion of the water supply for the region, but warming since the mid-1970’s has produced more rain, less snow, diminished snow accumulation and earlier runoff over mountain catchments that historically have accumulated significant snow cover. The observed warming and the hydrologic shifts have, with a high degree of likelihood, been boosted by additional anthropogenic warming. A many-member ensemble of CMIP5 GCM simulations indicates that even under moderate scenarios of rising greenhouse gases, the warming, relative to historical climatology, could approach +2°C by mid-21st Century. This amount of warming would produce substantial changes in watersheds which have historically been dominated by snowmelt. In the California Sierra Nevada, this warming would advance spring runoff timing by more than two weeks. Combined with changes towards increased precipitation amounts in the region’s largest storms, higher than present-day freezing levels would increase flood flows in Sierran rivers. Historical observations and hydrological model simulations indicate that California’s total spring snow water storage will decline by more than half by 2100. Heavy snow years would still occur, but not as often as today, and springs with highly depleted mountain snow pack would occur with increasing frequency. These changes would produce a cascade of impacts to natural landscapes and resources, requiring multifold adaptation strategies by the humans who use and are affected by them.",

            "abstract": "Contour currents are commonly associated with bedform development on modern seabeds yet there is a general paucity of published examples from the ancient record. Recently acquired 3D seismic data, covering over 13000km2 of the Pelotas Basin, offshore Uruguay, provides a unique opportunity to study the architecture and development of a variety of bedform. The data shows that, throughout the Tertiary, contour currents were the dominant control on sedimentation along the Uruguayan margin.\nThe first evidence of contour current activity is during the Early Tertiary in the form of a major regional unconformity that, even though it was fully subaqueous, does not show any major features associated with downslope sedimentation. In the mid-slope region, the unconformity coincides with an extensive (1500km2) intra-slope scour-field orientated parallel to the slope. Individual scours are up to 40m deep, 500m wide and 3km long. Coeval with these scours are a group of coalesced basin floor scours, which run parallel to the base of slope and extend over 400km2. Individual scours exhibit an asymmetric shape - similar to giant flute marks - that are up to 150m deep, 20km wide and extend for at least 40km along slope. The development of these scoured areas shows clear evidence of two major north-flowing water masses.\nDirectly above this regional unconformity are a series of ribbon-like bedforms that developed oblique to the slope. Individual bedforms are up to 40km in length with wavelengths of 5km and heights up to 100m. These bedforms are overlain by a set of barchan-like dunes, up to 30km in length with wavelengths of 10km. Individual dunes are in the order of 100m thick and stack to form an overall package up to 500m thick. These features show a clear change from erosion/bypass to deposition/reworking that is linked to a decrease in ocean current velocity and/ or sediment supply.\nThe features observed suggest a complex oceanic regime was present throughout the Tertiary that varied both spatially and temporally and operated at various water depths. This complexity continues Present-day and is spectacularly imaged by pseudo time-lapse seismic data from the Present-day water column. These data, which are commonly neglected, highlight the true complexity of ocean currents and show how discrete dynamic water masses mix and move over time.",

            "abstract": "Due to its layered structure at multiple scales, mechanical properties of shale in the direction parallel to the bedding planes are significantly different from its properties in the perpendicular direction. Isotropic material models simplify the process of modeling these materials; however, they often fail to accurately describe mechanical response when the layered structure plays an important role. Further, shales often exhibit temperature-dependent properties when significantly heated or cooled. In this work, we study the thermo-mechanical behavior of oil shale, a kerogen-rich source rock. In particular, we examine in-situ conversion processes in which the shale is heated to high temperatures (>300C) to convert the solid kerogen phase to useful oil and gas products. Multi-temperature triaxial tests on core samples reveal that changes in microstructure at high temperatures dramatically alter mechanical properties. Accordingly, the current study presents a thermo-mechanical framework for modeling oil shale and related materials. The underlying model is based on the well-known Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) yield surface, here modified to incorporate the effects of transverse isotropy. We also include temperature dependence in the elastic and plastic response. The proposed model is verified by comparison with available experimental data, and used to study the effect of anisotropy on deformation behavior during mechanical and thermal loading. We also study the formation of deformation bands as a result material instability, and the effect the bedding structure has on the shear localization process.",

            "abstract": "Traditional inverse modeling approaches that are applied to estimate sources of chemically- and/or radiatively-active constituents rely heavily on model-data error covariances that are typically prescribed and assumed to have diagonal (uncorrelated) structures. In most cases, this type of error representation do not fully account for errors in atmospheric chemistry models, especially with regards to uncertainties in transport and removal/loss mechanisms. Here, we introduce an ensemble Bayesian synthesis inversion framework for estimating black carbon and carbon monoxide sources in a coupled weather-chemistry model, WRF-Chem. We use a quasi Monte Carlo approach in generating a small ensemble of WRF-Chem configuration, through multi-physics representation and perturbations in a) emissions for both CO and BC, b) removal rates for BC, and c) initial and boundary conditions for both meteorology and chemistry. We then carry out ensemble tagged tracer (basis functions) simulations using slightly different ‘model configuration’ for each ensemble member to: a) calculate the model response functions, and b) estimate the associated error covariances based on the ensemble statistics. These simulations are conducted using an ensemble-based data assimilation software package, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). Conventional meteorological observations are assimilated in WRF-Chem/DART to constrain model meteorological fields. We then carry out a suite of multi-species (BC and CO) Bayesian synthesis inversions using a combination of: 1) ground-based (EPAAQS CO and IMPROVE BC) and satellite measurements (MOPITT CO, MODIS AOD, OMI Near UV AOD) and 2) ensemble-mean basis and response functions together with their associated ensemble error covariances derived from these simulations. We present our initial results of this work particularly a comparison of a posteriori diagnostics using this approach to that of a single WRF-Chem inverse analysis experiment. Finally, we introduce the need for a TransCom-like chemical data assimilation/inverse modeling systems inter-comparison for CO and BC.",

            "abstract": "A ground source heat pump (GSHP) was installed in a discontinuous permafrost region of Fairbanks Alaska in 2013 with the primary aim of determining the effect of different ground cover options on the long-term subterranean temperature regime. Three different surface treatments were applied to separate loops of the GSHP; grass, sand, and gravel, and temperature monitoring was established at several depths above and below the heat sink loops. The GSHP has been actively utilized to supplement the heat in a hydronic heating system of a neighboring 5000 ft2 research facility. The ground immediately surrounding the GSHP was not permafrost when initially installed. Numerical modeling simulations were used to predict the long-term ground temperature regime surrounding the GSHP loops, and results indicate that permafrost would begin to form after the first year. A pseudo-steady state temperature regime would establish in approximately 8 years with a yearly fluctuation of -14°C to -2°C. Simulations also indicate that permafrost could be prevented with a 15 W/m recharge during the summer, such as from a solar thermal system. The ground surface treatments have negligible effect on the ground temperature below 1 meter and therefore have no long-term effect on the active region the GSHP. Data collected from thermistors in the two years since installation indicate that permafrost has not yet been established, although the ground is now becoming seasonally frozen due to the GSHP energy removal. Yearly average temperatures are declining, and extrapolation indicates that permafrost will establish in future years. The GSHP coefficient of performance (COP) was initially 3.6 and is declining with the decreasing ground temperatures. Economic modeling indicates that the system may become uneconomical in future years, although volatile energy costs have a substantial effect of the prediction.",

            "abstract": "Field measurements of carbon (C) fluxes are fundamental for understanding global C cycling, and the C source/sink status of ecosystems. In the tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, old regional bedrock groundwater (gw) high in dissolved inorganic C discharges into some streams and wetlands with possible impacts on ecosystem C pools and fluxes. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) degassing from two streams at La Selva: the Arboleda, where ~1/3 of the streamflow is from regional gw, and the Taconazo, fed exclusively by much younger local gw recharged within the catchment. In two reaches (upper and lower) of the Arboleda and Taconazo streams, emissions were determined from tracer injections. In the lower Arboleda (the only reach receiving regional gw) CO2 fluxes (fCO2) averaged 5.5 mol C per m2 of stream surface per day, ~7.5x higher than the average (0.7 mol C m-2 d-1) from the stream reaches with no regional gw inflow (the Taconazo and upper Arboleda). The regional gw inflow had no measurable effect on CH4 emissions. To further understand the dynamics of enhanced CO2 degassing from the lower Arboleda, we examined spatiotemporal patterns in fCO2 using floating chambers. Both static and drifting chambers revealed high spatial heterogeneity in fCO2 at the scale of 5 to 30 m reaches. Temporal trends were highly localized; in two of three subreaches surveyed repeatedly, fCO2 increased with stream discharge and did not differ between wet and dry seasons, but the third subreach showed the opposite behavior. Results from static and drifting chambers deviated 31% and -36%, respectively, from tracer injection results. CO2 degassing from the Arboleda is a large C flux; when averaged over the watershed area it is similar in magnitude to the net ecosystem exchange measured by eddy covariance. Elevated CO2 emissions from the Arboleda stream are consistent with measurements of higher CO2 concentration in the air above the Arboleda stream, and low 14C in plants growing near the Arboleda weir, a zone of high stream gas exchange where geological CO2 low in 14C is degassed from the stream and taken up by riparian plants. The outcomes of this research contribute to the understanding of how catchment connections to underlying hydrogeological systems can affect terrestrial ecosystem C budgets.",

            "abstract": "The pattern and causes of intermediate and deep ocean temperature variability are poorly understood, in part because of a paucity of reliable paleothermometers. Long-lived, cosmopolitan deep-sea bamboo corals (Keratoisis sp.) may be valuable paleotemperature archives, but realizing their potential has been complicated by evidence for vital and kinetic effects. Among these is a strong linear correlation in δ18O and δ13C along radial growth transects. The “lines” method assumes a common mechanism causes proportional δ18O and δ13C deviations from equilibrium, and empirically accounts for them to estimate the mean growth temperature across a coral’s lifespan. Recent work suggests similar δ18O - δ13C trends occur in contemporaneous skeleton, raising the possibility that timeseries of “lines” paleotemperatures may be possible. Here, we explore the mechanisms and paleoclimatic utility of the “lines” method using 1) traditional IRMS-based analyses of micromilled samples 2) SIMS-based analyses of δ18O and δ13C and 3) carbonate clumped isotopes. Consistent with previous studies, micromilled data show that clear linear δ18O - δ13C correlations in skeleton deposited during approximately the same multidecadal interval yield accurate, albeit relatively imprecise, “lines” paleotemperatures. However, SIMS data show no clear correlation suggesting that other processes affect δ18O - δ13C variability at spatial scales of tens of microns. Clumped isotope data will help evaluate if these patterns are consistent with variations in equilibrium dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) speciation associated with pH, a non-equilibrium DIC pool and/or kinetic effects at the solution-skeleton interface.",

Federal, state and local governments in the United States are demanding guidance on flood frequency estimates that account for climate change. If a trend exists in peak flow series, ignoring it could result in large quantile estimator bias, while trying to estimate a trend will increase the flood quantile estimator’s variance. Thus the issue is, what bias-variance tradeoff should we accept?\nThis paper discusses approaches to flood frequency analysis (FFA) when flood series have trends. GCMs describe how annual runoff might vary over sub-continental scales, but this information is nearly useless for FFA in small watersheds. A LP3 Monte Carlo analysis and a re-sampling study of 100-year flood estimation (25- and 50-year projections) compares the performance of five methods:\nFFA as prescribed in national guidelines (Bulletin 17B), assumes the flood series is stationary and follows a log-Pearson type III (LP3) distribution;\nFitting a LP3 distribution with time-varying parameters that include future trends in mean and perhaps variance, where slopes are assumed known;\nFitting a LP3 distribution with time-varying parameters that capture future trends in mean and perhaps variance, where slopes are estimated from annual peak flow series;\nEmploying only the most recent 30 years of flood records to fit a LP3 distribution;\nApplying a safety factor to the 100-year flood estimator (e.g. 25% increase).\nThe 100-year flood estimator of method 2 has the smallest log-space mean squared error, though it is unlikely that the true trend would be known. Method 3 is only recommended over method 1 for large trends (≥ 0.5% per year). The 100-year flood estimators of method 1, 4, and 5 often have poor accuracy. Clearly, flood risk assessment will be a challenge in an uncertain world.",

Here, this work is extended by examining the last 7500 years of biogenic sedimentation from marine sediment core EW0408-33JC (57.16°N, 135.36°W, 144 m water depth), which is constrained by 17 age-control points spaced every ~500 years. We use bromine (Br) intensities measured by core-scanning XRF with a 2-mm sampling resolution as a geochemical proxy for past primary productivity. These Br intensities are calibrated to organic Br concentrations using a combination of quantitative WD-XRF methods and synchrotron-radiation Br speciation studies, with cross-verification provided by low-resolution analyses of other productivity proxies, including biogenic silica (opal), total organic carbon (TOC), and organic matter δ13C ratios. Our findings indicate distinct centennial-to-millennial changes, with positive productivity excursions between 7500-7000, 6500-6000, 5000-3500, 2500-1500, and 1000-500 INTCAL13 yr BP. We compare the timing of these excursions against a compilation of marine and terrestrial paleoclimate records sensitive to forcing by the Aleutian Low to determine if the positive relationship between atmosphere/ocean dynamics and marine primary productivity has remained consistent over the last 7500 years. Other potential forcing mechanisms (e.g., solar insolation, irradiance) are also considered.\n",

The gas composition changes systematically from CH4 ± H2 in type 1 and 2a to CH4 + higher hydrocarbons in type 2b and to CO2 dominant type 3 inclusions. Most of the inclusions show re-equilibration texures (‘implosion’ halos). Another typical feature is a tendency to decrepitate at temperatures higher than 140-150 °C.\nThe fluid evolution started with the exsolution of a saline aqueous liquid (~25 wt.% NaCl eq.) from the pegmatitic melt at a temperature of about 400 °C and a pressure around 1100 bars. Further evolution occurred due to cooling (isobaric) and oxidation of the fluid. Early initial oxidation led to formation of higher hydrocarbons by oxidative coupling of methane, and later, full-blown oxidation led to the production of CO2. The CO2 reacted with Na-rich fluid to form nahcolite, which caused a significant decrease in the apparent salinity down to a critical level, below which further oxidation led to an increase in the CO2/CH4 ratio and eventual disappearance of CH4. Isobaric cooling continued down to at least 150-170 °C, at which temperature the CO2 component was consumed to form REE-rich flurocarbonates. Nahcolite decomposed to release additional CO2 and Na. The CO2 was consumed by further fluid-rock interaction, whereas the Na contributed to an increase in fluid salinity.",

Just prior to the historic New Horizons encounter with the Pluto system, NASA celebrated Small Worlds Week (July 6-10) as a fully online program to highlight small worlds mission discoveries.\nSmall Worlds Week leveraged the infrastructure of Sun-Earth Days that included a robust web design, exemplary education materials, hands-on fun activities, multimedia resources, science and career highlights, and a culminating event. Each day from July 6-9, a new class of solar system small worlds was featured on the website: Monday-comets, Tuesday-asteroids, Wednesday-icy moons, and Thursday-dwarf planets. Then on Friday, July 10, nine scientists from Goddard Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, and Lunar and Planetary Institute gathered online for four hours to answer questions from the public via Facebook and Twitter. Throughout the afternoon the scientists worked closely with a social media expert and several summer interns to reply to inquirers and to archive their chats. By all accounts, Small Worlds Week was a huge success. The group plans to improve and replicate the program during the school year with a more classroom focus, and then to build and extend the program to be held every year.

This close to the Sun the background solar-wind properties are highly inhomogeneous. As a result, outward-propagating Alfven waves (AWs) arising from the random motions of the photospheric magnetic-field footpoints undergo strong non-WKB reflections and trigger a vigorous turbulent cascade. In this talk I will discuss recent progress in the understanding of reflection-driven Alfven turbulence in this scenario by means of high-resolution numerical simulations, with the goal of predicting the detailed nature of the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations that the SPP mission will measure. In particular, I will place special emphasis on relating the simulations to relevant physical mechanisms that might govern the radial evolution of the turbulence spectra of outward/inward-propagating fluctuations and discuss the conditions that lead to universal power-laws.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake early warning (EEW) includes two tasks: detecting an earthquake and estimating its size. Detection requires low instrumental noise; estimating the size can be done most simply by estimating the moment from the static (near-field) signal, which does not saturate with magnitude. The usual approach in EEW has been to use inertial sensors (detecting acceleration) for low noise, and GPS (measuring displacement) to determine the static signal. Because a strainmeter can combine low noise and broad frequency response in a single sensor, such systems should also be considered for EEW networks. While borehole strainmeters often do not record the static offset correctly, past results from longbase laser strainmeters (LSM's) show that this can be done reliably if the strain is measured over hundreds of meters. Recent developments in optical fiber LSM's have allowed the construction of low-cost, low-power long-base LSM's with low noise in the frequency band of interest. Digital processing of the interference signal makes possible a flat frequency response from 0 to 100 Hz and a high dynamic range, with the upper limit (strain of 0.1%) set by the tensioning of the fiber. Such instruments can be flexibly sited, including in locations, such as the ocean floor, impracticable for GPS. Application of such instruments to EEW will require further, though straightforward, development of processing methods and installation techniques, as well as testing under conditions of high dynamic strain; additional modeling will be needed to determine the optimal use LSM's in an EEW seismometer/GPS network.",

            "abstract": "Rate and state friction (RSF) laws are empirical relationships that describe the frictional behavior of rocks and other materials in experiments, and reproduce a variety of observed natural behavior when employed in earthquake models. A pervasive observation from rock friction experiments is the linear increase of static friction with the log of contact time, or ‘ageing’. Ageing is usually attributed to an increase in real area of contact associated with asperity creep. However, recent atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments demonstrate that ageing of nanoscale silica-silica contacts is due to progressive formation of interfacial chemical bonds in the absence of plastic deformation, in a manner consistent with the multi-contact ageing behavior of rocks [Li et al., 2011]. To further investigate chemical bonding-induced ageing, we explored the influence of normal load (and thus contact normal stress) and contact time on ageing. Experiments that mimic slide-hold-slide rock friction experiments were conducted in the AFM for contact loads and hold times ranging from 23 to 393 nN and 0.1 to 100 s, respectively, all in humid air (~50% RH) at room temperature. Experiments were conducted by sequentially sliding the AFM tip on the sample at a velocity V of 0.5 μm/s, setting V to zero and holding the tip stationary for a given time, and finally resuming sliding at 0.5 μm/s to yield a peak value of friction followed by a drop to the sliding friction value. Chemical bonding-induced ageing, as measured by the peak friction minus the sliding friction, increases approximately linearly with the product of normal load and the log of the hold time. Theoretical studies of the roles of reaction energy barriers in nanoscale ageing indicate that frictional ageing depends on the total number of reaction sites and the hold time [Liu & Szlufarska, 2012]. We combine chemical kinetics analyses with contact mechanics models to explain our results, and develop a new approach for curve fitting ageing vs. load data which shows that the friction drop data points all fall on a master curve. The analysis yields physically reasonable values for the activation energy and activation volume of the chemical bonding process. Our study provides a basis to hypothesize that the kinetic processes in chemical bonding-induced ageing do not depend strongly on normal load.",

            "abstract": "The Isabella Anomaly is a volume of relatively high seismic velocity upper mantle beneath the southern Great Valley in California. We deployed ~45 broadband seismometers in central California to test two main hypotheses for the origin of the Isabella Anomaly. One suggests that the Isabella Anomaly is the foundered lithospheric root of the southern Sierra Nevada batholith, which delaminated on account of eclogite-rich composition and translated westward as it began to sink into the asthenosphere. The other hypothesis suggests that the Isabella Anomaly is a fossil slab fragment attached to the Monterey microplate that lies offshore of central California and thus it is mechanically coupled to the Pacific plate. Prior seismic imaging with ~70 km station spacing cannot resolve the landward termination of Monterey microplate lithosphere beneath coastal California or where/if the Isabella Anomaly is attached to North America lithosphere beneath the Great Valley. The new temporary broadband array consists of 40 broadband seismometers with ~7 km spacing extending from the central California coast to the western Sierra Nevada batholith, plus some outliers to fill gaps in the regional network coverage. The temporary array was initially deployed in early 2014 and will continue to record until October 2015 so the complete data are not yet available. Preliminary Ps scattered wave images show an abrupt ~6 km increase in Moho depth eastward across the San Andreas fault, a strong positive impedance contrast that dips westward from ~7-25 km beneath Great Valley, and a sharp Moho with a slight westward dip beneath the western edge of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Apparently low impedance contrast characterizes the Moho beneath the eastern Great Valley and foothills, consistent with near mantle velocities in the lower crust. Processing of the cumulative data that will be available in October 2015 and incorporation of new tomography models into scattered wave imaging are needed before assessing the significance of potential uppermost mantle interfaces that may represent edges of the Isabella Anomaly. Results from Ps and Sp scattered wave imaging, ambient noise surface wave tomography, teleseismic body-wave tomography, and teleseismic shear wave splitting will be presented.",

Using the extensive field measurements database from the 10,000 USGS measurement locations across the CONUS, parameters were developed for the kinematic wave routing in FLASH. This presentation will highlight FLASH performance over the CONUS on basins less than 1,000 km2 and discuss the development of simulated streamflow climatology over the CONUS for data mining applications.

            "abstract": "The epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model is one of the most popular tools for modeling seismicity and quantifying risk in earthquake-prone regions. Under the ETAS model, the occurrence times of earthquakes are treated as a self-exciting Poisson process where each earthquake briefly increases the probability of subsequent earthquakes occurring soon afterwards, which captures the fact that large mainshocks tend to produce long sequences of aftershocks. A triggering kernel controls the amount by which the probability increases based on the magnitude of each earthquake, and the rate at which it then decays over time. \nThis triggering kernel is usually chosen heuristically, to match the parametric form of the modified Omori law for aftershock decay. However recent work has questioned whether this is an appropriate choice. Since the choice of kernel has a large impact on the predictions made by the ETAS model, avoiding misspecification is crucially important.\n\nWe present a novel nonparametric version of ETAS which avoids making parametric assumptions, and instead learns the correct specification from the data itself. Our approach is based on the Dirichlet process, which is a modern class of Bayesian prior distribution which allows for efficient inference over an infinite dimensional space of functions. We show how our nonparametric ETAS model can be fit to data, and present results demonstrating that the fit is greatly improved compared to the standard parametric specification. Additionally, we explain how our model can be used to perform probabilistic declustering of earthquake catalogs, to classify earthquakes as being either aftershocks or mainshocks. and to learn the causal relations between pairs of earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Central segment of San Andreas Fault (CSAF) is characterized by a nearly continuous right-lateral aseismic slip. However, observations of the creep rate obtained using Characteristically Repeating Earthquakes (CREs) show a quasi-periodic temporal variation, which is recently confirmed using both InSAR surface deformation time series and geodetic-based time-dependent kinematic model of creep along the CSAF. Here, we show that the statistical analysis of creep fronts along the CSAF indicates a sporadic behavior, signature of a burst-like creep dynamics. Moreover, the probability of creep velocities follows a Gumbel distribution characterized by longer tail toward the extreme positive rates. Fourier analysis of the time series of surface creep rate indicates a self-affine regime with Hurst exponent altering between 0.6 and 0.9 during the observation period of 2003-2011. The variable Hurst component is an indicator for temporal variation in the roughness of the fault zone. To explain the causes of creep avalanches, two possible mechanisms are considered, including temporal variation in: 1) fault geometry, and 2) Ambient normal stress. We find that the overall statistical dependence between the pattern of surface creep rate and the fault geometry is insignificant. To investigate the effect of ambient normal stress, primarily due to variation in pore pressure, we implement a rate and state friction law to link the time-dependent kinematic creep model to the spatiotemporal variations of the normal stress on the velocity-strengthening fault zones. These observations and models help to understand the driving mechanisms that govern the creep rate variations at short spatial length and low velocities. Under these circumstances, the other mechanisms such as thermal pressurization are not feasible.",

NASA’s Applied Sciences’ Capacity Building Program (CBP) offers training, project collaboration, and decision support tool co-development to decision-makers through three program elements called ARSET, DEVELOP, and SERVIR. With a portfolio that includes multiple capacity building approaches, it is important to monitor progress over time to assess impact and identify improvements. The diversity of activities requires a monitoring approach that tracks overall impact as well as the impacts of individual program elements. Building on ongoing element-level monitoring, CBP recently established a set of overarching standardized targets, identified indicators for each target, and developed a methodology to collect the data across the program. This presentation will include program and element case studies highlighting the capacity building approaches and current practices for monitoring progress and assessing impact.",

            "abstract": "Plasma jets aka bursty bulk flows play a crucial role in Earth's magnetosphere dynamics, in particular during substorms where\nthey can penetrate down to the geosynchronous orbit. The energy input from the solar wind is partly dissipated in jet fronts\n(also called dipolarization fronts) in the form of strong whistler waves that can heat and accelerate energetic electrons. The\nratio of the energy transported during jets to the substorm energy consumption can reach one third or more due to kinetic-scale\nphenomena, that are still under debate due to instrumental limitations. The recently-launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)\nmission has already detected numerous plasma jet events, and evolves in a tetrahedral configuration (with an average inter-\nsatellite distance of 160 km and unprecedent resolutions up to 16,000 samples/s) that allows to study in detail the microphysics\nof these phenomena. Thus in this study we employ MMS data to investigate the energy dissipated in jet fronts related to the\ngeneration of whistler waves, and the interaction of such waves with energetic electrons in the vicinity of the flow/jet braking\nregion near the equatorial boundary between tail and inner magnetosphere. We also make use of ray tracing simulations to evaluate\ntheir propagation properties, as well as their impact on particles in the off-equatorial magnetosphere.",

Component magnetization directions indicate an apparent magnetic excursion in Core MD04-2822 at 16 meters below seafloor (mbsf), corresponding to an age of 26.5 ka, and occupying ~30 cm of core implying an excursion duration of ~350 yrs. The relative paleointensity (RPI) records from the two cores can be matched to each other, and only in part to other RPI records and to lower resolution RPI reference templates. Magnetic concentration and grain-size parameters change together with benthic d13C/d18O and with SST proxies, with coarser magnetic grain size and higher magnetic concentration during glacial stages and cold SST (Dansgaard-Oescheger) intervals. The magnetic parameters are, however, lagged by several kyr relative to benthic d18O at Terminations I and II. The mean grain size of sortable-silt (10-63 µm) across Termination I in Core MD04-2822 implies changes in bottom-current velocity, although these are decoupled from the progressive fining of (magnetite) grain size across Termination I implied by magnetic grain size parameters. The magnetic parameters, respond to a fine (micron-scale) grain size fraction, and are interpreted as being sensitive to changes in detrital source (bottom-current path) rather than bottom-current strength.",

            "abstract": "In this study we develop a systematic methodology to analyze cyclogenesis in high resolution climate model simulations. The motivation for this study is to understand how cyclones develop in simulations with the objective of improving the theoretical foundations of cyclogenesis. We use the toolkit for extreme climate analysis (TECA) [Prabhat et al., ICCS 2012] to detect and track cyclones (TCs) in recent high resolution simulations (25km) of current day and climate change scenarios [Wehner et al, J Climate 2015], as well as reanalyses. We systematically adjust the tracking criteria to identify developing and non-developing TCs. The detection and tracking criteria are based on (i) the local relative vorticity maximum being above a certain value, (ii) the colocation of vorticity maximum, surface pressure minimum and warm core temperature maximum, (iii) surface pressure gradient around the storm center to be above a certain value, and (iv) temperature gradient around the warm core center to be above a certain value. To identify non-developing TCs, we systematically characterize the sensitivity of cyclone detection to these criteria using a principal component analysis on the criteria. First, we composite vorticity, pressure and temperature fields around the start of each cyclone’s trajectory. Second, we find the covariance of pairs of thresholded variables, for example, vorticity and pressure gradient. Finally, we construct a cross-correlation matrix with these covariances and find the eigenvectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue describes the direction of maximum sensitivity.We simultaneously lower thresholds along the direction of maximum sensitivity, which results in an increase in the number of TC-like systems and trajectory lengths compared to the baseline case. We contrast the behavior of developing and non-developing TCs by constructing multivariate joint PDFs of various environmental conditions along their trajectories. We also compute the standard genesis potential index, max potential intensity and ventilation index along these trajectories. Existing indices do not appear to capture the probability of cyclogenesis accurately. Multivariate joint PDF analysis could provide the foundation to develop a more comprehensive predictive tool for cyclogenesis.",

These waves are generated by photo-ionized protons from the Martian corona and reflect the density of the exosphere. However, the amplitude of these waves is highly variable. Despite direct observations of pickup protons, the associated ion cyclotron waves may be absent. We show that this typically occurs when the solar wind magnetic field and velocity are perpendicular. Theoretical calculations and numerical modeling show that the thermal solar wind may damp ion cyclotron waves and suppress the ion cyclotron wave generation. When pickup ions have a significant velocity parallel to the magnetic field, the Doppler shift between the core and pickup protons allows wave growth. Future work, relating ion cyclotron wave amplitude to the ionization of the exosphere, will need to account for this necessary condition for the wave generation process.",

The four data quality management phases as identified by the DQWG are: 1. Capturing (i.e., deriving, collecting and organizing the information), 2. Describing (i.e., documenting and procuring the information for public consumption), 3. Facilitating Discovery (i.e., publishing and providing access to the information), and 4. Enabling Use (i.e., enhancing the utility of the information). Mapping each of our recommendations to one or more of the above management phases is intended to enable improved assessment of cost, feasibility, and relevancy to the entities responsible for implementing such recommendations. The DQWG further defined two distinct actionable categories: 1) Data Systems and 2) Science. The purpose of these actionable categories is to define specifically who is responsible for the implementation and adherence toward these recommendations; we refer to the responsible entities as the “actionees”. Here we will summarize each of the high level recommendations along with their corresponding management phases and actionees. We will present what has recently been identified as our set of “low-hanging fruit” recommendations, which are intended for near-term implementation. Finally, we will present the status and motivation for continuing and future planned activities, which include but are not limited to: engaging inter-agency and international communities, more direct feedback from Earth observation missions, and mapping of “low-hanging fruit” recommendations to existing solutions.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the western US, growing population centers rely on mountain watersheds that are already sensitive to hydrologic stressors. We examined rivers along Utah’s Wasatch Front over a range of spatial and discharge scales, confusing on the mountain-to-urban transition to identify how urbanization impacts water resources. The rivers we studied all originate in canyons with impact level ranging from minimal human disturbance to roads and open grazing cattle. Each river enters an urban area after leaving the canyon, where there is significantly more anthropogenic impact on the system. As part of an interdisciplinary effort with the iUTAH project, sample sites were selected at intervals along each river and a variety of measurements were made, including basic water chemistry along with discharge, water isotopes, nutrients, and organic matter analysis.\nBy combining physical and chemical parameters we were able to quantify groundwater influence in gaining reaches and how those differ between the mountain and urban environments. We also identified how the urban system impacted hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in the catchment. For example, in Red Butte Creek discharge tripled through gaining reached in the canyon with only small corresponding changes in conductivity or nitrate levels. However in the urban stretch a gaining reach that tripled the discharge corresponded with a doubling in the conductivity and order of magnitude increase in nitrate. The fact that we first see this change in chemistry during a gaining reach, and not in an area full of storm culverts, suggests that urban impact to stream chemistry predominately occurs through the groundwater. Further work will incorporate ecological and climatic data along with the hydrologic and chemical datasets to identify how controls on water resources change along the mountain to urban gradient. By combining this physical information with sociological data we can identify green infrastructure solutions to mitigate urban impacts on our waterways.",

Methylating organisms are now known to exist in almost all anaerobic niches including fermentation, Fe(III)- and sulfate- reduction as well as methanogenesis. The study objective was to determine the effect of different carbon sources on the microbial community and methylating populations in particular along a Hg contaminated creek. Sediment cores from upstream and downstream at the Hg contaminated East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC), Oak Ridge TN, and a background site were sectioned by depth, and Hg-methylation potential (HgMP) assays were performed using stable isotope spikes. Sediments from the lowest depth possessed the highest in-situ activity. Replicate samples were amended with different carbon substrates (cellulose, acetate, propionate, lactate, ethanol and methanol), spiked with stable isotopes for HgMP assays and incubated for 24hrs. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to determine alterations in Bacterial and Archaeal population dynamics. Additionally, bioinformatics and our new qualitative and quantitative hgcAB primers were utilized to determine microbial community structure alterations and correlate organism and gene abundance with altered MeHg generation.\nHgMP was significantly reduced in cellulose amended sediments while acetate and propionate slightly decreased HgMP in both sites. Methanol, ethanol and lactate increased the HgMP in EFPC downstream while cellulose amendment significantly decreased the Proteobacteria, and the Firmicutes increased but none are currently known to produce MeHg. Geobacter bemidjiensis in particular significantly decreased in cellulose amended sediments in all three sites from being predominant in-situ. This suggests that in EFPC downstream and background sites, the prevalent Hg-methyaltors might be Deltaprotebacteria, since upstream, cellulose amendment did not reduce HgMP even though relative composition of Deltaproteobacteria decreased significantly. Hence the phylogenetic distribution of Hg-methylating bacteria upstream may be much broader. Most Archaea belonged to either Euryarchaeota or Crenarchaeota, but there were no consistent trends with specific groups among the treatments.",

Seasonal and inter-annual differences in phenology can affect surface energy balance and land-atmosphere carbon flux. Considering the relative importance of the Arctic to global carbon balance, improved scaling and extrapolation of phenological dynamics from the plot level to the landscape level is important for advancing our understanding of the impact of climate and other environmental change in arctic terrestrial ecosystems.\nSeasonal and interannual landscape phenology was observed over the Mobile Instrumented Sensor Platform (MISP) grid (2 x 50 meters) located in Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska using imagery acquired from kite aerial photography (KAP), a hyperspectral ground-based spectrometer, and a phenocam. These data were analyzed in RGB and non-traditional HSV and l*a*b*color spaces to determine site, plant community seasonal, and inter annual phenological dynamics. Results were also compared to high spatial resolution satellite imagery to determine optimal indices for scaling vegetation dynamics from plot to landscape level.\nThese results show that greenness indices similar to those acquired from hyperspectral remote sensing platforms can be derived using low-cost and low-tech techniques that could be deployed at multiple sites at low cost.",

            "abstract": "The reliability of melt inclusions (MI) for deciphering magmatic processes is the subject of debate. While the compositional variability of MI in single samples or phenocrysts can nominally be used to understand crystallization processes and magma dynamics of active volcanic systems, the observed variability can potentially result from modification after trapping or by boundary-layer effects. Key to assessing whether MI reliability is to study melt inclusion assemblages (MIA). MIA represent groups of MI trapped at the same time. Compositional differences between inclusions in an MIA can therefore guide interpretation of the modification processes that occurred after entrapment.\nWe analyzed melt inclusions in a euhedral olivine phenocryst from the Solchiaro eruption at Procida (Southern Italy) that is the most primitive eruption in the Phlegrean Volcanic District. The olivine is reversely zoned from Fo84 at the core to Fo87 at the rim. Selection of MIA near the rim and at the core was based on petrography and phosphorus X-Ray maps. We measured major elements plus S, Cl, P by electron microprobe in 12 MI belonging to the same MIA near the phenocryst rim. With the exception of Mg and Ca, element concentrations are consistent and independent of MI size. In contrast, Mg concentration increases and Ca concentration decreases with increasing MI diameter. After post-entrapment crystallization, a boundary layer formed at the olivine MI interface with concentration profiles developing toward the center of MI. Smaller MI will reequilibrate (homogenize) faster than larger MI. If the same melt was trapped in MI with different size and all the MI were measured at their centers, a correlation between concentration and size will result depending on the length of the profile.\nTrapped melt compositions in a MIA from the core of the same olivine are significantly more evolved (Al/Ca 1.96±0.04 wt%) than those from the MIA at the rim (Al/Ca 1.30±0.06 wt%). In particular, K2O is enriched in melt trapped in the core (3.70±0.05 wt%) relative to the melt trapped near the rim of the olivine (1.48±0.09 wt%). Thus, the composition of the melt inclusions is consistent with the reverse zoning of the crystal indicating that injection of more primitive basaltic melt mixed with a more evolved shallower melt prior to the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation has been expanding rapidly in China with total capacity quadrupled from 8 to 32 GW between 2012 and 2014. Studies find that China has the potential to increase solar PV in total energy generation up towards 10% (about 300 GW in total capacity) by 2030. However, severe air pollution in China reduces the productivity of solar PV panels by scattering and absorbing sunlight before it reaches the surface. In this study, we first calculate the surface radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols (considering only the direct effect) over China from 2003 to 2013 using the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) reanalysis dataset constrained by satellite derived greenhouse gas, reactive gases and aerosols. Our results indicate that, from 2003-2013, the attenuation of sunlight by aerosols over Eastern China averaged about -25 W m-2 compared with the global mean effect of -4.4 W m-2. The largest attenuation is found in Northern China in spring when mean attenuation reached as high as -57 W m-2. This attenuation reduced surface radiative flux by approximately 10%. In Southeastern China, maximum attenuation also occurred in spring, but had a smaller -40 W m-2 monthly mean. Western China is pristine in comparison, featuring no more than a -15 W m-2 monthly mean attenuation. These results imply a potentially large benefit for solar PV efficiency of improving air quality in eastern regions of China. We estimate that, if anthropogenic aerosols were entirely removed in China, solar PV generation would (1) increase 4.5-6.7% (varying among provinces) in Northeastern China where there is abundant solar resource,; (2) reduce the payback period by up to 1 year, increasing investment incentives particularly for distributed PV in Eastern China; and (3) increase total electricity generation in China in 2030 by up to 34 TWh/yr if the total capacity reaches 480 GW, equivalent to one-third of current annual electricity generation from the Three Gorges Dam.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves the injection of fluids above lithostatic pressures to increase permeability of rocks at depth. During the fracturing process thousands of micro-seismic events are generated as the fracture front propagates outwards from the injection point. Sand or glass beads are frequently injected later in the stage to prop the fractures and maintain flow paths open. Because injection progresses in time and space changing the in situ characteristics the generated seismic events show a combination of seismic signatures between two end members: Coulomb stress transfer on favorably oriented fractures and fluid-induced tensile fractures. In this study we investigate the failure process of ~27,000 micro-seismic fractures induced during a hydraulic fracturing shale completion program. Our goal is to identify spatial and temporal distribution of families of events with similar characteristic rupture behaviors, for different injection phases and relative locations based on either rock formation, depth, source mechanism, fracture plane orientation, stress drop, etc., to classify distinct dynamic failure processes. In our analysis we estimate static and dynamic stress drop, radiated energy, seismic efficiency, moment tensor, fracture plane orientation, slip direction and rupture velocity. On average, the micro-seismic events have low radiated energy, low dynamic stress and low seismic efficiency failing in overshoot mode, with slow rupture velocities consistent with failure on fluid lubricated fractures with decreased friction resistance. Slip is accommodated on fracture planes with orientations dominated by the rock fabric and not always optimally oriented to the regional stress field. Subtle source characteristic differences can be identified: Events occurring in deeper formations tend to have faster rupture velocities and are more efficient in radiating energy. Variations in rupture velocity tend to correlate with variation in depth, fault azimuth and elapsed time, reflecting a dominance of the local stress field over other factors.",

Apparent universal functions of the dimensionless similarity parameters are also presented based on results from direct numerical simulations (DNS). These simulations allow the variability of the low-level jet (LLJ) height and its speed to be specified along with the height of both the dynamic and the thermal boundary layers. Such scaling relations are of interest for numerical and experimental communities, given that they facilitate the design of experiments and the parameterization of thermally driven flows over a broad range of scales and applications. Normalized DNS profiles show a remarkable collapse of the proposed flow features and suggest the LLJ could be regarded as a transition layer separating the inner (laminar) wall regions from the outer (turbulent) flow. A dynamic and a thermodynamic identity – to be employed in assessing convergence of averaging operations is also proposed and tested using the DNS.",

The current release 3.0 (available at gewex-srb.larc.nasa.gov) uses the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) DX product for pixel level radiance and cloud information. This product is subsampled to 30 km. ISCCP is currently recalibrating and recomputing their entire data series, to be released as the H product, at 10km resolution. The ninefold increase in pixel number will allow SRB a higher resolution gridded product (e.g. 0.5 degree), as well as the production of pixel-level fluxes.\nOther key input improvements include a detailed aerosol history using the Max Planck Institut Aerosol Climatology (MAC), temperature and moisture profiles from HIRS, and new topography, surface type, and snow/ice.\nAt the time of abstract submission, results from the year 2007 have been produced. More years will be added as ISCCP reprocessing occurs. Here we present results for the improved GEWEX Shortwave and Longwave algorithm (GSW and GLW) with new ISCCP data, the various other improved input data sets and the incorporation of many additional internal SRB model improvements. Improvements in GSW include an expansion of the number of wavelength bands from five to eighteen, and the inclusion of ice cloud vs. water cloud radiative transfer. The SRB data produced will be released as part of the Release 4.0 Integrated Product, recognizing the interdependence of the radiative fluxes with other GEWEX products providing estimates of the Earth's global water and energy cycle (I.e., ISCCP, SeaFlux, LandFlux, NVAP, etc.).",

In this study, we used a physically based watershed model, Dynamic Watershed Simulation Model (DWSM), to obtain these values, based on which we examined spatial patterns of sediment dynamics in a watershed with the area of 311 km2for an extreme storm event. By dividing the watershed into 42 overland elements and 21 connected stream segments and fitting the hydrograph and sedigraph of at its outlet, we tested the simultaneously predicted hydrological and sediment variables in these overlands and stream segments using the measured event runoff volume (V) and sediment yield (SSYe) at both a sub-watershed and the outlet of the study watershed. Then, using these predicted variables, we examined the relationship between SSYe and area (A), precipitation (P), mean slope (S), soil K-factor (K), and percent cropland(%L) for all overland elements (i.e., the small spatial scale), and the changes of SSYe with peak flow (Qpeak) and event runoff depth (h). We found that SSYe at this scale cannot be explained well by these variables. Next, we investigated the relationships between SSYe and A, sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and Qpeak of a series of first-order and nested sub-watersheds, respectively, which led to good correlation. The different spatial patterns between two spatial scales suggest that sediment transport is more controlled by surface conditions of the overlands, while by in-channel hydraulics at the sub-watershed scale for this event. Further analysis also revealed that both flow and sediment-transport regimes were changed during this event. Our study demonstrated a new means of characterizing spatially and temporal variable hydrological and sediment connectivity.",

            "abstract": "Solar polar jets are observed to originate in regions within the open field of solar coronal holes. These so called “anemone” regions are associated with an embedded dipole topology, consisting of a fan-separatrix and a spine line emanating from a null point occurring at the top of the dome shaped fan surface (Antiochos 1996). In this study, we analyze simulations using the Adaptively Refined MHD Solver (ARMS) that take into account gravity, solar wind, and spherical geometry to generate polar jets by reconnection between a twisted embedded bipole and the surrounding open field (Karpen et al. 2015). These simulations confirm and extend previous Cartesian studies of polar jets based on this mechanism (Pariat et al. 2009, 2010, 2015), as well as extending the analyses from our previous work (Roberts et al. 2014,2015) out to radial distances that will be sampled by Solar Probe Plus. Focusing on the plasma density, velocity, magnetic field, and current density, we interpolate the adaptively gridded simulation data onto a regular grid, and analyze the signatures that the jet produces as it propagates outward from the solar surface into the inner heliosphere. We also conduct simulated spacecraft fly-throughs of the jet in several different velocity regimes, illustrating the signatures that Solar Probe Plus may encounter in situ as the jet propagates into the heliosphere. The trans-Alfvénic nature of the jet front is confirmed by temporally differencing the plasma mass density and comparing the result with the local Alfvén speed. Our analysis confirms the presence of a reconnection driven magnetic turbulence in the simulated plasma jet, finding spatial correlations of magnetic fluctuations inside the jet to be in agreement with the scaling model of MHD turbulence. The turbulence cascade is supported by multiscale current sheets combined with filamentary structures representing fluid vorticies. The spatial orientation of these current sheets, combined with the anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations, is indicative of torsional Alfvén wave packets, consistent with the helical geometry of the jet.\nThis research was supported by NASA grant NNG11PL10A 670.036 to CUA/IACS (M.A.R. and V.M.U.) and NASA's Living With a Star Targeted Research and Technology (J.T.K. and C.R.D.) program.",

Scientific data, while a small fraction of that volume, pose a thorny problem for data-driven Earth science disciplines where temporal trends are critical: Older data sets, far from becoming obsolete, often gain in importance as time passes, and must therefore remain usable through careful curation. Unlike stone tablets, parchments, or high-quality paper, which have shelf lives of centuries or even millennia, digital data have a half-life measured in years to decades, not only because of medium degradation but, more critically, because of the rapid obsolescence of the underlying technology, in particular the software infrastructure. It is nigh impossible to use 7-track, 800bpi tapes from the 60’s, and it is questionable whether today’s media could be used in 2050. To combat obsolescence, data centers adopt a rigid discipline of “data migration,” with holdings regularly transferred to new technology every decade or so. This is typically required by parent agencies, and organizations such as the ICSU World Data System. In this light, it is clear that salvaging data from last century so that it can be analyzed simultaneously with current data becomes a massive migration exercise that is not helped by the all too common historical impulse to “save everything” (e.g., all successive versions of data, metadata, and higher-level products) as if resources and budgets were limitless. Further, software advances, longer series, better science, sometimes call for ever-improved reprocessing of entire data sets, which must be curated for that purpose in a condition that permits uniform processing. Other atavisms (e.g., save intermediate results, ostensibly as evidence trail; preserve all results for posterity, correct or not) leave “zombie” data sets never to be accessed for research. If unchecked, such practices could well overwhelm what Moore’s law can sustain. This is even more acute for simulation outputs, which can be essentially unbounded. I therefore argue that we need to develop a process and effective strategies acceptable to each community to select which data to save for long-term curation and which to discard, or face the zombies again in a few decades.",

            "abstract": "The urban heat island (UHI) represents ubiquitous urban warmth compared to surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon, when compounded with future climate warming, will exacerbate heat stress on urban residents who will comprise 70% of the world’s population by 2070. At the same time, urban climate adaptation plans have shown great potential for reducing the impacts of global change. In this study, we assess three mitigation strategies, including reflective roofs, green roofs, and street trees, to ameliorate the warming under climate change through both “online” and “offline” methods. The “online” method compares modeling results from a modified urban roof albedo configuration (ALB-MOD) where the roof albedo is raised to a high reflective value to the modeling results from the default configuration (CTRL), both using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Three pairs of simulations under current climate forcing and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are conducted. The “offline” method uses a surface temperature attribution solution derived previously for partitioning the UHI intensity to assess the efficacy of the mitigation strategies. The “offline” method supplements the “online” method in assessing green roof and street tree strategies, because the current design of CESM does not have explicit vegetation in the urban canopy configuration. The excellent agreement between the “online” and “offline” results confirms the validity of the offline scheme, supporting that the “offline” method can be used to predict the impacts of various urban adaptation strategies for development planning. Results show that albedo management is the most effective and viable way to mitigate UHIs, whereas although green roof and street trees strategies have evaporative cooling effects, the cooling is compensated by vegetation’s lower albedo, showing much less effectiveness on UHI mitigation. Although convection efficiency associated with the surface roughness is an important contributor to UHIs, both street trees and green roof bring minimal increase to the citywide surface roughness. Our results also show that the urban mitigation strategies can even completely offset the impacts of global warming on the local urban climate.",

            "abstract": "Hubbard Glacier, located in southeast Alaska, is the largest non-polar tidewater glacier in the world and one of a small number of glaciers that is steadily advancing. These attributes make it an intriguing target for observations of variations in ice dynamics over time. We use synthetic aperture radar data (ALOS and TerraSAR-X) and high-resolution optical imagery (WorldView and Quickbird) with a pixel tracking technique to map surface velocities from 2008 to the present, lengthening and broadening the time series of ice velocities presented in previous studies.\nA key result from our analysis is that Hubbard displays peak speeds of up to 12 m/day during the winter months (December – February) and minimum speeds during late summer (August – September). The times of peak and minimum speeds is quite different from those found in previous studies of Hubbard surface velocities derived from Landsat imagery, GPS, and photogrammetric methods. Those studies found peak speeds during late spring (May – June) and minimum speeds in fall (October-November), a pattern observed generally at tidewater glaciers.\nA second major feature we observe in our time series is the dramatic seasonal variation in surface speeds. The minimum speeds we find along the terminal lobe of the glacier are much lower than those found in previous studies, with values decreasing to near zero. Such a dramatic slow down of a tidewater glacier has not been widely observed. This result, along with the recent pattern of seasonal velocity peaks and minimas, suggests that Hubbard has undergone a change in ice dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Mineral deformation plays a key role in the creation of seismic anisotropy, an important tool used to understand the structure and nature of deep continental crust. Hornblende is a common anisotropic mineral that may account for much of the seismic anisotropy observed at deep crustal levels. Recent studies demonstrate a large range in the amount of seismic anisotropy produced by amphibole-rich tectonites (P-wave anisotropy values from 3-17%) without a systematic correlation between amphibole mode and anisotropy magnitude. We investigate this variation by studying two exhumed deep crustal shear zones where tectonites have similar mineralogy and foliation strength but contrasting anisotropy magnitude.\nThe structures are the km-scale Grease River shear zone (SZ1) in the Athabasca granulite terrane in northern Saskatchewan and a series of cm-scale shear zones (SZ2) in and near Gallatin Canyon in SW Montana. SZ1 reworked a deep crustal meta-granodiorite at conditions of 0.7-0.5 GPa and 600-700 °C, overprinting an earlier developed granulite facies assemblage and deformation fabric. SZ2 structures are characterized by strain gradients from undeformed meta-gabbro with igneous textures to a laminated ultramylonite at metamorphic conditions of uppermost amphibolite facies (1.1 GPa, 800° C). Both structures developed during fluid infiltration and involved significant growth and subsequent recrystallization of new hornblende, from less than 10% in the host rock to near 50% in the mylonite, at the expense of earlier pyroxene-rich assemblages. SZ1 mylonite has a strongly developed hornblende crystallographically preferred orientation (CPO) resulting in a moderately high P-wave anisotropy of 6.7%, whereas SZ2 ultramylonite exhibits a weak CPO and a low P-wave anisotropy of 2.1%, despite containing a well-developed hornblende shape-preferred orientation. We hypothesize that these contrasting microstructural and anisotropy patterns are due to deformation achieved through different hornblende deformation mechanisms, with dislocation creep dominant in SZ1 and dissolution-precipitation creep dominant in SZ2. We investigate factors influencing the dominant deformation mechanism including fluid composition, metamorphic grade, amphibole chemistry, strain rate, and kinematic regime.",

            "abstract": "The Sm-Nd system is widely used for tracking the differentiation and evolution of planetary silicate reservoirs, due to the well understood, strong Sm-Nd fractionation between melt and mantle minerals. The short-lived 146Sm-142Nd system with a half-life of 103 Ma or 68 Ma has been used to constrain early planetary differentiation events based on early Archean terrestrial rocks, lunar rocks and meteorites. Early Archean terrestrial rocks show significant variations in 142Nd/144Nd of about 30 ppm, demonstrating very early differentiation of the Earth’s mantle and crust. In contrast, present day 142Nd/144Nd ratios of mantle-derived ocean island basalts and MORBs show almost no variation at the reported analytical precision level (2σ = ± 6 ppm), suggesting that such early variations have been erased with time due to crustal recycling and mantle mixing. The 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the lunar mantle has been reported to be offset from terrestrial standards by about –5 ppm, barely resolvable with the reported analytical uncertainties. Differences in the 142Nd/144Nd ratios between the bulk Earth and Moon may suggest early large scale silicate differentiation events on the Earth that predate the Giant Moon forming impact. To address this problem, we carry out new 142Nd/144Nd measurements of terrestrial rocks, and lunar rocks and meteorites with a TIMS (Isoprobe T) equipped with new Xact Faraday amplifiers provided by Isotopx. We find that the Xact amplifiers provide lower noise than the earlier generation preamplifiers and operate close to the theoretical thermodynamic noise limit calculated from the Johnson equation. So far we have been able to improve multidynamic measurements to be reproducible to within ± 2 ppm at the 2σ level, and with this precision we find no variations in a few young terrestrial rocks. Our next step is measurements of lunar rocks and E-chondrites. If these turn out to be identical to the modern Earth, then the Nd isotope system may tell the same story as isotope ratios of many other elements: they are identical in the Earth, Moon and E-chondrites, and different from most other Solar System objects. There would thus be no need to postulate hidden reservoirs in the Earth’s mantle to explain the 142Nd/144Nd ratios of the modern Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "Beryllium isotopes have provided a useful tool in the field of geochronology and geomorphology over the last 25 years. The amount of cosmogenic meteoric 10Be and native 9Be absorbed to soils often scales with the residence time and chemical weathering of sediments in a landscape, respectively. Thus, the concentrations in river sediment may be used to quantify the denudation of specific watersheds. When deposited in ocean sediment, these concentrations are thought to record the history of denudation on Earth over the last ~10 Ma. The use of both isotopes often relies on the premise of beryllium retention to sediment surfaces in order to preserve a landscape’s erosion and weathering signature. Changes in setting, en route from the soil to fluvial system to the ocean, can cause beryllium desorption and may preclude some applications of the 10Be/9Be system.\nFour mechanisms were tested to determine the desorption potential of beryllium including a reduction in pH, an increase in ionic strength and complexation with soluble organic and inorganic species. These processes have the potential to mobilize beryllium into solution. For example, by both reducing the pH and increasing the ionic strength, competition for adsorption sites increases, potentially liberating beryllium from the sediment surface. In addition, organic and inorganic ligands can complex beryllium causing it to become mobilized. To determine which of these alterations influence beryllium desorption and to quantify the effect, we prepared separate solutions of beryllium bound to minerals and organic compounds and measured beryllium concentrations in solution before and after adjusting the pH, ionic strength, and changing inorganic and organic ligand concentrations. We conclude from our observations that overall, beryllium sorbed to organic compounds was more resistant to desorption relative to mineral-associated beryllium. Among the methods tested, a reduction in pH resulted in the greatest amount of beryllium desorption. Changes to the ionic strength and concentration of soluble organic and inorganic ligands affected the behavior of beryllium differently depending on the sorbent type. These results indicate that beryllium may be more mobile than previously expected.",

            "abstract": "Valley networks on Mars are river-like features that offer the best evidence for water activities in its geologic past. Previous studies have extracted valley network lines automatically from digital elevation model (DEM) data and manually from remotely sensed images. The volume of material removed by valley networks is an important parameter that could help us infer the amount of water needed to carve the valleys. A progressive black top hat (PBTH) transformation algorithm has been adapted from image processing to extract valley volume and successfully applied to simulated landform and Ma’adim Valles, Mars. However, the volume of valley network excavation on Mars has not been estimated on a global scale. In this study, the PBTH method was applied to the whole Mars to estimate this important parameter. The process was automated with Python in ArcGIS. Polygons delineating the valley associated depressions were generated by using a multi-flow direction growth method, which started with selected high point seeds on a depth grid (essentially an inverted valley) created by PBTH transformation and grew outward following multi-flow direction on the depth grid. Two published versions of valley network lines were integrated to automatically select depression polygons that represent the valleys. Some crater depressions that are connected with valleys and thus selected in the previous step were removed by using information from a crater database. Because of large distortion associated with global dataset in projected maps, the volume of each cell within a valley was calculated using the depth of the cell multiplied by the spherical area of the cell. The volumes of all the valley cells were then summed to produce the estimate of global valley excavation volume. Our initial result of this estimate was ~2.4×1014 m3. Assuming a sediment density of 2900 kg/m3, a porosity of 0.35, and a sediment load of 1.5 kg/m3, the global volume of water needed to carve the valleys was estimated to be ~7.1×1017 m3. Because of the coarse resolution of MOLA data, this is a conservative lower bound. Comparing with the hypothesized northern ocean volume 2.3×1016 m3 estimated by Carr and Head (2003), our estimate of water volume suggests and confirms an active hydrologic cycle for early Mars. Further hydrologic analysis will improve the estimate accuracy.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on regional climate change in Beijing, China using the online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry Model (WRF/Chem) with the Fu-Liou-Gu radiation scheme and a spatial resolution of 4km. We further updated this radiation scheme with a geometric-optics surface-wave (GOS) approach for the computation of light absorption and scattering by black carbon (BC) particles in which aggregation shape and internal mixing properties are accounted for. In addition, we incorporated in WRF/Chem a 3D radiative transfer parameterization in conjunction with high-resolution digital data for city buildings and landscape to improve the simulation of boundary-layer, surface solar fluxes and associated sensible/latent heat fluxes. Preliminary simulated meteorological parameters, fine particles (PM2.5) and their chemical components agree well with observational data in terms of both magnitude and spatio-temporal variations. The effects of anthropogenic aerosols, including BC, on radiative forcing, surface temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud water path, and precipitation are quantified on the basis of simulation results. With several preliminary sensitivity runs, we found that meteorological parameters and aerosol radiative effects simulated with the incorporation of improved BC absorption and 3-D radiation parameterizations deviate substantially from simulation results using the conventional homogeneous/core-shell configuration for BC and the plane-parallel model for radiative transfer. Understanding of the aerosol effects on regional climate change over megacities must consider the complex shape and mixing state of aerosol aggregates and 3D radiative transfer effects over city landscape.",

            "abstract": "This study describes the global responses of observed gravity waves (GWs) to winter planetary wave (PW) variations during stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) using TIMED-SABER temperature measurements. GWs affect the ionosphere and thermosphere, and it is important to understand global variations of GWs from the lower atmosphere to the thermosphere during SSWs in order to advance our understanding of vertical coupling. The responses of GWs to SSWs are shown by calculating correlations between vertical components of Eliassen-Palm (EP) fluxes in the winter polar stratosphere and global GW temperature amplitudes derived from SABER observations. Consistent with previous ground-based and satellite observations, winter EP fluxes show positive correlations with GWs in the winter hemisphere. More interestingly, winter stratospheric EP fluxes are positively correlated with GWs in the tropics and in the summer mesosphere, indicating global variations of GWs in response to PW variations in the winter hemisphere. To study the mechanism of GW response to SSWs, global wind simulations from SD-WACCM are used. Zonal wind anomalies (differences in the wind before and during SSWs) extend from the winter stratosphere to the summer mesosphere. By comparing anomalies in background winds to the observed patterns in the correlations between GWs and winter EP fluxes, we find that regions of positive correlation follow change in background winds and zero-wind lines. The results indicate that responses of SABER GWs in the summer hemisphere to winter PW variations during SSWs are likely caused by changes in GW propagation due to the changes in atmospheric circulation. These observed changes in global GWs during SSWs can affect the ionosphere and thermosphere, and studying global GW variation during SSWs is important for understanding mechanisms of vertical coupling.",

Preliminary results demonstrated the potential for improved accuracy and timeliness over commonly-used methods in which thresholds are based on simpler summary statistics of historical data. Other benefits of the dynamic linear modeling approach include robustness to missing data and the ability to fit models with relatively few years of training data. To predict future outbreaks, we started with the early detection model for each district and added a regression component based on satellite-derived environmental predictor variables including precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and land surface temperature (LST) and spectral indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We included lagged environmental predictors in the regression component of the model, with lags chosen based on cross-correlation of the one-step-ahead forecast errors from the first model. Our results suggest that predictions of future malaria outbreaks can be improved by incorporating lagged environmental predictors.",

Little is known about how these rates vary in regional groundwater settings, as few studies have focused on regional datasets with multiple tracers and methods of analysis that account for effects of mixed residence times on apparent reaction rates. This study provides insight into residence times and rates of O2 reduction and denitrification using a novel approach of multi-model residence time distributions (RTDs) applied to a data set of atmospheric tracers of groundwater age and geochemical data from 141 well samples in the Central Eastern San Joaquin Valley, CA. The residence time distribution approach accounts for mixtures of residence times in a single sample to provide estimates of in-situ rates. Tracers included SF6, CFCs, 3H, He from 3H, 14C, and terrigenic He. Parameter estimation and multi-model averaging were used to establish RTDs with lower error variance than produced by individual RTD models. The set of multi-model RTDs was used in combination with NO3− and dissolved gas data to estimate zero order and first order rates of O2 reduction and denitrification. Results indicated that these rates followed approximately log-normal distributions. Rates of O2 reduction and denitrification were correlated and, on an electron milliequivalent basis, denitrification rates tended to exceed O2 reduction rates. Results indicate that the multi-model approach can improve estimation of age distributions, and that, because of the correlations, relatively easily measured O2 rates can provide information about trends in denitrification rates, which are more difficult to measure.",

It is well recognized that in agriculturally intensive areas, fertilizers and pesticides may leach through the vadose zone and eventually reach groundwater, impacting future uses of this limited resource. While numerical models are commonly used to simulate fate and transport of agricultural contaminants, few models have been validated based on realistic three dimensional soil lithology, hydrological conditions, and historical changes in groundwater quality. In this work, contamination of groundwater in the Nebraska Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) site was simulated based on extensive field data including (1) lithology from 69 wells and 11 test holes; (2) surface soil type, land use, and surface elevations; (3) 5-year groundwater level and flow velocity; (4) daily meteorological monitoring; (5) 5-year seasonal irrigation records; (6) 5-years of spatially intensive contaminant concentration in 40 multilevel monitoring wells; and (7) detailed cultivation records. Using this data, a three-dimensional vadose zone lithological framework was developed using a commercial software tool (RockworksTM). Based on the interpolated lithology, a hydrological model was developed using HYDRUS-3D to simulate water flow and contaminant transport. The model was validated through comparison of simulated atrazine and nitrate concentration with historical data from 40 wells and multilevel samplers. The validated model will be used to predict potential changes in ground water quality due to agricultural contamination under future climate scenarios in the High Plain Aquifer system.",

            "abstract": "Strata preserving Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2), which span the Cenomanian-Turonian (C/T; Late Cretaceous), exhibit evidence of widespread anoxia, a major perturbation to the global carbon cycle, and increased biotic turnover rates. It has been hypothesized that a major volcanic (LIP) eruption, increased CO2 levels, and significant climate warming triggered the event. Recently, OAE2 has also been cited as a potential example of ocean acidification in Earth history and therefore has potential to offer predictive insights on impacts of increasing modern pCO2 levels. As part of an effort to test this hypothesis, the 131-m Smoky Hollow #1 (SH-1) core was drilled near Big Water, Utah during the summer of 2014. The core recovered an expanded stratigraphic record of OAE2 from the mud-rich western margin of the Western Interior Seaway. A high-resolution stable carbon isotope record from bulk organic carbon (δ13Corg) indicates near-continuous preservation of OAE2 with a sustained +2.5‰ excursion that is over 5 times the thickness of the same excursion at the C/T GSSP in Pueblo, Colorado. Notably, this record is characterized by a 1-m thick carbonate-barren interval at the δ13C excursion’s onset. This may indicate an episode of ocean acidification driving suppressed carbonate sedimentation or carbonate dissolution. An alternative interpretation is that variations in carbonate concentrations are unrelated to changes in ocean chemistry and are instead driven by changes in local sedimentation patterns (e.g. transgressive-regressive parasequences).\nTo test these hypotheses, a regional lithostratigraphic correlation to the nearshore Cottonwood Canyon section is constructed to assess whether prograding sandy parasequences may have altered carbonate sedimentation rates at the SH-1 locality. Initial osmium and δ13C chemostratigraphies are also developed to constrain the timing of perturbations in global geochemical cycles at the initiation of OAE2, including the onset of large igneous province volcanism and enhanced global organic matter burial, respectively. By combining a refined knowledge of local depositional environments with isotope geochemistry it is better possible to evaluate the impact of ocean acidification on the stratigraphic record through this critical Earth-life transition.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic ice cover is riddled with cracks, ridges, and melt ponds leading to spatial heterogeneities that manifest as sharp transitions in thickness, porosity, salinity, etc., that in turn affect the bulk mechanical behavior of the ice pack. In regions within and near the marginal ice zone, where ice survives the summer melt and break-up as discrete floes with length scales on the order of hundreds of meters to a kilometer, the freeze up subsequent to the melt season forms a patchwork of thick perennial ice bound together by thinner and smoother first-year ice with a coherence of varying length scales. Remote sensing has shown that the fracture patterns in these patchy ice regions, which may be more representative of marginal ice zone and coastal areas, tend to form in preferential pathways in the thinner ice, therefore modifying the rhomboidal pattern that is characteristic of more homogeneous ice. Using a sea ice model based on the discrete element method (DEM) and remotely sensed images, we examine the effect that heterogeneities in the ice cover have on the derivation of constitutive behavior at scales relevant to climate models by representing the observed heterogeneities explicitly. This model allows us to not only measure the mechanical response of a sample domain, but to also look at the break-up behavior for regions of varying melt pond coverage, thickness, etc. Our hope is that our results can be used to extend existing sea ice rheologies that already incorporate the spatial discontinuities of the ice cover due to lead formation [Moritz & Ukita, 2000; Schreyer et al., 2006; Wilchinsky & Feltham, 2004; Sedlacek et al., 2007].",

However, the large amount of data collected during spectral field campaigns poses major challenges regarding data management, archiving and processing.

We provide an example for using Specchio based on leaf level spectra of prairie plant species collected during the 2015 field campaign of the Dimensions of Biodiversity research project, conducted at the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research site, in central Minnesota.

However, the majority of research has focused on a small number of methods, such as artificial neural networks, while not considering other approaches for non-parametric regression that have been developed in recent years. These methods may be able to achieve comparable predictive accuracy to ANN’s and more easily provide physical insights into the system of interest through evaluation of covariate influence. Additionally, these methods could provide a straightforward, computationally efficient way of evaluating climate change impacts in basins where data to support physical hydrologic models is limited. In this paper, we use multiple regression and machine-learning approaches to predict monthly streamflow in five highly-seasonal rivers in the highlands of Ethiopia. We find that generalized additive models, random forests, and cubist models achieve better predictive accuracy than ANNs in many basins assessed and are also able to outperform physical models developed for the same region. We discuss some challenges that could hinder the use of such models for climate impact assessment, such as biases resulting from model formulation and prediction under extreme climate conditions, and suggest methods for preventing and addressing these challenges. Finally, we demonstrate how predictor variable influence can be assessed to provide insights into the physical functioning of data-sparse watersheds.",

The focus of this study is on the temporal evolution of mass flows into and out of the solar corona.

Not only does this challenge our ability to educate sufficient numbers of students in the geosciences, it also challenges our ability to address issues of environmental justice, to bring geoscience expertise to diverse communities, and to pursue a research agenda reflecting the needs and interests of our nation as a whole. Programs that are successful in supporting students from underrepresented groups attend to the whole student (Jolly et al, 2004) as they develop not only knowledge and skills, but a sense of belonging and a drive to succeed in geoscience. The whole student approach provides a framework for supporting the success of all students, be they members of underrepresented groups or not. Important aspects of support include mentoring and advising, academic support, an inclusive learning community, and opportunities to learn about the profession and to develop geoscience and professional skills. To successfully provide support for the full range of students, it is critical to consider not only what opportunities are available but the barriers different types of students face in accessing these opportunities. Barriers may arise from gaps in academic experiences, crossing into a new and unfamiliar culture, lack of confidence, stereotype threat, implicit bias and other sources. Isolation of geoscience learning from its application and social context may preferentially discourage some groups. Action can be taken to increase support for all students within an individual course, a department or an institution. The InTeGrate STEP Center for the Geosciences, the Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education at Two-Year Colleges program and the On the Cutting Edge Professional Development for Geoscience Faculty program all provide resources for individuals and departments including on line information, program descriptions, and workshop opportunities.",

            "abstract": "At present, the oil and gas industry distributes gasoline with an ethanol content of up to 10% (E10) to the consumer. However, ethanol advocates are promoting gasoline blends with higher ethanol content to be introduced into the market (e.g., E20, corresponding to an ethanol content of 20%). The likelihood of unintended fuel releases with elevated ethanol concentrations through surficial spills or from underground storage systems will therefore increase. A particular concern is the increased rate of CH4 and CO2 production as the spill biodegrades, which is believed to be associated with the increased ethanol content in the fuel. Consequently, high gas generation rates associated with ethanol-blended fuels may amplify the risk of vapor intrusion of CH4 and BTEX into basements or other subsurface structures that may be nearby. A comprehensive and comparative study on the fate of higher concentration ethanol-blended fuels in the subsurface has not been conducted to date. The present study focuses on determining the fate of ethanol blended fuels in the subsurface through a series of controlled and instrumented laboratory column experiments. The experiments compare the behavior of pure gasoline with that of ethanol-blended fuels for different soil types (sand and silt) in columns 2 meters tall and 30cm in diameter. The column experiments focus on the quantification of gas generation by volatilization and biodegradation and 1-D vertical fate and transport of CO2, CH4, benzene and toluene through the vadose zone. The fuel blends have been injected into the lower third of the columns and gas composition and fluxes within the column are being monitored over time. The goal of this study is to contribute to the scientific foundation that will allow gauging the level of risk and the need for remediation at fuel spill sites with higher ethanol blends.",

            "abstract": "A common simplifying assumption in inversions of geodetic data for the earthquake source is that the geodetic observations were made on a flat surface at zero elevation. In many cases, this approximation is reasonable, however in the case of large thrust faults, where the hangingwall of the fault is often accompanied by significant relief, including steep slopes and high elevations, it is much less secure.\nWe can anticipate two potential biases in source models that do not account for topography. First, geodetic observations made at high elevations are correspondingly further away from the faults that generated them, compared with a flat surface at sea level, and will thus require greater amounts of fault slip to provide the same surface displacements; models that do not account for topography may, therefore, underestimate seismic moment. Second, in situations where the topographic profile contains slopes on a length scale similar to that of the fault, the different elevations of the actual observation points may cause a bias in dip in a model that does not take topography into account.\nWe test these hypotheses against data from the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake. Using interferometric surface displacements imaged by the ALOS-2 satellite, we first invert for the geometry of the source fault, and its corresponding slip distribution, assuming a flat elastic half space. Our best fitting model has a dip of 15 degrees, steeper than seismic estimates (7-10 degrees), tentatively supporting our hypothesis of a possible bias. We will present the preliminary results of our modeling of the same data using finite element models that include a realistic representation of the topography, using both our preferred dip from our half space model, and the shallower preferred dip from seismology.",

They can retain significant porosity at geological time-scales, providing preferential pathways for crustal fluids and often host mineral deposits.\nThe mines of Panasqueira, central Portugal, represent the largest W-Sn deposit currently mined in western Europe and constitutes a fossil record of natural hydrofracturing at presumably high levels of pore pressure in the upper crust. The ore deposit comprises an extensive sub-horizontal vein network hosted by a regional metasedimentary sequence of Palaeozoic age, which was folded, foliated and metamorphosed to greenschist facies during the Hercynian Orogeny. The vein system is connected to a greisenized cupola of the underlying granitic intrusion, evidenced by the pronounced contact metamorphism.\nThe extensive network of underground excavations allows for exceptional exposure of the geological structures, and gives the possibility to use the mines of Panasqueira as a natural laboratory in order to understand the mechanisms driving its formation and propagation.\nPaleostress analyses using vein data, complemented with fluid inclusion and geothermometry/geobarometry studies were conducted. Preliminary results of vein attitudes indicate a cluster distribution of the poles with σ3 vertical. The other stress axes were oriented NW-SE (σ1) and NE-SW (σ2), respectively. Microthermometry of fluid inclusions in quartz related to the main opening stages of the veins evidence low salinity fluids belonging to the system H2O-NaCl-CO2-(CH4)-(N2). The respective homogenization temperatures fall in the range of 250-320˚C. Coeval arsenopyrite contains 33,5–34,0 atomic % As, corresponding to mineralisation temperatures of ~450 ˚C. Fluid isochores together with the formation temperatures derived from arsenopyrite compositions suggest fluid paleopressures of ~300 MPa contemporaneous to vein opening. Similar pressure values are corroborated by Mole % FeS compositions obtained on coeval sphalerite.\nFurther work will include the calculation of the “full” paleostress state associated to the formation of the quartz veins.",

This bias is not found in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Model with Community Model version 3 (GFDL-CM3) model, while Community Earth System Model with Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CESM-CAM5) and Max Planck Institute Earth System Model low resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) continually show strong diabatic heating over topography. However, enhancing model grid-resolution in the NCAR CAM4 to 1/4 has the potential to mitigate the heating bias.

We focus our study on California’s 11 major geothermal fields: Amedee, Brawley, Casa Diablo, Coso, East Mesa, The Geysers, Heber, Litchfield, Salton Sea, Susanville, and Wendel. The Geysers geothermal field is the world’s largest geothermal energy producer. California’s Department of Oil Gas and Geothermal Resources provides field-wide monthly injection and production volumes for each of these sites, which allows us to study the relationship between geothermal pumping activities and seismicity. Since many of the geothermal fields began injecting and producing before nearby seismic stations were installed, we use smoothed seismicity since 1932 from the ANSS catalog as a proxy for tectonic earthquake rate. We examine both geothermal pumping and long-term earthquake rate as factors that may control earthquake rate.\nRather than focusing only on the largest earthquake, which is essentially a random occurrence in time, we examine how M≥4 earthquake rate density (probability per unit area, time, and magnitude) varies for each field. We estimate relative contributions to the observed earthquake rate of M≥4 from both a long-term earthquake rate (Kagan and Jackson, 2010) and pumping activity. For each geothermal field, respective earthquake catalogs (NCEDC and SCSN) are complete above at least M3 during the test period (which we tailor to each site). We test the hypothesis that the observed earthquake rate at a geothermal site during the test period is a linear combination of the long-term seismicity and pumping rates. We use a grid search to determine the confidence interval of the weighting parameters.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice in its final stage of demise, “rotten ice”, is characterized by seriously compromised structural integrity, making it difficult to collect and study. Consequently, little is known about the physical, chemical and biological properties of this ice type. Yet, as the Arctic melt season lengthens, this ice type will likely appear sooner and become more prevalent in the Arctic Ocean and its occurrence may be more common than satellite mapping and ice charts suggest (e.g., Barber et al., 2009).\nHere we present physical, chemical, biological, and optical measurements of first-year ice near Barrow, Alaska during the spring and summer of 2015. Samples represent a progression from solid, “springtime” shorefast ice (May); through melting, heavily melt-ponded, “summertime” shorefast ice (June); to the final stage of barely-intact, “rotten” ice collected from small floes Beaufort Sea (July). Results indicate that rotten ice exhibits low salinity, is well drained and has a lower density than its springtime counterpart. X-ray tomography of dimethyl phthalate-casted sea ice samples indicates differences in porosity and relative permeability in rotten ice vs. spring- and summertime ice. We also present a preliminary characterization of rotten sea ice as a microbial habitat using preliminary results of chemical measurements (nutrients, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon), and microbiological characterizations (concentrations and16S/18S rDNA-based identifications) from seawater vs. sea ice vs. sea ice brines. Optical measurements show that while decreased ice thickness and increased melt pond coverage cause an overall increase in solar radiation to the ocean as sea ice warms, rotten ice is actually less transparent to solar radiation than its spring- and summertime counterparts. These factors determine solar heating in the ocean and, ultimately, the potential for accelerated ice melting (e.g., Light et al., 2008).\nThis work provides a foundation for understanding and investigating this largely unexplored ice type that may become increasingly important in the future Arctic.\n",

            "abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and the production and emission of methane from sediments in inland waters and shallow oceans both contributes to and may be exacerbated by climate change. In some of these shallow-water settings, methane fluxes are often controlled by episodic free-gas venting. The fraction of the methane released from the sediments that bypasses dissolution in the water column and reaches the atmosphere impacts the magnitude of the climate forcing, and this fraction depends critically on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of the bubble releases. Here, we present measurements of the episodicity, spacing and persistence of ebullition from the laboratory scale (1-50 cm) to the field scale (0.5-20 m). Field observations were made using a fixed-location Imagenex DeltaT 837B multibeam sonar, which was calibrated to quantify gas fluxes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution (~0.5 m, 1 Hz). The field scale results show a pattern of short range spatiotemporal clustering (radius<2 m) in ebullition events that dissipates over time to a spatially homogenous process at the resolution of the sonar. The lack of persistent hotspots suggests a limited role for lateral methane transport within the sediments, and the spatiotemporal clustering implies a mechanism for triggering nearby aftershock ebullition episodes. The fine-scale (1-50 cm) experiment recorded ebullition from sediments that were dredged from the field site, reconstituted and incubated in the laboratory to generate methane. This experiment shows the degree of re-use of specific outlets, with implications for the scale of lateral methane transport and the role of hysteresis on sediment cohesion (healing of closed conduits). The details of the short range clustering process helps to identify the mechanism by which gas venting triggers nearby “aftershock” episodes of gas release. Taken together, these results point towards a better understanding of the microscale processes controlling methane venting from deformable sediments, as well as their impact on large-scale methane fluxes from shallow-water bodies.\nFigure: Short-range spatial clustering, quantified with the Radial Distribution Function (RDF>1, r<2), dissipates to a homogeneous signature (RDF = 1) over long observation periods.",

This untreated wastewater is discharged to surface waters where it is diluted and reused by farmers and municipalities downstream. Without proper safeguards, the use of these waters can present health risks. However, these same waters also provide a reliable and nutrient rich water source for farmers, often in regions where water is already physically or economically scarce. Case studies show the prevalence and diversity of motivations for indirect reuse, but are difficult to interpret in aggregate at the global scale.\nThis study quantifies the global extent and characteristics of the reuse of wastewater in irrigated agriculture through three main components:\nQuantifying the global extent of urban and peri-urban irrigated and rainfed croplands;\nEvaluating the contribution of urban wastewater production to available blue water at the catchment scale;\nDeveloping an irrigation water quality indicator and classifying irrigated croplands downstream of cities on the basis of this indicator.\nEach of these components integrates several global scale spatial datasets including MIRCA2000 (irrigated croplands); GDBD (stream channels and catchments); and compilations of water use, sewerage and wastewater treatment data. All analyses were conducted using spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS and Python.\nThis analysis found that 60 percent of all irrigated croplands (130 Mha) were within 20 km of cities. Urban irrigated croplands were found to be farmed with greater cropping intensity (1.48) as compared to non-urban irrigated croplands. Ten percent of the global catchment area is in catchments where domestic wastewater constitutes greater than five percent of available blue water. In contrast, 25 percent of irrigated croplands are located in catchments where domestic wastewater exceeds five percent of available blue water. Particularly in the water scarce regions of North Africa and East Asia, a strong correlation between the volume of urban wastewater production and the area of peri-urban irrigated croplands was found. A better understanding of global reliance on the indirect reuse of untreated wastewater in irrigated agriculture can provide valuable insights for large-scale water allocation planning and risk mitigation efforts.",

We also present 52 new ages on 18 lava flows from the Punaruu valley, Tahiti, which record the Matuyama-Bruhnes reversal. The new ages confirm that the lavas record this reversal, but the ages differ from the original stratigraphy presented in Mochizuki et al. (2011). Our new ages using the Kuiper et al. (2008) fish canyon sanidine ages for Punaruu valley lava flows are concordant with previous astronomically tuned ages (Channell et al. 2002, 2009) and represent the highest precision radiometric ages for the most recent reversal. Here we show that paleointensity lows associated with excursional events can be comparable to or less than those associated with reversals. In addition, such field strength reductions can occur in time intervals as short as 3 thousand years.",

This talk will outline synthesis findings from multi-country, interdisciplinary research on cocaine trafficking as an engine of forest loss in Central America. During the “narco-boom” of the mid-2000s, we observed a geographical evolution of cocaine flows into Central America, and the transit of cocaine through new spaces, accompanied by specific patterns of social and environmental change in new nodes of transit. We coarsely estimated that the total amount of cocaine flowing through Central America increased from 70 metric tons in 2000 to 350 mt in 2012, implying that total cocaine trafficking revenue in the region increased from roughly 600 million dollars to 3.5 billion in that time. We describe the mechanism by which these locally captured cocaine rents resulted in a rapid conversion of forest into cattle pasture. Narco-traffickers are drawn to invest in the cattle economy, as a direct means of laundering and formalizing proceeds. Ranching is a land intensive activity, and new narco-enriched cattle pastures can be isolated from other forms forest loss solely by their spatial and temporal change characteristics. A preliminary forest change study in Honduras, for example, indicated that areas of accelerated deforestation were in close proximity to known narcotics trafficking routes and were thirteen times more extensive on average than other forest clearings. Deforested areas commonly appeared in isolated and biodiverse lowland tropical rainforest regions that often intersected with protected areas and indigenous reserves. We find that narco-deforestation is a readily identifiable signal of the extent and health of the cocaine economy. This talk will feature summaries of both ethnographic and land cover change we have observed in cocaine transfer nodes in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.",

            "abstract": "Analyses of ground-based airglow data suggest that gravity waves at relatively small scales and short intrinsic periods may carry significant momentum through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) [e.g., Fritts et al., JGR, 119(24), 2014; Fritts et al, BAMS, 10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00269, 2015.]. The quantification of wave momentum fluxes, and thus wave amplitudes, by airglow measurements is complicated by assumptions regarding chemical processes and initial states [e.g., Liu and Swenson, JGR, 108(D4), 2003] and by assumptions of wave propagation characteristics [e.g., Fritts, JGR, 105(D17), 2000]. Recent studies leveraging short-wave infrared hydroxyl (OH) imagers, such as the Utah State University (USU) Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM), suggest that airglow temperature measurements provide a promising capability to improve estimates of momentum fluxes [e.g., Fritts et al., 2014]. Nevertheless, integrated OH intensity and temperature signatures depend on multiple layered species [e.g., Snively et al., JGR 2010] that may be significantly and nonlinearly perturbed by strong or breaking gravity waves.\nTo elucidate gravity wave propagation, effects, and the observable airglow responses, we use a nonlinear, compressible atmospheric dynamics model in both two and three dimensions, coupled with a photochemical model [e.g., Adler-Golden, JGR, 102(A9), 1997; Snively, GRL, 40(17), 2013, and references therein]. In particular, we consider specific case studies where species layers become dramatically distorted by the evolving gravity waves. First, we assess the range of validity of momentum flux estimates, derived from integrated airglow intensity and temperature measurements, for waves at short periods and large amplitudes. Second, we estimate the impacts of the modeled large-amplitude waves at altitudes above in the lower thermosphere. Guidance towards the quantitative interpretations of airglow data is provided. Results also strongly suggest that waves with large amplitudes in the OH layer may have significant impacts in the lower thermosphere when their vertical propagation is unimpeded.",

Two of the most important factors are three-phase relative permeability and hysteresis effects, both of which are difficult to measure and are usually represented by numerical interpolation models. The purposes of this study included quantification of impacts of different three-phase relative permeability models and hysteresis models on CO2 sequestration simulation results, and associated quantitative estimation of uncertainty. Four three-phase relative permeability models and three hysteresis models were applied to a model of an active CO2-EOR site, the SACROC unit located in western Texas. To eliminate possible bias of deterministic parameters on the evaluation, a sequential Gaussian simulation technique was utilized to generate 50 realizations to describe heterogeneity of porosity and permeability, initially obtained from well logs and seismic survey data. Simulation results of forecasted pressure distributions and CO2 storage suggest that (1) the choice of three-phase relative permeability model and hysteresis model have noticeable impacts on CO2 sequestration simulation results; (2) influences of both factors are observed in all 50 realizations; and (3) the specific choice of hysteresis model appears to be somewhat more important relative to the choice of three-phase relative permeability model in terms of model uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Dramatic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the industrial revolution are in large part due to the release of carbon previously stored in the soil. No-till strategies have been proposed as a means to mitigate agricultural contributions to atmospheric carbon by decreasing emissions and sequestering carbon in agricultural soils while increasing water use efficiency and soil quality. However, the effects of no-till versus conventional-till practices on carbon sequestration often vary due to difficulty in quantifying soil carbon as soil properties change with management. Eddy covariance (EC) offers a more accurate method of continuously measuring the total carbon budget and does so without relying on physical soil carbon measurements. The majority of agricultural land in the Midwestern United States is farmed using the corn/soybean rotation, making it an ideal agro-ecosystem to examine the potential of adopting no-till practices on carbon and water balances. In this study, we use EC to compare carbon and water fluxes between continuous no-till and conventional-till corn/soybean sites over several years in east central Illinois. This allows the determination and comparison of 1) net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome production (NEE after accounting for grain usage); 2) water use efficiency; and 3) response to climatic variation, both at short and long time scales, between the two tillage systems. We hypothesize that both carbon uptake and water use efficiency will improve with no-till practices, which in turn will improve crop responses to environmental factors such as drought and heat stress.",

            "abstract": "Dust radiative forcing on high elevation snowpack is well-documented in the southern Rockies. Various field studies show that dust deposits decrease snow albedo and increase absorption of solar radiation, leading to earlier snowmelt and peak stream flows. These findings have implications for the use of temperature-index snow runoff models (such as the Snowmelt Runoff Model [SRM]) for predicting streamflow. In previous work, we have used SRM to simulate historical streamflow from 26 Upper Rio Grande sub-basins. Because dust radiative forcing can alter the relation between temperature and snowmelt, we wanted to find out if there is evidence of dust radiative forcing and earlier snowmelt in our study basins, particularly for those years where SRM was less successful in simulating streamflow. To accomplish this we have used openly-available data such as EPA air quality station measurements of particulate matter up to 10 micrometers (PM10); streamflow data from the USGS National Water Information System and Colorado Division of Water Resources; temperature, precipitation and snow water equivalent (SWE) from NRCS SNOTEL stations and remotely sensed data products from the MODIS sensor. Initial analyses indicate that a connection between seasonal dust concentration and streamflow timing (date of onset of warm-season snowmelt, date of streamflow center-of-volume) can be detected. This is further supported by time series analysis of MODIS-derived estimates of snow albedo and dust radiative-forcing in alpine and open subalpine snow fields.",

Bogotá's metropolitan area has over 13 million inhabitants all above 2,600 meters, where the anthropogenic emissions are concentrated. Because of the high elevation, density of development, and low temperatures, the local biogenic emissions are relatively small contributors to the total VOC. The surrounding area has a much lower altitude and over 5 times higher average biogenic emission fluxes. This work characterizes the interaction between local anthropogenic emissions and surrounding biogenic emissions.\nThe simulated photochemical environment shows clear urban/rural interfaces. Ozone concentrations are higher in the surrounding region and show titration around the boundary of Bogotá. We use chemical indicators to define the identify the extent of interaction and apportion ozone and photochemically produced secondary aerosols. We also examine the roles of proposed regulation on interaction between biogenic and anthropogenic emissions.\nIn Bogotá local and regional emissions exert clearly distinct influences, but also interesting confluences. The combination of regional biogenic emissions and local anthropogenic emissions creates an ideal case study for biogenic/anthropogenic interaction. Our results show strong NOx inhibition now that must be considered in the future. We also show that secondary aerosols from biogenic sources are also inhibited in our modeling system.",

Recently (IGARSS, July 27-31, 2015, Milan, Italy), we reported the results of laboratory polarization measurements of single detached leaves during dry down. We found that RWC was linearly related to the ratio of the reflectance of the interior of the leaf and the leaf transmittance. Here we report application of the laboratory results to estimate RWC for sunlit leaves in a plant canopy.\nUsing a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Nikon 810 camera with Nikkor 300 mm lens and Polaroid type HN-22 linear polarizer, we photographed in the principle plane a plant canopy displaying a gradient of water stress and collected, at each of multiple points along the gradient, two images, one with the polarization filter oriented for maximum scene response and a second with the filter oriented for minimum scene response. We converted the digital values in the two images to reflectance factor with reference to images of a white, flat, horizontal Spectralon surface. We classified the polarization imagery, identifying reflecting leaves, transmitting leaves, other sunlit vegetation and shadows. For each image pair we normalized the leaf internal reflectance by dividing by the cosine of the angle of incidence of the sunlight on the leaf, selected the leaf maximum transmittance in the scene and divided to obtain the ratio reflectance/transmittance, which we compared with leaf RWC. We determined the leaf relative water content by harvesting a section of leaf and immediately placing it in a sealed container in an ice chest. Later in the laboratory the leaf sample was weighed, rehydrated, weighed, dried and again weighed. RWC was determined using the standard formula.\nOur experimental results support our hypothesis, suggesting that the RWC of sunlit leaves in a plant canopy may be estimated from analysis of polarization imagery collected by a COTS camera system. Unlike remotely sensed estimates of canopy equivalent water thickness, our estimates of the RWC of sunlit canopy leaves provide leaf physiological information. We propose RWC estimates based upon sunlit leaves are more relevant to assessing the water status of a plant canopy than would be RWC estimates based upon large FOV canopy measurements.",

            "abstract": "The use of isotope hydrology has become a successful tool for water resource investigations. The complex task of defining interactions between groundwater, surface water, and atmospheric water vapor continue to remain a challenge. Evapotranspiration is still a dominant source of uncertainty for water resources management, especially in the face of climate change. The development of cavity ring-down spectroscopy has provided a valuable tool that makes it possible to quantify evaporation and transpiration using isotopic mass balance techniques. However, these techniques require collection of vapor at both the evaporation and transpiration fronts as well as directly above the canopy. Obtaining these representative samples is difficult. We are unaware of other attempts to use these techniques in seasonal swamps, such as the Florida Everglades, where collection of representative end members is complicated by seasonally inundated conditions. The purpose of the research presented here is to test different methods of collecting the necessary representative samples in variably inundated environments. Our tests are being conducting in a controlled setting to allow us to validate our isotope-derived estimates of evaporation and transpiration against conventional water balances. This paper will present the preliminary results of our first series of tests.",

            "abstract": "The UNESCO-IHP ISARM-Americas technical committee has developed a regional strategy for the assessment and management of transboundary aquifer systems in the Americas as part of their ongoing cooperative assistance to help neighboring countries sustain water resources and reduce potential conflict. The fourth book in the series of publications sponsored by UNESCO and OAS documents this strategy. The goal of this strategy is the collective understanding, developing, managing, and protecting of the transboundary aquifers in the Americas This strategy includes technical, social, and governance recommendations for an integrated resource management of groundwater based on flexible arrangements that not only manage but also demand social participation in solving problems, consider changes in land use and water use and promote the increase of water sustainability for all transboundary neighbors. The successful implementation of this strategy starts with sharing information of the status and use of land and water as well as intergovernmental partnerships to link science and policy with existing instruments for managing the water resources. International organizations such as UNESCO and OAS also can help facilitate the development of transboundary agreements and establish cooperation on transboundary aquifers between neighbors. The UNESCO-IHP ISARM-Americas technical committee has been successful in creating a network of partners from 24 countries and in translating existing aquifer knowledge into a meaningful strategy for the American hemisphere. The strategy aims to explain and develop the role of science and the informed-decision approach. Examples from North and South America show how the process has begun to develop for selected transboundary aquifers. These include the Milk River basin between the US and Canada, the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins between the US and Mexico, and the Guarani River basin in South America.",

Distinctive dispersive seismic coda waves (~7-35 Hz), trapped within the low-velocity fault damage zone, have been recorded on three component 2 Hz borehole seismometers installed within 20 m of the principal slip zone in the shallow (< 150 m deep) DFDP-1 boreholes. Near the central Alpine Fault, known for low background seismicity, FZGW-generating microseismic events are located beyond the catchment-scale strike-slip and thrust segment partitioning of the fault indicating lateral connectivity of the low-velocity zone immediately below the near-surface segmentation. Double-difference earthquake relocation of events using the dense SAMBA and WIZARD seismometer arrays allows spatio-temporal patterns of 2013 events to be analysed and the segmentation and low velocity zone depth extent further explored. Three layer, dispersion modeling of the low-velocity zone indicates a waveguide width of 60-200 m with a 10-40% reduction in S-wave velocity, similar to that inferred for the fault core of other mature plate boundary faults such as the San Andreas and North Anatolian Faults.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Evans_AGU_2015_Poster_Final.compressed.pdf\nIn mountainous regions, warmer air temperatures have led to an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and lower snowmelt rates; i.e. because snowmelt has shifted earlier when energy availability is lower. These changes to snowmelt will likely affect the partitioning of snowmelt water between surface runoff and groundwater flow, and therefore, the lag time between snowmelt and streamflow. While the connection between snowmelt and surface runoff has been well-studied, the impact of snowmelt variability on groundwater flow processes has received limited attention, especially in mountainous catchments.\nWe construct a two-dimensional, finite element, coupled flow and heat transport hydrogeologic model to evaluate how changes in snowmelt onset and rate may alter groundwater discharge to streams in mountainous catchments. The coupled hydrogeologic model simulates seasonally frozen ground by incorporating permeability variation as a function of temperature and allows for modeling of pore water freeze and thaw. We apply the model to the Green Lakes Valley (GLV) watershed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, a representative snowmelt-dominated catchment. Snowmelt for the GLV catchment is reconstructed from a 12 year (1996-2007) dataset of hydrometeorological records and satellite-derived snow covered area.\nModeling results suggest that on a yearly cycle, groundwater infiltration and discharge is limited by the seasonally frozen subsurface. Under average conditions from 1996 to 2007, maximum groundwater discharge to the surface lags maximum snowmelt by approximately two months. Ongoing modeling is exploring how increasing air temperatures affect lag times between snowmelt and groundwater discharge to streams. This study has implications for water resource availability and its temporal variability in a warming global climate.",

            "abstract": "The 2011–2014 staged removals of two nearly century-old dams on the Elwha River in northwest Washington State, the largest dam-removal project in the United States, exposed 21 million m3 of reservoir-trapped sand and gravel to potential fluvial transport. The river downstream from the dams is gravel bedded with a pool-riffle morphology. The river flows 20 km to the marine environment through a riparian corridor lined with large wood and having relatively few anthropogenic alterations. This moderately natural pre-dam-removal condition afforded an unprecedented opportunity to study river response to an anticipated massive sediment release. Four years into the project, 12 million m3 of sediment eroded from the former reservoirs with about 90% of the total load transported to the marine environment. Annualized sediment discharge was as great as 20 times the background natural load. Initial river response to the arrival of the first large sediment pulse was the nearly complete filling of the river’s previously sediment-starved pools, widespread filling of side channels, and increased braiding index. In year 2, during maximum aggradation, the river graded to a plane-bedded system, efficiently conveying sediment to the marine environment. Modest peak flows (<2-yr return period) in year 2 promoted sediment transport but caused little large-scale geomorphic disturbance by channel migration or avulsions. As the river processed the sediment pulse, pools returned and the braiding index decreased in years 3–4. Higher peak flows in year 4 caused localized channel widening and migration but no major avulsions. Gauging indicated sand dominated the first stages of sediment release, but fluvial loads coarsened through time with progressive arrival of larger material. The literature suggests the Elwha River sediment wave should have evolved through dispersion with little translation. However, morphologic measurements and data from a stage-gauge network indicated patterns of deposition, sediment transport, and sediment-wave evolution were heterogeneously complex, challenging our efforts to classify the sediment wave in terms of simple dispersion or translation.",

            "abstract": "The southwestern U.S. is highly vulnerable to climate variability leading to extremes, such as droughts and pluvials, because of its geographic location and climatologic characteristics. These can include multi-year and multi-decadal extremes in precipitation, as occurred in the 1950s drought. Multi-year droughts and pluvials can have severe consequences on water resources management, which makes them events of interest to a major water utility in the region, Denver Water. Denver Water managers are especially interested in 36-month droughts for planning water management, both for maintaining supply and adequate operating revenue. Our analysis is part of an effort to understand the basis for past droughts and pluvials and how they might change in the future.\nSeveral indices, based on their sensitivity to drought development at different time scales, data availability and drought types, have been developed for detecting and monitoring drought and pluvial severity. Among them are the Palmer drought severity index, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). This study uses 36-month SPEI and SPI to analyze drought and pluvial episodes over the southwestern U.S., with a focus on the region that supplies water for Denver Water. Aims of this study include: 1) characteristics of multi-year droughts and pluvials (e.g., onset, duration, cessation, intensity, and frequency), 2) the contrasts between drought and pluvial characteristics, and 3) atmospheric large-scale features associated with the initiation and maintenance of extended drought and pluvial periods. We find that droughts and pluvials are not simply mirror images of each other in their characteristics, so that one is not simply the opposite phase of the other. This result is particularly true of the large-scale circulation patterns associated with droughts and pluvials. We diagnose how the circulation behavior sustains the very wet and very dry episodes revealed by the SPEI and SPI indices.",

            "abstract": "The ion temperature of the magnetosphere of Jupiter derived from Galileo PLS data was observed to increase by about an order of magnitude from 10 to 40 Jupiter radii. This suggests presence of heating sources that counteract adiabatic cooling effect of expanding plasma. There have been different models trying to explain such observation using different heating mechanisms, including a heating model based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence [Saur, Astrophys. J. Lett., 602, L137, 2004]. We revisit that model, which is based on flux tube diffusion, and find that it is not adequate in explaining the heating. To account for possible heating by turbulence, we apply another turbulence heating model based on convection, which is commonly used in modeling solar wind heating. Based on analysis of Galileo magnetometer data, we find that observed MHD turbulence could potentially provide the required heating based on this model.\nThis work is supported by a NASA grant (NNX14AM27G).",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_PUI-CutOff_Poster_Fin.pdf\nThe precise determination of the interstellar neutral (ISN) flow direction is important in several different ways. As a cardinal axis of the heliosphere it has strong leverage on the plane subtended by the ISN velocity and interstellar magnetic field vector, which controls the shape of the heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium. The observation of the ISN flow through the heliosphere for several decades has initiated a discussion about potential temporal variations in the ISN flow. To tackle these questions, a precision measurement of the ISN flow velocity vector is needed over a long time period. Recent efforts to obtain a consistent ISN vector and temperature with Ulysses and IBEX point to remaining uncertainties and potential systematic effects. In particular, IBEX measurements provide a very precise relation between ISN flow longitude and speed via the hyperbolic trajectory equation, but they contain larger uncertainties separately for longitude and speed. Pickup ion (PUI) observations of the ISN flow pattern at 1 AU can provide a complementary determination of the flow longitude with high precision. The interstellar PUI cut-off speed is a function of the ratio of the radial ISN flow component and the solar wind speed at the observer location [Möbius et al., 1999, GRL, 26, 3181]. We have compared STEREO A PLASTIC observations with a simple analytic model of the cut-off and performed a Pearson correlation analysis of the cut-off as a function of ecliptic longitude with its mirrored function. The two complementary approaches demonstrate that the ISN flow longitude can be obtained with a precision on the order of 0.1o. The cut-off speed is much less sensitive to systematic effects on PUIs, such as variations in the solar wind parameters, ionization, and transport. ACE SWICS, STEREO PLASTIC, and SOHO CTOF data are available that span almost two decades, which will allow long term studies with high precision. The availability of O and Ne PUI data with high counting statistics from PLASTIC and CTOF will also allow the determination of the deflection of secondary O, in comparison with He and Ne.",

Here we present an overview of high-resolution, precisely dated and PSV synchronized Holocene lake sediment records on Iceland, where we employ diverse proxies at sites spanning a broad modern climate gradient, from the presently glaciated highlands to the coastal lowlands. Despite substantial differences in catchment specific processes that influence each lake record, the multi-proxy reconstructions over the last 10 ka show remarkably consistent trends, especially throughout the mid to late Holocene cooling related to the slow decrease in summer insolation. Of particular note are highly non-linear abrupt departures of centennial scale summer cold periods such as at 5.5 ka, ~4.2 ka; ~3.0 ka, ~1.5 ka, 0.7 ka, and 0.2 ka. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in Iceland. That these shifts reflect regional climate changes is also supported by contemporaneous shifts documented elsewhere in the northern North Atlantic region. Although timing and abruptness of these shifts is similar between our Icelandic lake records, their magnitude can differ substantially. Regional-scale factors such as volcanism likely modulate climatic responses to radiative forcing; and at the same time, local watershed characteristics like vegetation cover and soil properties produce site-specific environmental responses to climate change. Our Icelandic lake records provide opportunities to observe the precise timing of local climate shifts and corresponding environmental responses, and thus to disentangle these effects.",

Recently, we presented a rigorous framework based on spectral graph theory to study delta channel networks from a topologic (channel connectivity) and dynamic (flux exchange) perspective for advancing our understanding of deltas as complex systems [Tejedor et al., 2015a,b]. The framework enhances the quantitative comparison of deltas and seeks to replace the still qualitative diagrams [Galloway, 1975; Orton and Reading, 1993] by relating the controlling physical mechanisms of delta formation to the spatial patterns they create. Here we examine one controlling factor of river dominated delta evolution, namely the sediment cohesiveness. To explore the dependence of the delta channel network topo-dynamic complexity on sediment composition, we have simulated delta channel networks using a hydro-dynamic model (Delft3D) with varying sediment parameters. The results of our analysis show how complexity metrics are able not only to capture the variability in the delta network structure, but also to quantify the increase of complexity when the sediment composition transitions to coarser grains.",

            "abstract": "We present a flexible, general and efficient approach for implementing thermodynamic phase equilibria information (in the form of sets of physical parameters) into geophysical and geodynamic studies.\nThe approach is based on multi-dimensional decomposition methods, which transform the original multi-dimensional discrete information into a dimensional-separated representation. This representation has the property of increasing the number of coefficients to be stored linearly with the number of dimensions (opposite to a full multi-dimensional cube requiring exponential storage depending on the number of dimensions). Thus, the amount of information to be stored in memory during a numerical simulation or geophysical inversion is drastically reduced. Accordingly, the amount and resolution of the thermodynamic information that can be used in a simulation or inversion increases substantially.\nIn addition, the method is independent of the actual software used to obtain the primary thermodynamic information, and therefore it can be used in conjunction with any thermodynamic modeling program and/or database. Also, the errors associated with the decomposition procedure are readily controlled by the user, depending on her/his actual needs (e.g. preliminary runs vs full resolution runs). We illustrate the benefits, generality and applicability of our approach with several examples of practical interest for both geodynamic modeling and geophysical inversion/modeling. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is a competitive and attractive candidate for implementing thermodynamic constraints into a broad range of geophysical and geodynamic studies.",

            "abstract": "The east-west oriented Transverse Ranges of Southern California have historically experienced shallow landslides and debris flows that threaten life and property. Steep topography, soil composition, and frequent wildfires make this area susceptible to mass wasting. Extreme rainfall often acts as a trigger for these events. This work characterizes atmospheric conditions at multiple scales during extreme (>99th percentile) 1-day precipitation events in the major sub-ranges of the Transverse Ranges. Totals from these 1-day events generally exceed the established sub-daily intensity-duration thresholds for shallow landslides and debris flows in this region. Daily extreme precipitation values are derived from both gridded and station-based datasets over the period 1958-2014. For each major sub-range, extreme events are clustered by atmospheric feature and direction of moisture transport. A composite analysis of synoptic conditions is produced for each cluster to create a conceptual model of atmospheric conditions favoring extreme precipitation. The vertical structure of the atmosphere during these extreme events is also examined using observed and modeled soundings. Preliminary results show two atmospheric features to be of importance: 1) closed and cutoff low-pressure systems, areas of counter-clockwise circulation that can produce southerly flow orthogonal to the Transverse Range ridge axes; and 2) atmospheric rivers that transport large quantities of water vapor into the region. In some cases, the closed lows and atmospheric rivers work in concert with each other to produce extreme precipitation. Additionally, there is a notable east-west dipole of precipitation totals during some extreme events between the San Gabriel and Santa Ynez Mountains where extreme values are observed in one range and not the other. The cause of this relationship is explored. The results of this work can help forecasters and emergency responders determine the likelihood that an event will produce extreme precipitation in the Transverse Ranges.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the degree of mantle depletion of highly incompatible elements is critically important for assessing Earth’s internal heat production and Urey number. Current views of the degree of MORB source depletion are dominated by Salters and Stracke (2004), and Workman and Hart (2005). The first is based on an assessment of average MORB compositions, whereas the second considers trace element data of oceanic peridotites. Both require an independent determination of one absolute concentration, Lu (Salters & Stracke), or Nd (Workman & Hart). Both use parent-daughter ratios Lu/Hf, Sm/Nd, and Rb/Sr calculated from MORB isotopes combined with continental-crust extraction models, as well as “canonical” trace element ratios, to boot-strap the full range of trace element abundances. We show that the single most important factor in determining the ultimate degree of incompatible element depletion in the MORB source lies in the assumptions about the timing of continent extraction, exemplified by continuous extraction versus simple two-stage models. Continued crust extraction generates additional, recent mantle depletion, without affecting the isotopic composition of the residual mantle significantly. Previous emphasis on chemical compositions of MORB and/or peridotites has tended to obscure this. We will explore the effect of different continent extraction models on the degree of U, Th, and K depletion in the MORB source. Given the uncertainties of the two most popular models, the uncertainties of U and Th in DMM are at least ±50%, and this impacts the constraints on the terrestrial Urey ratio.\nSalters, F.J.M. and Stracke, A., 2004, Geochem.

            "abstract": "Transportation infrastructure is a significant climate change adaptation concern because it is: costly; designed for long operational lives; susceptible to both episodic and seasonal deterioration; and a significant safety concern. While examples of adaptation exist in transportation design, many communities do not have the capacity to incorporate climate change considerations into infrastructure planning and management. This presentation will overview the process and outcomes of research conducted in collaboration with the communities of Prince George and Squamish, both located in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Previous research in Prince George (in northern BC) involved applying downscaled climate projection information to assess local climate impacts, and identified transportation infrastructure as the top priority for ongoing study. In Prince George the adaptation process was oriented toward determining how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other representatives. The workshop precipitated additional modelling of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans to explore the viability of alternative paving techniques. Outcomes of the case study provide insights regarding how researchers can ‘combine’ top down and bottom up approaches by using modelling information as part of an engagement process with local experts to explore adaptation. Ongoing research in Squamish seeks to apply lessons learned from the Prince George case study (both related to process and the application of modelling information) to a more temperate coastal region with a more climate-concerned population. In Squamish there also lies an opportunity to explicitly focus on realizing mitigation co-benefits when adapting transportation infrastructure to climate change.",

We derive ice-surface roughness from satellite observations and investigate the relationships of surface roughness and its changes to the main manifestations of climate-induced changes in the Greenland ice sheet: (a) glacial accelerations and (b) melting. Results are relevant for assessment of sea-level change through mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet and for understanding relationships between observations and physical processes. The analysis is based on ICESat GLAS data 2003-2009, CryoSat-2 SIRAL data (since 2010) and data from ICESat-2 simulator instruments MABEL and SIMPL. The approach uses a spatial statistical concept of generalized spatial surface roughness and characteristic parameters, which are mathematically related to physical concepts including crevassing, deformation and aerodynamic roughness length. To derive micro-topographic and roughness information from MABEL and SIMPL data, the Density-Dimension-Poisson Algorithm (DDA) is introduced. Results demonstrate the expected capabilities of NASA's future ICESat-2 mission to map even spatially complex ice-surface topography with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. The remote-sensing data analysis lays the foundation for applied case studies: (1) Roughness and elevation changes in Ilulissat Ice Stream and other outlet glaciers are analyzed to investigate links between glacial acceleration and its causes. (2) Roughness changes during the recent acceleration of the margin of the Greenland ice sheet are analyzed together with other synoptic observations, such as those of surface water. (3) Energy balance calculations are carried out to relate surface roughness changes and changes in melt energy, for regions with small-scale roughness typical of uncrevassed snow and ice surfaces.",

Most currently available instruments for measuring snow albedo utilize the natural, downward flux of solar radiation and the reflected upward flux. This reliance on solar radiation (and, thus, large zenith angles and clear-sky conditions) leads to severe constraints, preventing characterization of detailed diurnal snow albedo cycles.\nHere, we describe instrumentation and methodologies to address these limitations with the development and deployment of new snow radiation sensors for measuring surface spectral and in-snow radiative properties. This novel instrumentation will be tested at the CRREL/UCSB Eastern Sierra (CUES) Snow Study Site at Mammoth Mountain, which is extensively instrumented for characterizing snow properties including snow albedo and surface morphology. However, it has been lacking instrumentation for the characterization of aerosols that can be deposited on the snow surface through dry and wet deposition. Currently, we are installing aerosol instrumentation at the CUES site, which are also described. This includes instruments for the multi-wavelength measurement of aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients and for the characterization of aerosol size distribution. Knowledge of aerosol concentration and physical and optical properties will allow for the study of aerosol deposition and modification of snow albedo and for establishing an aerosol climatology for the CUES site.",

Currently, global land cover and land use change is estimated to emit 0.9 PgC yr-1 compared to emissions due to fossil fuel combustion and cement production of 8.4 PgC yr-1. South and Southeast Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Singapore) is a region of rapid land cover and land use change due to the continuous development of agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, afforestation, and the increased demand of land for people to live. In this study, we synthesize outputs of nine models participated in Global Carbon Budget Project to identify the carbon budget of South and southeast Asia, diagnose the contribution of land cover and land use change to carbon emissions and assess areas of uncertainty in the suite of models. Uncertainty is determined using the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of net ecosystem exchange and its component parts. Results show the region’s terrestrial biosphere was a source of carbon emissions from the 1980 to the early 1990s. During the same time period, land cover and land use change increasingly contributed to carbon emission. In the most recent two decades, the region became a carbon sink since emission due to land cover land use changes. Spatially, the greatest total emissions occurred in the tropical forest of Southeast Asia. Additionally, this is the subregion with the greatest uncertainty and greatest biomass. Model uncertainty is shown to be proportional to total biomass. The atmospheric impacts of ENSO are shown to suppress the net biosphere productivity in South and Southeast Asia leading to years of increased carbon emissions.",

            "abstract": "Since 1958 it has been recognized that rewetting a dry soil produces a large pulse of respiration. However, the mechanisms controlling these pulses continue to be debated, with both physiological and physical mechanisms postulated. Recent studies suggest that a pool of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) increases as surface soils dry, concomitant with the increase in microbial biomass and the size of the rewetting CO2 pulse, but that these patterns are weakened in soils below the rooting zone. Because physically protected soil C is made available by the rewetting event itself, it is unlikely that the WEOC was generated by physical processes. Thus, we asked: i) Does the microbial decomposition of ‘fresh’ plant detritus during the dry season generate a pool of bioavailable WEOC, and ii) does its rapid metabolism upon rewetting control the magnitude of CO2 pulses? To answer these questions we manipulated plant inputs by thinning during the growing season, and measured CO2 emissions and WEOC concentrations for two years at a seasonally-dry California grassland. We also estimated a rapidly bioavailable WEOC (BWEOC) pool by measuring headspace CO2 after 3 hours of adding water. Opposite to our predictions, WEOC and BWEOC were most abundant in soils without plants. However, during the second year of treatment, soils with plants had higher BWEOC. Soil CO2 emissions were greater during the dry season with plants than without plants during both years, as well as upon rewetting, especially during the second year of treatment when the BWEOC accumulated during the summer drought. Apparently, WEOC was not generated by the decomposition of ‘fresh’ plant C, but rather, by C in various stages of decomposition. Because CO2 emissions during the dry season were higher with plants than without plants, interactions between plants and microbes appear to control the production of a BWEOC pool that influences the magnitude of CO2 pulses upon rewetting.",

During relativistic feedback discharges, the generation of energetic electrons is self–sustained via the production of backward propagating positrons and back-scattered x-rays, resulting in very larges fluxes of energetic radiation. In addition, ionization produces large electric currents that generate LF/VLF radio emissions and eventually discharge the electric field, terminating the gamma-ray production. In this presentation, new relativistic feedback model results will be presented and compared to recent observations.",

            "abstract": "Degradation and aggradation of deep-water seascapes result in a complicated stratigraphic record. Datasets rarely permit the inversion of this archive at a resolution high enough to understand process controls on sediment mass balance and grain-size segregation. An exceptional exhumed basin margin, exposed over 2500 km2, has permitted 4 deep-water systems to be mapped from slope valley-fills, through leveed channel complexes, to the distal fringe of basin-floor fans in the Permian Fort Brown Formation in the Laingsburg-Karoo depocenter, South Africa. Edge-to-edge reconstructions of the sand-prone units supported by >1000 measured sections permits quantitative constraints to be placed on the dynamic distribution and volumetric partitioning of sediment by depositional environment and grain-size. Grain-size is well segregated, with channel-levee deposits being silt-rich and lobe deposits sand-rich, although system progradation results in a common levee-over-lobe stratigraphic motif. Strikingly similar volumes of deposits are recorded in channel-levee systems as in stratigraphically related basin-floor lobe complexes in all the systems (10’s km3). The results point to the conduits feeding sediment gravity flows that were density stratified and became increasing sand-rich as they passed into the basin due to flow-stripping and overbanking processes. These patterns also suggest a persistent goodness to fit between the flow magnitude and the scale of confinement such that the channel-levee systems propagated into the basin under steady boundary conditions, despite the presence of a stepped slope profile. This comprehensive field study is a unique example where quantification of the volumes of sediment in the transport and depositional zones have been calculated, and highlight the importance of external levee deposits as a sediment store when attempting to estimate the mass balance of sediment in deep-water systems.",

            "abstract": "The future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the critical questions in assessing the effects of climate change. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) was regarded as relatively stable, and only recently has become the subject of a series of studies to determine if parts of the EAIS might be susceptible to melting if warm ocean masses reach the ice sheet. We are presenting new oceanographic and bathymetry observations from the East Antarctic continental margin between 115° E and 135° E that have been collected as part of the scientific cruise NBP1503 onboard the NB Palmer in early 2015. The goal of the scientific cruise was to determine to what extent warmer ocean water could reach (or is reaching) the inner shelf. Sea ice conditions prevented access to most inner continental shelf areas. Instead, we collected detailed multibeam bathymetry and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data from the continental slope, rise and the outer shelf north of the Dibble Glacier, Frost Glacier, Dalton Iceberg Tongue and Totten Glacier. An oceanographic section of 19 CTD stations on the continental slope parallel to the margin shows that modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) with higher salinity and temperatures is present near the shelf break over large sections of the investigated margin, but is absent in other sections. The shelf break depth varies significantly along the margin between ~300 and ~500 m. The shallower depths are potentially an obstacle for access of mCDW to the shelf. As a result, a ~100 m thick layer of mCDW resides on the ~500 m deep outer shelf north of the Totten Glacier, but there is no indication of mCDW in the Dibble Polynya because the shelf break is shallower. The access and presence of warmer mCDW water, especially north of Totten Glacier and the Moscow University Ice Shelf, has important implications in understanding the observed thinning of this ice stream.",

            "abstract": "Climate Education Partners (CEP) has been using an action research approach to build climate literacy and partnership with key influential (KI) leaders in the San Diego community. After identifying 6 key sectors that either (a) could reduce green house gas emissions and adapt to impacts, or (b) would be highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we conducted 89 interviews with KIs from the San Diego region -- including elected officials, academics, laborers, and representatives from local businesses, non-profits, ethnic and cultural communities, faith-based groups, and special interest groups -- to assess their science knowledge and opinions about climate change and the impacts of climate change. Other questions asked were about KIs’ personal efficacy, identity, values and engagement in pro-environmental behaviors related to climate change. The results of the interviews contributed to CEP’s action research approach in two ways: 1) it provided critical data regarding which leaders wanted further engagement with CEP and what that engagement should entail (e.g., being a connector to other leaders, a spokesperson, or a participant in future educational activities), and 2) it provided key information about the extent to which “knowledge deficit” is related to use of climate change knowledge to inform engagement in mitigation and adaptive behaviors. Practically, the results were used to create a database that is being used to inform the contact and education of KIs. We were able to show, consistent with previous research and identity theory, that liberal leaders were more likely than conservatives to believe in, feel concern for, and be knowledgeable about climate change. However, engagement in mitigation behaviors- specifically making decisions that would reduce electricity, gas, or water use- were similar for both groups. These results are being used to create resources and direct climate education activities going forward.",

A five-year airborne campaign, OMG will directly measure ocean warming and glacier retreat around all of Greenland. By relating these two, we will explore one of the most pressing open questions about how climate change drives sea level rise: How quickly are the warming oceans melting the Greenland Ice Sheet from the edges? The airborne campaigns will consist of once-per-year surveys of ocean conditions by deploying up to 250 expendable temperature and salinity probes, covering most of Greenland’s continental shelf. In addition, a once-per-year survey of glacier surface elevations for nearly all marine terminating glaciers will be conducted. Because the shape and depth of the sea floor help control whether warm water can reach a particular glacier, an airborne gravity campaign will also provide bathymetry information in poorly measured areas of the shelf. All of these campaigns will begin in 2016. However, this summer a ship-based survey of sea floor bathymetry is being conducted along the West Coast of Greenland. An overview of the survey strategy as well as preliminary results from the ship survey, including bathymetry as well as ocean temperature and salinity profiles, will be presented.",

However, its applicability to marine sediments has only been explored in a highly productive, hypoxic margin setting. We use δ15N-AA measurements to provide insight into the source and preservation of particulate organic nitrogen preserved in sediment using a core top sample set in the equatorial Pacific that spans a range of depositional conditions, including surface productivity, sediment oxicity, accumulation rate, and water depth (378–4360m below sea level). These variables represent main drivers understood to determine the formation and preservation of bulk sedimentary N pool during N uptake and after initial deposition. Core top bulk nitrogen isotope values (δ15Nbulk) exhibit characteristic enrichment with decreasing surface nitrate concentration away from coastal and equatorial upwelling. We examine how this spatial pattern in δ15Nbulk then manifests in sedimentary δ15N-AA values. Additionally, we examine how δ15N-AA can inform interpretations of past changes in N utilization, water column N cycling, and post-depositional processes measured downcore in a suite of equatorial Pacific multicores (11.3ºN–8.5ºS, 81.2–161ºW). Our new δ15Nbulk records are regionally coherent with a priori data in the equatorial Pacific, recording changes in N cycling from the Last Glacial Maximum, deglaciation, and Late Holocene. Analyses of δ15N-AA in downcore samples preserve detailed information about changes in source nutrients, reconstruct changes in ecosystem structure, and elucidate the presence and importance of diagenetic alteration of bulk δ15N values. This is possible because δ15N-AA investigates the molecular-level constituents of most of the bulk sedimentary δ15N signal. Understanding depositional processes and biases in the bulk δ15N record informs interpretations of current records and future study site selection.",

            "abstract": "The Williston Basin is a sub-circular intracratonic basin spanning central North America with its center in NW North Dakota. The Late Ordovician Red River Formation is an economically viable unit in the Williston Basin containing large hydrocarbon reserves in Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Manitoba, and Montana. Red River dolomitization contributed to the reservoir-quality porosity and permeability observed today with three types of dolomite (burrow, matrix, and saddle) possibly representing three events. Dolomitization is widely believed to have resulted from downward percolating brines, due to the stratigraphically close association between dolomite deposits and overlying basin-scale evaporites. However, in contrast, Sr isotope evidence suggests an upward fluid migration in the basin. Spatial variation of Mg isotopes (δ26Mg) may serve as a direct tracer of dolomitizing fluid flow. Dolomite sequesters light isotopes of Mg from dolomitizing fluids, therefore, the fluid will evolve with time and distance to heavier δ26Mg values. Accordingly, the δ26Mg values of the Red River dolomite should increase in the direction of fluid flow. We test this hypothesis on Red River burrow dolomite from the Williston Basin; the first event most often attributed to downward infiltration of brines. Burrow δ26Mg values range between –1.89‰ and –1.31‰. Using contouring software, the data are shown to form a pattern of increasing δ26Mg values out from the center of the Williston Basin, indicating an up-dip migration of dolomitizing fluids through the burrow network, rather than down-dip as suggested by the brine reflux model. We conclude that dolomitization of the Red River carbonate is not tied to the spatial and temporal history of evaporite deposition in the Williston Basin, but rather to the thermal history of the basin, suggesting dolomitization likely occurred during a late Paleozoic heating event that drove Mg-rich connate waters ponded in the center of the basin upwards into overlying strata.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) emissions through plants have long been known in wetlands. However, most measurements have focused on stem tops and leaves. Recently, measurements at the lower parts of stems have shown that stem emissions can exceed soil CH4 emissions in Asian peatlands (Pangala et al. 2013). The addition of stem fluxes to soil fluxes for total ecosystem fluxes has the potential to bridge the discrepancy between modeled to measured and bottom-up to top-down flux estimates. Our measurements in peatlands of Peru show that especially Mauritia flexuosa, a palm species, can emit very large quantities of CH4, although most trees emitted at least some CH4.\nWe used flexible stem chambers to adapt to stems of any size above 5cm in diameter. The chambers were sampled in closed loop with a Gasmet DX4015 for flux measurements, which lasted ~5 minutes after flushing with ambient air. We found that M. flexuosa stem fluxes decrease with height along the stem and were positively correlated with soil fluxes. Most likely CH4 is transported up the stem with the xylem water. Measured M. flexuosa stem fluxes below 1.5m averaged 11.2±1.5 mg-C m-2 h-1 (±95% CI) with a maximum of 123±3.5 mg-C m-2 h-1 (±SE), whereas soil fluxes averaged 6.7±1.7 mg-C m-2 h-1 (±95% CI) with a maximum of 31.6±0.4 mg-C m-2 h-1 (±SE). Significant CH4 fluxes were measured up to 5 m height along the stems. Combined with the high density of ~150 M. flexuosa individuals per hectare in these peatlands and the consistent diameter of ~30cm, the high flux rates add ~20% to the soil flux. With anywhere between 1 and 5 billion M. flexuosa stems across Amazon basin wetlands, stem fluxes from this palm species could represent a major addition to the overall Amazon basin CH4 flux.",

By specifically cultivating the commercialisation of research where appropriate, the UK demonstrates a forward-thinking and coordinated approach to deriving economic and societal impact from scientific research activities. This presentation provides an overview of innovation activities at government-backed organisations that support the Earth and space science communities.\nAt the broadest and highest levels, the UK has a whole-of-government approach to fostering innovation. The government also has a designated innovation agency – Innovate UK – which works with people, companies, and partner organisations to find and drive the science & technology innovations that will grow the UK economy.\nA primary source of scientific funding to UK-based researchers comes from the Research Councils UK (RCUK), which has seven constituent Research Councils. Along with funding activities that support basic research, innovation is supported through a variety of activities. The National Environmental Research Council (NERC), the UK’s leading public funder for Earth & environmental science, has brought to market a wide variety of ideas and innovations, including by helping to register patents, negotiating licensing deals, and setting up spin-out companies or joint ventures with commercial organisations.\nCase studies of NERC commercialization successes will be given, as well as an overview of mechanisms by which NERC supports innovation. These include ‘Pathfinder’ awards that help enable researchers to develop a greater understanding of the commercial aspects and possibilities of their research. Complementary ‘Follow-on Fund’ awards provide proof-of-concept funding to support the commercialisation of ideas arising from NERC-funded research. Early-career researchers are also eligible for NERC’s Environment Young Entrepreneurs Scheme.\nInnovation activity, like basic research, can be enhanced through international collaboration and engagement. Approaches taken by UK organisations such as RCUK seek to bring together the correct teams, regardless of nationality, to develop innovations needed to address common challenges.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust plays an important role in the Earth system, but a reliable quantification of the global dust budget is still not possible due to a lack of observations and insufficient representation of relevant processes in climate and weather models. Five years ago, the Desert Storms project funded by the European Research Council set out to reduce these uncertainties. Its aims were to (1) improve the understanding of key meteorological mechanisms of peak wind generation in dust emission regions (particularly in northern Africa), (2) assess their relative importance, (3) evaluate their representation in models, (4) determine model sensitivities with respect to resolution and model physics, and (5) explore the usefulness of new approaches for model improvements.\nHere we give an overview of the most significant findings: (1) The morning breakdown of nocturnal low-level jets is an important emission mechanism, but details depend crucially on nighttime stability, which is often badly handled by models. (2) Convective cold pools are a key control on summertime dust emission over northern Africa, directly and through their influence on the heat low; they are severely misrepresented by models using parameterized convection. A new scheme based on downdraft mass flux has been developed that can mitigate this problem. (3) Mobile cyclones make a relatively unimportant contribution, except for northeastern Africa in spring. (4) A new global climatology of dust devils identifies local hotspots but suggests a minor contribution to the global dust budget in contrast to previous studies. A new dust-devil parameterization based on data from large-eddy simulations will be presented. (5) The lack of sufficient observations and misrepresentation of physical processes lead to a considerable uncertainty and biases in (re)analysis products. (6) Variations in vegetation-related surface roughness create small-scale wind variability and support long-term dust trends in semi-arid areas.",

            "abstract": "Correctly estimating soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes emitted to the atmosphere is essential because they are a large component of the ecosystem carbon balance. Continuous estimates of soil CO2 flux, especially when paired with eddy covariance measurements of whole-ecosystem CO­2 exchange, help to disaggregate net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Most researchers estimate soil CO2 fluxes by applying the gradient method; however, this is only appropriate in the absence of advective or convective processes. Given the rarity of such static states, we must move toward measurement techniques that will allow us to quantify the dynamic soil efflux system with gas transport by convective, advective and molecular diffusion processes.\nConvective processes are mainly relevant in caves, where values of relative humidity, temperature and CO2 molar fraction determine the buoyancy of the external-internal air masses. These convective processes also are important in large fractures when temperature differences between surface and depth can generate convection, transporting CO2 from deep layers to the atmosphere. Advective processes occur both in caves and in soils, and the CO2 exchanges are mainly due to three factors: wind, changes in atmospheric pressure, and changes in the water table. Molecular diffusion processes are being widely applied in the determination of soil-atmosphere gas exchanges by applying the gradient method. However, the use of the gradient method can yield inappropriate flux estimates due to the uncertainties mainly associated with the inappropriate determination of the soil diffusion coefficient. Therefore, in-situ methods to determine diffusion coefficient are necessary to obtain accurate CO2 fluxes. If this is resolved, the gradient method has great potential to become the most used technique to monitor atmosphere-soil CO2 exchanges within the next few years. Here we review the state of the science and describe a series of field measurements for significantly improving the accuracy of soil CO2 fluxes.",

Does a single, monotonic relationship exist between acoustic backscatter and suspended sediment concentration in a bi-modal size distribution (PSD) at some sound frequency? These questions are addressed in this paper. In-situ vertical profiles of PSD, measured with a laser diffraction instrument LISST-SL are used to compute vertical profiles of acoustic attenuation and backscattering properties. Two sets of data taken one-year apart are examined. The data are from the Cowlitz river in Washington State. Data from one day in March, 2011 reveal a bi-modal PSD that is all washload at surface, but is dominated by Rouse-like suspended sand mode lower to bottom. In this case, at low frequencies, attenuation is indeed set by the washload, while scattering is determined by sand mode except near the surface. A monotonic relationship between backscatter and suspended sediment concentration is also found, offering a calibration for a single frequency system, and rendering inversion of acoustic profiles explicit. A year later, March 2012, the water column had very little wash load, instead only a Rouse-like suspended mode existed. In this uni-modal case, both attenuation and scattering profiles were determined by the suspended load, making inversions implicit. In this latter case, the backscatter-suspended concentration had a much tighter relationship than the bi-modal earlier case, associated with a narrow size distribution of sands. These views emphasize the dramatic variability of acoustic properties of a river column in different flow regimes.",

IRIS and EarthScope are partnering with the Alaska Earthquake Center, part of the University of Alaska’s Geophysical Institute, and Yukon College to spread awareness of earthquakes in Alaska and western Canada and the benefits of the Transportable Array for people living in these regions. We provide an update of ongoing education and outreach activities in Alaska and Canada as well as continued efforts to publicize the Transportable Array in the Lower 48.\nNearly all parts of Alaska and portions of western Canada are tectonically active. The tectonic and seismic variability of Alaska, in particular, requires focused attention at the regional level, and the remoteness and inaccessibility of most Alaskan and western Canadian villages and towns often makes frequent visits difficult. When a community is accessible, every opportunity to engage the residents is made. Booths at state fairs and large cultural gatherings, such as the annual convention of the Alaska Federation of Natives, are excellent venues to distribute earthquake information and to demonstrate a wide variety of educational products and web-based applications related to seismology and the Transportable Array that residents can use in their own communities. Meetings and interviews with Alaska Native Elders and tribal councils discussing past earthquakes has led to a better understanding of how Alaskans view and understand earthquakes.\nRegion-specific publications have been developed to tie in a sense of place for residents of Alaska and the Yukon. The Alaska content for IRIS’s Active Earth Monitor emphasizes the widespread tectonic and seismic features and offers not just Alaska residents, but anyone interested in Alaska, a glimpse into what is going on beneath their feet. The concerted efforts of the outreach team will have lasting effects on Alaskan and Canadian understanding of the seismic hazard and tectonics of the region.",

However, the technical expertise required to develop web apps represents a barrier for would-be developers. This barrier can be characterized by the following hurdles that developers must overcome: (1) identify, select, and install software that meet the spatial and computational capabilities commonly required for water resources modeling; (2) orchestrate the use of multiple free and open source (FOSS) projects and navigate their differing application programming interfaces; (3) learn the multi-language programming skills required for modern web development; and (4) develop a web-secure and fully featured web portal to host the app.\nTethys Platform has been developed to lower the technical barrier and minimize the initial development investment that prohibits many scientists and engineers from making use of the web app medium. It includes (1) a suite of FOSS that address the unique data and computational needs common to water resources web app development, (2) a Python software development kit that streamlines development, and (3) a customizable web portal that is used to deploy the completed web apps. Tethys synthesizes several software projects including PostGIS, 52°North WPS, GeoServer, Google Maps™, OpenLayers, and Highcharts.

X-ray microdiffraction experiments and electron microprobe analyses show that diverse alteration paths produced authigenic phillipsite and Al-tobermorite in the pyroclasts, pores, and cementing matrix of mortars in Romacons drill cores from Portus Cosanus, Portus Neronis, and Baianus Sinus. These minerals have cation exchange capabilities for some radionuclides and heavy metal cations and are candidate sorbents for concrete waste encapsulations. Compositions of phillipsite in certain Portus Cosanus and Portus Neronis pumice clasts are similar to those in the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff. Dissolution of this phillipsite and alkali feldspar produced new, authigenic phillipsite with less Si, greater Al and Ca, Al-tobermorite, and poorly-crystalline binder in pumice vesicles. Conversely, alteration of trachytic glass to clay mineral (nontronite) in a Baianus Sinus tuff clast is associated with new, authigenic phillipsite and Al-tobermorite in the tuff and cementing matrix. The Al-tobermorite has lower Al/(Si+Al) and Ca/(Si+Al) compared to Al-tobermorite in relict lime clasts. These more siliceous crystals, similar to those in hydrothermally-altered basalt, have 11.3 Å d-spacing in [001]. Raman spectra show symmetrical bending of Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al linkages, Si-O and Si-Al symmetrical stretching, and possible Q3 Si and Al tetrahedral peaks that suggest cross-linking of silicate chains–an important factor in cation exchange. The authigenic crystals refine pore space, contribute to binding in interfacial zones, and obstruct microcrack propagation. The well-constrained history of temperature variations and seawater immersion could provide further information for understanding alteration in volcanoclastic deposits and predicting regenerative processes in high performance concrete with pyroclastic rock pozzolan.",

Small projects cannot afford to maintain a large staff for infrastructure maintenance. Rapid prototyping fosters innovation. However, maintaining the integrity of data and systems demands care, particularly in a government context. The extensive data holdings that make up much of the value of NASA’s EOSDIS (Earth Observing System Data and Information System) are stored in a number of locations, across a wide variety of applications, ranging from small prototypes to large computationally-intensive operational processes.\nHowever, it is increasingly difficult for an application to implement the required security controls, perform required registrations and inventory entries, ensure logging, monitoring, patching, and then ensure that all these activities continue for the life of that application, let alone five, or ten, or fifty applications. This process often takes weeks or months to complete and requires expertise in a variety of different domains such as security, systems administration, development, etc.\nNGAP, the Next Generation Application Platform, is tackling this problem by investigating, automating, and resolving many of the repeatable policy hurdles that a typical application must overcome. This platform provides a relatively simple and straightforward process by which applications can commit source code to a repository and then deploy that source code to a cloud-based infrastructure, all while meeting NASA’s policies for security, governance, inventory, reliability, and availability. While there is still work for the application owner for any application hosting, NGAP handles a significant portion of that work.\nThis talk will discuss areas where we have made significant progress, areas that are complex or must remain human-intensive, and areas where we are still striving to improve this application deployment and hosting pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Wet tropical forests are some of the environments with the greatest annual precipitation, but are also considered as the world’s major carbon sink; however, literature postulates that phothsynthesis rates are inhibited while leaves are wet. Yet measurements of photosynthesis during wet conditions are challenging to obtain due to equipment limitations and the extreme complexity of canopy-atmosphere interactions in tropical environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate tropical species reactions to simulated leaf wetness and test the hypothesis that leaf wetness reduces rates of photosynthesis. In a central Costa Rica site with an average 4200 mm annual rainfall, we selected six tropical species with distinct leaf traits in which five sun-exposed leaf replicates from each species were subjected to gas exchange measurements using a LI-6400 IRGA (LICOR Inc., Lincoln, NE) under dry and wet/misted leaf conditions. Relationships between photosynthesis (As) and stomatal conductance (gs) with leaf to air temperature difference (DT), VPD, and relative humidity were evaluated using linear regression analysis. We found that the responses varied greatly among species, but all plants maintained a baseline of activity under wet leaf conditions, suggesting that abaxial leaf As was a significant percentage of total leaf As. Stachytarpheta jamaicens had an 18.7% reduction in As, while others, like Zamia skinneri, had a 7% increase in As. Tibouchina heteromalla showed a rapid stomatal recovery of 2 mins, while Carapa guianensis was slower with 7 mins. This variability between species suggests that leaf traits, such as presence or absence of trichomes, water repellency, vein distribution and size and leaf angle variation, may be critical for optimizing photosynthesis under wet conditions. Relative humidity and leaf temperature were the strongest secondary influences on As and gs under wet leaf conditions. While tropical vegetation-atmosphere interactions are complex, such leaf-level data are vital for an accurate modeling of growth in tropical environments.",

            "abstract": "With the advance of modern computers, studies of planetary atmospheres have heavily relied on general circulation models (GCMs). Because these GCMs are usually very complicated, the simulations are sometimes difficult to understand. Here we develop a semi-analytic zonally averaged, cyclostrophic residual Eulerian model to illustrate how some of the large-scale structures of the middle atmospheric circulation can be explained qualitatively in terms of simple thermal (e.g. solar heating) and mechanical (the Eliassen-Palm flux divergence) forcings. This model is a generalization of that for fast rotating planets such as the Earth, where geostrophy dominates (Andrews and McIntyre 1987). The solution to this semi-analytic model consists of a set of modified Hough functions of the generalized Laplace's tidal equation with the cyclostrohpic terms. As examples, we apply this model to Titan and Venus. We show that the seasonal variations of the temperature and the circulation of these slowly-rotating planets can be well reproduced by adjusting only three parameters in the model: the Brunt–Väisälä bouyancy frequency, the Newtonian radiative cooling rate, and the Rayleigh friction damping rate. We will also discuss the application of this model to study the meridional transport of photochemically produced tracers that can be observed by space instruments.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic gas emissions are a key component for monitoring volcanic activity, magmatic input of volatiles to the atmosphere and the assessment of geothermal potential in volcanic regions. Diffuse soil degassing has been shown to represent a major part of volcanic gas emissions. However, this type of gas emission has not yet been quantified in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica; a region of the country with several large, active or dormant volcanoes. We conducted the first study of diffuse CO2 degassing at Rincón de la Vieja and Miravalles volcanoes, both located in Guanacaste. Diffuse degassing was measured using the accumulation chamber method to quantify CO2 flux in regions where hydrothermal surface features indicate anomalous activity. The total diffuse carbon dioxide flux estimated at Miravalles in two areas, together roughly 2 km2 in size, was 135 t/day and in several areas at Rincón de la Vieja a minimum of 4 t/day.\nComparatively low flux values and a very local concentration (few m2) of CO2 flux were observed at the active Rincón de la Vieja volcano, compared to the dormant Miravalles volcano, where significant soil flux was found over extended areas, not only around vents. Our assessment of the origin of these differences leads to two possibilities depending on if the surface features on the two volcanoes are fed by a common hydrothermal system or two separate ones. In the former case, the different intensity of diffuse CO2 flux could indicate a different degassing behavior and stronger concentration of gas emissions at the active vent areas at Rincon de la Vieja. In the latter case, where the hydrothermal systems are not linked, the amount of CO2 degassed through the flanks of the volcanoes could indicate that different physical and chemical conditions are governing the degassing of the two systems.",

Perhaps nowhere is the connection between these facets stronger than in the marine and coastal Arctic where environmental change is driving advancements in our understanding of natural and socio-ecological systems while paving the way for a new assortment of arctic stakeholders, who generally lack adequate operational knowledge. As such, the Arctic provides opportunity to advance the role of science communication into a collaborative process of engagement and co-communication. To date, the communication of arctic change falls within four primary genres, each with particular audiences in mind. The New Arctic communicates an arctic of new stakeholders scampering to take advantage of unprecedented access. The Global Arctic conveys the Arctic’s importance to the rest of the world, primarily as a regulator of lower-latitude climate and weather. The Intra-connected Arctic emphasizes the increasing awareness of the interplay between system components, such as between sea ice loss and marine food webs. The Transforming Arctic communicates the region’s trajectory relative to the historical Arctic, acknowledging the impacts on indigenous peoples. The broad societal consensus on climate change in the Arctic as compared to other regions in the world underscores the opportunity for co-communication. Seizing this opportunity requires the science community’s engagement with stakeholders and indigenous peoples to construct environmental change narratives that are meaningful to climate responses relative to non-ecological priorities (e.g., infrastructure, food availability, employment, or language). Co-communication fosters opportunities for new methods of and audiences for communication, the co-production of new interdisciplinary knowledge and cross-epistemological perspectives, and direct feedback to the science community regarding the societal implications of future research. Currently, the Study for Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) is developing this necessary cadre of co-communicators of marine and coastal arctic change.",

This question is addressed here using stereo photogrammetric observations of clouds in Miami, Florida and a cloud-tracking algorithm implemented in large-eddy simulations. In both observations and large-eddy simulations, cloud thermals can be tracked throughout significant portions of their life cycles. These data can then be fit against simple parcel theories to infer the dominant balance in the momentum budget. These conclusions are then confirmed by diagnosing individual terms in the cloud-thermal momentum budget from large-eddy simulations.",

We show theoretically and numerically that macroweather precipitation can be modeled by a stochastic weather-climate model (the Climate Extended Fractionally Integrated Flux, model, CEFIF) first proposed for macroweather temperatures and we show numerically that a four parameter space-time CEFIF model can approximately reproduce eight or so empirical space-time exponents. In spite of this success, CEFIF is theoretically and numerically difficult to manage. We therefore propose a simplified stochastic model in which the temporal behavior is modeled as a fractional Gaussian noise but the spatial behaviour as a multifractal (climate) cascade: a spatial extension of the recently introduced ScaLIng Macroweather Model, SLIMM. Both the CEFIF and this spatial SLIMM model have a property often implicitly assumed by climatologists: that climate statistics can be “homogenized” by normalizing them with the standard deviation of the anomalies. Physically, it means that the spatial macroweather variability corresponds to different climate zones that multiplicatively modulate the local, temporal statistics. This simplified macroweather model provides a framework for macroweather forecasting that exploits the system’s long range memory and spatial correlations. We test factorization and the model with the help of three centennial, global scale precipitation products that we analyze jointly in space-time.",

The adsorption of supercritical CO2 could also affect shale permeability, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We performed pressure pulse-decay experiments on intact shale samples from the Utica formation to evaluate the permeability evolution. The experiments were conducted on horizontally oriented shale samples with a temperature of 41.1 °C (± 0.1 °C) and under a constant confining pressure. We measured permeability at high effective stress (13.9 MPa) using argon before and after permeating the samples with argon or supercritical CO2 at low effective stress (2.1 MPa).\nOur results show that after treatment with argon for three days, the shale permeability slightly changes. After treatment with supercritical CO2 for three days, the permeability with argon significantly decreases. From the observation of shale microstructure before and after the treatment, we found that the permeability decrease is due to pore size reduction. For samples with high initial permeability (e.g., 800 nD), the change of supercritical CO2 permeability is minor. However, for samples with low initial permeability (e.g., 4 nD), we observed a net increase of the permeability with supercritical CO2 owing to enlarged nanopores connected for fluid flow. The increase of nanopore size may be due to the adsorption of supercritical CO2. The net increase in the supercritical CO2 permeability is found in samples with high total organic content (TOC). We concluded that the adsorption of supercritical CO2 induces the permeability enhancement of horizontally oriented shale samples with low initial permeability and high TOC.",

            "abstract": "Current absolute plate motion (APM) models from 80 – 0 Ma are constrained by the location of mantle plume related hotspot seamounts, in particular those of the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville seamount trails. Originally the 'fixed' hotspot hypothesis was developed to explain past plate motion based on linear age progressive intra-plate volcanism. However, now that ‘moving’ hotspots are accepted, it is becoming clear that APM models need to be corrected for individual plume motion vectors. For older seamount trails that were active between roughly 50 and 80 Ma the APM models that use ‘fixed’ hotspots overestimate the measured age progression in those trails, while APM models corrected for ‘moving’ hotspots underestimate those age progressions. These mismatches are due to both a lack of reliable ages in the older portions of both the Hawaii and Louisville seamount trails and insufficient APM modeling constraints from other seamount trails in the Pacific Basin. Seamounts are difficult to sample and analyze because many are hydrothermally altered and have low potassium concentrations.\nNew 40Ar/39Ar Age results from International Ocean Drilling Project (IODP) Expedition 330 Sites U1372 (n=18), U1375 (n=3), U1376 (n=15) and U1377 (n=7) aid in constraining the oldest end of the Louisville Seamount trail. A significant observation in this study is that the age range recovered in the drill cores match the range of ages that were acquired on dredging cruises at the same seamounts (e.g. Koppers et al., 2011). This is important for determining the inception age of a seamount. The sections recovered from IODP EXP 330 are in-situ volcanoclastic breccia and lava flows. Comparing the seismic interpretations of Louisville guyots (Contreras-Reyes et al., 2010), Holes U1372, U1373 and U1374 penetrated the extrusive and volcanoclastic sections of the seamount. The ages obtained are consistent over stratigraphic intervals >100-450 m thick, providing evidence that these seamounts construct rapidly and represent a time period close to the inception age of the seamount, thus by proxy also the hotspot location. Here we present a new age dependent plate motion model that tests the 'fixed' and 'moving' hotspot hypotheses.",

Optimization is achieved using simulated annealing, a metaheuristic global optimization algorithm that does not require an accurate initial model. Balancing the seismic-gravity objective function is accomplished by a novel approach based on analysis of Pareto charts. Gravity modeling uses a newly developed convolution algorithm, while seismic modeling utilizes the highly efficient Vidale eikonal equation traveltime generation technique. Synthetic tests show that joint optimization improves velocity model accuracy and provides velocity control below the deepest headwave raypath.\nDetailed first arrival picking followed by trial velocity modeling remediates inconsistent data. We use a set of highly refined first arrival picks to compare results of a convergent joint seismic-gravity optimization to the Plotrefa™ and SeisOpt® Pro™ velocity modeling packages. Plotrefa™ uses a nonlinear least squares approach that is initial model dependent and produces shallow velocity artifacts. SeisOpt® Pro™ utilizes the simulated annealing algorithm and is limited to depths above the deepest raypath. Joint optimization increases the depth of constrained velocities, improving reflector coherency at depth. Kirchoff prestack depth migrations reveal that joint optimization ameliorates shallow velocity artifacts caused by limitations in refraction ray coverage.\nSeismic and gravity data from the San Emidio Geothermal field of the northwest Basin and Range province demonstrate that joint optimization changes interpretation outcomes. The prior shallow-valley interpretation gives way to a deep valley model, while shallow antiformal reflectors that could have been interpreted as antiformal folds are flattened. Furthermore, joint optimization provides a clearer image of the rangefront fault. This technique can readily be applied to existing datasets and could replace the existing strategy of forward modeling to match gravity data.",

            "abstract": "Secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) formation is not fully characterized due to inadequate knowledge of pre-cursor emissions (ammonia, NH3, and nitrogen oxides, NOx) and from incomplete understanding of reactions in model predictions involving the precursors and the chemical products such as nitric acid (HNO3). The Columbia River Gorge (CRG), located between Oregon and Washington states, has unique sources of reactive nitrogen located at both ends and experiences bimodal winds: winter easterlies and summer westerlies. Because of the unique winds, this project will utilize the CRG as an environmental flow tube as we monitor for atmospheric reactive nitrogen species at two locations within the CRG: one located on the western side and one on the east. Measurements will include total oxidized nitrogen, NOx, NH3 and HNO3 using annular denuders, and a novel method using ion exchange resins for particulate ammonium, nitrate, and sulfates. In addition, an ozone gas analyzer and meteorological conditions of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction will be measured. Our December 2012- June 2014 NOx measurements located near the eastern end of the CRG show significantly different (p<<0.05) levels of NO2 with easterly (8.1 ppb) versus westerly (5.7 ppb) wind conditions. This suggests an eastern NOx source – potentially the 550 megawatt Boardman Coal Power Plant 100 km to the east. These measurements in the near-source environment will provide insight into uncertainties in HNO3 formation, regional ammonia levels, and the best strategy for managers to reduce NOx or NH3 emissions to minimize SIA formation.",

            "abstract": "Application of conventional polyethylene (PE) mulch in crop production offers benefits of increased water use efficiency, weed control, management of certain plant diseases, and maintenance of a micro-climate conducive for plant growth. These factors improve crop yield and quality, but PE must be retrieved and safely disposed of after usage. Substituting PE with biodegradable plastic mulches (BDM) would alleviate disposal needs, and is potentially a more sustainable practice. However, knowledge of potential impacts of BDMs on agricultural soil ecosystems is needed to evaluate sustainability. We (a) monitored soil moisture and temperature dynamics, and (b) assessed soil quality upon usage of different mulches, with pie pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) as the test crop. Experimental field trials are ongoing at two sites, one at Northwestern Washington Research and Extension Center, Mount Vernon, WA, and the other at East Tennessee Research and Education Center, Knoxville, TN. The treatments constitute four different commercial BDM products, one experimental BDM; no mulch and PE served as the controls. Soil quality parameters being examined include: organic matter content, aggregate stability, water infiltration rate, CO2 flux, pH, and extracellular enzyme activity. In addition, lysimeters were installed to examine the soil water and heat flow dynamics. We present baseline and the first field season results from this study. Mulch cover appeared to moderate soil temperatures, but biodegradable mulches also appeared to lose water more quickly than PE. All mulch types, with the exception of cellulose, reduced the diurnal fluctuations in soil temperature at 10cm depth from 1 to 4ºC. However, volumetric water content ranged from 0.10 to 0.22 m3 m-3 under the five biodegradable mulches compared to 0.22 to 0.28 m3 m-3 under conventional PE. Results from the study will be useful for management practices by providing knowledge on how different mulches impact soil physical and biological properties which are important indicators of sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Since the arrival of the Cassini probe to the Saturnian system in 2004, the flattened shape and extreme equatorial ridge of the moon Iapetus have posed a number of questions regarding its geophysical evolution. Current models suggest either tidal despinning or a collapsed ring system formed the ridge, with 26Al decay serving as an additional heating mechanism and warm ice or liquid water beneath a thick lithosphere potentially allowing for large-scale topography and deformation to occur (Sandwell and Schubert 2010). Structure at the ridge itself provides further questions in understanding the deformation of Iapetus at its equator. Persaud and Phillips (2014) use stereo topography to present a trend of crater relaxation and crater diameter that suggests a secondary heating event has relaxed younger, smaller craters focused at this region. The extreme slopes along the ridge, however, complicate understanding the order of events that have occurred on Iapetus, including ridge formation, crater relaxation, secondary thermal events, and mass wasting.\nWe use topographic profiles of Iapetus impact craters extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs) constructed with stereo images from the Cassini ISS Instrument to characterize crater complexity and transition diameters versus crater floor geometry, proximity to the equatorial ridge, and relaxation percentage. We then use these results to begin to develop a geometric model of events at the ridge on Iapetus to understand its deformation history.\nWe will present results and discussion of using stereo topography for these analyses.\n",

            "abstract": "Microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE) is a key variable in biogeochemical cycling that regulates soil C sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and retention of inorganic nutrients. Microbial CUE is the fraction of C converted to biomass rather than respired as CO2. Biogeochemical models have been shown to be highly sensitive to variation in CUE; however, we currently have a poor understanding of how CUE responds to environmental variables such as soil moisture and nutrient limitations. We examined the effect of soil moisture and C supply on CUE in soil from a western hemlock / sitka spruce forest in Oregon, USA, using a novel technique which supplies 13C and 15N substrates through the gas phase so that water addition is not necessary. Soil samples (28 g oven-dry equiv. wt) at two water potentials (-0.03 and -3.55 MPa) were exposed to 13C-acetic acid vapor for either 6 or 30 sec to provide two different concentrations of acetate to soil microbial communities. The soils were also injected with small amounts of 15NH3 gas to allow quantification of microbial N assimilation rates and to provide an alternate method of calculating CUE. Rates of 13CO2 respiration were measured continuously during a 48-h incubation using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Soil samples were extracted at seven time intervals (0, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 12, 24, and 48 h) in 0.5 M K2SO4 and analyzed for DO13C, microbial 13C, DO15N, inorganic 15N, and microbial 15N to calculate how gross rates of C and N assimilation and microbial CUE change with incubation time. As expected, microbial C and N assimilation rates and CUE increased with soil moisture and the quantity of acetate added; however, C:N assimilated was higher at lower soil moisture, suggesting that either C-storage compounds were being created, or that fungal communities were responsible for a greater proportion of the assimilation in drier soils. Assimilation rates and CUE also changed with incubation time, demonstrating that estimates of CUE from studies that use different incubation durations may not be comparable. Additional studies are essential to fully characterize the effects of soil moisture and substrate supply on CUE so that biogeochemical models can accurately predict the effects of climate change on soil processes.",

It is now well established that assimilating GPS delay parameters - most commonly zenith total delay (ZTD) estimates - into a numerical weather model (NWM) improves its characterization of water vapor distribution in all three spatial dimensions plus time, and thus improves forecasts of precipitation, and often of other meteorological variables, including cloud cover and surface temperature. Given that NWMs are now used to study the climatology of the GriS, including changes in surface mass balance over time, we argue that assimilating ZTD data from GNET into NWMs using 4DVAR, or similar assimilation techniques, will improve the utility of these models for climatology. The constraint imposed by ZTD observations is somewhat different in character in polar settings than at low or mid latitudes. In southern Greenland, close to sea level, the temporal variability of ZTD is dominated by the variability of total-column integrated water vapor, or precipitable water, especially in summer. But in the high interior of the GrIs, particularly in winter, the temporal variability of ZTD is dominated by changes in surface pressure. We will use GNET and radiosonde observations to illustrate these and some related ideas.",

Climate change is resulting in an increase in disturbance frequency and intensity, making it critical that we quantify the physical and chemical impacts of disturbances on forests. The impacts of disturbance are thought to vary widely depending on disturbance type, location, and climate. More specifically, fires, insect infestations, and other types of disturbances differ in their timing, extent, and intensity making it difficult to assess the true impact of disturbances on local energy budgets and carbon cycling. Here, we provide a regional analysis of the impacts of fire, insect attack, and other disturbances on land surface temperature (LST), carbon stocks, and gross primary productivity (GPP). Using disturbances detected with MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series between 2002 and 2012, we find that the impacts of disturbance on LST, carbon stocks, and GPP vary widely according to local climate, vegetation, and disturbance type and intensity. Fires resulted in the most distinct impacts on all response variables. Forest responses to insect epidemics were more varied in their magnitude and timing. The results of this study provide an important estimation of the variability of climate and ecosystem responses to disturbance across a large and heterogeneous landscape. With disturbance projected to increase in both frequency and intensity around the globe in the coming years, this information is vitally important to effectively manage forests into the future.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster.pdf\nOn a global scale, biogenically emitted isoprene is the most abundant nonmethane volatile organic compound (VOC), and therefore a key source of reactive carbon in the earth’s atmosphere. Because there are significant uncertainties in the oxidation mechanism of isoprene, and little work examining the deposition rates of the key oxidation products, predicting the total amount, the speciation, and the fate of isoprene oxidation products is difficult. Therefore, the fate of reactive carbon is also poorly constrained.\nDuring the 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign, OH reactivity, isoprene, and key first-generation and later-generation isoprene oxidation products were measured over the South-East United States. The observed OH reactivity can largely be accounted for, with an average “missing” reactivity of ~25%. OH reactivity was largely dominated by isoprene, with only small contributions from isoprene-derived oxidation products. In contrast, not all oxidation products show good agreement, despite well parameterized dry deposition and dilution rates. Using the viewpoint of OH reactivity, we discuss the sources of reactive carbon at this site. Then, from the viewpoint of oxidized VOCs, we discuss its fate. Measurement and model discrepancies are used to explore the plausibility of unknown physical and chemical carbon sinks.",

Monthly precipitation modelled by the PRISM group, and runoff data (1952-2011) from 18 unregulated basins (USGS) are analyzed using a single-field based Principal Component’s Analysis. Results indicate that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation are the main drivers of hydroclimate variability in the region, sometimes operating at several months lag. Their influence is the strongest in the fall through spring, which corresponds with the dry season in the southern parts of the study area, increasing pressure on already limited water resources. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific-North American patterns vary on shorter term bases, and also show a significant, but temporally more sporadic influence. A study of the relationship between the time series of precipitation and runoff indicates that the correlation between the two has become stronger over time, particularly in winter and spring, indicating an altered hydrologic cycle, which might be explained by a warmer climate.\nFindings can be used in water resources forecasting, indicating expected water volumes several months ahead and giving an idea about future changes to the water cycle, following a warmer climate.",

            "abstract": "At-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) is a recently discovered set of geomorphic relationships showing that empirical parameters of at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG: w=aQb, d=cQf, v=kQm) are functionally related along a river. This simple empirical conclusion seemingly refutes previous decades of research defining AHG as spatially independent and derived from cross sectional geometry. AMHG also enabled a recent methodology that successfully estimated river discharge solely from satellite imagery [Gleason and Smith, 2014]. Despite these important implications, AMHG has remained an empirical phenomenon without theoretical explanation. Here, we derive AMHG, showing that it arises when spatially independent AHG curves within a reach intersect at or near the same values of discharge and width, depth, or velocity. Thus, AMHG is shown to be a mathematical construct, and the strength (linearity) of AMHG is determined by the degree of this convergence: how tightly these rating curves cluster about their intersection point determines how linear the resultant AMHG equation will be. We thus suggest future interpretation of AMHG as an index of geometric variability (as rating curves will not cross if AHG exponents similar and rating curves are parallel) and hydraulic similarity. We also show how AMHG enables remotely sensed discharge estimation by defining the convergence point of rating curves in hydraulic space, thus generating a set of possible inverted discharge values that usually agrees with the range of true discharge when truncated by minimum and maximum imposed discharges and observed widths. Finally, we show that Gleason and Smith’s [2014] previously proposed remotely sensed proxy for AMHG is coincidental and should not be used, and we propose alternatives for remote sensing of discharge without in situ data. We conclude that AMHG discharge estimation remains robust, and that the hydrologic and hydraulic drivers of AMHG are fertile ground for further study.",

            "abstract": "Many extreme floods result from a causal chain, where exceptional rain and floods in water basins from different sizes are related to large scale, anomalous and persistent patterns in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Organized moisture plumes from oceanic sources are often implicated. One could use an Eulerian-Lagrangian climate model to test a causal chain hypothesis, but the parameterization and testing of such a model covering convection and transport continues to be a challenge. Consequently, empirical data based studies can be useful to establish the need to formally model such events using this approach. Here we consider two flood-prone regions in Southeast and South Brazil as case studies. A hypothesis of the causal chain of extreme floods in these regions is investigated by means of observed streamflow and reanalysis data and some machine learning tools. The signatures of the organization of the large scale atmospheric circulation in the days prior to the flood events are evaluated based on the integrated moisture flux and its divergence field and storm track data, so that a better understanding of the relations between the flood magnitude and duration, strength of moisture convergence and role of regional moisture recycling or teleconnected moisture is established. Persistent patterns and anomalies in the sea surface temperature (SST) field in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans that may be associated with disturbances in the atmospheric circulation and with the flood dynamics are investigated through composite analysis. Finally, machine learning algorithms for nonlinear dimension reduction are employed to visualize and understand some of the spatio-temporal patterns of the dominated climate variables in a reduced dimensional space. Prospects for prediction are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recent measurements from the Van Allen Probes mission revealed unexpected behavior of the energetic and relativistic electron intensities in the Earth’s inner radiation belt and the slot region. Over all geomagnetic storms spanned by the Van Allen Probes, relativistic electrons with the energies of ~1 MeV and higher never penetrated inside the energy-dependent boundary centered at L~3, whereas energetic electrons with the energies of 10s to 100s keV penetrated through the slot and filled out the inner belt during multiple of these storms. One of the fundamental processes that needs to be quantified in order to explain this unexpected behavior is the radial transport of electrons across their drift shells. Quantifying the radial transport rates inside L=3 on purely observational basis is difficult because the amplitudes of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) electric fields that drive the transport cannot be resolved from the in situ measurements on fast moving platforms. Also, the empirical methods of computing the radial transport rates from the measurements of electron intensities inside L=3 are affected by the complexity of the Earth’s inner magnetic field and other uncertainties. The goal of this paper is to investigate the properties of radial transport with the use of test-particle numerical simulations. Taking the amplitude of the ULF electric field as a free parameter we quantify the radial transport rates as a function of energy and L, and investigate at what values of energy and L and at what timescales the transport can be described as radial diffusion.",

            "abstract": "Stratigraphy contains the most complete record of information necessary to quantitatively reconstruct paleolandscape dynamics, but this record contains significant gaps over a range of time and space scales. These gaps result from stasis on geomorphic surfaces and from erosional events. We examine stratigraphic completeness in a suite of 11 physical experiments where the topography of aggrading deltas was monitored at high temporal and spatial scales. These experiments cover a range of boundary conditions, with both constant and dynamic forcings. Our analysis centers on three time scales: (1) the time at which a record is discretized (t), (2) the time necessary to build a deposit with mean thickness equivalent to the maximum topographic roughness (Tc), and (3) the time necessary for channelized flow to migrate over the entire basin (Tch). These time scales incorporate information pertaining to the evolving topography of actively changing surfaces, kinematics by which the surfaces are changing, and net deposition rate. In constant boundary condition experiments, we find that stratigraphic completeness increases as a power law function of t/Tc until reaching 100% completeness at time scales equal to Tc. The relationship between completeness and t/Tc in experiments experiencing base-level cycles is complex and related to characteristics of the base level cycles. We observe that in our experiments the mean and standard deviation of the width of stratigraphic gaps scales with Tc/Tch. These results place quantitative limits on the fidelity of the stratigraphic record, and thus aid prediction of a depositional environment’s capacity to store environmental signals.",

            "abstract": "The lower Long Tom River is a heavily managed, highly modified stream in the southwestern Willamette Valley with many opportunities for habitat improvements and river restoration. In the 1940s and 1950s, the US Army Corps of Engineers dramatically altered this river system by constructing the Fern Ridge Dam and three, large drop structures, converting the River from a highly sinuous channel to a straight, channelized stream that is interrupted by these grade control structures, and removed the majority of the riparian vegetation. As a result, juvenile spring Chinook salmon are no longer found in the Watershed and the local population of coastal cutthroat trout face limited aquatic habitat. When the river was channelized, long sections of the historical channel were left abandoned on the floodplain. Reconnecting these historical channels as side channels may improve the quality and quantity of aquatic habitat and could allow fish passage around current barriers. However, such construction may also lead to undesirable threats to infrastructure and farmland.\nThis study uses multiple HEC-RAS models to determine the impact of reconnecting two historical channels to the lower Long Tom River by quantifying the change in area of flood inundation and identifying infrastructure in jeapordy given current and post-restoration conditions for 1.5, 5, 10, and 25-year flood discharges. Bathymetric data from ADCP and RTK-GPS surveys has been combined with LiDAR-derived topographic data to create continuous elevation models. Several types of side channel connections are modeled in order to determine which type of connection will result in both the greatest quantity of accessible habitat and the fewest threats to public and private property. In the future, this study will also consider the change in the quantity of physical salmonid habitat and map the areas prone to sedimentation and erosion using CEASAR and PHABSIM tools.",

First is what ground based values to use.

Second is the scaling relation that can depend upon the ratios of fuel-air equivalence, pressure, and combustor flame temperature.\nWe are using measured ground-based values to evaluate the accuracy of present methods towards developing alternative methods for CBCby smoke number or via a semi-empirical kinetic method for the specific engine, CFM56-2C, representative of a rich-dome style combustor, and as one of the most prevalent engine families in commercial use. Applying scaling relations to measured ground based values and comparison to measurements at cruise evaluates the accuracy of current scaling formalism.\nIn partnership with GE Aviation, performing engine cycle deck calculations enables critical comparison between estimated or predicted thermodynamic parameters and true (engine) operational values for the CFM56-2C engine. Such specific comparisons allow tracing differences between predictive estimates for, and measurements of nvPM to their origin – as either divergence of input parameters or in the functional form of the predictive relations. Such insights will lead to development of new predictive tools for jet aircraft nvPM emissions. Such validated relations can then be extended to alternative fuels with confidence in operational thermodynamic values and functional form. Comparisons will then be made between these new predictive relationships and measurements of nvPM from alternative fuels using ground and cruise data – as collected during NASA-led AAFEX and ACCESS field campaigns, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic extremes, such as drought, offer an exceptional opportunity to explore how runoff generation mechanisms and stream networks respond to changing precipitation regimes. The winter of 2014-2015 was the warmest on record in western Oregon, US, with record low snowpacks, and was followed by an anomalously warm, dry spring, resulting in historically low streamflows. But a year like 2015 is more than an outlier meteorological year. It provides a unique opportunity to test fundamental hypotheses for how montane hydrologic systems will respond to anticipated changes in amount and timing of recharge. In particular, the volcanic Cascade Mountains represent a “landscape laboratory” comprised of two distinct runoff regimes: the surface-flow dominated Western Cascade watersheds, with flashy streamflow regimes, rapid baseflow recession, and very low summer flows; and (b) the spring-fed High Cascade watersheds, with a slow-responding streamflow regime, and a long and sustained baseflow recession that maintains late summer streamflow through deep-groundwater contributions to high volume, coldwater springs.\nWe hypothesize that stream network response to the extremely low snowpack and recharge varies sharply in these two regions. In surface flow dominated streams, the location of channel heads can migrate downstream, contracting the network longitudinally; wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as summer recession proceeds and flows diminish. In contrast, in spring-fed streams, channel heads “jump” to the next downstream spring when upper basin spring flow diminishes to zero. Downstream of flowing springs, wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as flows recede.\nTo test these hypotheses, we conducted a field campaign to measure changing discharge, hydraulic geometry, and channel head location in both types of watersheds throughout the summer and early fall. Multiple cross-section sites were established on 6 streams representing both flow regime types on either side of the Cascade crest. We also took Isotopic water samples to determine recharge elevations of receding streams. Taken together these measurements reveal the processes by which drainage networks contract as flows diminish – a fundamental property of montane stream systems both now and in the future.",

            "abstract": "Ground based remote sensing is a novel technique for development of digital outcrop models which can be instrumental in performing detailed qualitative and quantitative sedimentological analysis for the study of depositional environment, diagenetic processes, and hydrocarbon reservoir characterization. For this investigation, ground-based hyperspectral data collection is combined with terrestrial LiDAR to study outcrops of Late Albian rudist buildups of the Edwards formation in the Lake Georgetown Spillway in Williamson County, Texas. The Edwards formation consists of shallow water deposits of reef and associated inter-reef facies, including rudist bioherms and biostromes. It is a significant aquifer and was investigated as a hydrocarbon play in south central Texas. Hyperspectral data were used to map compositional variation in the outcrop by distinguishing spectral properties unique to each material. Lithological variation was mapped in detail to investigate the structure and composition of rudist buildups. Hyperspectral imagery was registered to a 3D model produced from the LiDAR point cloud with an accuracy of up to one pixel. Flat-topped toucasid-rich bioherm facies were distinguished from overlying toucasid-rich biostrome facies containing chert nodules, overlying sucrosic dolostones, and uppermost peloid wackestones and packstones of back-reef facies. Ground truth was established by petrographic study of samples from this area and has validated classification products of remote sensing data. Several types of porosity were observed and have been associated with increased dolomitization. This ongoing research involves integration of remotely sensed datasets to analyze geometrical and compositional properties of this carbonate formation at a finer scale than traditional methods have achieved and seeks to develop a workflow for quick and efficient ground based remote sensing-assisted outcrop studies.",

            "abstract": "Thunderstorm observation has been conducted in Osaka, Japan, with a use of a 3D lightning mapper, called Broadband Observation network for Lightning and Thunderstorm (BOLT), and an X-band phased array radar (PAR). BOLT is a LF sensor network that receives LF emission associated with lightning discharges and locates LF radiation sources in 3D. PAR employs mechanical and electrical scans, respectively, in azimuthal and elevation direction, succeeding in quite high volume scan rate. In this presentation, we focus on lightning activity and charge structure in convective cells that lasted only short time (15 minutes or so). Thunderstorms that consisted of several convective cells developed near the radar site. Precipitation structure of a convective cell in the thunderstorm was clearly observed by PAR. A reflectivity core of the convective cell appeared at an altitude of 6 km at 2245 (JST). After that the core descended and reached the ground at 2256 (JST), resulting in heavy precipitation on surface. The echo top height (30dBZ) increased intermittently between 2245 (JST) and 2253 (JST) and it reached at the altitude of 12 km. The convective cell dissipated at 2300. Many intra-cloud (IC) flashes were initiated within the convective cell. Most IC flashes that were initiated in the convective cell occurred during the time when the echo top height increased, while a few IC flashes were initiated in the convective cell after the cease of the echo top vertical development. These facts indicate that strong updraft at upper levels (about 8 km or higher) plays an important role on thunderstorm electrification for IC flashes. Moreover, initiation altitudes of the IC flashes and the positive charge regions removed by the IC flashes increased, as the echo top height increased. This fact implies that the strong updraft at the upper levels blew up positively-charged ice pellets and negatively-charged graupel, and lifted IC flash initiation altitudes and positive charge regions. Previous observation results showed that positive charge regions sometimes moved upward in short time (about 5 minutes or so) in vigorous convective cells. Our observation results support the previous observation results and show that the rapid charge structure change was caused by strong updraft at upper levels in the convective cell.",

            "abstract": "Scientific provenance describes the authenticity, origin, and processing history of research products and promotes scientific transparency by detailing the steps in computational workflows that produce derived products. These products include papers, findings, input data, software products to perform computations, and derived data and visualizations. The geosciences community values this type of information, and, at least theoretically, strives to base conclusions on computationally replicable findings. In practice, capturing detailed provenance is laborious and thus has been a low priority; beyond a lab notebook describing methods and results, few researchers capture and preserve detailed records of scientific provenance.\nWe have built tools for capturing and publishing provenance that integrate into analytical environments that are in widespread use by geoscientists (R and Matlab). These tools lower the barrier to provenance generation by automating capture of critical information as researchers prepare data for analysis, develop, test, and execute models, and create visualizations. The 'recordr' library in R and the `matlab-dataone` library in Matlab provide shared functions to capture provenance with minimal changes to normal working procedures. Researchers can capture both scripted and interactive sessions, tag and manage these executions as they iterate over analyses, and then prune and publish provenance metadata and derived products to the DataONE federation of archival repositories. Provenance traces conform to the ProvONE model extension of W3C PROV, enabling interoperability across tools and languages. The capture system supports fine-grained versioning of science products and provenance traces. By assigning global identifiers such as DOIs, reseachers can cite the computational processes used to reach findings. And, finally, DataONE has built a web portal to search, browse, and clearly display provenance relationships between input data, the software used to execute analyses and models, and derived data and products that arise from these computations. This provenance is vital to interpretation and understanding of science, and provides an audit trail that researchers can use to understand and replicate computational workflows in the geosciences.",

Since the ocean dynamics are chaotic in nature, a roundoff-level perturbation in the initial conditions will potentially result in distinct model solutions. No bit-for-bit (BFB) identical results in ocean solutions can be guaranteed for even tiny code modification. Our approach takes the natural variability of the ocean model into account through POP ensemble simulations. In particular, the statistical distribution from an ensemble of POP simulations is used to determine the standard score of any new model solution at each grid point. This setup accounts for the spatial heterogeneity in variability within the ensemble. Then the percentage of grid points which have scores greater than a specified threshold indicates whether the new model simulation is statistically distinguishable from the ensemble simulations. We evaluate the new tool on three types of scenarios: running with different processor layouts, changing the physical parameterization, and varying the convergence tolerance in the barotropic solver. Results indicate that our new testing tool is capable of distinguishing cases which should be consistent with the ensemble, such as the solutions with different processor layouts, and those which should not, such as increasing a certain physical parameter by two or more times. This new tool provides a simple, subjective and systematic way to evaluate the difference between the given solution and the ensemble, thus facilitating the detection of errors introduced during model development.",

But because publications are static and atomic, researchers can only cite and reference a whole work when building on prior work of colleagues. The open source software model has demonstrated a new approach in which strong version control in an open environment can nurture an open ecosystem of software. Developers now commonly fork and extend software giving proper credit, with less repetition, and with confidence in the relationship to original software. Through initiatives like 'Beyond the PDF', an analogous model has been imagined for open science, in which software, data, analyses, and derived products become first class objects within a publishing ecosystem that has evolved to be finer-grained and is realized through a web of linked open data.\nWe have prototyped a Living Paper concept by developing the ProvONE provenance model for scientific workflows, with prototype deployments in DataONE. ProvONE promotes transparency and openness by describing the authenticity, origin, structure, and processing history of research artifacts and by detailing the steps in computational workflows that produce derived products. To realize the Living Paper, we decompose scientific papers into their constituent products and publish these as compound objects in the DataONE federation of archival repositories. Each individual finding and sub-product of a reseach project (such as a derived data table, a workflow or script, a figure, an image, or a finding) can be independently stored, versioned, and cited. ProvONE provenance traces link these fine-grained products within and across versions of a paper, and across related papers that extend an original analysis. This allows for open scientific publishing in which researchers extend and modify findings, creating a dynamic, evolving web of results that collectively represent the scientific enterprise. The Living Paper provides detailed metadata for properly interpreting and verifying individual research findings, for tracing the origin of ideas, for launching new lines of inquiry, and for implementing transitive credit for research and engineering.",

The simulation period is near equinox when the north and south hemispheres are similarly exposed to solar radiation. We present a model simulation of the eight day period 2002 September 27 (DOY 270) through October 4 (DOY 277). The first three days have relatively quiet magnetic activity as indicated by low Kp values. The fourth day (270) is moderately active, and over the last four days (1-4 October) a strong magnetic storm takes place where Kp reaches values greater than 7 and Dst reaches values below -170. The GPW model was utilized to simulate the behavior of the plasma outflow from both hemispheres over the eight-day period. This storm differs from idealized storm that was the subject of a number of previous studies by Schunk and coauthors in the following ways. First, the interplanetary magnetic field changed in a complex manner in contrast to the previous studies where the IMF remained in the negative z direction. Second, Kp variation is more complex than the previous investigations. Third, the simulation period of eight days is much longer than the previous simulations (less than 18 hours). Finally, both hemispheres are considered, in contrast to previous simulations that investigated the northern hemisphere only. This investigation focuses on the variation of the integrated flux (from the poles to 45 degrees of latitude). We discuss how the integrated flux depends on the ion species (O+ vs. H+) and on the hemisphere (north vs. south). We also investigated the integrated flux dependence on the physical conditions, e.g., Kp, Dst universal time, etc. This statistical approach helped extract important simple conclusions from the complex behavior of the ion outflow during real a storm.",

Thus, tephra-analysis on the Mohoş sediments gives valuable insights into the volcanic history of that region, mainly arising from the younger crater of Sf Ana and several secondary domes. For investigations into the past climate history, the Mohoş sediment sequence has been analysed using a multi-proxy approach including geophysical, geochemical and sedimentological parameters. Multi-Sensor core logging and ITRAX X-ray fluorescence scanning have been performed at high-resolution, whereas grain size analysis, TOC and C/N ratios supplement the geophysical and geochemical data. Chronological control is based on radiocarbon and luminescence dating. We also present first results of the tephra-analysis on the Mohoş sediment record and their correlation to medium-distal pyroclastic deposits originating in this volcanic field. We further discuss responses of this mid-altitude site (1050 m a.s.l.) to past climate oscillations since early MIS 3. To date, the Mohoş core record provides the longest time series from the Carpathian region. This study is part of the Collaborative Research Centre 806 ”Our Way To Europe; Culture-Environment Interaction and Human Mobility in the Late Quaternary” (\nwww.sfb806.de\n); subproject B2.",

            "abstract": "Horizontal geologic and geodetic slip rate discrepancies for active faults in Southern California are well documented, however this discrepancy is significantly larger in the vertical direction. In turn, rheological models used to constrain fault slip rates generally exclude vertical geodetic motions. Here we compare geologic vertical rates from the Southern California Earthquake Center Vertical Motion Database and vertical GPS velocities from the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO). These two data sets are not necessarily co-located in space and the geologic data are observed using four different markers: thermo-chronologic (TH), river terraces (RT), stratigraphic horizons (SH) and marine terraces (MT). Therefore, we extract subsets of the geologic data and perform geostatistical analysis of these data to better understand their spatial dependency. Overall, the combined raw data correlation coefficient (R) is ~0.1, while for the subset data, R ranges from -0.3 to 0.3. The geologic data from SH primarily indicate subsidence, but the geologic data from other sources (TH, MT, and RT) primarily indicate uplift, though the SH and RT samples are mostly from the same geographic location. The GPS data are also likely to be contaminated by high-frequency non-tectonic noise (e.g., groundwater withdrawal). Therefore, we also compare the geologic data to a smoothed GPS velocity field derived from a statistically robust interpolation technique that reduces non-tectonic noise. Our comparison with the interpolated GPS data shows an increased combined correlation (R = 0.29), but overall the agreement is not strong. Moreover, average geologic vertical velocities appear to be one order smaller in magnitude than geodetic rates. While the agreement between these two vertical motion rates is not necessarily warranted, the discrepancy is likely related to measurement bias caused by the use of different geologic markers, as well as non-tectonic motion in the geodetic data.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - agu_2015.pdf\nOne of the most basic descriptions of streams is the presence of channelized flow. However, this seemingly simple query goes unanswered for the majority of headwater networks, as stream length expands and contracts with the wetness of catchments seasonally, interannually, and in response to storm events. Although streams are known to grow and shrink, a lack of information on longitudinal dynamics across different geographic regions precludes effective management. Understanding the temporal variation in temporary network length over a broad range of settings is critical for policy decisions that impact aquatic ecosystem health. This project characterizes changes in active stream length for forested headwater catchments spanning four physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Highlands: the New England at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire; Valley and Ridge at Poverty Creek and the North Fork of Big Stony Creek in Jefferson National Forest, Virginia; Blue Ridge at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina; and Appalachian Plateau at Fernow Experimental Forest, West Virginia. Multivariate statistical analysis confirms these provinces exhibit characteristic topographies reflecting differences in climate, geology, and environmental history and, thus, merit separate consideration. The active streams of three watersheds (<45 ha) in each study area were mapped six times to capture a variety of moderate flow conditions that can be expected most of the time (i.e., exceedance probabilities between 25 to 75%). The geomorphic channel and channel heads were additionally mapped to determine how active stream length variability relates to the development of the geomorphic network. We found that drainage density can vary up to four-fold with discharge. Stream contraction primarily proceeds by increasing disconnection and disintegration into pools, while the number of flow origins remains constant except at high and low extremes of discharge. This work demonstrates that streams can remain active in the form of isolated, disconnected sections along even the most upstream reaches during low flows. This finding suggests that we must consider the maximum stream extent for conservation and management strategies much more frequently than for just periods of high stream flow.",

The functional model is based on first principles regulating the dynamics of each system constituent and their synergies, therefore its applicability is general and data-independent, not requiring local calibrations. Moreover, it enables the dynamical estimation of hydroclimatic variations in space and time from the given knowledge at different spatiotemporal conditions. This paves the way for a robust physically based prediction of hydroclimatic changes in unmonitored areas.\nValidation is achieved by producing, with the dynamical model, a comprehensive spatiotemporal legacy consistent with the observed distributions along with their dynamical and statistical properties and relations. The similarity between simulated and observed distributions is further assessed with robust information-theoretic diagnostics.\nThis study ultimately brings to light emerging signatures of structural change in hydroclimate dynamics arising from nonlinear synergies across spatiotemporal scales, and contributes to a better dynamical understanding and prediction of spatiotemporal regimes, transitions and extremes. The study further sheds light onto a diversity of emerging properties from harmonic to hyper-chaotic dynamics in hydroclimatic systems.",

In anticipation of the launch of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard GOES-R that will provide continuous real time observations of total (both cloud and ground) lightning, the Fly’s Eye GLM Simulator (FEGS) is in production. FEGS is an airborne instrument designed to provide cal/val measurements for GLM from high altitude aircraft. It consists of a 5 x 5 array of telescopes each with a narrow passband filter to isolate the 777.4 nm neutral oxygen emission triplet radiated by lightning. The telescopes will measure the optical radiance emitted by lightning that is transmitted through the cloud top with a temporal resolution of 10 μs. When integrated on the NASA ER-2 aircraft, the FEGS array with its 90° field-of-view will observe a cloud top area nearly equal to a single GLM pixel. This design will allow FEGS to determine the temporal and spatial variation of light that contributes to a GLM event detection. In addition to the primary telescope array, the instrument includes 5 supplementary optical channels that observe alternate spectral emission features and will enable the use of FEGS for interesting lightning physics applications. Here we present an up-to-date summary of the project and a description of its scientific applications.",

This relationship exists in varying extents throughout the global tropics. We focus on different regions and seasons to analyze the size and maturity spectra of electrified RPFs, not only in how these spectra are manifested in remotely sensed convective intensity proxies, but also in ERA-interim-derived environmental parameters.\nWe aim for a better answer to the question of what determines the degree of convective vigor sufficient for initiating lightning, and why this seems to vary in different meteorological regimes.",

It carries a novel radar altimeter allowing the satellite to monitor changes in highly complex terrain, such as smaller ice caps, glaciers and the marginal areas of the ice sheets.\nHere we present on the development and validation of an independent elevation retrieval processing chain and respective elevation changes based on ESA’s L1B data. Overall we find large improvement in both accuracy and precision over Greenland relative to ESA’s L2 product when comparing against both airborne data and crossover analysis. The seasonal component and spatial sampling of the surface elevation changes where also compared against ICESat derived changes from 2003-2009. The comparison showed good agreement between the to product on a local scale. However, a global sampling bias was detected in the seasonal signal due to the clustering of CryoSat-2 data in higher elevation areas.\nThe retrieval processing chain presented here does not correct for changes in surface scattering conditions and appears to be insensitive to the 2012 melt event (Nilsson et al., 2015). This in contrast to the elevation changes derived from ESA’s L2 elevation product, which where found to be sensitive to the effects of the melt event. The positive elevation bias created by the event introduced a discrepancy between the two products with a magnitude of roughly 90 km3/year. This difference can directly be attributed to the differences in retracking procedure pointing to the importance of the retracking of the radar waveforms for altimetric volume change studies.\nGreenland 2012 melt event effects on CryoSat-2 radar altimetry./ Nilsson, Johan; Vallelonga, Paul Travis; Simonsen, Sebastian Bjerregaard; Sørensen, Louise Sandberg; Forsberg, René; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe; Hirabayashi, Motohiro; Goto-Azuma, Kumiko; Hvidberg, Christine S.; Kjær, Helle A.; Satow, Kazuhide.\nIn: Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 42, 2015, p. 3919-3926.",

While theories of land-atmosphere interaction across a range of space and time scales are well-developed, the capacity to verify them in nature, and thus to confront weather and climate models regarding the fidelity of their representations of coupled processes, has been lacking. Recently, observations of land surface states, surface fluxes, and co-located meteorological data have been growing rapidly, and as time passes the lengths of the time series grow to make the data sets ever more useful. This is allowing the development of a range of metrics to assess land-climate feedbacks in nature and models.

It provides a “datacube-oriented” framework responsible for atomically processing and manipulating scientific datasets, by providing a common way to run distributive tasks on large set of data fragments (chunks).\nOphidia provides declarative, server-side, and parallel data analysis, jointly with an internal storage model able to efficiently deal with multidimensional data and a hierarchical data organization to manage large data volumes. The project relies on a strong background on high performance database management and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems to manage large scientific datasets.\nThe Ophidia analytics platform provides several data operators to manipulate datacubes (about 50), and array-based primitives (more than 100) to perform data analysis on large scientific data arrays. To address interoperability, Ophidia provides multiple server interfaces (e.g. OGC-WPS). From a client standpoint, a Python interface enables the exploitation of the framework into Python-based eco-systems/applications (e.g. IPython) and the straightforward adoption of a strong set of related libraries (e.g. SciPy, NumPy).\nThe talk will highlight a key feature of the Ophidia framework stack: the “Analytics Workflow Management System” (AWfMS). The Ophidia AWfMS coordinates, orchestrates, optimises and monitors the execution of multiple scientific data analytics and visualization tasks, thus supporting “complex analytics experiments”.\nSome real use cases related to the CMIP5 experiment will be discussed. In particular, with regard to the “Climate models intercomparison data analysis” case study proposed in the EU H2020 INDIGO-DataCloud project, workflows related to (i) anomalies, (ii) trend, and (iii) climate change signal analysis will be presented. Such workflows will be distributed across multiple sites - according to the datasets distribution - and will include intercomparison, ensemble, and outlier analysis. The two-level workflow solution envisioned in INDIGO (coarse grain for distributed tasks orchestration, and fine grain, at the level of a single data analytics cluster instance) will be presented and discussed.",

Although many atmospheric and oceanic processes have been proposed as drivers for these differing regional trends (e.g. atmospheric temperature or wind stress changes due to stratospheric ozone loss or increases in the Southern Annular mode; ocean circulation responses to land-based ice sheet melting; or ocean-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks), explanations remain uncertain.\nGlobal climate models have been unable to explain observed increases in Antarctic Sea Ice extent. In contrast to the observations, nearly all of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations show decreasing trends in Antarctic sea ice extent over the late 20th century. Analysis of regional ice area trends reveals that discrepancies between observed and modeled trends in ice extent are largest and most consistent (between models) in the Ross Sea area during austral fall – a region and season of large observed increases in sea ice. A consideration of pre-industrial control simulations and large ensembles of 20th century runs suggests that this discrepancy cannot be explained by internal variability. We use output from the CMIP5 models as well as several variations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to explore possible reasons for this consistently large discrepancy between observed and modeled Antarctic Sea Ice extent trends.",

            "abstract": "Why is the Sun No Longer Accelerating Particles to High Energy in Solar Cycle 24?\nMeasurements by ACE, STEREO, and GOES show that the number of large Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events in solar cycle 24 is reduced by a factor of ~2 compared to this point of solar cycle 23, while the fluences of >10 MeV/nuc ions from H to Fe are reduced by factors ranging from ~4 to ~10. Compared to solar Cycle 22 and 23, the fluence of >100 MeV protons is reduced by factors of ~7 to ~10 in the current cycle. A common element of these observations is that the observed Cycle-24 energy spectra have \"breaks\" that suddenly steepen 2 to 4 times lower in energy/nucleon than in Cycle 23. We investigate the origin of these cycle-to-cycle spectral differences by evaluating possible factors that control the maximum energy of CME-shock-accelerated particles in the two cycles, including seed-particle densities of suprathermal ions, the interplanetary magnetic field strength and turbulence level, and properties of the associated CMEs. The effect of these conditions will be evaluated in the context of existing SEP acceleration models by comparing SEP data with simulations and with analytic evaluations of the maximum kinetic energy to which CME shocks can accelerate solar energetic ions from H to Fe. Understanding the properties that control the maximum kinetic energy of CME-shock accelerated particles has important implications for predicting future solar activity.",

This task has been accomplished by a dedicated group of scientist and engineers working in close collaboration with the NOAA Satellite and Information Services (NESDIS) Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) science teams for the JPSS/Suomi-NPOES Preparatory Project (S-NPP) Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) instruments.\nThe presentation purpose is to describe the JPSS project process for algorithm implementation from the very early delivering stages by the science teams to the full operationalization into the Interface Processing Segment (IDPS), the processing system that provides Environmental Data Records (EDR’s) to NOAA. Special focus is given to the NASA Data Products Engineering and Services (DPES) Algorithm Integration Team (AIT) functional and regression test activities. In the functional testing phase, the AIT uses one or a few specific chunks of data (granules) selected by the NOAA STAR Calibration and Validation (cal/val) Teams to demonstrate that a small change in the code performs properly and does not disrupt the rest of the algorithm chain. In the regression testing phase, the modified code is placed into to the Government Resources for Algorithm Verification, Integration, Test and Evaluation (GRAVITE) Algorithm Development Area (ADA), a simulated and smaller version of the operational IDPS. Baseline files are swapped out, not edited and the whole code package runs in one full orbit of Science Data Records (SDR’s) using Calibration Look Up Tables (Cal LUT’s) for the time of the orbit. The purpose of the regression test is to identify unintended outcomes.\nOverall the presentation provides a general and easy to follow overview of the JPSS Algorithm Change Process (ACP) and is intended to facility the audience understanding of a very extensive and complex process.",

South eastern forests occupy 60% of the land area, with a large fraction dominated by the genus Pinus distributed in almost equal proportions of naturally-regenerated and planted stands. These stands often differ in structure (e.g., stem density, leaf area index (LAI)) and in the intensity with which they are managed (e.g. naturally-regenerated, older pine stands are often managed less intensively, with prescribed fire). We measured C fluxes using the eddy covariance approach (net ecosystem production, -NEP) in planted (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii) and naturally-regenerated mixed stand of long leaf (Pinus palustris Mill) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii) accompanied by biometric estimations of C balance. Measurements spanned more than a decade and included interannual climatic variability ranging from severe droughts (e.g. Palmer Drought severity index (PDSI) averaged -2.7 from January 2000 to May 2002, and -3.3 from June 2006 to April 2008), to years with tropical storms. Annual NEP for the older, naturally-regenerated stand fluctuated from -1.60 to -5.38 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 with an average of -2.73 ± 1.17 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 while in plantations after canopy closure NEP fluctuated from -4.0 to -8.2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 with an average of -6.17 ± 1.34 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Annual NEP in naturally-regenerated pine was mainly driven by a combination of water availability and understory burning while in plantations it was driven by water availability after canopy closure. Woody and above ground net primary productivity (NPP) followed gross ecosystem carbon exchange (GEE) in both ecosystems. Naturally-regenerated and planted pine are a strong carbon sink under the current management and environmental fluctuations accumulating 28 and 130 Mg C ha-1 in a decade, respectively, and are among the most productive forests in the world.",

            "abstract": "Advances in water resources modeling are improving the information that can be supplied to support decisions affecting the safety and sustainability of society. However, as water resources models become more sophisticated and data-intensive they require more computational power to run. Purchasing and maintaining the computing facilities needed to support certain modeling tasks has been cost-prohibitive for many organizations. With the advent of the cloud, the computing resources needed to address this challenge are now available and cost-effective, yet there still remains a significant technical barrier to leverage these resources. This barrier inhibits many decision makers and even trained engineers from taking advantage of the best science and tools available. Here we present the Python tools TethysCluster and CondorPy, that have been developed to lower the barrier to model computation in the cloud by providing (1) programmatic access to dynamically scalable computing resources, (2) a batch scheduling system to queue and dispatch the jobs to the computing resources, (3) data management for job inputs and outputs, and (4) the ability to dynamically create, submit, and monitor computing jobs. These Python tools leverage the open source, computing-resource management, and job management software, HTCondor, to offer a flexible and scalable distributed-computing environment. While TethysCluster and CondorPy can be used independently to provision computing resources and perform large modeling tasks, they have also been integrated into Tethys Platform, a development platform for water resources web apps, to enable computing support for modeling workflows and decision-support systems deployed as web apps.",

Measurements have observed CFC-112 (CFCl2CFCl2), CFC-112a (CF2ClCCl3), and CFC-113a (CCl3CF3) in the atmosphere (Laube et al., 2014). The current atmospheric abundances of CFC-112 and CFC-112a are ~0.4 and ~0.06 ppt, respectively, with decreasing abundance since 1995. In contrast, CFC-113a was found to show continuous growth over the past 50 years with a current atmospheric abundance of ~0.5 ppt.\nThe major atmospheric removal process for these compounds is expected to be UV photolysis in the stratosphere. To date there is, however, no UV absorption spectra for these compounds available in the literature. To better determine the atmospheric lifetimes and environmental impact of these CFCs, laboratory measurements of the UV absorption spectra of CFC-112, CFC-112a, CFC-113a, and CFC-114a (Cl2FCF3) between 195 and 235 nm and over the temperature range 207 to 323 K were performed. Spectrum parametrizations were developed for use in atmospheric models. Atmospheric lifetimes and ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) were calculated using the Goddard Space Flight Center 2-D atmospheric chemistry model. Infrared absorption spectra of these compounds were also measured and used to calculate their global warming potentials. The results of the laboratory measurements and model calculations will be presented.\nJ. C.

            "abstract": "Vegetation plays a key role on the distribution and regulation of the water budget in multiple spatial and temporal scales. These regulation properties occur as a consequence of vegetation-mediated ecohydrological processes that result in the modification of hydrological fluxes that define water budgets in basins, ranging in size from squared meters to millions of squared kilometers. Important empirical and theoretical advances in the field of Ecohydrology have developed a robust theoretical framework to explain these interactions, particularly at local to regional scales. However, recent hypotheses have suggested that the presence of widespread-continuous forests, such as those occurring in tropical South America, plays a more active role in the regional climate, and particularly in the transport of atmospheric moisture from the ocean, eventually becoming precipitation over the continental masses. This condition, associated with the regulating role of natural vegetation on surface water balance and ecohydrological processes, produces ecohydrological and ecoclimatological effects that have important regional and potentially global implications. In this work we present preliminary observations on the relationship between the presence of widespread continouos forests in tropical South-America and the characteristics of precipitation regimes along atmospheric moisture transport pathways, through the combined use of multiple hydroclimatological and vegetation cover datasets. Further, we develop a corresponding analysis of the relationship between the forest cover and streamflow dynamics in tropical basins, using the scaling theory framework. Our preliminary observations highlight a distinguishable differentiation in precipitation regimes in atmospheric moisture pathways in forested vs. non-forested areas. Additionally, the regulating effect of tropical forests is also highlighted by differences in rainfall-runoff relationships and hydrological scaling properties of basins with different amounts of natural forest cover. Overall, our preliminary results highlight a large-scale effect of forest cover in ecoclimatological processes that determine key ecohydrological properties of tropical ecosystems.",

In the late summer of 2014, visible near infrared/shortwave infrared imagery was acquired over the Santa Barbara, CA, urban area by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) (18 m resolution, 224 bands, 0.35 - 2.5 µm) and AVIRIS-Next Generation (4 m resolution, 432 bands, 0.35 - 2.5 µm). We developed spectral libraries of urban image endmembers at both 4 m and 18 m, and then applied them to the 18 m imagery using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to produce a classified map and sub-pixel fractions of impervious ground surfaces, roofs, irrigated grass, trees, senesced vegetation, and soil. Final products were validated using 1m resolution aerial imagery.\nSub-pixel fraction results show that broad, ecologically important classes were assessed at a relatively high degree of accuracy. These classes include modeled green vegetation and impervious surface fractions (r2 > 0.85) and a combined senesced vegetation and soil (r2 > 0.70). Sub-classes of vegetation (trees, irrigated grass, and senesced vegetation) were also detectable, indicating the possibility for refined inputs for future urban ecological studies. MESMA results showed that the majority (> 85%) of the 18 m scale image was mapped with one or two endmembers (plus shade). Furthermore, endmembers extracted from higher spatial resolution imagery (4 m) did not yield a detectable increase in sub-pixel accuracy. Overall, these results indicate that the 18 m spatial resolution imagery was adequate to capture these broad urban classes at the sub-pixel level.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of in-stream processes to nitrogen (N) exports remains unclear because stream water chemistry integrates biogeochemical processes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales within upland, riparian and aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring nutrient concentrations at fine-scale temporal resolution can provide insights on in-stream N processing. Yet, the mechanisms underlying fine-scale temporal nutrient dynamics and their implications for flux budgets at catchment scale are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated patterns and controls of diel variation in stream nitrate (NO3-) concentration and the influence of these on N fluxes along a stream continuum with increasing riparian area and channel width. We tested two alternative hypotheses: that diel variation in stream NO3- concentration is driven (a) by stream metabolism, or (b) by riparian groundwater inputs.\nAlthough productivity in this stream was extremely low, patterns of diel variation in stream NO3- concentration emerged in early-spring and they were highly correlated with the daily regime of irradiance and gross primary production (GPP). In addition, diel NO3- patterns agreed with those predicted from GPP and biofilm C:N ratios, but not with diel variations predicted from changes in riparian groundwater inputs. These results point at in-stream photoautotrophic N uptake as the most likely driver of diel fluctuations in stream NO3- concentration. From a network perspective, the occurrence of diel variations in stream NO3- concentration, and thus their influence on stream N fluxes, increased along the stream continuum likely because of increases in light inputs and water temperature. This study evidences that monitoring of nutrient concentrations at fine-scale temporal resolution can provide mechanistic explanations about the relevance of in-stream and terrestrial processes on regulating stream N dynamics and their contribution to N export at catchment scale.",

We define the occurance of a heat wave as a period of 3 (or more) consecutive days with daily maximum temperature above a threshold, and the intensity of the heat wave is the accumulated daily maximum temperatures over its duration. We calculated the two metrics for the period 1950-2099 over US for all models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). We also test two different approaches to estimate the ensemble means of the heat wave metrics. The first approach calculates the numbers and intensity of heat waves for each individual model and then calculated the ensemble mean over 21 models of these two metrics, while the second approach first calculates the ensemble mean of the maximum temperatures over 21 different models and then estimates the annually heat wave numbers and heat wave intensity. The two approaches lead to remarkably different results: The results from the first method detect significant increasing trend of annually heat wave frequency and intensity in each individual GCMs. The mean durations of the heat waves are also found to be steadly increasing during the rest of the 21st century. The results from the second method show less-significant increasing trend of annually heat wave numbers. However the intensity of heat waves in the second approach is much larger than that calculated from the first way. These results confirms our hypothesis that both the occurance and the intensity of heat waves will increase in the future. They also emphasize that caution must be taken in processing high-frequency (daily or above) climate data in order to provide consistent and coherent assessments of future changes of climate extremes.",

We use a fully coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) that includes the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW), Parallel Ocean Program (POP), Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE5), and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model coupled with the NCAR CESM CPL7 coupler. RASM simulates a pan-Arctic domain with a 50-km horizontal atmospheric resolution. The simulation uses atmospheric boundary conditions provided by the NCAR CCSM4. Additionally, part of the ocean domain also uses as boundary conditions daily values of SST and SSS from the NCAR CCSM4. Previous results suggest that as sea-ice cover wanes there is a tendency for increased persistent 1-regime (as opposed to 2-regime) behavior in Arctic atmospheric circulation. Using RASM, we extend the analysis to understand the development of persistent dynamical regimes in the 21st Century. Results from a multi-decadal simulation using RASM will be presented and will focus on the susceptibility of present and future persistent dynamical circulation regimes to producing temperature extremes. Results suggest that identification of when persistent 1- and 2-regime behavior occurs is useful for ascertaining the future of the Arctic temperature extremes.",

We corrected the rainfall frequency bias of the GCM by truncating its daily rainfall cumulative distribution into the station's distribution using a wet-day threshold. Then, we corrected the GCM’s rainfall intensity bias by mapping its truncated rainfall distribution into the station's truncated distribution. Additional tailoring was made to the bias corrected GCM rainfall by linking it with a stochastic disaggregation scheme based on a conditional stochastic weather generator to correct the temporal structure inherent with daily GCM rainfall. Results of the simple and hybridized GCM downscaled precipitation variables (total, probability of occurrence, intensity and dry spell length) were linked with a crop model. An objective evaluation of the tailored GCM data was done using entropy. This study is useful for the identification of the most suitable downscaling technique, as well as the most effective precipitation variables for forecasting crop yields.",

Ship-following large-eddy simulations (LES) of selected cruise legs of 4-5 days are compared with a broad suite of observations of cloud structure and radiative properties taken on the Horizon Spirit ship. This quantitative comparison across a realistic range of conditions assesses the suitability of LES for simulating the sensitivity of such cloud regimes to climate perturbations, and for guiding the development of cloud and boundary layer parameterizations in global climate and weather forecast models.\nThe System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) LES is used with a small, doubly-periodic domain and variable vertical resolution, initialized using thermodynamic radiosonde profiles near the start of each cruise leg. Sea-surface temperatures are prescribed from observations, and ECMWF analyses are used to derive time-varying geostrophic wind, ship-relative large-scale advective forcing, and large-scale vertical velocity. ECMWF vertical velocities are adjusted to keep the temperature profile close to radiosonde profiles with a relaxation timescale of 1 day. The ship-measured accumulation-mode aerosol concentration is assumed throughout the boundary layer for nucleation of cloud droplets.\nThe ship-following approach allows efficient comparison of model output with a broad suite of ship-based observations. The simulations cannot be expected to match the observations on timescales less than three hours because of cloud-scale and mesoscale sampling variability. Nevertheless, a preliminary sample of eleven 2D runs of different legs predicts daily mean cloud fraction and surface longwave radiation with negligible systematic bias and correlation coefficients of 0.33 and 0.53, respectively. Full-leg 3D simulations will also be evaluated and presented.",

These expressions give a simple equation for the radius of a cold pool when it terminates by ceasing to be cold. The terminal radius of a cold pool is relatively insensitive to its initial conditions, with a typical maximum radius of about 14 times the initial radius, give or take a factor of two. The terminal time of a cold pool, on the other hand, can vary over orders of magnitude depending on its initial potential and kinetic energy.

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015 Soot Poster .pdf\nAccurate, as compared to precise, measurement of aerosol absorption has always posed a significant problem for the particle radiative properties community. Filter-based instruments do not actually measure absorption but rather light transmission through the filter; absorption must be derived from this data using multiple corrections. The potential for matrix-induced effects is also great for organic-laden aerosols. The introduction of true in situ measurement instruments using photoacoustic or photothermal interferometric techniques represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art. However, measurement artifacts caused by changes in humidity still represent a significant hurdle as does the lack of a good calibration standard at most measurement wavelengths. And, in the absence of any particle-based absorption standard, there is no way to demonstrate any real level of accuracy.\nWe, along with others, have proposed that under the circumstance of low single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption is best determined by difference using measurement of total extinction and scattering. We discuss a robust, compact, field deployable instrument (the CAPS PMssa) that simultaneously measures airborne particle light extinction and scattering coefficients and thus the single scattering albedo (SSA) on the same sample volume. The extinction measurement is based on cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) techniques as employed in the CAPS PMex particle extinction monitor; scattering is measured using integrating nephelometry by incorporating a Lambertian integrating sphere within the sample cell. The scattering measurement is calibrated using the extinction measurement of non-absorbing particles. For small particles and low SSA, absorption can be measured with an accuracy of 6-8% at absorption levels as low as a few Mm-1.\nWe present new results of the measurement of the mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of soot generated by an inverted methane diffusion flame at 630 nm. A value of 6.60 ±0.2 m2 g-1 was determined where the uncertainty refers to the precision of the measurement. The overall accuracy of the measurement, traceable to the properties of polystyrene latex particles, is estimated to be better than ±10%.",

This work describes a tool and method that allows end users to easily browse and access cloud information that is otherwise difficult to acquire and manipulate. The core of the tool is an application-programming interface that is made available to the public. One goal of the tool is to provide a demonstration to end users so that they can use the dynamically generated imagery as an input into their own work flows for both image generation and cloud product requisition.\nThis project builds upon NASA Langley Cloud and Radiation Group’s experience with making real-time and historical satellite cloud product imagery accessible and easily searchable. As we see the increasing use of virtual supply chains that provide additional value at each link there is value in making satellite derived cloud product information available through a simple access method as well as allowing users to browse and view that imagery as they need rather than in a manner most convenient for the data provider.\nUsing the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Web Processing Service as our access method, we describe a system that uses a hybrid local and cloud based parallel processing system that can return both satellite imagery and cloud product imagery as well as the binary data used to generate them in multiple formats. The images and cloud products are sourced from multiple satellites and also “merged” datasets created by temporally and spatially matching satellite sensors. Finally, the tool and API allow users to access information that spans the time ranges that our group has information available. In the case of satellite imagery, the temporal range can span the entire lifetime of the sensor.",

            "abstract": "Spatial and temporal distribution of paleo Colorado River (CR) deposits form a primary dataset to better understand the evolution of a continental-scale river system and quantify regional uplift. We focus on the elevations of Bouse Formation, Bullhead Alluvium, and Chemehuevi Formation outcrops in the lower CR corridor taken from published maps and ongoing regional mapping efforts and the elevations of published and newly dated strath and fill terraces in Grand Canyon (GC). Our premise is that paleoprofile reconstruction can reveal overall incision magnitude, change in incision rates through time and space, fault dampened incision, and regional tilting due to differential epeirogenic uplift. Paleoprofile geometries were determined by projecting the elevation of dated CR deposits and bedrock straths onto a longitudinal valley profile using a semi-automated GIS routine. Base and top of deposits provide information about net bedrock incision and aggradation magnitude, respectively. In the lower CR corridor, the base of the ca. 4 Ma Bullhead Alluvium is subparallel to the modern CR, where not locally subsided, and projects to near sea level indicating little bedrock incision or surface uplift since 4 Ma. In GC paleoprofiles older than ca. 100 ka are above modern river level due to prolonged bedrock incision. Incision rates in western GC of ~100 m/Ma and 160 m/Ma in eastern GC necessitate ~400 m of differential block uplift across faults in the Lake Mead area and an additional ~240 m of epeirogenic mantle-driven surface uplift in eastern GC. Bedrock incision is locally dampened by fault-related folding associated with the Hurricane and Toroweap faults, but there is little regional uplift across these structures. Ongoing efforts focus on detailed geologic mapping and improved geochronology of defined paleoprofile segments to test depositional models for the Bouse, post-Bouse / pre-Bullhead uplift models, and further constrain differential uplift rates.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of the chromosphere is due to various regime changes that take place across it. Consequently, the interpretation of chromospheric observations is a challenging task. It is thus crucial to combine these observations with advanced radiative-MHD numerical modeling. Because the photosphere, chromosphere and transition region are partially ionized, the interaction between ionized and neutral particles has important consequences on the magneto-thermodynamics of these regions. We implemented the effects of partial ionization using generalized Ohm’s law in the Bifrost code (Gudiksen et al. 2011) which solves the full MHD equations with non-grey and non-LTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. We perform 2.5D simulations which combines large and small scales structures. This leads to a highly dynamic chromosphere with large variety of physical processes which have not been reproduced with smaller simulations. The implementation of partial ionization effects impact our modeled radiative-MHD atmosphere, such as producing chromospheric heating and diffusion of photospheric magnetic field into the upper-chromosphere. We will also focus on which observables of these processes can be revealed with chromospheric observations.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Land Use Poster for 2015 AGU2.pdf\nThe fact that climate change is likely to accelerate throughout this century means that climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture will need to adapt increasingly to climate change. This fact also means that understanding the potential for agricultural adaptation, and how it could come about, is important for ongoing technology investments in the public and private sectors, for infrastructure investments, and for the various policies that address agriculture directly or indirectly. This paper is an interdisciplinary study by collaborating with climate scientist, agronomists, economists, and ecologists. We first use statistical models to estimate impacts of climate change on major crop yields (wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, and cotton) and predict changes in crop yields under future climate condition using downscaled climate projections from CMIP5. Then, we feed the predicted yield changes to a partial equilibrium economic model (FASOM-GHG) to evaluate economic and environmental outcomes including changes in land uses (i.e., cropland, pastureland, forest land, urban land and land for conservation) in United States. Finally, we use outputs from FASOM-GHG as inputs for the ST-SIM ecological model to simulate future carbon dynamics through changes in land use under future climate conditions and discuss the rate of adaptation through land-use changes. Findings in this paper have several merits compared to previous findings in the literature. First, we add economic components to the carbon calculation. It is important to include socio-economic conditions when calculating carbon emission and/or carbon sequestration because human activities are the major contribution to atmosphere GHG emissions. Second, we use the most recent downscaled climate projections from CMIP5 to capture uncertainties from climate model projections. Instead of using all GCMs, we select five GCMs to represent the ensemble. Third, we use a bottom-up approach because we start from micro-level data (e.g., counties in the United States) and aggregate to states or eco-logical regions. Alternative approach used in previous literature is the top-down approach, which depends on global economic model projections and downscaling methods. Compared to the top-down approach, our approach is more realistic by using observed data.",

We examine the possibility of convective overturn in surface layers of nitrogen and other “supervolatile” ices on Pluto, based on the best available rheologies. The characteristics of such convection may differ from those observed or expected on the terrestrial planets and icy satellites. We will discuss whether these characteristics possess any explanatory power for Pluto.",

            "abstract": "Nanometals have received significant attention in recent years due to their ability to rapidly destroy numerous priority source zone contaminants in controlled laboratory studies. This has led to great optimism surrounding nanometal particle injection for insitu remediation. Reported dechlorination rates vary widely among different investigators. These differences have been ascribed to differences in the iron types (granular, micro, or nano-sized iron), matrix solution chemistry and the morphology of the nZVI surface. Among these, the effects of solution chemistry on rates of reductive dechlorination of various chlorinated compounds have been investigated in several short-term laboratory studies. Variables investigated include the effect of anions or groundwater solutes such as SO4-2, Cl-, NO3-, pH, natural organic matters (NOM), surfactant, and humic acid on dechlorination reaction of various chlorinated compounds such as TCE, carbon tetrachloride (CT), and chloroform (CF). These studies have normally centered on the assessment of nZVI reactivity toward dechlorination of an isolated individual contaminant spiked into a ground water sample under ideal conditions, with limited work conducted using real field samples. In this work, the DNAPL used for the dechlorination study was obtained from a contaminatied site. This approach was selected to adequately simulate a condition where the nZVI suspension was in direct contact with DNAPL and to isolate the dechlorination activity shown by the nZVI from the groundwater matrix effects. An ideal system “synthetic DNAPL” composed of a mixture of chlorinated compounds mimicking the composition of the actual DNAPL was also dechlorinated to evaluate the DNAPL “matrix effect” on NZVI dechlorination activity. This approach allowed us to evaluate the effect of the presence of different types of organic compounds (volatile fatty acids and humic acids) found in the actual DNAPL on nZVI dechlorination activity. This presentation will help provide insights into the degradation kinetics that can be expected in the field and help with field scale implementation of nZVI.",

            "abstract": "We investigated carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a steep, forested, headwater catchment in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon, USA. Water samples were collected monthly from the stream and a well network between July and December 2013 and again in March 2014. Samples collected from the well network showed that DOC concentrations decreased, and that DIC concentrations increased, with median travel time through the hyporheic zone on all sample dates. Further, the magnitude of the observed increase in DIC was approximately 10-times too large to be explained by metabolism of stream-source DOC. We examined two alternative explanations: 1) that different source waters – either groundwater rich in DIC or lateral inputs of soil water rich in labile DOC that was subsequently metabolized to DIC – mixed with stream water and thereby accounted for the high concentrations of DIC observed in the hyporheic zone, or 2) that changes in the concentrations of DOC and DIC were best explained by in-situ biogeochemical processing of buried particulate organic matter. End-member mixing analyses showed that neither groundwater nor lateral inputs of soil water influenced carbon chemistry within the hyporheic zone. The analyses could not rule out leaching from the overlying unsaturated riparian soils as a potential source of DOC, but the rate of input from this source would have to be much smaller than the rate at which DOC was metabolized in the hyporheic zone because concentrations of DOC in the hyporheic zone were always lower than in the stream. Overall, our results suggest that particulate organic carbon, perhaps augmented with DOC leached from the overlying soils, is the primary source of organic carbon to the hyporheic zone. Further, these measurements suggest that riparian zones supply, via hyporheic exchange, a disproportionately large fraction of carbon to headwater streams and may therefore play an outsized role in the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Given the importance of land in the climate system, we investigate the influence of land surface, in particular the variation in snow characteristics, on climate variability and extremes over North America using the fifth generation of Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). To this end, we carried out two CRCM5 simulations driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis, where snow is either prescribed (uncoupled) or evolves interactively (coupled) during the model integration. Results indicate a systematic influence of snow on the inter-annual variability of air and surface temperature throughout the winter and spring seasons. In the coupled simulations, where the snow depth and snow cover were allowed to evolve freely, the inter-annual variability of surface and near surface air temperatures were found to be larger. Comparison with the uncoupled simulation suggests that snow depth/cover variability accounts for about 70% of the total surface temperature variability over the northern Great Plains and Canadian Prairies for the winter and spring seasons. The snow-atmosphere coupling is stronger in spring than in winter, since in spring season both the albedo and the latent heat flux contribute to the variability in temperature. Snow is also found to modulate extreme temperature events such as the number of cold days over Prairies during weak La-Nina episodes. These results suggest that initializing forecast models with realistic snow condition could potentially help to improve seasonal/sub-seasonal prediction skill over these snow-atmosphere coupling hotspot regions.",

            "abstract": "A series of recent studies have shown that a model of the turbulent vertical velocity variance spectrum (Fvv) combined with a simplified cospectral budget can reproduce many macroscopic flow properties of turbulent wall-bounded flows, including various features of the mean-velocity profile (MVP), i.e., the “law of the wall”. While the theory reasonably models the MVP’s logarithmic layer, the modelled buffer layer displays insufficient curvature compared to measurements at moderate Reynolds number. The theory is re-examined here using a DNS dataset at moderate Reynolds number. Starting with several hypotheses for the cause of the ‘missing’ curvature, it is shown that it is mainly due to mismatches between (i) the modelled and DNS-observed pressure-strain terms in the cospectral budget and (ii) the DNS-observed Fvv and the idealized form used in the previous model. By replacing the current parameterization for the pressure-strain term with an expansive version that directly accounts for the presence of a wall, the modelled and DNS reported pressure-strain profiles match each other in the buffer and logarithmic layers. Forcing the new model with DNS-reported Fvv rather than the idealized form previously used reproduces the missing buffer layer curvature to high fidelity thereby confirming the “spectral link” between Fvv and the MVP. A major departure between the idealized Fvv previously employed and those reported from DNS is the invariance with distance from the wall of the cross-over scale to the inertial subrange in Fvv. This invariance is presumably due to the presence of streaks within the buffer region whose dimensions do not scale with distance from the wall. Comparisons between DNS reported and modeled cospectra are also discussed. A broad implication of this work is that much of the macroscopic properties of the flow (such as the MVP) may be derived from the energy distribution in turbulent eddies (i.e., Fvv) representing the microstates of the flow.",

World Bank (2005) data indicate that seventeen of the top thirty-five countries with relatively high mortality risk from 3 or more hazards are located in LAC, El Salvador has the second highest per cent of its population at risk - 77.7% and 7 of the top 10 countries for population exposure to multiple hazards are in LAC. All LAC countries have half or more of GDP exposed to at least one hazard. The report underscores the need for better data and information on hazards and disasters to inform disaster risk reduction (DRR) and supports the view that reduction of disaster risk is essential for achieving Sustainable Development (SD). This suggests that DRR must be integrated into development planning of countries. However the Global Assessment Report notes that globally, there has been little progress in mainstreaming DRR in national development (UNISDR 2009). Without this, countries will not realise development goals.\nDRR efforts in LAC require an integrated approach including societal input in deciding priority DRR research themes and interdisciplinary, multi-hazard research informing DRR policy and practice. Jiminez (2015) from a study of countries across LAC reports that efforts are being made to link research to national planning through inclusion of policy makers in some university-led research projects. Research by the author in Jamaica reveals that the public sector has started to apply research on hazards to inform DRR policy, programmes and plans. As most research is done by universities, there is collaboration between the public sector and academia.\nDespite differences in scale among countries across the region, similarities in exposure to multiple hazards and potential hazard impacts suggest that collaboration among researchers in LAC could be beneficial. It is proposed here that this collaboration should go beyond the scientific community and should include sharing of experiences in linking DRR research to national development needs, inclusion of policy makers in research design and implementation and integration of research results in policy and programme development.",

High vacancy areas have often been associated with increasing public safety problems and declining property values and subsequent tax base. High vacancy can lead to visible signs of city decline and significant barriers to the revitalization of cities. Addressing the problem of vacancy requires knowledge of vacancy patterns and their possible contributing factors. In this study, we evaluated the ten year (2005-2015) urban environmental changes for some high vacancy areas. Social and economic variables derived from U.S. census data such as non-white population, employment rate, housing price, and environmental variables derived from National Land Cover Data such as land cover and impervious area, were used as the basis for analysis. Correlation analysis and principle components analysis were performed at the Census Block Group level. Three components were identified and interpreted as economic status, urbanness, and greenness. A synthetic Urban Environmental Quality (UEQ) index was developed by integrating the three principle components according to their weights. Comparisons of the UEQ indices between the 2005 and 2015 in the increasingly high vacancy area provided useful information for investigating the possible associations between social, economic, and environmental factors, and the vacancy status. This study could provide useful information for understanding the complex issues leading to vacancy and facilitating future rehabilitation of vacant urban area.",

            "abstract": "During geomagnetic storms a large volume of ions are transported from the magnetotail deep into the inner magnetosphere leading to ion acceleration to the energies of tens to hundreds keV. Energized ions become the dominant source of plasma pressure in the inner magnetosphere. Hot plasma pressure drives large electrical currents which determine global electrodynamics and coupling of the inner magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Recent analysis of ion measurements from the RBSPICE experiment of the Van Allen Probes mission showed that the buildup of plasma pressure in the inner magnetosphere largely occurs in the form of localized discrete injections similar to dipolarization fronts observed in the magnetotail. Previous studies proposed several mechanisms that can rapidly accelerate protons to ~100 keV at injection fronts in the magnetotail including betatron-line acceleration, reflection and the synchrotron effect. None of these mechanisms, however, can operate in the inner magnetosphere where the ambient magnetic field is much higher and the propagation speeds of injection fronts are much lower. In this paper we discuss a new mechanism of stable proton trapping and acceleration inherent to the inner magnetosphere that can rapidly energize particles to >200 keV.",

            "abstract": "Climate services offer information and tools to help stakeholders anticipate and/or manage risks posed by climate change. However, climate services lack a cohesive ethical framework to govern their development and application. This paper describes a prototype, open-ended process to form a set of ethical principles to ensure that climate services are effectively deployed to manage climate risks, realize opportunities, and advance human security.\nWe begin by acknowledging the multiplicity of competing interests and motivations across individuals and institutions. Growing awareness of potential climate impacts has raised interest and investments in climate services and led to the entrance of new providers. User demand for climate services is also rising, as are calls for new types of services. Meanwhile, there is growing pressure from funders to operationalize climate research.\nOur proposed ethical framework applies reference points founded on diverse experiences in western and developing countries, fundamental and applied climate research, different sectors, gender, and professional practice (academia, private sector, government). We assert that climate service providers should be accountable for both their practices and products by upholding values of integrity, transparency, humility, and collaboration.\nPrinciples of practice include: communicating all value judgements; eschewing climate change as a singular threat; engaging in the co-exploration of knowledge; establishing mechanisms for monitoring/evaluating procedures and products; declaring any conflicts of interest. Examples of principles of products include: clear and defensible provenance of information; descriptions of the extent and character of uncertainties using terms that are meaningful to intended users;  tools and information that are tailored to the context of the user; and thorough documentation of methods and meta-data.\nWe invite the community to test and refine these points.",

There is substantial variation in the methods used in these assessments; however, managers and decision-makers have come to value their utility to identify future system limitations, and to evaluate future alternatives to ensure satisfactory system performance. A new set of decision-making frameworks have been proposed, including robust decision making (RDM), and decision scaling, that directly address the deep uncertainties found in both future climate, and non-climatic factors. Promising results have been obtained using these new frameworks, offering a more comprehensive understanding of future conditions leading to failures, and identification of measures to address these failures. Data and resource constraints have limited the use of these frameworks within the Bureau of Reclamation. We present here a modified framework that captures the strengths of previously proposed methods while using a suite of analysis tool that allow for a ‘rapid climate assessment’ to be performed. A scalable approach has been taken where more complex tools can be used if project resources allow. This ‘rapid assessment’ is demonstrated through two case studies on the Santa Ana and Colorado Rivers where previous climate assessments have been completed. Planning-level measures are used to compare how decision making is affected when using this new decision making framework.",

Contrary to our expectations based on the model of this class of events as precipitation by electromagnetic cyclotron (EMIC) waves, we find no enhanced plasma density during these events using IMAGE/EUV, we find the peak in magnetic local time (MLT) shifted several hours from the peak of EMIC waves at geosynchronous orbit, and we find that the hardest precipitation events do not correlate with high solar wind proton density as EMIC waves do. We will present first results of a comparison of the hardest SAMPEX events with a data-driven model of EMIC wave occurrence. We will also discuss an alternate model for these hard events: current-sheet scattering (loss of the first adiabatic invariant at field inhomogeneities near midnight). The MLT distribution of the hard precipitation events already provides some circumstantial evidence for this model: as the e-folding energy softens from 700 keV to below 400 keV, the average MLT moves smoothly from about 20h to midnight (see Figure). This is consistent with a picture of electrons lost to current-sheet scattering, which would be expected to scatter the highest-energy electrons (with the largest cyclotron radii) first as the population drifts from dusk to midnight, where the inhomogeneities are thought to be most effective and can reach to lower energies.",

The transient response of river long profiles can be a powerful aid in unraveling sequences of tectonic perturbations associated with the inception and establishment of normal fault arrays. The Premygdonia-Mygdonia basin complex in continental northern Greece is an obliquely extending region of horst and graben topography that was established in the Pliocene and evolved in a complex manner to this day. It is the product of the setting of new tectonic boundary conditions in the north Aegean associated with the interaction of slab rollback-induced back-arc extension and the transtensional influence of the westward propagation of the North Anatolian fault zone. This study attempts to constrain the stages of development of the basin complex's fault bounded ranges by utilizing drainage network analysis, footwall relief distribution, and river long profiles that drain across the main faults of this significant area. The ubiquitous presence of two sets of knickpoints on all the major range fronts points to two significant tectonic perturbations associated with the inception of the basin complex area and its later modification. Footwall drainage patterns and the spatial scaling of the upper set of knickpoints point to discrete fault segments that accommodated the initial phase of deformation. The lower set of knickpoints is taken to signify either a phase of uplift and reworking of the initial hangingwall by basinward migration of faulting or fault linkage and establishment of a continuous fault array, depending on the orientation of the initial fault structures to the evolving stress regime. The relation of these tectonic perturbations to the regional geodynamic evolution of the broader north Aegean realm during the Plio-Quaternary is discussed.",

Improved signal to noise ratio and radiometric resolution of recent satellite imagery and fine scale 3-dimensional information from lidar provides opportunities for refined measurements of vegetation structure. We leverage a large number of Landsat 8 and lidar-based metrics for prediction of biomass and cover of shrubs in the semi-arid rangeland of the western United States. Time-series Landsat 8 images were used to develop 20 ratio based vegetation indices. Similarly, 35 vegetation metrics, including metrics based on numerical values (e.g. elevation, canopy height) and on density of points (e.g. canopy density) were developed from airborne lidar point clouds. These vegetation indices and metrics were trained and linked to insitu measurements (n=141) with the Random Forest regression to impute biomass and cover map across a large scale. We also validate our model with an independent data-set (n=44), explaining up to 63% of variation in cover and 53% in biomass. The preliminary results suggest that Landsat performs better in estimating vegetation cover whereas lidar performs better in estimating biomass with no significant relationship to topographic variables (e.g. slope, aspect and elevation). We further compare our results with historical fire data to show that both biomass and cover decreases with the increase of fire frequency in the study site. This study demonstrates the new opportunities of using Landsat 8 with established lidar approaches to better quantify vegetation in semiarid ecosystems.",

Mineral elasticity data also have more general applications towards understanding equations of state, phase equilibria, interatomic forces, material strength, and phase transitions. The singe-crystal elastic properties are the most generally useful as they provide complete information on the anisotropy of elastic moduli (e.g. Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus), sound velocities, and compressibility. Measurement of the full set of single-crystal elastic properties remains challenging especially for lower symmetry crystals. In this talk, I present an overview of our current understanding of single-crystal elasticity based on a newly constructed database of single-crystal elastic properties. At ambient conditions the full elastic tensor of about 150 minerals have now been measured, along with about another 60 related compounds that are not formally minerals. About two-thirds of the measured minerals are oxides or silicates. A limitation of the existing database is that only about 10% of the measurements are on crystals of monoclinic or triclinic symmetry, while these two systems account for about 40% of known minerals. Additionally, only a smaller subset of minerals have been examined at high pressure or temperature conditions. Several applications of the database will be presented emphasizing trends in elastic anisotropy. The pyroxenes will be used as an illustrative example.",

For parcels that are wide and/or near the surface, this back-reaction can produce an `effective buoyancy' quite different from the Archimedean one. We quantify these effects by computing exact analytical expressions for the effective buoyancy of idealized buoyant parcels at the surface and aloft. These results depend strongly on both aspect ratio as well as surface proximity, and in particular show that a surface parcel accelerates much slower than the same parcel aloft. We illustrate these effects with large-eddy simulations, and understand them using a view of buoyancy in which vertical accelerations are driven by horizontal hydrostatic pressure gradients, similar to how a chimney works. These analytical formulae may be useful in convective parameterizations, as well as for thinking about the “grey zone” of horizontal resolution in large-scale numerical models.",

Through collaboration with the research community, funding agencies, national and international science programs, and other stakeholders, SEARCH facilitates research activities across local-to-global scales, with increasing emphasis on addressing the information needs of policy and decision-makers. This talk will explore the program’s history, spanning its earliest efforts to understand interrelated atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial changes in the Arctic to more recent objectives of providing stakeholder-relevant information, such as community-wide summaries of the expected arctic summer sea ice minimum or up-to-date information on sea ice conditions to Alaska Native walrus hunters in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We will discuss SEARCH’s recent shift toward a “Knowledge to Action” vision and implementation of focused Action Teams to: (1) improve understanding, advance prediction, and explore consequences of changing arctic sea ice; (2) document and understand how degradation of near-surface permafrost will affect arctic and global systems; and (3) improve predictions of future land-ice loss and impacts on sea level. Tracking and evaluating how scientific information from such research reaches stakeholders and informs decisions are critical for interactions that allow the research community to keep pace with an evolving landscape of arctic decision-makers. Examples will be given for the new directions these Action Teams are taking regarding science communication and approaches for research community collaboration to synthesize research findings and promote arctic science and interdisciplinary scientific discovery.",

            "abstract": "As part of a wider hydro climatic modeling research, we studied the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and temperature over the Middle Tennessee Elk watershed and its environs using regional climate model simulations over the past 30 years. Three sets of simulations with the Hadley Center's regional climate model (PRECIS) were carried out for the present day climate (1980-2010) at a resolution of 25km covering the southeastern U.S. These three sets simulations are driven by lateral boundary conditions taken from ERA-Interim reanalysis, and two global climate models (HadCM3 and ECHAM5) respectively. For validation, high resolution observed daily data sets from North American Land-Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and Climate Research Unit, CRU data are used. Preliminary results show that the spatial distribution of the present-day seasonal mean rainfall and temperature, simulated by PRECIS, are not only consistent with NLDAS and CRU but also captured fine scale spatial structures that are missing in the global model simulations due to their coarse resolution. In addition, the annual cycle and intera-anual variability, particularly that of temperature, are reasonably well reproduced by the PRECIS. When comparing the PRECIS simulations with the driving GCMs, PRECIS is sensitive to the choice of the driving GCM, suggesting a careful selection of driving GCM based on the current climate performance for the use of future climate impact assessment. Quantitative understanding of the climate system and better estimation of the fresh water balance over the Middle Tennessee Elk watershed is a vital corner stone for a sustainable economic growth of the region over the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "It has been observed that vertically (SV) and horizontally (SH) polarised S waves crossing the lowermost mantle sometimes are split by a few seconds The splitting of such waves is often interpreted in terms of seismic anisotropy in the D” region. Here we investigate systematically the effects of elastic, anelastic, isotropic and anisotropic structure on shear-wave splitting, including 3-D variations in some of these physical properties. Taking advantage of accurate waveform modeling techniques such as Gemini and the Spectral Element Method we generate three-component theoretical waveforms in a wide set of 1-D and 3-D, isotropic and radially anisotropic earth models, accurate down to a wave period of T~5.6s. Our numerical simulations in isotropic earth models show that the contamination of S waves by other phases can generate an apparent splitting between SH and SV waves. In particular, in the case of very shallow sources, the sS phase can interfere with the direct S phase, resulting in split SH and SV pulses when the SH and SV (or sSH and sSV) waves have different polarity or a substantial amplitude difference. In the case of deep earthquake sources, a positive shear velocity jump at the top of the D” can cause the triplication of S waves and the ScSH and ScSV phases can have different polarity. Thus, when the triplicated S wave is combined with the ScS phase, the resulting SH-ScSH and SV-ScSV phases may seem split. On the other hand, in the absence of a sharp vertical variation in the shear wave velocity, the difference in polarity between ScSH and ScSV can make the SH pulse larger than SV and thus also lead to apparent splitting between these phases. This effect depends on the thickness of the D” and the Vs gradient within it. S waveforms simulated in radially anisotropic models reveal that a radial anisotropy of ξ=1.07 in the D” seems to be necessary to explain the 2-3s of splitting observed in waveforms recorded in Tanzania from an event in the Banda Sea. However, our analysis also shows that other factors such as sharp vertical variations at the top of D” and gradients of Vs and η within the D’’ may also affect the observed waveforms. This study suggests that caution should be taken when interpreting SH-SV splitting of deep mantle body waves exclusively in terms of anisotropy in the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Japan earthquakes took the community by surprise because they ruptured frontal sections of megathrust thought to slip aseismically. Studying the deformation of accretionary prisms can help in characterizing the specific structures associated to frontal propagation and determining the mechanical properties leading to this behavior. Recent observations suggest a correlation between landward faults and frontal propagation of earthquakes along the Sumatra subduction zone. Large sections of landward thrusts are also observed along Cascadia known to have ruptured in 1700 with a M~9 generating a large tsunami.\nIn this study, we propose to investigate if specific frictional properties could lead to a landward sequence of thrusting with the limit analysis approach. We first show that such sequence requires very low effective friction along the megathrust with a rather high internal effective friction. We also show that landward sequence appears close to the extensional critical limit. We retrieve the megathrust effective friction for three wedges with different sediment incomes. For Cascadia, we find a maximal effective friction of 0.032. For northern and southern Sumatra, we find μ≤0.02 and μ≤ 0.08 respectively. This very low effective friction is probably due to lithostatic pore pressure.\nThis high pore pressure could either be a long-term property or due to dynamic effects such as thermal pressurization. The fact that landward vergence appears far from the compressional critical limit favors a dynamic effect. Indeed, a wedge would move away from this limit if material is added synchronously to the deformation or if it is suddenly submitted to a lower effective friction. In addition, the long-term high pore pressure could be due to a low permeability enhancing thermal pressurization and co-seismic slip along the frontal part of the megathrust.",

Past model intercomparison studies used different models with different complexities of dynamic-microphysics interactions, making it hard to isolate the causes of differences between simulations. In this intercomparison study, we employed a much more constrained approach – with the same model and same experiment setups for simulations with different cloud microphysics schemes (one-moment, two-moment, and bin models). Both the piggybacking and interactive approaches are employed to explore the major microphysical processes that control the model differences and the significance of their feedback to dynamics through latent heating/cooling and cold pool characteristics.\nReal-case simulations are conducted for the squall line case 20 May 2011 from the MC3E field campaign. Results from the piggybacking approach show substantially different responses of the microphysics schemes to the same dynamical fields. Although the interactive microphysics-dynamics simulations buffer some differences compared with those from the piggyback runs, large differences still exist and are mainly contributed by ice microphysical processes parameterizations. The presentation will include in-depth analyses of the major microphysical processes for the squall line case, the significance of the feedback of the processes to dynamics, and how those results differ in different cloud microphysics schemes.",

Orographic forcing is a well-known source for these waves which can impact the stratosphere (Eckermann and Preusse, 1999), and even the mesosphere (Smith et al., 2009).\nDuring the months of June and July 2014, a large-scale project named DEEPWAVE took place in New Zealand. This international program focused on investigating the generation and deep propagation of atmospheric gravity waves, especially over the mountain range of the Southern Alps. A series of instruments was operated at several ground-based locations and on-board the NSF Gulfstream V aircraft. 25 nighttime research flights were performed to explore possible wave sources and their effects on the middle and upper atmosphere.\nOn 2 consecutive nights (29th and 30th June), research flights 12 and 13 were conducted over New Zealand South Island to compare the effects of 2 different wind forcing: strong during the first flight, then reduced on the following day. As the GV aircraft was repetitively flying over the Southern Alps, the mesospheric gravity wave field was measured using a series of newly developed instruments (Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper, IR side cameras and lidars). This presentation will investigate the differences between the gravity waves observed during these 2 flights and the impact of distinct orographic forcing on the upper atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Water is a key agent in Central Asia ultimately determining human well-being, food security, and economic development. There are complex interplays among the natural and anthropogenic drivers effecting the regional hydrological processes and water availability. Analysis of the data combined from regional censuses and remote sensing shows a decline in areas of arable and irrigated lands and a significant decrease in availability of arable and irrigated lands per capita across all Central Asian countries since the middle of 1990thas the result of post-Soviet transformation processes. This change could lead to considerable deterioration in food security and human system sustainability. The change of political situation in the region has also resulted in the escalated problems of water demand between countries in international river basins.\nWe applied the University of New Hampshire - Water Balance Model - Transport from Anthropogenic and Natural Systems (WBM-TrANS) to understand the consequences of changes in climate, water and land use on regional hydrological processes and water availability. The model accounts for sub-pixel land cover types, glacier and snow-pack accumulation/melt across sub-pixel elevation bands, anthropogenic water use (e.g. domestic and industrial consumption, and irrigation for most of existing crop types), hydro-infrastructure for inter-basin water transfer and reservoir/dam regulations. A suite of historical climate re-analysis and temporal extrapolation of MIRCA-2000 crop structure datasets has been used in WBM-TrANS for this project. A preliminary analysis of the model simulations over the last 30 years has shown significant spatial and temporal changes in hydrology and water availability for crops and human across the region due to climatic and anthropogenic causes. We found that regional water availability is mostly impacted by changes in extents and efficiency of crop filed irrigation, especially in highly arid areas of Central Asia, changes in winter snow storage, and shifts in seasonality and intensity of glacier melt waters driven by climatic changes.",

            "abstract": "The currently funded African Meridian B-Field Education and Research (AMBER) magnetometer array comprises more than thirteen magnetometers stationed globally in the vicinity of geomagnetic equator. One of the main objectives of AMBER network is to understand the longitudinal variability of equatorial electrodynamics as function of local time, magnetic activity, and season. While providing complete meridian observation in the region and filling the largest land-based gap in global magnetometer coverage, the AMBER array addresses two fundamental areas of space physics: first, the processes governing electrodynamics of the equatorial ionosphere as a function of latitude (or L-shell), local time, longitude, magnetic activity, and season, and second, ULF pulsation strength at low/mid-latitude regions and its connection with equatorial electrojet and density fluctuation. The global AMBER network can also be used to augment observations from space-based instruments, such us the triplet SWARM mission and the upcoming ICON missions. Thus, in coordination with space-based and other ground-based observations, the AMBER magnetometer network provides a great opportunity to understand the electrodynamics that governs equatorial ionosphere motions. In this paper we present the longitudinal variability of the equatorial electrodynamics using the combination of instruments onboard SWARM and C/NOFS satellites and ground-based AMBER network. Both ground- and pace-based observations show stronger dayside and evening sector equatorial electrodynamics in the American and Asian sectors compared to the African sector. On the other hand, the African sector is home to stronger and year-round ionospheric bubbles/irregularities compared to the American and Asian sectors. This raises the question if the evening sector equatorial electrodynamics (vertical drift), which is believed to be the main cause for the enhancement of Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability growth rate, is stronger in the American sector and weaker in the African sector – why are the occurrence and amplitude of equatorial irregularities stronger in the African sector?",

            "abstract": "Mount Veniaminof volcano is a >300 km3 andesite to dacite stratovolcano, characterized by an 8 x 11 km diameter ice-filled summit caldera. Veniaminof is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc and has erupted at least 15 times in the past 200 years. The volcano is located on the Alaska Peninsula (56.1979° N, 159.3931° W) about 780 km SW of Anchorage. Our geologic investigations have documented two large (>VEI 5) caldera-forming or -modifying eruptions (V1, V2) of Holocene age whose eruptive products make up most of the surficial deposits around the volcano. These deposits and other unconsolidated glacial, fluvial, and colluvial deposits are depicted on the accompanying map. The the V2 eruption occurred 4.1–4.4 ka (cal 2-sigma age range) and produced an extensive landscape-mantling sequence of pyroclastic deposits >50 km3 in volume that cover or partly obscure older unconsolidated eruptive products. The V1 eruption occurred 8–9 ka and its deposits lie stratigraphically below the pyroclastic deposits associated with the V2 eruption and a prominent, widespread tephra fall deposit erupted from nearby Black Peak volcano 4.4–4.6 ka. The V2 pyroclastic-flow deposits range from densely welded, columnar jointed units exposed along the main valley floors, to loose, unconsolidated, blanketing accumulations of scoriaceous (55–57% SiO2) and lithic material found as far as 75 km from the edifice. Large lahars also formed during the V2 eruption and flowed as far as 50 km from the volcano. The resulting deposits are present in all glacial valleys that head on the volcano and are 10–15 m thick in several locations. Lahar deposits cover an area of about 800–1000 km2, have an approximate volume of 1-2 km3, and record substantial inundation of the major valleys on all flanks of the edifice. Significant amounts of water are required to form lahars of this size, which suggests that an ice-filled summit caldera probably existed when the V2 eruption occurred.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur is one of the key volatiles that are less affected by degassing and may capture deeper magmatic processes and mantle source characteristics. S content of OIBs is controlled by S solubility of partial melts at sulfide saturation which depends on P, T, fO2 and melt composition (e.g., [1]), S content of the mantle, and fractional crystallization of primary basalts. In this study, we coupled mantle melting and basalt differentiation models with sulfur solubility models and compared our results with the S abundance data of OIBs. The goal was to compare and contrast the efficiency of S extraction from MORB and OIB sources by partial melting and put constraints on the S content of the mantle source.\nS contents in basalts from Loihi, Samoa, and Galapagos islands range from 800 to 2500 ppm with MgO from 11 to 4 wt.%. Modeling of S solubility change during isobaric fractional crystallization for basalts from these three islands with MELTS and an SCSS parameterization [1] showed that SCSS are distinctly higher than S concentration in the basalts at MgO>8wt.% (e.g., [2-3]). Assuming that there could be ≤20% S6+/SS present in the OIBs derived from a potentially more oxidized source [4], sulfide-undersaturated primitive melts with 700-900 ppm S are required to match the S concentration in the primitive OIBs. Derivation of sulfide undersaturated low-degree melts (Loihi: F=2-4%; [5]; Samoa: F=1-6%; [6]) from a mantle source with potential temperature (TP) of 1420 °C requires that the mantle source S content is ≤50 ppm. For Galapagos spreading center with F~10% [7], ≤100 ppm S is required in the mantle source. While low F constrains low S abundance in OIB mantle, more sulfide could be present in the MORB source (eg. 146±35 ppm S, [8]) owing to higher average extent of melting. The estimated S content for OIB sources above should be the lower bounds since TP in OIB mantle could be hotter and increasing TP increases SCSS significantly because of increased FeO* in the deeper partial melt.\n [1] Li and Ripley (2005), Miner.

            "abstract": "Due to its simple production and transport in the terrestrial environment, 81Kr (half-life = 230,000 yr) is the ideal tracer for old water and ice with mean residence times in the range of 105-106 years, a range beyond the reach of 14C. 81Kr-dating is now available to the earth science community at large thanks to the development of an efficient and selective atom counter based on the Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) method. ATTA is a laser-based atom counting method where individual neutral atoms of the desired isotope are selectively captured by laser beams, and their fluorescence detected via a CCD camera. ATTA is unique among trace analysis techniques in that it is free of interferences from any other isotopes, isobars, atomic or molecular species.\nThe ATTA instrument at Argonne’s Laboratory for Radiokrypton Dating is capable of measuring both 81Kr/Kr and 85Kr/Kr ratios of environmental samples in the range of 10-14-10-10. For 81Kr-dating in the age range of 150 kyr – 1500 kyr, the required sample size is 5 micro-L STP of krypton gas, which can be extracted from approximately 100 kg of water or 40 kg of ice. For 85Kr/Kr analysis, the sample size can be smaller by an order of magnitude. We are continually developing the method towards higher counting efficiency, smaller sample sizes requirements, and higher sample throughput rates. In the past four years, we have performed radiokrypton analysis of over 150 groundwater and ice samples extracted by collaborators from all seven continents. Sample collection and purification was performed by groups including the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Bern, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nThis work is supported by the U.S. DOE, Office of Nuclear Physics, under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.",

The data were categorized by placing each individual land area into one of six categories: low, average, or high productivity, and whether or not they were resilient or sensitive to biophysical and/or social production drivers. In order to mitigate productivity interference from forest and other land cover types, a custom agricultural land use was developed. Five land cover datasets, including FAO, GLC, IFPRI, GlobCover, and MODIS were combined to minimize errors of commission. Model assessment occurred via field work in Malawi. Approximately 200 sites were visited across nearly the entire extent of the country. Cropland and land cover were assessed via visual inspection, true color/near-infrared photography, and on-site interviews with farmers and extension officers to inquire about productivity and limiting factors for yield.

A new test is proposed to determine statistical significance of the probability density function based skill measures. Skill scores are found to be generally high for all three measures throughout the study region, but lower scores are present in coastal and mountainous areas. Application of the significance test shows that while the skill scores may be high they are not significantly higher than could be expected at random in some areas. The distribution-based skill scores are not significant in much of Florida and the Appalachians. The extreme-based skill scores are not significant in more than 90% of the region for all models investigated. The findings suggest that although the downscaled models have simulated observed means well and are a good match to the entire distribution of observations, they are not simulating the occurrence of extreme (above 90th percentile) maximum daily temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon containing soot particles are an important aerosol subclass owing to their light-absorbing properties. Furthermore, soot particles present challenges with regard to characterization and modeling of their microphysical, chemical, and optical properties, because of their inherent non-spherical, fractal morphology.\nAggregation/coagulation of soot adds to the complexity of the particle morphology, while co-emitted organic compounds affect the chemical composition both during emission and though aging, which causes partitioning of secondary organic aerosol. Measurements of soot particles from vehicular and jet engine exhaust plumes have shown that the effective density can vary over a broad range (0.3-1.8 gm-3) and is affected by the fuel burn characteristics (fuel type, fuel equivalence ratio, combustion temperature), the particle size, and the extent of the aggregation.\nThe action of organic coatings and the uptake of particle water, through hygroscopic growth, can cause a dramatic change in the morphology of soot. Restructuring of the fractal morphology into a more compact form has the effect of increasing the effective particle density, thus reducing the particle size, with important implications for the optical and hygroscopic properties.\nWe present measurements of size-resolved particle density from laboratory generated fresh soot particles, under a range of operating conditions. We first filter by particle mass using an aerosol particle mass (APM) centrifugal analyzer and then subject the sample to a pre-humidification cycle in order to initiate particle restructuring. Finally, the sample is dried and the mobility size distribution is measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). A range of particle masses is scanned to determine the density as a function of size and, for each mass set point, a range of relative humidity settings are scanned to determine the extent of restructuring. We discuss the findings in relation to atmospherically relevant aerosol, and preview the extension of the laboratory setup for field deployment.",

Unfortunately, strong motion records are limited spatially and temporally relative to the area and time windows hazard maps encompass. We develop a framework to test the predictive powers of PSHA maps that is flexible with respect to a map’s specified probability of exceedance and time window, and the strong motion receiver coverage. Using a combination of recorded and interpolated strong motion records produced through the ShakeMap environment, we compile a record of ground motion intensity measures for California from 2002-present. We use this information to perform an area-based test of California PSHA maps inspired by the work of Ward (1995). Though this framework is flexible in that it can be applied to seismically active areas where ShakeMap-like ground shaking interpolations have or can be produced, this testing procedure is limited by the relatively short lifetime of strong motion recordings and by the desire to only test with data collected after the development of the PSHA map under scrutiny. To account for this, we use the assumption that PSHA maps are time independent to adapt the testing procedure for periods of recorded data shorter than the lifetime of a map. We note that accuracy of this testing procedure will only improve as more data is collected, or as the time-horizon of interest is reduced, as has been proposed for maps of areas experiencing induced seismicity. We believe that this procedure can be used to determine whether PSHA maps are accurately portraying seismic hazard and whether discrepancies are localized or systemic.",

            "abstract": "We used geologic mapping applied to Dawn spacecraft data as a tool to understand the geologic history of the Ac-H-1 Asari quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres. The Dawn Framing Camera observed the quadrangle (north polar area: 66°N-90°N) from an altitude of 4424 km and a clear-filter mosaic was produced at a spatial resolution of 400 m/pixel. A stereo-photogrammetric digital elevation model was calculated from images acquired during a higher altitude resulting in a spatial resolution of 1.4 km/pixel. Key characteristics of the study area are (1) a high density of impact craters and (2) moderate topographic variations. We measured a crater density of 9.8E-04 (km-2) for crater diameters >10 km, the highest on Ceres. Few isolated topographic highs (plateaus), reaching ~5 km in altitude relative to the ellipsoid, are present. Their irregular shape is often sculpted by impacts. We also note a positive relief with relatively steep slopes (~13°) and a cone-like shape centered at 85°N/8°E. Topographic lows, reaching -4 km, correspond to the floors of impact craters with diameters up to 64 km. The morphology of impact craters exhibits varying degrees of degradation. Degraded crater floors show central peaks and mass wasting deposits. The largest morphologically fresh deposit (78°N/38°E) is 20 km long, and has a lobate shape with striations on its surface. It extends from a crater rim downslope. No extensive ejecta deposits are present in the study area. In the course of the ongoing mission, we will incorporate mosaics from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (~140 m/pixel) and Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (~35 m/pixel) phases to complete the preliminary photo-geological map and stratigraphy.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations indicate that the flow of a purely thermal plume preserves the azimuthal zonation of the source region, thus providing a framework to attribute a deep origin to the isotopic zonation of Hawaiian lavas. However, previous studies were limited to passive heterogeneities not affecting the flow. We go beyond this simplification by considering active heterogeneities which are compositionally denser, or more viscous, and we address the following questions: (1) How do active heterogeneities modify the axially symmetric velocity field of the plume conduit? (2) Under which conditions is the azimuthal zonation of the source region no longer preserved in the plume stem? (3) How do active heterogeneities deform during upwelling and what is their shape once at sublithospheric depths? We conducted both laboratory experiments, using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to calculate the velocity field, and high resolution three-dimensional simulations where millions of tracers keep track of the heterogeneous fluid. For compositionally denser heterogeneities we cover a range of buoyancy ratios 0<B<2, where B=Δρchemical/Δρthermal and ρ is density; for more viscous heterogeneities, the range of viscosity ratios is 0<λ<20, where λ=ηheterogeneity/ηfluid and η is viscosity. The initial heterogeneity has the arbitrary shape of a sphere and we vary its volume and its distance from the plume axis. We find that by increasing λ, the shape of the heterogeneity changes from filament-like to blob-like characterized by internal rotation and little stretching. By increasing B the heterogeneity tends to spread at the base of the plume stem and to rise as a tendril close to the axis, so that the initial zonation may be poorly preserved. We also find that the plume velocity field can be profoundly modified by active heterogeneities, and we explore the relation between strain rates and the evolving shape of the upwelling heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Global-scale studies indicate that semiarid ecosystems strongly regulate the long-term trend and interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon sink, possibly due to changes in vegetation and an inherent sensitivity to changes in water availability. However, we lack understanding of how climate shifts, such as the ongoing decadal-scale drought in the Southwest US, impact carbon sink functioning in semiarid ecosystems with differing structure. Therefore, we investigated the response of net ecosystem production of carbon dioxide (NEP) to changes in annual water availability in four Southwest US ecosystems varying in relative shrub, tree and grass abundance. Using eddy covariance carbon dioxide and water vapor flux measurements collected over the last drought-impacted decade, we identified a precipitation “pivot point” in the annual carbon balance for each ecosystem type where annual NEP switched from negative to positive. At the three sites with larger amounts of grass, rather than woody plant, cover, pivot points were closer to the drought-period mean annual precipitation (MAP) than MAP over the preceding 30 years, suggesting the carbon pools of these grassier ecosystems have more quickly adjusted to the decadal-scale drought. Current-year water availability, as quantified by evapotranspiration (ET) overwhelmingly drove the response of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and respiration (Reco) fluxes. Ecosystem water use efficiency (GEP/ET) increased with water availability and leaf area index, resulting in a more efficient photosynthetic use of water in wetter years and at wetter sites. Grasslands supported a higher leaf area than shrublands at a given water availability, and thus had higher GEP/ET. Differences in GEP/ET were also related to the relative proportion of abiotic evaporation, estimated from the ET intercept in a linear regression of ET and GEP, to total ET at a site, highlighting the importance of ET partitioning for understanding how semiarid rainfall drives plant productivity.",

The main ECVF has 40Ar/39Ar ages from ~18.7-12.4 Ma (mostly 18.7-18.5 Ma; Sabin et al. 1994), and on Fort Irwin, the ages are from 21.0-15.8 Ma (mostly 18.6-15.8 Ma; Schermer et al. 1996). 68 samples (56 lava flow, 4 dome-collapse breccia, 3 ignimbrite, and 5 fallout tephra) were analyzed for major, minor, and trace elements. Typically, stratigraphic sequences dip <30° (mostly <15°) except near faults, with local buttress unconfomities and no large unconfomities. Compositions are moderate-to-high-K type, and similar to Na2O+K2O from Sabin et al. (1994) but with slightly smaller ranges. The generalized stratigraphic sequence is rhyolite (R), dacite (D), or trachyte (T) that form domes, lava flows (up to 3.5 km long), dome-collapse deposits, or pyroclastic deposits, overlain by andesite (A), trachyandesite (TA), basaltic andesite (BA), basaltic trachyandesite (BT), or basalt (B) lava flows (up to 7 km long), and minor cinder cones. A general upward felsic to mafic compositional sequence occurs throughout the area, but is not continuous as B is locally in a R-D sequence and B is at the base of and interstratified with a BA-A sequence. Also, there are compositional variations at different locations along the edges of the field. In the Goldstone Mesa, Pink Canyon, and Stone Ridge areas (~70 km2), B-BA forms the youngest lava flows, but ~21 km to the north in the Garry Owen area (~25 km2), BTA forms the youngest lava flows. Compared to the Stone Ridge area with a D-A-TA-BA trend, ~6 km west in the Pioneer Plateau area is R-TA-D, ~3 km south in the Pink Canyon area is R-B-BA-A, and ~8 km east at Dacite Dome is D only (all areas have slightly different Na2O+K2O in each rock type). A non-ECVF, 5.6 Ma BA flow in SE Fort Irwin also has distinct compositions. Chemical variations indicate the region had similar general evolution of magma sources, but (1) there were numerous small, isolated chambers that fed flows along the edges of the field, (2) several tuffs are similar to local lavas but some differ and might have distant sources, and (3) basalt flows locally encroached into adjacent areas.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Coastal_altimetry.pdf\nThe US Atlantic coast is one of the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise (SLR) due to its low elevation, large population concentrations, and economic importance. Further vulnerability arises from accelerating rates of SLR, which began in the early 2000’s and caused a significant increase in flooding frequency in several coastal communities. Several studies have suggested that the accelerating SLR rates are due to the slowing down of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, in particular, a weakening of the Gulf Stream (GS). However, there are no direct observations that link the GS conditions and high sea levels along the coast.\nIn this study we use satellite altimetry, tide gauge, and Florida Current (FC) cable data to explore possible relations between the recent SLR rate increase along the Florida Atlantic coast and various dynamical processes in the GS/FC system. Preliminary calculations indicate a good agreement between coastal sea level and nearshore altimetry series (R = 0.76-0.8) suggesting that SSH gradients from altimetry may be useful for assessing the dynamics associated with the coastal sea level change. Here we focus on spatio-temporal SSH changes along the two satellite passes located closest to the Florida Atlantic coast. Our results indicate an intriguing transition in SSH behavior around 2004-5. Prior to 2004, anomalous low coastal SSH events (strong FC) occurred every 3-5 years in correlation with warm ENSO events. After 2004, the strong relationship between ENSO and the gradient across the FC vanishes, while the mean sea level across the current increases. The observed SSH anomaly transition around 2004-5 correlates well with the initiation of accelerated rates of coastal SLR, suggesting that the decadal scale SLR acceleration has occurred during weak FC conditions. However, the forcing of this transition and the role of mean sea level variability, which is of comparable magnitude to variability in the gradient, remain unexplained.",

            "abstract": "Prehistoric eruptions are generally treated as discrete events, separated from preceding and following events by periods defined by 14C or radiometric dating as centuries or longer. Modern events such as Monserrat (1995-?) or Mount St. Helens (1980-86; 2004-2008) blur this distinction with ‘eruption episodes’ versus ‘separate eruptions’ becoming a semantic issue. For rhyolite eruptions, where historic events are scarce, discerning episodicity within, or close spacing between, eruptions becomes important. Time gaps of a few decades or less are challenging to recognise and quantify in eruption products, but important in terms of modelling future events and considering the consequent hazards, economic impacts and associated societal responses. We here consider the geological record for the timing of prehistoric rhyolite eruptions over a range of sizes. In some, such as the Bishop Tuff, there is no evidence in the eruptive stratigraphy to suggest any significant hiatus in activity, and an overall timing of days for the main activity has been inferred. In contrast, evidence from other deposits indicates a prolongation of geologically distinct eruptions, such as the Oruanui (over several months) and Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (over likely over a few decades). Such evidence is in the form of syn-eruptive erosion and reworking, or breaks long enough for successive units to have contrasting welding histories but for the earlier units to still be hot and fumarolically active when the later ones were emplaced. Some eruptions in the young record from Taupo volcano were sourced from widely separated vents, yet have only subtle evidence for time breaks between them, suggestive of years to 1-2 decades. The youngest event at Taupo consisted of the catastrophic 232±5 CE explosive activity (eruption Y), which was followed by a break of 10±5 years before effusive activity (eruption Z) occurred under the re-formed Lake Taupo. The lengths of time breaks within and between rhyolite eruptions are overlapping, and present major challenges for linking field and petrological evidence and considering whether or not an eruption has ended.",

The pyrolysis (to 900°C)-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Pyro-GCMS) analytical mode was systematically used to reach that goal. It revealed the existence of complex interactions between compounds present in the soil sample (e.g. oxychlorines [2]) and internal components of the SAM experiment (e.g. derivatization reactant) resulting in signals complex to interpret [3].\nBy comparing these results with those obtained for the other Mars samples analysed with SAM, and by carefully identifying, from laboratory work, the possible SAM internal contributions to the organic molecules detected [4], chlorobenzene has already been identified as mainly originating from organics present in the mudstone [5]. Since this discovery, we did additional studies of the chromatograms that reveal the presence of dichlorobenzene originating from an organic source endogenous to the sample. Even if the exact original source of these organic molecules cannot be strictly identified, the detection of several chlorinated aromatic molecules suggests the presence of a significant amount of aromatized materials which are in an oxidized state involving oxygen in the mudstone. We present here the corresponding results and the implication it can have on the origin of these organic materials\n",

This project analyzes the impacts of these disturbances on ecosystem structure and function. Eddy covariance and static chamber measurements were used during the 2013 growing season to determine net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from multiple retrogressive thaw slumps located in areas with different vegetation types. Two eddy covariance towers were established at the beginning of the growing season and ran continuously throughout the summer. Flux partitioning based on wind direction allowed us to determine NEE fluxes from disturbed tundra, which were compared with fluxes from surrounding undisturbed tundra. A static chamber system was utilized throughout the season to measure ER from corresponding disturbed and undisturbed tundra. Vegetation composition and environmental variables were determined across multiple disturbances. NEE and ER were separated throughout the season into three periods of analysis based on temperature, precipitation, and vegetation development.\nEddy covariance measurements indicate decreases in NEE in disturbed areas. In one site, this decrease shifted the system from a net sink to a net source of carbon over the entire growing season. Vegetation community composition determines the overall impact of disturbance on carbon dioxide fluxes. Seasonal shifts in fluxes are also apparent. Disturbances increased ER in sedge tundra and decreased ER in dwarf shrub communities. Analysis of vegetation indicates a decrease in overall vegetation cover within two active disturbances when compared with undisturbed surrounding areas. This corresponds with differing dominant vegetation types in these zones. We determined the impacts of permafrost disturbances on ecosystem structure and function by quantitatively measuring vegetation composition and carbon dioxide fluxes from disturbed and undisturbed tundra.",

Although point clouds have tremendous potential, they are fraught with errors and challenges, which has led to an abundance of methodological studies about data quality and coping with uncertainty. In addition, the abundance and spatial autocorrelation of the data necessitate a paradigm shift in scientific analysis away from classic statistical analysis focusing on central tendency and towards an understanding of the primary importance of spatially organized landscape complexity. Looking beyond data processing methods, there are terrific opportunities for linking scientific data analysis of existing conditions with engineering data synthesis to build new landscapes or enhance existing ones to achieve more environmental functionality. In pursuit of these goals the new paradigm of near-census river science is emerging to support mutual analysis and synthesis of point clouds of river corridors focusing on the 1-m scale as the basic building block for characterizing geomorphic processes and ecological functions. Examples of near-census analysis of riverine topography and biota will be presented. A demonstration will be shown using a new software platform to illustrate how key metrics extracted from point clouds can be used to design synthetic river corridors with multiple scales of organized landscape complexity that yield specific geomorphic processes and ecological functions.",

This is a model of intermediate complexity, which can run 100 model years in 30 hours using 33 CPUs. The atmospheric component is the SPEEDY-IER (Molteni et al. 2003; Dee et al. 2015a), which is a water isotope-enabled (with equilibrium and kinetic fractionation schemes in precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture) simplified atmospheric general circulation model, with T30 horizontal resolution and 8 vertical layers. The oceanic component is NEMO 3.4 (Madec 2008), a state-of-the-art oceanic model (~2° horizontal resolution and 31 vertical layers) with an oceanic isotope module (a passive tracer scheme). A 1000-year control run shows that NEEMY is stable and its energy is conserved. The mean state is comparable to that of CMIP3-era CGCMs, though much cheaper to run. Atmospheric teleconnections such as the NAO and PNA are simulated very well. NEEMY also simulates the oceanic meridional overturning circulation well. The tropical climate variability is weaker than observations, and the climatology exhibits a double ITCZ problem despite bias corrections. The standard deviation of the monthly mean Nino3.4 index is 0.61K, compared to 0.91K in observations (Reynolds et al. 2002). We document similarities and differences with a close cousin, SPEEDY-NEMO (Kucharski et al. 2015). With its fast speed and relatively complete physical processes, NEEMY is suitable for paleoclimate studies ; we will present some forced simulations of the past millennium and their use in forward-modeling climate proxies, via proxy system models (PSMs, Dee et al 2015b).\n",

During compression, all of the ~30 modes monitored shift positively and monotonically until ~2.2 GPa where a few low frequency modes disappear and tetrahedral borate modes merge. The low frequency modes that disappear at ~2.2 GPa are likely associated with Na vibrations, and their disappearance suggests that dramatic changes occur in the Na sites at ~2.2 GPa. The merging of the boron bending and stretching modes at ~2.2 GPa suggests that the local symmetry of the BO4 tetrahedra changes at this pressure, and likely becomes more symmetric. The remaining modes shift positively up to ~7.4 GPa where a second notable change occurs. All but 5 modes (with initial frequencies of 150, 166, 289, 307, and 525 cm-1) disappear at ~7.4 GPa. This indicates that a second phase transition has occurred which affects both the BO3H and BO4­ groups: based on the loss of modes, this transition may be associated with disordering of the crystal. These 5 modes persist and shift monotonically up to ~25 GPa. On decompression, the 5 modes shift smoothly down to ~2.0 GPa where a few new modes appear in the spectrum. When fully decompressed to room pressure, the Raman spectrum of the recovered sample is significantly different from the ambient spectrum of the initial sample. Thus, our results are suggest a phase transition occurring at 2.2 GPa with changes in the Na and tetrahedral boron sites, followed by an additional transition at 7.4 GPa that may involve disordering of the crystal. In the latter transition, at least the BO3H groups appear to be destabilized, implying that the three-fold coordination of boron groups is, in contrast to the case of carbon, unstable in crystalline phases at relatively modest pressure conditions.",

This factor, together with large uncertainties in river hydraulic geometry, surface topography and other datasets, contribute to difficulties in simulating flooding processes over this basin. We have developed a large-scale inundation scheme in the framework of the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) river routing model. Both the kinematic wave and the diffusion wave routing methods are implemented in the model. A new process-based algorithm is designed to represent river channel – floodplain interactions.

            "abstract": "Cold pools play important roles in tropical and midlatitude deep convective initiation and organization through their influence on near-surface kinematic and thermodynamic fields. Because temperature, moisture, and winds are perturbed within cold pools, cold pools can also impact surface sensible and latent heat fluxes. In turn, surface fluxes both within the cold pool and in the environment can modify the characteristics of cold pools and their evolution, with subsequent implications for convective initiation and organization. The two-way interaction between cold pools and surface energy fluxes has not been well studied and is likely to vary according to the environment and surface type. The goal of this study is therefore to investigate the mechanisms by which surface fluxes and cold pools interact in environmental conditions ranging from tropical oceanic to dry continental. This goal will be accomplished using high-resolution (grid spacings as fine as 10 m), idealized, 2D simulations of isolated cold pools; such modeling experiments have proven useful for investigating cold pools and their dynamics in many previous studies. In the proposed experiments, the surface flux formulation, surface type, and environmental conditions will be systematically varied. The impact of surface fluxes on various cold pool characteristics and their evolution, including the buoyancy, maximum vertical velocity, and moisture distribution, will be analyzed and presented. Results suggest that the mechanisms by which surface fluxes and cold pools interact vary substantially with the environment. Additionally, the indirect effects of surface fluxes on turbulent entrainment rates into the cold pool are found to play an important role in cold pool evolution. These results suggest that surface fluxes can impact the timing and manner in which cold pools initiate convection, and that their effects may be important to incorporate into cold pool parameterizations for climate simulations.",

            "abstract": "Despite the key role played by volatile species in magmatic systems, it is still challenging to quantify their concentrations in ancient melts. We suggested a quantitative approach for estimating S contents in basaltic melts (Callegaro et al., 2014), based on direct measurement of S on clinopyroxene and calculation of its concentration in the melt through an experimentally determined partition coefficient (KD). We further investigated the partitioning of sulfur between silicate melts and nominally volatile-free minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase), as well as between melt and amphibole. Partitioning experiments were performed with basaltic, andesitic and dacitic bulk compositions, at hydrous and anhydrous conditions, and at high and low oxygen fugacities (fO2), where sulfur in the melt is dominantly present as an S6+ or S2- species, respectively (Wilke et al., 2011). Sulfur concentrations in melts were measured by electron microprobe and in crystals by synchrotron X-ray fluorescence. At low fO2 the average crystal/liquid KDs for sulfur vary from 0.0004 (at a maximum) for olivine, to 0.003 (another maximum) for orthopyroxene, to 0.03 for clinopyroxene, and to 0.07 for plagioclase. The KDs correlate positively with the cation-oxygen bond lengths in the crystals. At high fO2 the KDs drop to approximately one-third of those observed at low fO2. These observations suggest that S2- replaces oxygen in the crystal structure. Water has no measureable influence on the crystal/melt partitioning of sulfur. Clinopyroxene/melt KDs are correlated with the Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratio of the crystal, but appear insensitive to the IVAl in the structure.

            "abstract": "Giant clasts (>10,000 m3) are common in many submarine landslide deposits. Here, we use submarine landslide deposits exposed in the field (Karoo Basin, South Africa and Neuquén Basin, Argentina) and imaged in high-resolution reflection seismic data (offshore Colombia and offshore Brazil) to investigate how giant clasts were entrained and transported in the parent flows, and how they changed longitudinal flow behaviour. Based on: (i) facies/seismic facies similarities between clast and substrate; (ii) evidence for basal scour at a scale comparable to the clasts; and (iii) the spatial association of scours and clasts, we are able to discriminate between clasts derived from the substrate during flow run-out rather than from headwall degradation. Highly sheared basal surfaces are well-developed in distal locations, sometimes extending beyond the deposit. This points to deformation and weakening of the substrate ahead of the flow, thus providing a potential mechanism to entrain large clasts on low gradients in the absence of basal flow turbulence. Scours and ramps on the basal shear surface, which are associated with concentrations of large clasts, commonly occur where bathymetric changes are abrupt (confinement and/or steepening) or where more easily eroded substrate are encountered (e.g. sand-prone channel-fills). Substrate entrainment bulks the flow volume along during flow evolution, thereby increasing mass and momentum. Our outcrop and subsurface examples point to a complicated interplay between flow evolution, bathymetry, and substrate geology, which combine to control the development of the basal shear surface. Improved understanding of these interrelationships will help to refine the estimates of the volumes and runout distances, and therefore geohazard potential, of submarine landslides.",

Between 2010 and 2011, the ICDP-Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project recovered a sediment core that records ~200 ka of climate history in the region. The last interglacial (MIS 5e) included periods of extreme aridity in this region. This study aimed to characterize water sources into the lake during such critically dry periods. Geochemical analyses of aragonite, detritus, and halite samples waere carried out though a halite-rich interval during MIS 5e that represents a large drop in lake level, when discharge was less than half of modern levels. Uranium isotope activity ratios indicate a completely different hydrological regime during the driest periods in the Dead Sea, which is reflected by a major decrease of 234U/238U from 1.5, typical to the modern day and glacial high-stands of the lake, to ~1 . The decrease toward secular equilibrium happened gradually through the arid interval. Possible explanations include more southern sources coming into the lake, more flood events, addition dissolution of old salt (i.e. in secular equilibrium) by saline springs, and possibly shutdown of the Jordan River during extremely arid conditions. Further research will yield important information to prepare for future warming in the Middle East, a region where water access and droughts greatly affect socio-economic and political stability.",

Many scientists know what they want to communicate, some know to whom they’d like to communicate, but few can clearly express why they want to do it. So what? First, being clear about one’s goal is critical in being able to measure success. Second, when asked to think critically about communication goals, some scientists may shift their communication behaviors and practices to better achieve those goals.\nTo that end, NASA has designed a deep learning experience for scientists (and engineers and others) to: critically examine their communication goals; learn techniques for getting to know their intended audience; and develop and apply specific communication skills to a project of their choice. Participants in this program come into the classroom with projects that span a wide spectrum including: formal and informal education, public outreach, media interviews, public speaking, stakeholder briefings, and internal awareness-building. Through expert advisors, professional coaches and peer networks, this program provides a supportive environment for individuals to workshop their project in the classroom and receive feedback before, during, and after the project is complete.\nThis program also provides an opportunity for scientists and other participants to learn more about communication at NASA, and to directly influence the agency’s science communication culture through action learning. In this presentation, I will summarize NASA’s dual-design science communication leadership development program and present some lessons-learned, participant feedback and evaluation data from the initial course offerings.",

The FUV and MUV channels of the IUVS together cover the spectral range from 115 to 330 nm.\nThe first two campaigns were executed during March 24 and March 26, 2015, and during May 17 and May 18, 2015, respectively. So far 13 occultations could be used to retrieve CO2 and O2 number densities in the altitude range between 100 and 150 km from the first occultation campaign. From the second occultation campaign number densities for CO2, O3, and aerosols were obtained between 20 and 100 km altitude.\nTemperature profiles for the same altitude ranges were calculated by applying the constraint of hydrostatic equilibrium to the CO2 densities. With a cadence of 2.6 s, including a 2.0 s integration time, the altitude resolution of the density and temperature profiles is between 1.5 and 4.5 km, depending on the geometry of the particular occultation.\nThe retrieved density profiles of CO2 and O2 agree with previous measurements obtained by the Mars Express SPICAM instrument and by Viking 1 and 2. The corresponding O2 mixing ratios range from 1 to 5 x 10-3, also in agreement with previous observations. The temperatures that we retrieved agree with the models in the Mars Climate Database (MCD) between 10-2 and 10-4 Pa. At lower pressures, however, the measured temperatures are on average 70 K to 100 K cooler than the temperatures predicted by the MCD. This is because the model temperatures increase steadily with altitude above the mesopause whereas the observed temperatures decrease at pressures less than 3.5 x 10-5 Pa, reaching a minimum near 7 x 10-6 Pa. The large differences between the MCD and our results indicate that global models of thermal structure around the mesopause need to be revised.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks can house large reservoirs of N that are bioavailable as rock weathers to soil, and may be particularly important among montane landscapes where rock exhumation is rapid. Carbon storage and productivity of forests, particularly temperate and boreal forests are limited by N availability, and N inputs from geologic sources may drive higher productivity and above-ground biomass storage when compared to sites receiving only atmospheric N inputs. Here we investigate the foliar chemistry and biomass across a gradient of geologic N to determine whether rock N influences the nutrient status and biomass storage in forest foliage. We hypothesize that Douglas fir trees growing on sites with greater rock N will have larger pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous in foliar biomass than trees relying exclusively on atmospheric inputs. Foliage samples collected from six sites in northwestern California were weighed to establish a 100 needle mass average for each site and analyzed by ICP-MS for elemental composition as well as continuous flow IRMS. Working across a rock N gradient (63-800 mg N/kg), we observe that foliar (per needle) N (1.5-4.7 ng), P (0.3-0.8 ng), and C (65.2-2116.5 ng) is positively correlated (R2 of 0.26, 0.38, and 0.89, respectively) with bedrock N content. Foliar mass of individual needles also increases across the rock N gradient from 1.3 to 3.7 mg. These results show that the carbon content in foliage (P≤0.05) is correlated with the underlying rock N concentrations, and suggest that trees developing on N-rich bedrock exhibit increased potential for foliar carbon storage.",

Thus, iron is an important variable in the carbon cycles of both marine and atmospheric environments. Here, we build upon previous work characterizing the source and oxidation state of iron in atmospheric particles to provide more information on the mineralogy of the iron phases using the newly built Sub-Micron Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy (SRX) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II). The SRX beamline covers energies from 4.6 to 24 keV, allowing mapping of elements from Z=15 (P) to Z=95 (Am) at a sub-micrometer and a sub-100 nm spatial scale. This new method of aerosol analysis will provide outstanding performance for the spectromicroscopy of trace elements. Moreover, this technique will provide multiple modes of detection (fluorescence, absorption, diffraction, and tomographic imaging) to allow for a more complete characterization of the molecular nature of natural samples having nanometer scale structural features. Simultaneously measured X-ray absorption and fluorescence spectra from Asian mineral dust standards and deposited atmospheric particles will be presented. Application of this technique to atmospheric particle samples will broaden the scope of elements over which detailed spectral information can be obtained at a high spatial resolution and will complement existing imaging methods used to determine aerosol chemical and physical properties.",

            "abstract": "Communities, Tribes, and decision makers in coastal western Alaska are being impacted by declining sea ice, sea level rise, changing storm patterns and intensities, and increased rates of coastal erosion. Relative to their counterparts in the contiguous USA, their ability to plan for and respond to these changes is constrained by the region’s generally meager or non-existent information base. Further, the information needs and logistic challenges are of a scale that perhaps can be addressed only through strong, strategic collaboration. Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) are fundamentally about applied science and collaboration, especially collaborative decision making. The Western Alaska LCC has established a process of participatory decision making that brings together researchers, agency managers, local experts from Tribes and field specialists to identify and prioritize shared information needs; develop a course of action to address them by using the LCC’s limited resources to catalyze engagement, overcome barriers to progress, and build momentum; then ensure products are delivered in a manner that meets decision makers’ needs. We briefly review the LCC’s activities & outcomes from the stages of (i) collaborative needs assessment (joint with the Alaska Climate Science Center and the Alaska Ocean Observing System), (ii) strategic science activities, and (iii) product refinement and delivery. We discuss lessons learned, in the context of our recent program focused on ‘Changes in Coastal Storms and Their Impacts’ and current collaborative efforts focused on delivery of Coastal Resiliency planning tools and results from applied science projects. Emphasis is given to the various key interactions between scientists and decision makers / managers that have been promoted by this process to ensure alignment of final products to decision maker needs.",

Information on the size of fields is needed to plan and understand these factors, and may help the allocation of agricultural resources. The Landsat satellites provide the longest global land observation record and their data have potential for monitoring field sizes. A recently published automated methodology to extract agricultural crop fields was refined and applied to 30 m weekly Landsat 5 and 7 time series of year 2010 in the range of all the conterminous United States (CONUS). For the first time, spatially explicit CONUS field size maps and derived information are presented. A total of 4.18 million fields were extracted with mean and median field sizes of 0.193 km2 and 0.278 km2, respectively. There were discernable patterns between field size and the majority crop type as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer (CDL) classification. In general, larger field sizes occurred where a greater proportion of the land was dedicated to agriculture, predominantly in the U.S. Wheat and Corn belts, and in regions of irrigated agriculture. The CONUS field size histogram was skewed, and 50% of the extracted fields had sizes greater than or smaller than 0.361 km2, and there were four distinct peaks that corresponded closely to sizes equivalent to fields with 0.25 × 0.25 mile, 0.25 × 0.5 mile, 0.5 × 0.5 mile, and 0.5 × 1 mile side dimensions. The results of validation by comparison with independent field boundaries at 48 subsets selected across the 16 states with the greatest harvested cropland area are summarized. The presentation concludes with a discussion of the implications of this NASA funded research and challenges for field size extraction from global coverage long term satellite data.",

            "abstract": "Recent tomography models (Sigloch, 2011; Schmandt & Lin, 2014) reveal unprecedented details of the mantle structure beneath the United States (U.S.). Prominent slow seismic anomalies below Yellowstone, traditionally interpreted as due to a mantle plume, are restricted to depths either shallower than 200 km or between 500 and 1000 km, but a continuation to greater depth is missing. Compared to fast seismic anomalies, which are usually interpreted as slabs or delaminated lithosphere, origin of deep slow seismic anomalies, especially those in the vicinity of subduction zones, is more enigmatic. As a consequence, both the dynamics and evolution of these slow anomalies remain poorly understood.\nTo investigate the origin and evolution of the Yellowstone slow anomaly during the past 20 Myr, we construct a 4D inverse mantle convection model with a hybrid data assimilation scheme. On the one hand, we use the adjoint method to recover the past evolution of mantle seismic structures beyond the subduction zones. On the other hand, we use a high-resolution forward model to simulate the subduction of the oceanic (i.e., Farallon) plate. During the adjoint iterations, features from these two approaches are blended together at a depth of ~200 km below the subduction zone. In practice, we convert fast and slow seismic anomalies to effective positive and negative density heterogeneities. Our preliminary results indicate that at 20 Ma, the present-day shallow slow anomalies beneath the western U.S. were located inside the oceanic asthenosphere, which subsequently entered the mantle wedge, through the segmented Farallon slab. The eastward encroachment of the slow anomaly largely followed the Yellowstone hotspot track migration. The present deep mantle Yellowstone slow anomaly originated at shallower depths (i.e. transition zone), and was then translated down to the lower mantle accompanying the sinking fast anomalies. The temporal evolution of the slow anomalies suggests that the deep Yellowstone slow anomaly could also have originated from the oceanic asthenosphere. Thus, our model provides an alternative explanation for the Yellowstone slow seismic anomalies.",

In cities, groundwater can provide a cost-effective source of water for drinking and industrial uses, while groundwater basins provide storage. The role of groundwater in a city’s water supply tends to change over time. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, groundwater is critical. Over decades, users in the region’s many basins allocated annual pumping rights to groundwater among users through adjudications. These rights were determined through collective processes over decades, which contributed to the complex array of public and private organizations involved in water management. The rights also continue to evolve. We analyzed changes in the distribution of groundwater rights over time for adjudicated basins in Southern Los Angeles County. Results indicate that groundwater rights are increasingly: 1) controlled or regulated by public institutions and municipalities, and 2) consolidated among larger users. Yet, both the percentage of total supplies provided by groundwater, as well as the distribution of groundwater rights, varies widely among cities and communities throughout Los Angeles. As metropolitan Los Angeles faces reduced water imports and emphasizes local water reliance, access to pumping rights and storage capacity in groundwater basins will become even more vital. We discuss implications of our results for future urban water management. ",

            "abstract": "Geophysical observations show evidence of near-lithostatic pore pressure in fault zones that experience episodic slow slip events. In addition, dilatancy hardening is one of several hypotheses proposed to explain the transient self-sustaining nature of slow slip. Thus, pore pressure evolution is possibly an important control on slow slip behavior. Phyllosilicates are abundant in regions of subduction zones and along the deep San Andreas Fault where slow slip is observed, yet previous work on phyllosilicate-bearing rocks indicates that fracture and frictional sliding occur with little dilation of the pore space. We present experimental results of pore pressure effects during fracture and frictional shear of antigorite-rich serpentinite.\nTriaxial deformation experiments were conducted on intact cores 25.4 mm in diameter and 53.0 mm in length and ~1.5 mm thick gouge zones sandwiched between porous sandstone or steel sawcut forcing blocks. Experiments were conducted at room temperature, confining pressures from 50 to 100 MPa, pore pressure from 0 to 95 MPa, and axial displacement rates from 0.016 to 4.0 μm/s (shear rates from 0.02 to 5 μm/s). Foliated and macroscopically isotropic intact serpentinite samples were tested; fabric orientation is strongly correlated with both strength and dilatancy. When foliation is oriented parallel to σ1, strength and dilatancy are greatest and similar to those for crystalline rocks. When foliation is oriented 45 ° to σ1, however, dilatancy and strength are both greatly reduced. During frictional shear we observe a transition from rate-strengthening to rate-weakening behavior at ~0.5 μm/s, which is within range of typical slow slip rates and consistent with previous studies. This transition occurs concurrently with a transition from slip-induced compaction to dilation. Higher pore pressure correlates with overall higher friction coefficient, and also with lower compaction rates and higher dilation rates in the rate-strengthening and rate-weakening regimes, respectively. These preliminary results show that serpentinite exhibits many of the physical properties that promote slow slip behavior at room temperature. Ongoing studies at temperatures up to 400 °C will test whether these properties persist with the onset of thermally activated processes.",

            "abstract": "Application of Cu isotopes to high temperature systems has recently gained momentum and has the potential for probing sulphide fractionation during planetary differentiation [1]. This requires robust estimates for planetary reservoirs, and a fundamental understanding of how igneous processes affect Cu isotopes; this study aims to tackle the latter.\nCogenetic suites affected by both fractionation crystallisation and cumulate formation were analysed to study such effects on Cu isotopes. In S-undersatured systems, Cu behaves incompatibly during melt evolution and the Cu isotope composition of such melt is invariant over the differentiation sequence. In contrast, S-saturated systems show resolvable Cu isotope variations relative to primitive melt. Such variations are minor but imply a slightly heavy Cu isotope composition for continental crust compared to BSE, consistent with granite data [2]. Although olivine accumulation does not affect Cu isotopes, spinel-hosted Cu is isotopically light relative to the bulk.\nAnalysis of variably melt-depleted cratonic peridotites shows that partial melting can affect Cu isotope composition in restite, with the depleted samples isotopically light compared to BSE. This could be due to residual spinel and/or incongruent melting of sulphides – individual sulphides picked from a single xenolith reveal a range of Cu isotope compositions, dependent on composition.\nAlthough partial melting may fractionate Cu isotopes, models suggest most mantle-derived melt will have δ65Cu ≈ BSE, as most source Cu will be transferred to the melt. Small degree melts such as ocean island basalts are predicted to be isotopically heavier than MORB, if derived from a primitive mantle source. OIBs have a range of Cu isotope compositions: some are heavier than MORB as predicted; however, some have much lighter compositions. Since Cu isotopes can be significantly fractionated in the surface environment [e.g. 3] OIB Cu isotopic variations may be linked to recycling of sediments in the mantle; therefore Cu isotopes may be used as a tracer for mantle heterogeneities, and potentially, for sediment and/or fluid transfer through volcanic arcs.\n[1] Savage et al. 2015, Geochem.

            "abstract": "Assessing the seismic hazard of earthquakes induced by fluid injection requires estimating realistic maximum magnitudes, Mmax. Is Mmax limited by the industrial activity that induces the seismicity or is it limited by the same factors that constrain the magnitudes of natural earthquakes? McGarr (2014) analyzed evidence from many case histories of earthquakes induced by a variety of fluid injection activities into deep formations, to argue that Mmax is limited by the total volume of fluid injected before the largest earthquake. Moreover, these earthquakes appear to result from the migration of pore pressure increase into seismogenic fault zones usually located in the shallow crystalline basement. A loophole in this argument is the possibility that a small-scale injection activity might trigger a vastly larger-scale earthquake. Although this cannot be ruled out, there are reasons why such a disproportionate seismic response to fluid injection is highly improbable, for example, the differences between natural and induced earthquakes. Natural earthquakes are the result of regional-scale strain accumulation that finally results in rupture that nucleates at depths in the range of 10 to 15 km where fault zones are strongest. Fluid-induced earthquakes, in contrast, are caused by localized pore pressure increases that perturb faults in the shallowest part of the seismogenic crust as evidenced by their hypocentral depths, typically in the top 5 km. For natural earthquakes, Mmax for mapped active faults is estimated from fault area (e.g., Hanks and Bakun, 2014) and the frequency of earthquake occurrence from the long-term slip rate. For earthquakes induced by fluid injection, it is straightforward to show that the volume of injected fluid plays the same role as fault area, but this area, and correspondingly Mmax, increases with time as long as injection continues. Similarly, injection rate plays the same role as the long-term slip rate on mapped faults.",

            "abstract": "Soil C storage is balanced by photosynthetic production and microbial decomposition of organic matter (OM). Recently, this view has been expanded to account for the effects of physical erosion of OM in determining soil C storage. In parallel, the focus on OM quality as a primary determinant of C turnover has shifted to OM-mineral interactions. These recent advances necessitates our ability to discern how physical erosion, which controls the production, breakdown, and removal of colluvial soils, and chemical weathering, which generates secondary phyllosilicate and iron oxides, independently and collaboratively affect soils’ capacity to store C. Here we present soil organic C contents and storages as a function of soil properties that are controlled by physical vs. chemical weathering processes. The study site includes two hillslopes under different climates in SW Australia. The wetter site has continuous canopy of eucalyptus, while the drier site is covered by grasses with scattered eucalyptus overstorey. The two hillslope transects share similar granodiorite parent materials and denudation rates. Bioturbation-driven soil creep appears equally effective at both sites. In eroding areas, chemical weathering has created greater mineral surface area in the soils of wetter site, while physical soil production and erosion resulted in forming the eroding soils of similar thicknesses at both sites. In the drier site, however, vegetation density varies significantly with topography-dependent soil moisture, which appears to have resulted in a soil toposequence where impacts of localized overland-flow erosion is evident through soil mineral surface area, texture, and C contents. These soil properties, in contrast, are largely homogeneous across the wetter hillslope transect presumably because of the lack of localized overland-flow erosion. As a result, at the depositional areas, the drier site exhibits greater or similar soil C storages, which sharply contrasts with the smaller amount of C stored in the eroding soils at the drier site. These results reveal that climate affects relative significance of physical vs. chemical weathering processes in hillslopes and that such differential intensities of the two mechanisms may significantly interfere with biologically mediated climate control of soil C storages.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost-affected soils of the northern hemisphere have accumulated large pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) since continuous low temperatures in the permafrost prevented organic matter (OM) decomposition. According to recent estimates these soils contain 1300 ± 200 Pg of SOC, or about twice as much the carbon within the global vegetation. Rising arctic temperatures will likely result in increased permafrost thawing with the consequence of increased mobilization and degradation of formerly frozen OM. This degradation process will presumably result in an increased formation of trace gases such as methane and carbon dioxide which can be released to the atmosphere. Rising trace gas concentrations due to permafrost thawing would thereby induce a positive feedback on climate warming.\nCarboPerm, is a joint German-Russian research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It comprises multi-disciplinary investigations on the formation, turnover and release of SOC in Siberian permafrost. It aims to gain increased understanding of how permafrost-affected landscapes will respond to global warming and how this response will influence the local, regional and global trace gas balance.\nCarboPerm strengthens permafrost research in underrepresented areas which are hardly accessible to international researchers. The obtained results improve our understanding of the future development of the sensitive and economically relevant arctic permafrost regions.\nWith this contribution we want to inform the interested community about the new knowledge resulting from results of all scientific work packages: (i) the origin, properties, and dynamics of fossil carbon, (ii) the age and quality of organic matter, (iii) the recent carbon dynamics in permafrost landscapes, (iv) the microbial transformation of organic carbon in permafrost, and (v) process-driven modeling of soil carbon dynamics in permafrost areas.",

            "abstract": "Measuring CO2 emissions as surface fluxes is crucial for climate change predictions. One major set of techniques to measure surface fluxes is through continuous micrometeorological observations over different landscapes. Recent approaches of the surface renewal method (SR) are becoming important for their capacity to independently measure sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) fluxes while avoiding some of the shortcomings of the eddy covariance method (EC). Unlike EC, SR avoids orientation limitations, leveling requirements and instrumentation separation and shadowing issues. The main advantage of SR over EC method is in its applicability in both roughness and inertial sub-layers. Therefore, SR measurements can be planned in cases where fetch requirements are not adequate for EC application. We applied the recent approach as suggested by Castellvi et al. (2008) over two months (May to July, 2015) of high-frequency data collected by EC equipment from a rice field in Arkansas. The main goal was to extend this SR application to CO2 fluxes (Fc) over agricultural fields. The results show high correlation between EC and SR fluxes (H, LE and Fc) when they are compared for all atmospheric stability conditions (R2 > 0.75). Some overestimation is observed for SR with respect to EC fluxes, similar to the findings of Castellvi et al. (2008) for rangeland grass. For all the data, SR analysis results were about 11%, 18% and 17% higher than the EC results for H, LE and Fc, respectively. These higher flux estimates resulted in better energy balance closure. The root mean square error for Fc was 6.55 μmol m-2 s-1. The observed overestimation will be addressed in the future by using additional methods for the turbulent fluxes quantification.",

ISOPOOHs contain two highly hydrophilic functional groups that enable it to partition into atmospheric waters. There it can be further oxidized or act as a source of OH. In order to study this process, we conducted aqueous photooxidation experiments aimed at understanding the role of ISOPOOH, and hydroperoxides in general, in atmospheric waters. ISOPOOH standards were irradiated in the presence of H2O2 in order to simulate aqueous processing. The solutions were analyzed online via HR-ToF-CIMS and HR-ToF AMS. We were able to determine that the main products of ISOPOOH oxidation in water are isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX). Side products formed during the photooxidation were detected as well, including products of direct photolysis and highly oxygenated compounds. ISOPOOH was also confirmed to produce OH in the condensed phase both, via direct photolysis of the peroxide bond and as a co-product of IEPOX formation. Competition experiments with Levoglucosan allowed for the measurement of ISOPOOHs OH reaction rate constant in the condensed phase. Finally, experiments using an OH trap enabled the measurement of the yield of OH from ISOPOOH photolysis that escapes the solvent cage. Together these experiments provide new insights into the role that hydrophilic products of atmospheric oxidation, especially peroxides, can play in SOA formation via aqueous processing.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost thawing in high latitudes allows more soil organic carbon (SOC) to become hydrologically accessible. This can increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports and carbon release to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, with a positive feedback to regional and global climate warming. However, this portion of carbon loss through DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate a set of DOC-related processes (DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption and leaching) into an Arctic-enabled version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS (LPJ-GUESS WHyMe) to mechanistically model the DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS WHyMe with these DOC processes is applied to the Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. The relative importance of different DOC-related processes for mineral and peatland soils for this region have been explored at both monthly and annual scales based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis. For mineral soils, the annual DOC export is dominated by DOC fluxes in snowmelt seasons and the peak in spring is related to the runoff passing through top organic rich layers. Two processes, DOC sorption-desorption and production, are found to contribute most to the annual variance in DOC export. For peatland soils, the DOC export during snowmelt seasons is constrained by frozen soils and the processes of DOC production and mineralization, determining the magnitudes of DOC desorption in snowmelt seasons as well as DOC sorption in the rest of months, play the most important role in annual variances of DOC export. Generally, the seasonality of DOC fluxes is closely correlated with runoff seasonality in this region. The current implementation has demonstrated that DOC-related processes in the framework of LPJ-GUESS WHyMe are at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The quantified contributions from different processes on DOC export dynamics could be further linked to the climate change, vegetation composition change and permafrost thawing in this region.",

            "abstract": "The connection between tremor activity and active fault processes continues to expand our understanding of deep fault zone properties and deformation, the tectonic process, and the relationship of tremor to the occurrence of larger earthquakes. Compared to tremors in subduction zones, known tremor signals in California are ~5 to ~10 smaller in amplitude and duration. These characteristics, in addition to scarce geographic coverage, lack of continuous data (e.g., before mid-2001 at Parkfield), and absence of instrumentation sensitive enough to monitor these events have stifled tremor detection. The continuous monitoring of these events over a relatively short time period in limited locations may lead to a parochial view of the tremor phenomena and its relationship to fault, tectonic, and earthquake processes. To help overcome this, we have embarked on a project to expand the geographic and temporal scope of tremor observation along the Northern SAF system using available continuous seismic recordings from a broad array of 100s of surface seismic stations from multiple seismic networks. Available data for most of these stations also extends back into the mid-1990s. Processing and analysis of tremor signal from this large and low signal-to-noise dataset requires a heavily automated, data-science type approach and specialized techniques for identifying and extracting reliable data. We report here on the automated, envelope based methodology we have developed. We finally compare our catalog results with pre-existing tremor catalogs in the Parkfield area.",

CERES instruments are designed to monitor the Earth's radiation budget by measuring radiation in 3 broad bands. SCIAMACHY sensor measured earth reflected radiation in the spectral range 0.24 to 2.38 um with fine spectral and coarse spatial resolutions. In this work we evaluate CERES shortwave (SW) TOA radiance over permanent clear sky snow in the East Antarctic Plateau to test consistency between modeled and observed radiances. We use SCIAMACHY observations to validate spectral performance of our radiative transfer (RT) model.\nWe revisiting the issue reported by Hudson et al (2010) with another radiative transfer model and using instantaneous atmospheric profiles. That paper reported some overestimation of TOA albedo by their model in comparison with CERES observed SW radiances. As pointed out by Hudson et al., that comparison involves some uncertainties including errors in the modeled surface albedo and atmospheric properties.\nWe use RT model based on DISORT coupled with a k-distribution approach (Kato et al 1999). We use the same approach for the lower boundary condition as in Hudson et al. (2010) with a modification related to modeling surface albedo. In this work we create atmospheric profiles for the individual CERES and SCIAMACHY observations from GEOS-4 reanalysis.\nA comparison between modeling and actual observations was performed for data from the CERES sensors onboard EOS Terra and Aqua, and Suomi-NPP. Similar to the study by Hudson et al. (2010), the model overestimates the TOA radiance. Modeled radiances are greater than observed ones from the CERES Single Satellite Footprint data by 4.6% for FM-1, 2, and FM-4, and by 3.6% for FM-5. Modeled and observed radiance correlates well: coefficient of determination R2 > 0.999.\nWe compare modeled radiances SCIAMACHY radiances by spectrally integrating over the RT model bands with modeled radiances over the same region of interest in the spectral region 0.25 um to 1.6 um. The difference depends on spectral region. In general, the model overestimates measurements by ~2.9%. Sensitivity of the spectral difference to the snow grain size used in the snowpack model and to water vapor and ozone amounts will be presented.",

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques seek to mitigate these problems by providing sufficiently high-resolution grid patches only over features of interests while limiting the computational burden of requiring such resolutions globally. One such model is the non-hydrostatic, finite-volume Chombo-AMR general circulation model (GCM), which implements refinement in both space and time on a cubed-sphere grid. The 2D shallow-water equations exhibit many of the complexities of 3D GCM dynamical cores and serve as an effective method for testing the dynamical core and the refinement strategies of adaptive atmospheric models. We implement a shallow-water test case consisting of a pair of interacting tropical cyclone-like vortices. Small changes in the initial conditions can lead to a variety of interactions that develop fine-scale spiral band structures and large-scale wave trains. We investigate the accuracy and efficiency of AMR’s ability to capture and effectively follow the evolution of the vortices in time. These simulations serve to test the effectiveness of refinement for both static and dynamic grid configurations as well as the sensitivity of the model results to the refinement criteria.",

            "abstract": "Recent measurements of Xe isotopes place the formation of high 3He/4He mantle to within the first 80 Ma of solar system history. This timeframe coincides with Earth’s accretion, leading to the hypothesis that a magma ocean concentrated materials that now comprise the high 3He/4He source. We report the Ar contents of bridgmanite, periclase, and stishovite synthesized in the presence of Ar-rich fluids at lower mantle pressures. Experiments were conducting using diamond anvil cells (DAC) and multi-anvil (MA) apparatus and were analyzed by a microprobe. These data are needed to evaluate the behavior of noble gases during magma ocean crystallization, and thus, which materials are suitable precursors to high 3He/4He mantle.\nThe Ar contents of the large majority of bridgmanite, periclase, and stishovite analyses in the MA experiments were below delectability by WDS microprobe. Detection limits are calculated from counting statistics and nominally approached 20 ppm Ar for longer analyses. Saturation of an Ar-rich fluid in the MA experiments was confirmed by high Ar concentration blebs throughout the recovered samples. The Ar contents of samples from DAC experiments were more variable, but large areas of laser heating spots on bridgmanite contain Ar contents at or below the detection limit by EDS microprobe (~100 ppm Ar). Bridgmanite disproportionated to (Mg,Fe)O and SiO2 in some higher temperature heating spots. These phases also had undetectable Ar concentrations. Combined, our results indicate that Ar is relatively insoluble in the major lower mantle minerals compared to silicate liquids under similar pressures, i.e. Ar is incompatible during magma ocean crystallization. This suggests 1) a basal magma ocean will become progressively enriched in noble gases with crystallization and 2) trapped liquids have the potential to control the noble gas budget of any early-forming reservoir. Noble gas elemental fractionations in magma ocean liquids are not expected until high crystallinity is reached.",

            "abstract": "The geological record of the Archean Earth is spattered with impact spherules from a dozen or so major cosmic collisions involving Earth and asteroids or comets (Lowe, Byerly 1986, 2015). Extrapolation of the documented deposits suggests that most of these impacts were as big or bigger than the Chicxulub event that famously ended the reign of the thunder lizards. As the Archean impacts were greater, the environmental effects were also greater.\nThe number and magnitude of the impacts is bounded by the lunar record. There are no lunar craters bigger than Chicxulub that date to Earth's mid-to-late Archean. Chance dictates that Earth experienced ~10 impacts bigger than Chicxulub between 2.5 Ga and 3.5 Ga, the biggest of which were ~30-100X more energetic than Chicxulub.\n To quantify the thermal consequences of big impacts on old Earth, we model the global flow of energy from the impact into the environment. The model presumes that a significant fraction of the impact energy goes into ejecta that interact with the atmosphere. Much of this energy is initially in rock vapor, melt, and high speed particles. (i) The upper atmosphere is heated by ejecta as they reenter the atmosphere. The mix of hot air, rock vapor, and hot silicates cools by thermal radiation. Rock raindrops fall out as the upper atmosphere cools. (ii) The energy balance of the lower atmosphere is set by radiative exchange with the upper atmosphere and with the surface, and by evaporation of seawater. Susequent cooling is governed by condensation of water vapor. (iii) The oceans are heated by thermal radiation and rock rain and cooled by evaporation. Surface waters become hot and salty; if a deep ocean remains it is relatively cool. Subsequently water vapor condenses to replenish the oceans with hot fresh water (how fresh depending on continental weathering, which might be rather rapid under the circumstances). (iv) The surface temperature of dry land is presumed to be the same as the lower atmosphere. A thermal wave propagates into the land at a rate set by conduction.\nImpacts larger than Chicxulub can raise the surface temperature by tens, hundreds, or even thousands of degrees, and evaporate meters to hundreds of meters of water. The biggest should have vitrified exposed dry land. More results - including shock chemistry - are for the talk, as here we have run out of space.",

            "abstract": "Water is essential for the world’s food supply, for energy production, including bioenergy and hydroelectric power, and for power system cooling. Water is already scarce in many regions and could present a critical constraint as society attempts simultaneously to mitigate climate forcing and adapt to climate change, and to provide food for an increasing population. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), where interactions between population, economic growth, energy, land and water resources interact simultaneously in a dynamically evolving system, to investigate how water scarcity affects energy and land use decisions as well as mitigation policies. In GCAM, competing claims on water resources from all claimants—energy, land, and economy—are reconciled with water resource availability—from renewable water, non-renewable groundwater sources and desalinated water—across 235 major river basins. Limits to hydrologic systems have significant effects on energy and land use induced emissions via constraints on decisions of their use. We explore these effects and how they evolve under climate change mitigation policies, which can significantly alter land use patterns, both by limiting land use change emissions and by increasing bioenergy production. The study also explores the mitigation scenarios in the context of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We find that previous estimates of global water withdrawal projections are overestimated, as our simulations show that it is more economical in some basins to alter agricultural and energy activities rather than utilize non-renewable groundwater or desalinated water. This study highlights the fact that water is a binding factor in agriculture, energy and land use decisions in integrated assessment models (IAMs), and stresses the crucial role of water in regulating agricultural commodities trade and land-use and energy decisions.",

Satellite-derived estimates of land cover represent snapshots in time of this highly-dynamic landscape. We apply multiple observational datasets and a global carbon-chemistry-climate model (NASA ModelE2-YIBs) to quantify the magnitude of altered biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes in Southeast Asia and the resulting impacts on atmospheric chemical composition due to the past two decades of land cover change in the region. NASA ModelE2-YIBs includes a fully interactive land carbon cycle. Isoprene production is energetically coupled to photosynthesis. Time-slice simulations for the period spanning 1990 – 2010 are forced with monthly anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions from the MACCity emissions inventory. Simulated tropospheric chemical composition is compared to observations, including fire-free formaldehyde columns, TES vertically-resolved ozone concentrations, and surface-level ozone measurements. We assess the contribution of land cover change-induced BVOC emission changes to regional ozone and aerosol pollution and provide the first estimate of the impacts on global climate.",

One potentially important emissions source is subsurface leakage of natural gas. Better understanding of wellbore and other subsurface leaks are important in providing ways to decrease pollution while increasing the efficiency of oil and gas production.\nSoil gas measurements carried out by USGS over the last several years in Utah’s oil and gas fields have shown that, while concentrations of methane in soils near wells are typically low, soil gas near some wells can contain more than 50% methane. In the summers of 2013-2015 we carried out campaigns to measure the emission rate of methane and other hydrocarbons from soils near wells in the Uintah Basin, Utah. We also measured emissions at several locations on individual well pads and determined that concentrations of hydrocarbons tend to decrease with distance from the well head. Soil emissions were also measured at non-well sites in the same area to determine background emission rates. Emissions from exposed coal, oil shale, gilsonite, and fault zone surfaces were also measured. Relationships of emissions with soil gas concentrations, meteorological conditions, and soil properties were also investigated.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary observational datasets of sea level is represented by the tide gauge record. We propose a new method to estimate trends and variability on decadal time scales from tide gauge data by using a state space formulation, which couples the direct observations to a predefined state space model by using a Kalman filter. The model consists of a time-varying trend and seasonal cycle, and variability induced by several physical processes, such as wind, atmospheric pressure changes and teleconnection patterns. This model has two advantages over the classical least-squares method that uses regression to explain variations due to known processes: a seasonal cycle with time-varying phase and amplitude can be estimated, and the trend is allowed to vary over time. This time-varying trend consists of a secular trend and low-frequency variance that is not explained by any other term in the model. As a test case, we have used tide gauge data from stations around the North Sea over the period 1980-2013. We compare a model that only estimates a trend with two models that also remove intra-annual variability: one by means of time series of wind stress and sea level pressure, and one by using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Explaining variability significantly improves the accuracy of the found decadal variability signal, where the best results are obtained with the hydrodynamic model. We find a consistent decadal sea level signal in the North Sea, which significantly influences estimates of a linear trend over the 34-year period.",

Therefore, in this study, the daily rainfall is stochastically disaggregated into hourly data using Modified K-Nearest Neighbor (MKNN) resampling method. When MKNN resampling method is applied, 7 rainfall patterns are developed using historical hourly data and utilized these patterns to reproduce the similar hourly patterns of the disaggregated data.

Although DFBs are known to accelerate particles to create energetic particle injections, their acceleration mechanism and importance in generating injections inside geosynchronous orbit remain open questions. To answer these questions, we investigate DFBs in the inner magnetosphere by conducting a statistical study with data from the Van Allen Probes. The results show that just like DFBs outside geosynchronous orbit, those inside that orbit occur most often in the pre-midnight sector. Half the DFBs are accompanied by energetic particle injection. Statistically, DFBs with injection have an electric field three times that of those without. All the injections accompanying DFBs appear dispersionless within the temporal and energy resolution considered. These findings suggest that the injections are ushered or locally produced by the DFB, and the DFB’s strong electric field is an important aspect of the injection generation mechanism.",

In wetlands, the reductive dissolution of iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides releases large quantities of DOM into the soil solution. The objective of this study is to quantify the changes in aqueous organic carbon concentration in different sized fractions induced by reduction of iron and increase in pH. Twenty four cm long soil columns were prepared. Columns were run under oxic (as control) and anoxic conditions. Two platinum redox probes were inserted at 10 and 17 cm depths from the soil surface to monitor the redox status of the column. Anoxic and oxic conditions were maintained by flushing with either nitrogen or oxygen gas through the soil. No additional organic sources were added. After 35 days of anoxic environment, column leachate samples were separated by differential centrifugation into five colloidal sized fractions (<450 nm, <220 nm, <100 nm, <50 nm and <2.3 nm). Immediately after the 1st reduction half cycle, the leachate samples were collected inside the glove box and the soil columns were flushed with oxygen to prepare for 2nd reduction half cycle. After 1st reduction half cycle, the pH, ionic strength and aqueous (Fe2+) concentration of the column extracts were increased whereas the Eh value was decreased. The range of pH, Eh, ionic strength and concentration of Fe2+ was 6.38 to 6.91, -219 to -275 mV, 13.74 to 18.84 mM and 1.8 to 3.41 mg L-1, respectively. Following the anoxic incubation, the total desorbed C was increased up to 139 mg L-1. The distribution of C across the five particle size fractions was 3.68-11.73% (> 450 nm), 0.59-5.12% (450-220 nm), 0.45-4.91% (220-100 nm), 0.18-2.91% (100-50 nm), 15.48-35.23% (50 nm – 2.3 nm) and 49.15-63.94% (<2.3 nm). The preliminary results confirmed the release of more nanoparticulate (50-2.3 nm) and truly dissolved (<2.3 nm) organic matter from the anoxic soil column. This study will allow us to systematically evaluate the contribution of colloid mobilization on C release and the distribution of different sized fractions of C under redox dynamic environment.",

Similar to MODIS, VIIRS provides visible and IR observations at moderate spatial resolution and has a 1:30 pm equatorial crossing time consistent with the MODIS on Aqua platform. However unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels that are used by the MODIS cloud algorithms for both cloud detection and to retrieve cloud top height and cloud emissivity for ice clouds.\nGiven the different spectral and spatial characteristics of VIIRS, we seek to understand the extent to which the 15-year MODIS climate record can be continued with VIIRS/CrIS observations while maintaining consistent sensitivities across the observational systems. This presentation will focus on the evaluation of the latest version of the NASA funded cloud retrieval algorithms being developed for climate research.\nWe will present collocated inter-comparisons between the imagers (VIIRS and MODIS Aqua) with CALIPSO as well as long term statistics based on a new Level-3 (L3) product being developed as part the project. The CALIPSO inter-comparisons will focus on cloud detection (cloud mask), cloud-top heights, and cirrus optical thickness. Using CALIPSO as the reference, and applying the same algorithms to VIIRS and MODIS, we will discuss the consistency between products from both imagers. The L3 analysis will focus on the regional and seasonal consistency between the suite of MODIS and VIIRS continuity cloud products. Do systematic biases remains when using consistent algorithms but applied to different observations (MODIS or VIIRS)?",

(Crameri, et al. 2012, GRL)\nA low viscosity mantle wedge, possibly a result of slab dehydration, decouples the plates in the system. (Gerya et al. 2007, Geo)\nPlates must be composed of material which, in the case of the overriding plate, are is strong enough to resist bending stresses imposed by the subducting plate and yet, as in the case of the subducting plate, be weak enough to bend and subduct when pulled by the already subducted slab. (Petersen et al. 2015, PEPI)\nThough strong surface plates are required for subduction such plates may present a problem when they encounter the lower mantle.\nAs the subducting slab approaches the higher viscosity, lower mantle stresses are imposed on the tip.\nStrong slabs transmit this stress to the surface.\nThere the stress field at the plate interface is modified and potentially modifies the style of convection.\nIn addition to modifying the stress at the plate interface, the strength of the slab affects the morphology of the slab at the base of the upper mantle. (Stegman, et al 2010, Tectonophysics)\nSlabs that maintain a sufficient portion of their strength after being bent require high stresses to unbend or otherwise change their shape.\nOn the other hand slabs that are weakened though the bending process are more amenable to changes in morphology.\nWe present the results of computational models of convective systems across a range of Rayleigh numbers with strong plates and slabs with strength decreased due to bending to examine and compare the convective style of the system, the stress field, and slab morphology.",

            "abstract": "The environmental conditions that support and sustain tropical cyclones are affected by the amount of solar radiation incident on the tropics, which varies on millennial timescales owing to orbital variations. During the middle Holocene, higher amounts of summer solar radiation 6000 years ago (6ka) increased thermal stability and pools of hot, dry air in the tropical troposphere, rendering the thermodynamic environment less favorable than in modern times. (The opposite response is seen in the Southern Hemisphere, where January-March anomalies yield more conducive conditions 6ka there than today.) Here we compare these changes in environmental conditions to tropical storms simulated by two distinct methods as well as to available geologic evidence from the middle Holocene. We find that storms directly spawned by global climate models respond to the changes as the thermodynamic environment predicts: a reduction 6ka in Northern Hemisphere, with an increase 6ka in the Southern Hemisphere. We derive an empirical genesis index that identifies the best fit between environmental conditions and the response in genesis. We also compare the results to storms generated using the statistical downscaling method pioneered by Emanuel. Here too the events similarly respond to the changes in the environmental conditions, but the amplitude of the changes is smaller than seen in the global climate models. We discuss some possible reasons for the differences as well as their implications for studies applying these methods to 21st century climate.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster AGU_Lenka Kuglerova.pdf\nMany streams and rivers are subject to disturbance from intense land use such as urbanization and agriculture, and this is especially obvious for small headwaters. Streams are spatially organized into networks where headwaters represent the tributaries and provide water, nutrients, and organic material to the main stems. Therefore perturbations within the headwaters might be cumulatively carried on downstream. Although we know that the disturbance of headwaters in urban and agricultural landscapes poses threats to downstream river reaches, the magnitude and severity of these changes for ecological communities is less known.\nWe studied stream networks along a gradient of disturbance connected to land use intensity, from urbanized watersheds to watersheds placed in agricultural settings in the Greater Toronto Area. Further, we compared the patterns and processes found in the modified watershed to a control watershed, situated in a forested, less impacted landscape.\nPreliminary results suggest that hydrological modifications (flash floods), habitat loss (drainage and sewer systems), and water quality issues of small streams in urbanized and agricultural watersheds represent major disturbances and threats for aquatic and riparian biota on local as well as larger spatial scales. For example, communities of riparian plants are dominated by species typical of the land use on adjacent uplands as well as the dominant land use on the upstream contributing area, instead of riparian obligates commonly found in forested watersheds. Further, riparian communities in disturbed environments are dominated by invasive species. The changes in riparian communities are vital for various functions of riparian vegetation. Bank erosion control is suppressed, leading to severe channel transformations and sediment loadings in urbanized watersheds. Food sources for instream biota and thermal regimes are also changed, which further triggers alterations of in-stream biological communities. These findings clearly demonstrate that in watersheds which are disturbed by intensive land use, the eco-hydrological linkages between biota and fluvial processes significantly differ from those in more natural and forested landscapes.",

            "abstract": "We used three-dimensional hydrologic modeling to assess the potential linkages between crystalline basement seismicity (up to M3.2) beneath the Dagger Draw oil field in response to saline water reinjection. Production began in 2004 and preceded an increase in seismicity by about 5 years. Reinjection of produced brines occurred within the basal Ellenberger Group carbonate reservoir (yellow square). Published core permeability measurements for the Ellenberger vary between about 10-15 to 10-12 m2. Evidence for seismicity being triggered by injection include observations that the largest injection rates (> 106 barrels/month) occurred within wells closest to the induced seismicity (red circle about 15 km to the west of the injection well in A-C). Arguing against triggered seismicity is the apparent lack of temporal correlation between peak injection and felt seismicity as well as the extreme depth of the earthquakes (about 10-12 km below land surface). We conducted a numerical sensitivity study in which we varied the permeability of the basal reservoir as well as the crystalline basement rocks over several orders of magnitude. Assuming a crystalline basement permeability of 10-16 m2 and a basal reservoir permeability of 10-13 m2 produced about 50 m of excess heads in the seismogenic crust about 1900 days (D) after injection started. Prior studies suggest that excess heads of only a few meters could induce failure along critically stressed faults. The lag between injection and seismicity can be explained by the time required for the pressure envelope to propagate laterally 15 km and downward into the crystalline basement 11 km. Peak injection occurred 1900 days before recent increases in seismicity were observed. Future work will include assessing the potential role of relatively permeable Proterozoic faults in transmitting high fluid pressures into the crystalline basement.",

We assess the accuracy of retrieving the tidal amplitude solely using altimetry profiles produced by the REASON instrument (Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface), selected for the Europa Clipper mission. We investigate retrieval of the first Love number, h2, by inverting the entire set of altimetric ground tracks over the life of the mission. The inversion simultaneously estimates h2, long-wavelength topography, and spacecraft orbit parameters. In its simplest form, the inversion is quite robust: the time and location of the ground track uniquely fixes the phase of the sampled tide, where surface roughness acts as noise to be averaged out. In addition, we make an initial evaluation of altimetric biases that arise from known and hypothesized Europa topography using surface point target simulations. Overall, we find that the altimeter alone is capable of retrieving the first tidal Love number with accuracy sufficient to observationally constrain ice-shell thickness.",

The Old Carlisle Cemetery, Arkansas, since 1872 has been in use and a potential expansion will be planed if the geophysics data help to identify unused lands. GPR survey was conducted at the cemetery using GSSI SIR-3000 with 400 MHz antenna and 900 MHz antennas. A total of 234.5 m profiles of GPR data were acquired from three locations within the old and new parts of the cemetery.\nAt the 1stlocation, GPR data collected along 6 parallel profiles. Data reveals, after the normal comprehensive processing; two unmarked graves at about a depth of 1m and one misplaced headstone or collapsed grave were detected. Other marked graves around 1m depth with headstones were also verified by their typical reflections hyperbola on the GPR profiles.\nAt the 2ndlocation, the data collection was performed along 4 parallel profiles to locate potential areas that were not used for burial in the past. The GPR data showed that there were no graves in the area below at least two of the profiles. Three marked graves which were verified by their headstones might have metal caskets due to their strong reflection hyperbolas around a depth of about 1.2 m. Three other graves were either collapsed or decomposed due to their very weak reflections within a subsided surface area. Animal burrows and a rusted old key were found and verified by near surface digging.\nAt the 3rd location, the data was collected along 3 parallel profiles. The GPR was able to detect one unmarked grave and two marked graves, each with two coffins, by showing strong reflection hyperbolas at about 0.75 m depth. A grave with a headstone to the north of the two graves did not show strong reflection hyperbola although the burial date (1987) is younger than the other two. This might reflect different type of burial practice or material than the other two graves. GPR did not detect any additional burial site at the studied locations.",

            "abstract": "Particle size evolution in planetary ring systems can be driven by collisions at relatively low velocities (<1 m/s) occurring between objects with a range of sizes from very fine dust to decimeter-sized objects. In these complex systems, collisions between centimeter-sized objects may result in particle growth by accretion, rebounding, or erosive processes that result in the production of additional smaller particles. The outcomes of these collisions are dependent on factors such as collisional energy, particle size, and particle morphology. Numerical simulations are limited by a need to understand these collisional parameters over a range of conditions. We present the results of a sequence of laboratory experiments designed to explore collisions over a range of these parameters. We are able to observe low-velocity collisions by conducting experiments in vacuum chambers in our 0.8-sec drop tower apparatus. Initial experiments utilize a variety of impacting spheres, including glass, Teflon, aluminum, stainless steel, and brass. These spheres are either used in their natural state or are “mantled” - coated with a few-mm thick layer of a cohesive powder. A high-speed, high-resolution video camera is used to record the motion of the colliding bodies. These videos are then processed and we track the particles to determine impactor speeds before and after collision and the collisional outcome; in the case of the mantled impactors, we can assess how much of the powder was released in the collision. We also determine how the coefficient of restitution varies as a function of material type, morphology, and impact velocity. Impact velocities range from about 20-60 cm/s, and we observe that mantling of particles significantly reduces their coefficients of restitution. These results will contribute to an empirical model of collisional outcomes that can help refine our understanding of dusty ring system collisional evolution.",

Examples of such structures are found in laboratory deformation experiments on partially molten rocks. Simple-shear and torsion experiments demonstrate the formation of concentrated melt bands at angles of around 20o to the shear plane. The melt bands form in the experiments with widths between a few to tens of microns, and a band spacing roughly an order of magnitude larger. Existing compaction theories, however, cannot predict this band width structure, let alone any mode selection, since they infer the fastest growing instability to occur for wavelengths or bands of vanishing width. Here, we propose that surface tension in the mixture, especially on a diffuse interface in the limit of sharp melt-fraction gradients, can mitigate the instability at vanishing wavelength and thus permit mode selection for finite-width bands. Indeed, the expected weak capillary forces on the diffuse interface lead to predicted mode selection at the melt-band widths observed in the experiments.",

The first rate-limiting step of the nitrification process is carried out by ammonia-oxidizing (AO) archaea (AOB) and bacteria (AOB) that live in stream sediments and epilithic biofilms. Yet, the relative contribution of these two stream habitats to whole-reach nitrification is largely unknown.\nWe tested the well-established idea that whole-reach nitrification is mainly driven by AO present in hyporheic sediments because of their relative high active surface area compared to the thin epilithic biofilm interface. To do so, we examined substrata-specific nitrification rates and AO transcripts abundance (amoA gene) in mesocosms and scaled data to whole reach. Further, we compared the scaled data to in situ whole-reach nitrification rates and amoA transcript and gene abundances in a high N loaded urban stream downstream of a waste water treatment plant effluent. Against expectations, whole-reach in-stream nitrification was mainly driven by AOB embedded in biofilms growing on the sediment-facing side (> 60%) and light-exposed side (20%) of stream cobbles. Hyporheic sediments, which were mainly colonized by AOA, accounted for 11% of in situ whole-reach nitrification. Our study points epilithic biofilms as hot spots of nitrification within urban stream ecosystems.",

The formation of stratified continental crust in general and the vertical extent of processes active in arc crustal columns leading to the differentiation of primitive, mantle-derived melts entering the lower crust are highly debated. To investigate where in the crustal column magma mixing, fractionation, assimilation and crystal growth occur and to what extent, we study the ~ 90 Ma magmatic flare-up event of the Cascades arc, a magma plumbing system from ~ 5 to 30 km depth. We focus on three intrusive complexes, emplaced at different depths during major regional shortening in an exceptionally thick crust (≥ 55 km1) but which are temporally related: the upper crustal Black Peak intrusion (1-3 kbar at 3.7 to 11 km; ~ 86.8 to 91.7 Ma2), the mid-crustal Mt. Stuart intrusion (3.5-4.0 kbar at 13 to 15 km; 90.8 and 96.3 Ma3) and the deep crustal Tenpeak intrusion (7 to 10 kbar at 25 to 37 km; 89.7 to 92.3 Ma4). These intrusive complexes are well characterized by geochronology showing that they have been constructed incrementally by multiple magma batches over their lifespans and thus allow the monitoring and comparison of geochemical parameters over time at different depths. We use a combination of whole rock major and trace element data and isotopes combined with detailed investigation of amphibole, which has been recognized to be important in the generation of calc-alkaline rocks in arcs to test the following hypotheses: (a) compositional bimodality is produced in the lower crust, whereas upper crustal levels are dominated by mixing to form intermediate compositions, or (b) differentiation occurs throughout the crustal column with different crystallizing phases and their compositions controlling the bulk chemistry.\n1.

We work with polarized SOHO/LASCO-C2 images from the last two recent minima of solar activity (1996-1997 and 2008-2010), devoid of coronal mass ejections. We derive the 4D electron density distributions in the corona by applying a newly developed time-dependent tomographic reconstruction method. First we compare the density distributions obtained from tomography with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions. The tomography provides more accurate distributions of electron densities in the polar regions, and we find that the observed density varies with the solar cycle in both polar and equatorial regions. Second, we find that the highest-density structures do not always correspond to the predicted large-scale heliospheric current sheet or its helmet streamer but can follow the locations of pseudo-streamers. We conclude that tomography offers reliable density distribution in the corona, reproducing the slow time evolution of coronal structures, without prior knowledge of the coronal magnetic field over a full rotation. Finally, we suggest that the highest-density structures show a differential rotation well above the surface depending on how it is magnetically connected to the surface. Such valuable information on the rotation of large-scale structures could help to connect the sources of the solar wind to their in-situ counterparts in future missions such as Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus. This research combined with the MHD coronal modeling efforts has the potential to increase the reliability for future space weather forecasting.",

Known as the Ignik Sikumi #1 Gas Hydrate Field Trial, this experiment involved three stages: 1) the injection of a N2-CO2 mixture into a targeted hydrate-bearing layer, 2) a 4-day pressurized soaking period, and 3) a sustained depressurization and fluid production period. Data collected during the three stages of the field trial were made available after a thorough quality check. The Ignik Sikumi #1 data set is extensive, but contains no direct evidence of the guest-molecule exchange process. This study uses numerical simulation to provide an interpretation of the CH4/CO2/N2 guest molecule exchange process that occurred at Ignik Sikumi #1. Simulations were further informed by experimental observations. The goal of the scoping experiments was to understand kinetic exchange rates and develop parameters for use in Iġnik Sikumi history match simulations. The experimental procedure involves two main stages: 1) the formation of CH4 hydrate in a consolidated sand column at 750 psi and 2°C and 2) flow-through of a 77.5/22.5 N2/CO2 molar ratio gas mixture across the column. Experiments were run both above and below the hydrate stability zone in order to observe exchange behavior across varying conditions. The numerical simulator, STOMP-HYDT-KE, was then used to match experimental results, specifically fitting kinetic behavior. Once this behavior is understood, it can be applied to field scale models based on Ignik Sikumi #1.\n ",

            "abstract": "Mixing in crystal-rich magmas (mushes) during open-system events is governed by both granular and fluid dynamics. To clarify the granular (crystal-crystal-melt) controls on the volumes and timescales of crystal-rich mixing, we use discrete element-computational fluid dynamics (DEM-CFD) simulations that resolve mixing and multiphase flow at the crystal scale. We will report on three central findings: 1) that the crystal-crystal mixing time is well-recovered by an exponential relationship, 2) that the mixing of melts and crystals have different time and spatial scales and are not simply indexed to strain-rate, 3) a comparison of DEM-CFD with mixture theory and suspension rheology produces very different outcomes and illustrates the limitations of mixture theory when applied crystal-rich magmas.\nTo quantify the progress of crystal mixing, we introduce the Initial Neighbor Distance (IND) metric, which varies between zero (unmixed) and unity (mixed), indicating the goodness-of-mixing of the crystals throughout the domain with a single value at each time step. The IND is calculated by comparing the distance between every particle and its initial nearest neighbor, to the distance between every particle and a randomly selected particle. We find an exponential relationship between the IND and time during an open-system event. Although the coefficients of the exponential function depend on the crystal and melt properties, mush size and geometry, and intrusive velocity of incoming magma, the exponential behavior is very robust, and allows for predictions of characteristic crystal mixing times. For example consider a meter-scale olivine-rich basaltic mush intruded by a sub-meter scale dike at a flow-rate roughly ten times that needed to unlock and fluidize the crystals of the mush. The crystals achieve nearly complete mixing with an IND value of 0.9 after approximately four minutes of open-system intrusion.",

            "abstract": "The land surface in the Community Land Model (CLM), the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), is represented as a nested hierarchy of subgrid levels. By default, the vegetated fraction of a gridcell contains up to 16 plant functional types (PFTs), all of which share a single soil column. The PFTs specify the differences in biophysical and biogeochemical processes across different vegetation types, and provide an opportunity to examine how the different biophysical processes of each PFT respond to and interact with the atmosphere. While the distribution of PFTs within the vegetated fraction of a grid cell is represented in a tile or mosaic configuration, PFTs still compete for water and nutrients through the shared soil column. In this study, we compare PFT-level output from a modified land surface configuration (PFT-COL) where each PFT is given its own soil column to the PFT-level output from the default configuration (CTRL) where all PFTs share a single soil column. We use CLM4.0 and CLM4.5 (CESM1.2) forced by the CRUNCEP atmospheric dataset to examine how the individual vs. shared soil column configurations affect CLM output both at the PFT-level and the gridcell-level. Our results show that there are large differences in the PFT-level output between the PFT-COL and CTRL simulations, but likely due to compensating changes at the PFT-level, there are only minor differences in the gridcell-level output between the PFT-COL and CTRL simulations. Overall, we find that the PFT-level output is more reasonable and realistic in the PFT-COL simulations. We find that in the CTRL simulations, the shared soil column allows heat and moisture to transfer horizontally from one PFT to another, producing erroneous values most notably for air temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the ground heat flux. As the individual column configuration (PFT-COL) may more closely represent “real world” conditions, these results have implications for future subgrid land surface model experiments, including the ability to examine how different PFTs respond to atmospheric forcings, and how different land cover types influence climate at the local scale. In addition, this new configuration presents an opportunity to validate CLM at the PFT-level.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU15tabsmall.pdf\nHigh-resolution CCN spectra have revealed bimodality (Hudson et al. 2015) similar to aerosol size spectra (e.g., Hoppel et al. 1985). Bimodality is caused by chemical and physical cloud processes that increase mass or hygroscopicity of only CCN that produced activated cloud droplets. Bimodality is categorized by relative CCN concentrations (NCCN) within the two modes, Nu-Np; i.e., NCCN within the higher critical supersaturation, Sc, mode that did not undergo cloud processing minus NCCN within the lower Sc mode that was cloud processed. Lower, especially negative, Nu-Np designates greater processing. The table shows regressions between Nu-Np and characteristics of clouds nearest the CCN measurements.\nICE-T\nMASE\nparameter\nR\nSL\nR\nSL\nNc\n0.17\n93.24\n-0.26\n98.65\nMD\n-0.31\n99.69\n0.33\n99.78\nσ\n-0.27\n99.04\n0.48\n100.00\nLd\n-0.31\n99.61\n0.38\n99.96\nTable.

Nc is cloud droplet concentration, MD is cloud droplet mean diameter, σ is standard deviation of cloud droplet spectra, Ldis drizzle drop LWC.\nTwo aircraft field campaigns, Ice in Clouds Experiment-Tropical (ICE-T) and Marine Stratus/Stratocumulus Experiment (MASE) show opposite R signs because coalescence dominated cloud processing in low altitude ICE-T cumuli whereas chemical transformations predominated in MASE low altitude polluted stratus. Coalescence reduces Nc and NCCN, which thus increases MD, and σ, which promote Ld. Chemical transformations, e.g., SO2 to SO4, increase CCN hygroscopicity, thus reducing Sc, but not affecting Nc or NCCN. Lower Sc CCN are capable of producing greater Nc in subsequent cloud cycles, which leads to lower MD and σ which reduce Ld (figure). These observations are consistent with cloud droplet growth models for the higher vertical wind (W) of cumuli and lower W of stratus. Coalescence thus reduces the indirect aerosol effect (IAE) with a positive feedback that further enhances coalescence and drizzle. Chemical cloud processing enhances both components of IAE; 1st IAE by greater droplet surface area, 2ndIAE by suppressing drizzle and thus increasing cloudiness.\nHoppel, Fitzgerald and Larson: JGR 90, 2365-79\nHudson, Noble and Tabor: JGRA 120, 3436–52",

            "abstract": "Traditional isotope ratio mass spectrometry methods to measure 2H/1H and 13C/12C ratios of organic molecules only provide average isotopic values of whole molecules. During the measurement process, valuable information of position-specific isotope fractionations (PSIF) between non-equivalent H and C positions is lost, which can provide additional very useful information about the origins and history of organic molecules. Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry can measure 2H and 13C PSIF of organic molecules without destruction. The 2H and 13C signals from different positions of a given molecule show up as distinctive peaks in an NMR spectrum, and their peak areas are proportional to the 2H and 13C populations at each position. Moreover, quantitative NMR can be applied to a wide variety of organic molecules.\nWe have been developing quantitative NMR methods to determine 2H and 13C PSIF of light hydrocarbons (propane, butane and pentane), using J-Young and custom-made high-pressure NMR cells. With careful conditioning of the NMR spectrometer (e.g. tuning, shimming) and effective 1H -13C decoupling, precision of ± <10‰ (2H) and ± <1‰ (13C) can be readily attainable after several hours of acquisition. Measurement time depends on the relaxation time of interested nucleus and the total number of scans needed for high signal-to-noise ratios. Our data for commercial, pure hydrocarbon samples showed that 2H PSIF in the hydrocarbons can be larger than 60‰ and that 13C PSIF can be as large as 15‰. Comparison with theoretical calculations indicates that the PSIF patterns of some hydrocarbon samples reflect non-equilibrium processes in their productions.",

            "abstract": "The EPA employs a vast monitoring network to measure ambient PM2.5 concentrations across the United States with one of its goals being to quantify exposure within the population. However, there are several areas of the country with sparse monitoring spatially and temporally. One means to fill in these monitoring gaps is to use PM2.5 modeled estimates from Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) specifically the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. CMAQ is able to provide complete spatial coverage but is subject to systematic and random error due to model uncertainty. Due to the deterministic nature of CMAQ, often these uncertainties are not quantified. Much effort is employed to quantify the efficacy of these models through different metrics of model performance. Currently evaluation is specific to only locations with observed data. Multiyear studies across the United States are challenging because the error and model performance of CMAQ are not uniform over such large space/time domains. Error changes regionally and temporally. Because of the complex mix of species that constitute PM2.5, CMAQ error is also a function of increasing PM2.5 concentration. To address this issue we introduce a model performance evaluation for PM2.5 CMAQ that is regionalized and non-linear. This model performance evaluation leads to error quantification for each CMAQ grid. Areas and time periods of error being better qualified. The regionalized error correction approach is non-linear and is therefore more flexible at characterizing model performance than approaches that rely on linearity assumptions and assume homoscedasticity of CMAQ predictions errors. Corrected CMAQ data are then incorporated into the modern geostatistical framework of Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME). Through cross validation it is shown that incorporating error-corrected CMAQ data leads to more accurate estimates than just using observed data by themselves.",

            "abstract": "The increasing availability of meteorological data worldwide (satellite, weather radar, etc.) has led to the development of many systems to track thunderstorms. Despite their primary application on nowcasting, they may also provide information on the onset of thunderstorms. The main tracking system based on satellite data in Brazil is the FORTRACC (Forecast and Track of Cloud Cluster), which was developed by Vila and Machado (2006) to detect and follow clusters of penetrative clouds using the difference of water vapor and infrared channels of GOES imagery. The resulting data comprise different information of the trajectory and evolution of convective systems, as well as the starting point of each thunderstorm, called spontaneous generation (N). Based on a collection of 12 years (2003-2014) of these data (N) over the Amazon region, the resulting climatology of thunderstorm onset location is presented, which is expected to be less subject to errors than the other variables given by the tracking system (despite the storm trajectory and stages are not completely recognized in many cases, the convective system will exist). The initial results indicate a singular behavior, with a reduced number of convective systems starting over the main rivers and lower areas (see attached Figure). To better understand the underlying conditions, storm onset data (N) will be will be separated in different time intervals in a further analysis and the observed spatial distribution will be compared with lightning climatoligies (based on LIS/WWLLN data), as well as on the elevation (from GEOTOPO 30 dataset). Besides the influence of terrain, which is widely described in several previous studies on the thunderstorm initiation, large water bodies and adjacent forest/land may influence on storm onset. At the Amazon region, synoptic effects are reduced, which may increases the influence of contrasting surface characteristics on the sensible/latent heat fluxes and on the local circulation; and thus, inhibiting/enhancing thunderstorm formation.",

            "abstract": "The past variability of the Indian Monsoon is mostly known from records of wind strength over the Arabian Sea while Quaternary proxy records of Indian monsoon precipitation are still lacking. Here we utilize scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF) data from a sediment core obtained by the IODP vessel JOIDES Resolution in the Andaman Sea (Site 17) to investigate changes in sediment supply from the peak monsoon precipitation regions to the core site. We use Ti/Ca and K/Rb ratios to trace changes in terrigenous flux and weathering regime, respectively, while Zr/Rb ratios suggest grain size variations. The age model of Site 17 is based on correlation of benthic C. wuellerstorfi/C. mundulus δ18O data to the LR04 global benthic δ18O stack at a resolution of ~3 kyr (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) for the last 2 Myrs. In its youngest part the age model is supported by five 14C ages on planktic foraminifera and the youngest Toba ash layer (Ali et al., 2015) resulting in a nearly constant sedimentation rate of ~6.5 cm/kyr. Frequency analysis of the 4 mm resolution Ti/Ca, K/Rb, and Zr/Rb time series using the REDFIT program (Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002), reveals the three main Milankovitch orbital cycles above the 90% confidence level. Depth domain spectral analysis reveals the presence of significant cyclicity at wavelengths of 28.5 and 2.8 m corresponding to the ~400 kyr and ~41 kyr cycles, respectively, during the last 2 Myr. These records suggest that Indian monsoon variability has varied in the obliquity and eccentricity bands, the latter in particular after the mid Pleistocene transition (MPT), while strong precession forcing is lacking in this super-high resolution record. Northern summer insolation and Southern Hemisphere latent heat export are out of phase during precessional cycles, but in phase in the obliquity band, which indicates that Indian monsoon precipitation has likely been more sensitive to both NH pull and SH push mechanisms (Clemens and Prell, 2003).\n",

To place constraints on the potential role that tundra soils play in global CH4 cycling, we have been continuously measuring mole the air space in soils, snow, and the atmosphere as gradient-based surface-atmosphere fluxes for arctic tundra at Toolik Field Station (68° 38' N) starting in October 2014. We have found that atmospheric CH4 mole fractions were, on average, relatively constant during the first 9 months of sampling (averaging 1.93 µmol mol−1), with pronounced diel patterns starting in May and nighttime exceeding daytime mole fractions. However, gradients measured within the soil profile showed high variability in air withdrawn from different locations of these tundra soils (Typic Aquiturbels), with one soil profile indicating a CH4 sink during fall until January; mole fractions were similar to the atmospheric measurements during winter indicating no source or sink (average 1.89 µmol mol−1). A second soil profile 5 m away showed production of CH4 (average 2.48 µmol mol−1, two-times higher than atmospheric levels), even during mid-winter when soil temperatures were below −10 °C. Measurements of CH4 in interstitial snowpack air also exhibited a similar combination of sources and sinks. We used micrometeorological gradient surface flux measurements to confirm that the area was a net source of CH4 in fall, winter, and spring, with emissions averaging 26.6, 25.2, and 16.8 mg m−2 d−1, respectively. In the summer months, we saw strong diel flux patterns with deposition during day and emission at night, corresponding with observed diel variability in CH4 snowpack mole fractions. Our results indicated a high variability of tundra landscape CH4 fluxes, which locally shift from sources to sinks with high temporal variability. CH4 oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria probably occurs in tundra soils, confirming observations in one soil, snowpack, and the atmosphere during spring, but oxidation ceased during the coldest months. In close proximity, we suggest a CH4 production by methanogenic archaea, and surprisingly this production continued throughout winter even during the coldest periods showing little temperature dependence.",

Thus the presence of sea ice results in less absorption of energy during the long days of the polar summers. AS expected, the dramatic decline in Arctic summer sea ice area over the past decades has been accompanied by an increase in absorbed solar radiation (ASR). This has been observed by in situ measurements as well as satellite observations. The Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument on the NASA EOS Terra platform has provided global coverage of solar radiation since late 1999, providing a large-scale indicator of changes in absorbed solar radiation. These data show that the dramatic decrease in Arctic summer sea ice has been accompanied an increase in absorbed solar radiation during the boreal summer, with the largest gains corresponding to regions of the most notable summer ice loss. While overall there is good correlation, the relationship is far from perfect. This is not unexpected since other factors – particularly clouds – play a role in the amount of ASR.\nIn contrast to the decreasing sea ice in the Arctic, the Antarctic has seen a trend of increasing coverage. The increases are smaller, in both absolute and relative terms. However, the southern hemisphere sea ice cover is at a higher average latitude than in the north due to the presence of the Antarctic continent and is thus is potentially exposed to higher incoming solar radiation. Here we investigate the relationship between changes in sea ice and changes in ASR (estimated from CERES data) in the Arctic and Antarctic during their respective summer seasons. To first order, both hemispheres show an expected relationship between sea ice and absorbed solar radiation in the Arctic (sea ice decrease, ASR increase) and the Antarctic (sea ice increase, ASR decrease). However, the correlation in the Antarctic is not nearly as clear in the Arctic and the magnitude of the ASR trend is smaller, suggesting a more complicated connection between ASR and sea ice, likely due to a larger role of clouds in the Antarctic, the different characteristics of the sea ice itself, and possibly other factors",

Uncertainties associated with conventional tensiometers such as caused by ambient temperature effects and the draining of the tensiometer tube, as well as their limitation for deep soil monitoring has prevented their widespread use for vadose zone monitoring, despite their superior accuracy, in general. We introduce an alternative tensiometer design that offers the accuracy of the conventional tensiometer, while minimizing afore-mentioned uncertainties and limitations. The proposed alternative tensiometer largely eliminates temperature-induced diurnal fluctuations and uncertainties associated with the draining of the tensiometer tube, and removes the limitation in installation depth. In addition, the manufacturing costs of this alternative tensiometer design is close to that of the conventional tensiometer, while it is especially suited for monitoring of soil water potential gradients as required for soil water flux measurements.",

            "abstract": "The nature and consequences of mesoscale vortex interactions during tropical cyclone formation are not fully understood. The dynamics is inherently complicated by baroclinic effects and moist convection, and its elucidation generally requires a computational approach. This study offers new insights into the basic mechanics and possible outcomes of midlevel mesoscale vortex interactions over a warm ocean, obtained through idealized numerical experiments. The experiments use a traditional cloud-resolving model with warm-rain microphysics. As expected, symmetric binary interactions are sensitive to the initial vortex separation distance D and other parameters that influence the time-scale for an individual vortex to intensify in isolation. The latter parameters include the ambient middle-tropospheric relative humidity (RH) and the initial midlevel wind speed of each vortex. At relatively low RH, there is found to exist a critical interval of D where binary midlevel vortex interaction can prevent tropical cyclone formation. While tropical cyclones generally form at high RH, the process can exhibit substantial delay at intermediate values of D when the vortices are initially weak. Prevention or inhibition of tropical cyclone development appears to be connected to the outward expulsion of lower tropospheric potential vorticity anomalies as the two vortices merge in the middle-troposphere. It is proposed that the primary mechanism for midlevel merger and low-level potential vorticity expulsion involves the excitation of rotating misalignments in each vortex. An analogue model based on this premise provides a good approximation for the range of D in which the merger-expulsion scenario occurs. Relatively strong vortices in high RH environments promptly develop vigorous convection and begin rapid intensification. Differences between the interaction of such diabatic vortices and their adiabatic counterparts are briefly illustrated. In systems that generate tropical cyclones, the mature vortex properties (size and strength) are found to vary significantly with D. This work is supported by NSF under grant AGS-1250533.",

Previous studies have shown that surface ocean Pb concentrations and isotope ratios have varied in time and space, reflecting the changes in the amount of inputs and sources of anthropogenic Pb. However, data on surface ocean Pb is quite limited, especially for some basins like the Indian Ocean. In the present study, Pb concentrations and stable isotopes (208, 207, and 206) have been analyzed in surface water samples (3m depth) collected during the Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition, 2010. Our results are compared with data from the literature to i) evaluate the changing status of metal contamination in surface waters of the global ocean over the last 30 years, and ii) propose potential sources of modern Pb to the oceans.\nOur results show that Pb concentrations in surface waters of the North Atlantic Ocean have decreased ~ 40% since 1975, attributable to the phase-out of leaded gasoline in North America. This result is corroborated by stable Pb isotope measurements. Furthermore, the isotopic gradient observed in surface waters of the studied transects in the north tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean can be attributed to simple mixing of European and African aerosols and Saharan Holocene loess.\nResults from an understudied transect in the Southern Indian Ocean give an indication of the source region of Pb delivered to this region. Although comparison with literature data is limited, mixing of Australian ores and African and Australian coals could potentially explain the measured Pb isotope composition.\nThis study provides an opportunity to build on the work of previous oceanographic campaigns, enabling us to assess the impact of anthropogenic Pb inputs to the ocean and the relative importance of various Pb sources, providing new insights into the transport and fate of Pb in the oceans.",

Most flight legs were performed at temperatures near -30°C and -40°C, where relationships between ice water content and vertical velocity are somewhat similar in observations and simulations, although observed ice water contents tend to be a bit higher for a given vertical velocity. This difference can be traced to substantial differences in ice and liquid properties in convective updraft cores at -10°C, where simulated updrafts tend to have far more graupel and liquid water than observed updrafts for a given vertical velocity, although total condensate contents are similar. This partly leads to the commonly observed reflectivity high bias in simulations, which overshadows observed and simulated large snow water contents that commonly exceed 2 g m-3 without reflectivities exceeding 25 dBZ. It appears that magnitudes of microphysical processes operating in mixed phase conditions between 0 and -10°C are quite different in observed and simulated updrafts of similar size and strength, and this difference may be common to most microphysics schemes. Mixed phase properties in convective updrafts end up impacting ice sedimentation and detrainment from convective cores, which go on to impact precipitation efficiency, distribution of rain rates, and likely the life cycle of the convective system. Possible reasons for differences in observed and simulated updrafts are explored.",

            "abstract": "Controlled floods are released from Glen Canyon Dam to build and maintain eddy sandbars along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. Long-term monitoring shows that the topographic response to controlled floods varies considerably between eddies, likely reflecting different geometric configurations and flow hydraulics. Differences in eddy sandbar response also reflect the degree of vegetation establishment since the 1980s when reservoir spills more than double the magnitude of controlled floods cleared most sandbars of vegetation. Here we explore the geomorphology of sandbar responses in the context of controlled floods, debris fan-eddy geometry, and riparian vegetation establishment. In Marble Canyon, the proportion of eddy area stabilized by vegetation is negatively correlated with water surface slope and the rate of stage change with discharge. Less vegetated sites are more dynamic; they tend to build open sandbars during controlled floods and show greater topographic variability in the eddy compared to the main channel. In contrast, deposition of open sandbars is limited where vegetation establishment has decreased channel width, altering the pattern of eddy recirculation and sediment redistribution. In these locations, deposition during controlled floods is more akin to floodplain sedimentation, and the elevation of vegetated bar surfaces increases with successive floods. Changes in sand storage in the main channel are greater than storage change in the eddy at these lower gradient sites, and controlled floods tend to evacuate sand that has accumulated on the bed. The degree to which vegetation has stabilized sandbar surfaces may thus provide a proxy for different hydraulic conditions and a better canyon-wide assessment of controlled flood response. Our results apply primarily to large eddies in Marble Canyon, and ongoing flow modeling and vegetation composition mapping will allow further assessment of eddy sandbar-riparian vegetation interactions at a variety of scales.",

Deeper surveys were performed at four of the sites using the two station spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method. For the MASW and MAM surveys, a 48-channel seismic system with 4.5 Hz geophones was used with a 10-lb sledgehammer and a metal plate as a source. Surveys were conducted at various locations on the crest of levees, the toe of the levees, and off of the levees. For MASW surveys, we used a record length of 2.048 s, a sample interval of 1 ms, and 1 m geophone spacing. For MAM, ambient noise was recorded for 65.536 s with a sampling interval of 4 ms and 1 m geophone spacing. VS was determined to depths of ~ 20 m using the MASW method and ~ 40 m using the MAM method. Maximum separation between stations in the two-station SPAC surveys was typically 1600 m to 1800 m, providing coherent signal with wavelengths in excess of 5 km and depth penetration of as much as 2000 m.\nMeasured values of VS30 in the study area ranged from 97 m/s to 257 m/s, corresponding to NEHRP site classifications D and E. Comparison of our measured velocity profiles with available geotechnical logs, including soil type, SPT, and CPT, reveals the existence of a small number of characteristic horizons within the upper 40m in the Delta: levee fill material, peat, transitional silty sand, and eolian sand at depth.\nSites with a peat layer at the surface exhibited extremely low values of VS. Based on soil borings, the thickness of peat layers were approximately 0 m to 8 m. The VS for the peat layers ranged from 42 m/s to 150 m/s while the eolian sand layer exhibited VS ranging from of 220 m/s to 370 m/s. Soft near surface soils present in the region pose an increased earthquake hazard risk due to the potential for high ground accelerations.",

The pressure is assumed to be hydrostatic, and the water layer height is considered to be much smaller than horizontal scales.\nWe have investigated the interaction of wave packets in the magnetohydrodynamic shallow water flows in external magnetic field. Linear analisys lead to to magnetogravity waves (or magneto-Poincare waves) and magnetostrophic waves. Magnetostrophic mode disappears without the external magnetic field. Using the asymptotic multiscale methods we received that in magneto-Poincare mode three waves interact, in magnetostrophic mode there are three waves interactions, and also there are intermode interactions: two magnetostrophic waves and magneto-Poincare wave, two magneto-Poincare waves and magnetostrophic wave. In all cases we obtained the non-linear interaction equations for the waves amplitudes.\nAnalysis of obtained nonlinear equations of three waves interactions shows the existence of two types of instability mechanisms: decay instabilities and parametric growth. It has been found that there are four types of decay instabilities: magneto-Poincare wave decays into two magneto-Poincare waves, magnetostrophic wave decays into two magnetostrophic waves, magneto-Poincare decays into one magnetostrophic and one magneto-Poincare wave, and magnetostrophic wave decays into one magneto-Poincare and one magnetostrophic wave. The growth rates of decay instabilities were received. Also four types of parametric growth were investigated: magneto-Poincare waves amplification, magnetostrophic waves amplification, magneto-Poincare wave growth in field of magnetostrophic wave, and magnetostrophic wave growth in field of magneto-Poincare wave. For all types of parametric growth the growth rates were found.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUposterSalinian.pdf\nThe Salinian block (SB) consists largely of metasedimentary basement intruded by suites of compositionally heterogeneous Early to Late Cretaceous rocks. Exposed throughout Central and Northern California, it is bordered to the northwest by the Naciemiento fault, to the southwest by the Big Pine fault and to the east by the San Andreas Fault. These faults are thought to have caused a dextral offset of the SB; however, its original position is still debated. Published radioisotopic ages from various techniques on SB intrusives suggest that the initial magmatic activity of the Salinian arc began at around 100 Ma and concluded some 40 myr later, but the timing of individual magmatic pulses are yet to be fully understood because arguably most of the available geochronological data are compromised with respect to precision and accuracy. Previous studies include U-Pb zircon ages from different lithologies and areas using multi-crystal TIMS as well as ICPMS, and SIMS techniques. Whereas the former technique is now known to be prone to producing inaccurate, although precise, ages due to averaging effects from older inheritance and open system behavior, the latter are often associated with analytical uncertainty at the several percent level as well as unrecognized open system behavior, making the interpretation of age data notoriously difficult. Complementary geochemical, petrological and structural studies have been conducted, but are also difficult to interpret in absence of precise and accurate geochronological data because geochemical trends and intrusion rates cannot be reconstructed. Here, we examine a group of intrusive rocks from the Northern California SB that include a biotite-hornblende granodiorite host rock which is intruded by a complex array of igneous dikes of varying lithology ranging from ~5% to ~50% mafic components. We perform closed system single zircon U-Pb CA-TIMS analysis and obtain 206Pb/238U ages of ~98 Ma and ~92 Ma (with permil level resolution) for the host rock and a crosscutting intrusion, respectively. We suggest that two magmatic pulses separated by 6 myr is evidence for independent and distinct magmatic events within the studied area.

Of the domains that are affected by space weather, the coupling between the solar and galactic high-energy particles, the magnetosphere, and atmospheric regions can significantly affect humans and our technology as a result of radiation exposure. Space Environment Technologies (SET) has been conducting space weather observations of the atmospheric radiation environment at aviation altitudes that will eventually be transitioned into air traffic management operations. The Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) system and Upper-atmospheric Space and Earth Weather eXperiment (USEWX) both are providing dose rate measurements. Both activities are under the ARMAS goal of providing the “weather” of the radiation environment to improve aircraft crew and passenger safety. Over 5-dozen ARMAS and USEWX flights have successfully demonstrated the operation of a micro dosimeter on commercial aviation altitude aircraft that captures the real-time radiation environment resulting from Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Energetic Particles. The real-time radiation exposure is computed as an effective dose rate (body-averaged over the radiative-sensitive organs and tissues in units of microsieverts per hour); total ionizing dose is captured on the aircraft, downlinked in real-time, processed on the ground into effective dose rates, compared with NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) most recent Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System (NAIRAS) global radiation climatology model runs, and then made available to end users via the web and smart phone apps. Flight altitudes now exceed 60,000 ft. and extend above commercial aviation altitudes into the stratosphere. In this presentation we describe recent ARMAS and USEWX results.",

            "abstract": "Sediment transport on hillslopes has been described as \"creep\", and has been modeled as a \"diffusive\" process by invoking random disturbance of soil in the presence of a gradient. In this framework, physical and biological agents are envisioned to cause dilation of the soil that is greatest at the surface and decays with depth. Thus, there is a kind of internal energy of the sediment that allows flow, even below the angle of repose. This transport has not yet been connected, however, to the more general phenomenon of creep in disordered, particulate systems. Work in such \"soft matter\" materials has shown that disordered solids are fragile, and may deform slowly by localized particle rearrangement under static loads much smaller than the yield stress at which fluid-like flow occurs. The transition from creep to granular flow has not been thoroughly examined. Here we use particle dynamics simulations to examine creep and granular flow dynamics and the transition between them, and to test the ability of a granular physics model to describe observations of hillslope soil creep. We employ a well-developed discrete element model, with frictional and over-damped interactions among grains to approximate the conditions of earth hillslopes. Transient and equilibrium particle dynamics are described for a range of inclination angles that transit the angle of repose. We verify that sub-threshold creep occurs, even in the absence of internal energy, and describe its dynamic signature. Moreover, simulations show that the transition from creeping to a sustained granular flow is continuous as the angle of repose is crossed. We then perturb the granular system with acoustic vibrations, to directly compare the model with previously-reported laboratory experiments of acoustically-driven hillslope transport. We test the ability of the model to reproduce the heuristic nonlinear hillslope flux law. Results reveal that the bulk movement of hillslope sediment over long timescales may be accomplished by intermittent and localized particle motion - i.e., creeping of a disordered solid - for sub-critical slopes. Further, they suggest that the nonlinear flux law is a consequence of a continuous transition between two limits; creep at low angles and fluid-like granular flow at the angle of repose.",

            "abstract": "The stepwise removal of two dams on the Elwha River beginning in September 2011 exposed ~21 million cubic meters of sediment to fluvial erosion and created an unprecedented opportunity to monitor reservoir sediment erosion and river evolution during base level adjustment and a pulsed sediment release. We have conducted more than 60 aerial surveys with a Cessna 172 using a simple custom wing-mount for consumer grade cameras and SfM photogrammetry to produce orthoimagery and digital elevation models in near-real-time at weekly to monthly time intervals. Multiple lidar flights and ground survey campaigns have provided estimates of both systematic and random error for this uniquely dense dataset. Co-registration of multiple surveys during processing reduces systematic error and allows boot-strapping of subsequently established ground control to earlier flights. Measurements chronicle the erosion of 12 million cubic meters of reservoir sediment and record corresponding changes in channel braiding, wood loading and bank erosion. These data capture reservoir and river channel responses to dam removal at resolutions comparable to hydrologic forcing events, allowing us to quantify reservoir sediment budgets on a per-storm basis. This allows for the analysis of sediment transported relative to rates of reservoir drawdown and river stream power for dozens of intervals of time. Temporal decoupling of peak sediment flux and bank erosion rates is noted from these analyses. This dataset illustrates some of the challenges and opportunities emerging with the advent of big data in remote sensing of earth surface processes.",

            "abstract": "The Megacities Carbon Project (megacities.jpl.nasa.gov) is a multi-national, multi-institution project aimed at quantifying multi-year carbon emissions trends from large urban areas. The Los Angeles Megacity greenhouse gas observation network includes fifteen surface in situ sites and was designed to capture spatial and temporal variability in carbon emissions across the South Coast Air Basin. The surface sites include a combination of towers and rooftops equipped with laser absorption spectrometers measuring carbon dioxide (CO2), with methane and carbon monoxide measurement capability at a subset of the sites. In this study, we report intial results from January-April 2015 collected at four tower sites: two \"urban\" sites, which predominantly exhibit urban CO2 enhancements, and two \"background\" sites, which are primarily influenced by unpolluted maritime or continental air masses and reflect local background CO2 levels. During January-April 2015, hourly-averaged in situ measurements ranged from roughly 395-650 ppm CO2, with the urban sites reflecting systematically higher CO2 levels compared to the background sites. The average CO2 enhancement observed at midday (12-4pm PST) ranged from 15-23 ppm CO2 excess at the urban sites, Compton and Granada Hills. The tower measurements also show diurnal, day of week, and monthly variability. Overall, the results from the in situ network are consistent with prior studies that utilized ground-based and space-based remote sensing data to demonstrate that the \"urban CO2 dome\" hypothesis applies to Los Angeles. The continuous measurement capability provided by the in situ network also highlights the fact that atmospheric CO2 enhancements vary in both space and time and are not uniform throughout the South Coast Air Basin. Future work will involve sectoral attribution of the emissions sources contributing to the urban CO2 enhancements using the Hestia high-resolution fossil fuel carbon emissions inventory. A forward model simulation using WRF-GHG is also planned for the January-April 2015 period.",

While highly parametrized models allow a gamut of data and processes to be incorporated at fine temporal and spatial scales, their slow runtimes inhibit their use in optimization, uncertainty analysis, integrated modelling, and decision support. Surrogate modelling attempts to reproduce the relevant behaviour of a complex mode, at a fraction of the computational cost. Data-driven surrogate methods (e.g. Radial Basis Functions) have shown promise in replicating a relatively small number of input-output relationships. However, they are not suited to models with hundreds of inputs or outputs. Other drawbacks of data-driven methods include poor performance away from runs used to calibrate the surrogate. Hierarchical (e.g. Multigrid) and Projection (e.g. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) based surrogates are less prone to these drawbacks. Novel methods, such as multi-fidelity stochastic collocation, combine techniques from both Hierarchical and Projection based methods. In this work, we apply such an approach to a transient, spatially distributed groundwater flow model. While the surrogate runtime is orders of magnitude lower than the original model, it reproduces the hundreds of values necessary to characterize spatially and temporally varying outputs. The surrogate allows uncertainty in aquifer properties to be propagated to head time-series at a number of locations.",

Proteins can also be an important source of organic N for microorganisms, but must be fragmented into small peptides in order to be transported through their membranes. An exoenzyme’s affinity to mineral surfaces found in soil affects their capacity to degrade SOM or other proteins. Our goal was to determine the range of modifications on proteins when they interact with a mineral surface. We hypothesized that pedogenic oxides would fragment or promote greater chemical modifications to a protein than phyllosilicates. A well-characterized protein proxy (Gb1, IEP 4.0, 6.2 kDA) was adsorbed onto functionally different mineral surfaces (goethite, montmorillonite, kaolinite and birnesite) at pH 5 and pH 7. We then generated three engineered proxies of Gb1 by inserting either negatively charged, positively charged or aromatic amino acids into the second loop. We used liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) and solution-state Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence Spectroscopy Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HSQC NMR) to observe modifications to Gb1 that was allowed to equilibrate during the adsorption process for kaolinite, goethite, birnessite, and montmorillonite. We also used Helium Ion Microscopy (HIM) to determine which surface archetypes Gb1 preferentially adsorbed to as a function of the mineral type. The three engineered proxies were used to determine how variation of the amino acid sequence affects a protein interaction with a mineral surface. Preliminary results in the LC-MS/MS indicate that birnessite hydrolytically fragments Gb1 into polypeptides. Our results suggest that not all mineral surfaces in soil may act as sorbents for EEs and that chemical modification of their structure should also be considered as an explanation for decrease in EE activity. Our results also indicate an abiotic pathway for the turnover of proteins, although its relative contribution to protein turnover in soil must be further investigated.",

            "abstract": "In picosecond ultrasonic interferometry [1], femto- or picosecond pump laser pulses are first used to generate acoustic pulses ranging from several to a few tens of nanometres length, thanks to the optoacoustic transduction in a light absorbing generator. Time-delayed femto- or picosecond probe laser pulses are then used to follow the propagation of these ultrashort acoustic pulses through a transparent medium that is in contact with the generator surface. The transient signal thus contains, at each moment in time, information on the local elastic, optical and elasto-optical properties of the tested material at the position where the laser-generated picosecond acoustic pulse is located during its propagation in the sample depth. Hence, the technique allows evaluation of sound velocities and elastic anisotropy of micro-crystallites composing a transparent material compressed to high pressures in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). This interferometry technique also helps to understand the micro-crystallite orientations in a case of elastically anisotropic material. Here we report the preliminary results of picosecond ultrasonic interferometry applied to the evaluation of homogeneities and elastic properties of polycrystalline solid argon compressed to 10 GPa and 15 GPa. In comparison with the earlier reported experiments on H2O ice at Mbar pressures [2], more efforts were spent to the evaluation of the lateral microstructure of the sample at high pressures, i.e., to inhomogeneities along the surface of the optoacoustic generator, rather than to the in-depth imaging along the axis of the DAC. The lateral imaging is performed over a distance of 60 – 90 µm, nearly corresponding to the complete sample diameter. In addition to the presence of expected lateral inhomogeneities the obtained results demonstrate important changes in their distribution upon pressure increase from 10 to 15 GPa. On the basis of the analysis of the statistic probability in the detection of differently oriented micro-crystallites in the argon samples, we discuss the possible physical reasons of the experimental observations.\nThis work was supported by the ANR BLANC 2011 program (project LUDACism).\n[1] Thomsen et al.

            "abstract": "Planetary magnetospheric and high-energy cosmic ray interactions with Saturn's rings were first explored in-situ during the Pioneer 11 flyby in 1979. The following Voyager flybys produced a wealth of new information on ring structure and mass, and on spatial structure of the radiation belts beyond the main rings. Next came the Cassini Orbiter flyover of the rings during Saturn Orbital Insertion in 2004 with the first in-situ measurements of the ring atmosphere and plasma ionosphere. Cassini has since fully explored the radiation belt and magnetospheric plasma region beyond the main rings, discovering how Enceladus acts as a source of water group neutrals and water ions for the ion plasma. But do the main rings also substantially contribute by UV photolysis to water group plasma (H+, O+, OH+, H2O+, H3O+, O2+) and neutrals inwards from Enceladus? More massive rings, than earlier inferred from Pioneer 11 and Voyager observations, would further contribute by bulk ring ice radiolysis from interactions of galactic cosmic ray particles. Products of these interactions include neutron-decay proton and electron injection into the radiation belts beyond the main rings. How does radiolysis from moon and ring sweeping of the radiation belt particles compare with direct gas and plasma sources from the main rings and Enceladus? Can the magnetospheric ion and electron populations reasonably be accounted for by the sum of the ring-neutron-decay and outer magnetospheric inputs? Pioneer 11 made the deepest radial penetration into the C-ring, next followed by Cassini SOI. What might Cassini’s higher-inclination proximal orbits reveal about the atmospheric, ionospheric, and energetic radiation environments in the D-ring and the proximal gap region? Recent modeling predicts a lower-intensity innermost radiation belt extending from the gap to the inner D-ring. Other remaining questions include the lifetimes of narrow and diffuse dust rings with respect to plasma and energetic particle irradiation processes, the mass flux of water group ions along planetary magnetic field lines into the Saturn planetary atmosphere, seasonal dust charging dynamics of the now-reappeared Saturn ring spokes, and the exchange of energy via energetic neutral atoms between the outer magnetosphere and the rings.",

Water working of grains leads to structural differences between areas of the bed through particle sorting, packing, imbrication, mortaring and degree of bed armoring. In this study, non-destructive, micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging in 3D is used to visualize, quantify and assess the internal geometry of sections of a flume bed that have been extracted keeping their fabric intact. Flume experiments were conducted at 1:1 scaling of our prototype river. From the volume, center of mass, points of contact, and protrusion of individual grains derived from 3D scan data we estimate 3D static force properties at the grain-scale such as pivoting angles, buoyancy and gravity forces, and local grain exposure. By aggregating representative samples of grain-scale properties of localized interacting sediment into overall metrics, we derive inter-granular relationships to compare and contrast bed structure and stability at a macro-scale. This is the first time bed stability has been studied in 3D using CT scanned images of sediment from the bed surface to depths well into the subsurface. The derived metrics and inter-granular relationships and characterization of bed structures will lead to improved bedload estimates with reduced uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "As global populations grow, cities in drought prone regions of the world such as California and South East Australia are faced with escalating water scarcity and water security challenges. The management approaches geared towards addressing these challenges are diverse. Given the myriad of possible approaches and the tendency to apply them in combination, successful management actions can be difficult to identify. Background climactic variability further complicates the story, making transfer of management lessons from one drought stressed region to another difficult. Here we use Melbourne, a city of 4.3 million people in South East Australia that recently faced and overcame a > 10 year “Millennium” drought, as a test case for evaluating the relative importance of various management-related and climactic factors in driving reductions in municipal water consumption (~60% in 12 years). Our analysis suggests that Melbourne's declining municipal consumption cannot be explained by potable substitution alone, as reductions in municipal consumption were not matched by increased use of alternative sources (e.g., urban rain or recycled water). Thus, water conservation behavior (not source switching) may be responsible for the majority of demand reduction in Melbourne. Interestingly, while voluntary or mandatory water restrictions appear to have substantially altered the rate of change of consumption near the end of Melbourne's Millennium drought (e.g., forcing a period of intense conservation), overall conservation behavior precedes these restrictions. This suggests that other rapidly implemented (and hither too unquantified) management approaches such as advertising or newspapers may have driven water conservation behavior early in the drought. Climatic factors, particularly precipitation may also have influenced conservation behavior; changes in precipitation were significantly positively correlated with changes in water consumption at a lag of 18 months. Similar correlations with reduced lags were observed between reservoir inflow and consumption (lag = 15 months), and reservoir storage and consumption (lag = 9 months), suggesting that the effects of precipitation on consumption may be indirect, and linked to its effects on reservoir storage and public perception of water security.",

Data interpretation is evolving from a qualitative description of the soil, able only to discriminate the presence of contrasts in chargeability parameters, towards a quantitative analysis of the investigated media, which allows soil-type characterization.\nTwo major limitations restrict the extraction of the spectral information of TDIP data in the field: i) the difficulty of acquiring reliable early-time measurements, in the millisecond range and ii) the self-potential drift in the measured potentials distorting the shape of the late time IP decays, in the second range.\nFor measuring at early-times, we developed a new method for removing the powerline noise contained in the data through a model-based approach, localizing the fundamental frequency of the powerline signal in the full-waveform IP recordings. By this, we cancel both the fundamental signal and its harmonics. This noise cancellation allows the use of earlier and narrower gates, down to a few milliseconds after the current turn-off. Even earlier gates can be measured but they will be inductively “contaminated” which we at present want to avoid.\nA proper removal of the self-potential drift present between the potential electrodes is essential for preserving the shape of the TD decays, especially for late times. Usually constant or linear drift-removal algorithms are used, but these algorithms fail in removing the background potentials due to the polarization of the electrodes previously used for current injection. We developed a drift-removal scheme that model the polarization effect and efficiently allows for preserving the shape of the IP decays.\nThe removal of both the harmonic noise and self-potential drift allows for doubling the usable range of TDIP data to more than three decades in time (corresponding to three decays in frequency), and will significantly advance the science and the applicability of the IP method in exploration and environmental geophysics.",

The Raman spectra of pantellerite glasses show dramatic changes in the high wavelength region of the spectrum (800-1200cm-1) as iron oxidation state changes. In particular the 970 cm−1 band intensity increases with increasing oxidation state of the glass (Fe3+/Fetot. ratio from 0.24 to 0.83). In contrast, Raman spectra of the basaltic glasses (natural and synthetic) do not show the same oxidation state sensitivity as the pantelleritic samples (Fe3+/Fetot. ratio from 0.15 to 0.79). A shift, however, of the 950 cm-1 band to high wavenumber with decreasing iron oxidation state can be observed.\nTo help develop Raman spectroscopy as a quantitative tool in both geosciences and planetary science we present here an empirical, compositionally-independent model, based on an ideal mixing equation applied to the acquired Raman spectra. This model yields estimates of the iron oxidation state of anhydrous and hydrous silicate glasses of basaltic and pantelleritic composition for Fe3+/Fetot. ranging between 0.15 and 0.83 and water contents up to 2.4 wt.%. The model has been validated using independently characterized natural and synthetic silicate glasses (both anhydrous and hydrous) with a FeO content varying from ~8 to ~22 wt%.\nThe results of this study contribute to increase the compositionally-dependent database previously presented by Di Genova et al. (2015) for Raman spectra of complex silicate glasses. The applications of this model range from microanalysis of silicate glasses (e.g. melt inclusions) to handheld in situ terrestrial field studies and under extreme conditions (e.g. extraterrestrial, volcanic and submarine environments).",

It is possible to estimate gas exchange and metabolism (gross primary production and ecosystem respiration) simultaneously from oxygen data themselves, but estimates from any single day often contain a substantial (and unknown) amount of parameter error. Here we developed a statistical method to leverage the extra information in a long time series to better estimate daily rates of gas exchange and metabolism. Such time series are ubiquitous in water quality monitoring programs, and these data are readily available over broad spatial scales. We developed a hierarchical model that estimates gas exchange as a function of discharge for a year-long time series of dissolved oxygen data. Gas exchange, and therefore metabolism, had much lower temporal variability than if we estimated parameters on separate days. Rates of gas exchange were positively related with discharge, but the relationship was river specific and often nonlinear. Our approach provides a robust means to estimate gas exchange and metabolism from the many rivers that have oxygen time series collected as part of water quality monitoring.",

Several studies have addressed the day-night asymmetry with observation or simulation and showed the contrast in SR amplitude between day and night (Satori et.al 2007, Pechony and Price 2007, Yang et.al., 2006). And distinct perturbations in the ionosphere caused by solar proton events, x-ray emission and earthquake coupling will also produce variations in SRs (Roldugin et.al., 2004, De et al., 2010; Satori et.al., 2015). Considering all these possible variations produced by changes in ionospheric asymmetry, we simulate the SR propagation in an asymmetric cavity including the day-night contribution and the more general perturbation asymmetry using a TDTE (Two Dimensional Telegraph Equation) approach. The change of source position in the asymmetric ionosphere and the size of the perturbation will also affect the SR parameters such as amplitude and modal frequency. The central location of the source in either the daytime or nighttime zone will produce a larger amplitude than other locations in the cavity. For example, the amplitude from a source in the zone with lower electric height (like the daytime region) is larger than the situation with source in region of larger electric height (like nighttime region). The asymmetry(difference on EM amplitude between two regions) will be more distinct when the source is on the terminator between two region than on other position. And when the size of the asymmetric construction is changed, the amplitude and modal frequency will also be changed. The increased size of the zone with lower electric height will produce larger SR amplitudes and decreased modal frequency.",

Sediment cores were also acquired. New grain size analyses for three sediment cores will be presented. These records help constrain the flooding events captured in the existing grain size data from JPC 15, just east of the Mackenzie trough. This core shows evidence of multiple ice rafted debris events that were likely sourced from the retreat of the Amundsen ice stream. These layers have peaks in grain size around ~20 microns compared to the ~5 micron average for the rest of the core. The grain size peaks correlate to the high amplitude reflectors observed in the seismic CHIRP data. Similar reflectors are observed in the seismic data from two of the new core locations, one in the Mackenzie trough and one east of the trough. The seismic data from these stations also record a thick sediment package that is ~7 meters thick at its depocenter. This layer is interpreted to record a massive meltwater discharge event that entered the Arctic via the Mackenzie River. Oxygen isotope data from JPC 15 support an event at this location based on the covarying benthic and planktonic records. In our conceptual model, the pulses of freshwater from the Amundsen Gulf likely freshened the margin sufficiently that the major discharge event was then able to push the system over the edge. This catastrophic glacial lake draining out the Mackenzie River into the Beaufort Sea and export out of the Arctic into the North Atlantic caused diminished meridional overturning circulation - slowing of the conveyor belt thermohaline circulation – which, in turn, potentially caused the Younger Dryas cold period.",

Recently, flux balance analysis (FBA) has been applied to predict microbial rates in aquifers and other settings. FBA is a genome-scale constraint-based modeling approach that computes metabolic rates and other phenotypes of microorganisms. This approach requires a prior knowledge of substrate uptake rates, which is not available for most natural microbes. Here we propose to constrain substrate uptake rates on the basis of microbial kinetics.\nSpecifically, we calculate rates of respiration (and fermentation) using a revised Monod equation; this equation accounts for both the kinetics and thermodynamics of microbial catabolism. Substrate uptake rates are then computed from the rates of respiration, and applied to FBA to predict rates of microbial growth. We implemented this method by linking two software tools, PHREEQC and COBRA Toolbox.\nWe applied this method to acetotrophic methanogenesis by Methanosarcina barkeri, and compared the simulation results to previous laboratory observations. The new method constrains acetate uptake by accounting for the kinetics and thermodynamics of methanogenesis, and predicted well the observations of previous experiments. In comparison, traditional methods of dynamic-FBA constrain acetate uptake on the basis of enzyme kinetics, and failed to reproduce the experimental results. These results show that microbial rate laws may provide a better constraint than enzyme kinetics for applying FBA to biogeochemical reaction modeling.",

These interdependencies, collectively known as the Water-Energy-Food Nexus, become more complex and more critical as the climate changes, the population grows, habits and lifestyle alternatives, and the prices of water, energy, and food increase. The U.S. National Intelligence Council has identified the nexus of water, energy, food, and climate change as one of four overarching megatrends that will shape the world in 2030. However, the global research community has rarely addressed the full problem and focused instead on different subsets of the problem. For example, interactions between two of the three domains were studied, often neglecting the impact of such interaction on the third domain. Investigators have quantified water-energy tradeoffs in the highly engineered, centralized systems of water and power management. Agricultural researchers have tracked water costs by applying the concept of virtual water (the total volume of water needed to produce and process a commodity or service) or using large-scale system models to investigate food and water security. Integrative nexus initiatives have focused on reviews and data collection of existing knowledge and relevant facts. They unfortunately lack a conceptual and mathematical framework that can integrate all the gathered knowledge and account for multiple interactions, feedbacks, or natural processes that occur across all three domains of the nexus. Here, we present an integrated conceptual and mathematical framework (roadmap) for the nexus. This framework is driven by spatiotemporal demands for water, energy, and food to be satisfied by resource management of the three domains, envisioned as a stepwise process, with each step requiring inputs from the three nexus domains and creating waste products. The efficiency of each step, combined with mass balances, create the linkages and feedback loops within the nexus. Such an approach allows for a compact, single representation of the ’nexus equation’ that generally represents all interactions, material pathways, feedback loops and embedded resource echoes.",

We investigated the infiltration, the river runoff, and the scattering of the de-icing agent quantitatively, observed the variation of water quality in river, and discussed the infiltration route and balance of the deicing agent in order to clarify the influence of the de-icing agent on the groundwater salinization. As a result, it turned out that 65% of the de-icing agent sprinkled on the road surface flowed into the waterway, the 25% infiltrated into underground through the crack of a road surface, and the remaining 10% dispersed out of an expressway. Next, for the rate of the de-icing agent outflowing to the river during a frozen snow term, it was estimated that the 39% of the sprinkled de-icing agent outflowed with surface water, and the 17% did with groundwater. Moreover, it was shown clearly that the 44% was probably stored in underground from the balance between the sprinkled de-icing agent and the outflowing one.\nIn addition, the Cl- concentration of groundwater by the infiltrated deicing agent was simulated to clarify its extent and to predict its change in future when stopped sprinkling the deicing agent.",

            "abstract": "Marine mammals are important sources of food for indigenous residents of northern Alaska. Changing sea ice patterns affect the animals themselves as well as access by hunters. Documenting the traditional knowledge of Iñupiaq and Yupik hunters concerning marine mammals and sea ice makes accessible a wide range of information and insight relevant to ecological understanding, conservation action, and the regulation of human activity. We interviewed hunters in villages from northern Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea, focusing on bowhead whales, walrus, and ice seals. Hunters reported extensive changes in sea ice, with resulting effects on the timing of marine mammal migrations, the distribution and behavior of the animals, and the efficacy of certain hunting methods, for example the difficulty of finding ice thick enough to support a bowhead whale for butchering. At the same time, hunters acknowledged impacts and potential impacts from changing technology such as more powerful outboard engines and from industrial activity such as shipping and oil and gas development. Hunters have been able to adapt to some changes, for example by hunting bowhead whales in fall as well as spring on St. Lawrence Island, or by focusing their hunt in a shorter period in Nuiqsut to accommodate work schedules and worse weather. Other changes, such as reduced availability of ice seals due to rapid retreat of pack ice after spring break-up, continue to defy easy responses. Continued environmental changes, increased disturbance from human activity, and the introduction of new regulations for hunting may further challenge the ability of hunters to provide food as they have done to date, though innovation and flexibility may also provide new sources of adaptation.",

            "abstract": "While it is widely accepted that the mantle is chemically and isotopically heterogeneous on a global scale, the extent to which these large-scale heterogeneities are distributed by convection and mixing remains unclear. Radiogenic isotopic data from whole rock lavas has shown heterogeneity even within the magma sampled by a single volcanic hand sample. Developments in microanalysis techniques have allowed the augmentation of whole rock data with crystalline and sub-crystalline analyses, with the goal of identifying geochemically and isotopically distinct melts contributing to a single magma plumbing system.\nRadiogenic isotopic disequilibrium is caused by mixing of isotopically diverse magmas, and is evidenced by isotopic variation in phenocrysts and melt inclusions from a single young, fresh lava. Sr-isotopic values measured by LA-MC-ICPMS in clinopyroxenes (0.720830 to 0.720232) from a highly enriched Samoan hotspot lava differ significantly from the corresponding value of the surrounding ground mass (0.718592). Furthermore, the clinopyroxenes can be divided into two isotopically distinct populations, negating the argument that shallow assimilation (e.g. seawater) could be responsible for the isotopic disequilibrium. Many of the Samoan lavas exhibiting cpx-whole rock Sr-isotopic disequilibrium also exhibit Sr-isotopic disequilibrium between individual olivine-hosted melt inclusions.\nWe take advantage of the observation that, on a sub-grain scale, a single zoned plagioclase crystal can record multiple magma mixing events, with each zone reflecting the isotopic characteristics of the magma in which it formed. We report Sr-isotopic disequilibrium between zones of plagioclase crystals in the same Samoan lava that hosts extreme cpx-whole rock Sr-isotopic disequilibrium: the Sr-isotopic ratios extend to values higher than observed in the plagioclase. This implies a turbulent growth history involving magmas of differing isotopic compositions that mixed prior to eruption. ",

Often settlements appear in isolated parts along a network, grow into larger entities over time, connect with each other and start sharing a common identity. How these settlements get interconnected, for e.g. via trade, determine the 'organization' of the society that the settlements are part of. Using a semi-synthetic case study in Western India, this paper demonstrates a set of conditions that may trigger emergence of diverse spatial patterns of societal organization in water scarce basins. It shows that the emergence of diverse spatial patterns of basin scale socio-hydrology depend on how water is valued along the river network. These conditions in effect define thresholds, which when crossed lead to appearance of different spatial patterns of societal organization.",

Allan B. collected high resolution bathymetry, sidescan, and subbottom profiles along the neovolcanic zone of the Alarcon Rise and across the southern Pescadero Basin during 2012 and 2015 MBARI expeditions to the Gulf of California (GOC). The combination of high resolution multibeam bathymetry and seawater temperature data has proven effective in identifying active high temperature vent fields, as validated by inspection and sampling during ROV dives.\nThe AUV carries a 200 kHz multibeam sonar, 110 kHz chirp sidescan sonar, a 1-6 kHz chirp subbottom profiler, and a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensor for ~17-hour duration missions. Flying at 5.4 km/hr at 50 m altitude, the processed AUV bathymetry has a 0.1 m vertical precision and a 1 m lateral resolution. Chimneys taller than 1.5 m are sufficiently distinctive to allow provisional identification. The CTD temperature data have a nominal 0.002°C accuracy. Following calculation of potential temperature and correcting for average local variation of potential temperature with depth, anomalies greater than 0.05 °C can be reliably identified using a spike detection filter. MBARI AUV mapping surveys are typically planned using a 150 m survey line spacing, so the CTD data may be collected as much as 75 m away from any vent plume source.\nFive active high temperature vent fields were discovered in the southern GOC, with the Auka Field in the southern Pescadero Basin, and the Ja Sít, Pericú, Meyibó, and Tzab-ek Fields along the Alarcon Rise. In all five cases, hydrothermal vent chimneys are readily identifiable in the multibeam bathymetry, and temperature anomalies are observed above background variability. Other apparent hydrothermal chimneys were observed in the bathmetry that did not exhibit water temperature anomalies; most of these were visited during ROV dives and confirmed to be inactive sites. The maximum water column anomalies are 0.13°C observed above the Meyibó field and 0.25°C at the Auka vents. Although chimney mapping was frequently incomplete (e.g. chimneys insonified only from one side), chimney heights observed during ROV dives generally agreed well with the multibeam bathymetry. For example, the tallest chimney at the Tzab-ek field was mapped as 31 m high, and then observed by ROV to be 33 m high.",

            "abstract": "Previous USGS research on landslide potential in hillside areas and coastal bluffs around Puget Sound, WA, has identified rainfall thresholds and antecedent moisture conditions that correlate with heightened probability of shallow landslides. However, physically based assessments of temporal and spatial variability in landslide potential require improved quantitative characterization of the hydrologic controls on landslide initiation in heterogeneous geologic materials. Here we present preliminary steps towards integrating monitoring of hydrologic response with physically based numerical modeling to inform the development of a landslide warning system for a railway corridor along the eastern shore of Puget Sound. We instrumented two sites along the steep coastal bluffs – one active landslide and one currently stable slope with the potential for failure – to monitor rainfall, soil-moisture, and pore-pressure dynamics in near-real time. We applied a distributed model of variably saturated subsurface flow for each site, with heterogeneous hydraulic-property distributions based on our detailed site characterization of the surficial colluvium and the underlying glacial-lacustrine deposits that form the bluffs. We calibrated the model with observed volumetric water content and matric potential time series, then used simulated pore pressures from the calibrated model to calculate the suction stress and the corresponding distribution of the factor of safety against landsliding with the infinite slope approximation. Although the utility of the model is limited by uncertainty in the deeper groundwater flow system, the continuous simulation of near-surface hydrologic response can help to quantify the temporal variations in the potential for shallow slope failures at the two sites. Thus the integration of near-real time monitoring and physically based modeling contributes a useful tool towards mitigating hazards along the Puget Sound railway corridor.",

            "abstract": "Natural hazard presentations often highlight disasters that may ensue from natural processes when mitigation or preparedness actions are not taken. Examples include images of raging fires, collapsed buildings, and flooded urban areas. Research has shown that this makes presentations more interesting and more memorable. Such images are the stock and trade of disaster reporting by the media. Unfortunately, it may also trigger avoidance and denial in the audience, resulting in preparedness reduction; the opposite effect of what may have been intended by the speaker. Recent social research has provided insight into a better approach. The theory of communicating actionable risk posits that people will take action against hazards when they know what to do, think it would work, and know someone who did it. This approach was recently applied in an intervention designed to motivate earthquake-resistant construction in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Social theory further suggests that a tendency towards action is strengthened by hearing a consistent message over time, and by providing the audience with an appropriate opportunity to seek out relevant information. This presentation shows how, by taking this transdisciplinary step, scientists can make small changes in their hazard communication, thereby acting as positive influencers of change. A summary of “do’s” and “don’ts” is given for reference.\nDO:\n1. Show examples of what to do.\n2. Show effectiveness of actions.\n3. Give sense of knowing someone who did it.\n4.

Fire location and extent in boreal ecosystems highly depend on ignitions by lightning and periods of high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) that promote the spread of the fires. We show, using fire perimeter and remotely sensed burned area, that during the 2014 fire season, the Northwest Territories in Canada experienced its most severe fire season since the beginning of the fire perimeter record in 1971. Using a pyrogenic carbon consumption model driven by remotely sensed tree cover and burn severity, and meteorological reanalysis data, we estimate total carbon emissions of 136 (SE = 25) Tg for the entire territory. We also found anomalously large fires relatively close (0-300 km) to the high latitude treeline where sparse black spruce forests transition into tundra, ecosystems that are traditionally less affected by fire disturbance. This area received below-average winter precipitation and experienced an early snow melt in 2014. Using data from the Canadian Lightning Detection Network we show that many of these fires were ignited during lightning storms in May and June, and expanded during periods of anomalously high VPD in June and July. Fires that were ignited before July 1 accounted for approximately 76% of the total annual burned area. We hypothesize that the extent and northward expansion of boreal fires, driven by climatic anomalies in lightning and VPD, may accelerate northward species migration with climate change. We also show, using plume heights retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), that maximum plume injection heights in 2014 were on average more than 300 m higher compared to observations from other years. These high injection heights combined with the high latitude location of the fires increase the potential for northward long-range transport of black carbon emissions towards Greenland and other vulnerable components of the northern cryosphere.",

Both of these measured precisions exceed the EPA’s commercial building action limit, which for TCE is 0.92 ppb (5 µg/m3) and for PCE is 0.29 ppb (2 µg/m3). This ability has been fully demonstrated by the deployment of the instrument to the Superfund site at Moffett Naval Air Station in Mountain View, California where contaminated ground water results in vapor intrusion of TCE and PCE. For two weeks, the instrument operated continuously and autonomously, successfully measuring TCE and PCE concentrations in both the breathing zone and steam tunnel air, in excellent agreement with previous TO-15 data.\nIn this poster, we present laboratory performance data targeting new toxic molecules with the same instrument. We have demonstrated the measurement of trichlorofluolomethane (Freon 11) in zero air with a precision of 1 ppb (3σ at 1075cm-1), and hexafluoropropene in zero air with a precision of about 0.3 ppb (3σ per spectrum).

            "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between remotely sensed hydrometeors and land cover patterns of deforestation in Rôndonia, Brazil. Enhanced convection and precipitation preferentially develop over forested land, while shallow non-precipitating clouds preferentially form over deforested land. Numerical weather simulations (WRF-ARW) conditioned on topography and land-cover are used to elucidate the physical mechanisms of these mesoscale phenomena. Both remotely sensed land-cover products (MODIS, USGS) and modeled future conservation scenarios of deforestation (LBA-ECO LC-14) are used to capture the hydrologic response to changing length scales and heterogeneity that may be expected in the region. Analysis of the modeled forest, non-forest, and forest-edge precipitation fractions and cloud fractions corroborate previous findings and illustrate how future deforestation practices may further influence the hydroclimate of the region. Furthermore, the physical pathways are revealed by comparing simulated surface temperatures, turbulent heat fluxes, circulation patterns, convective energy, and static stability.",

            "abstract": "The modern subarctic North Pacific is characterized as a high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) area, but evidence for increased nutrient utilization during the last glacial indicates that this region is highly dynamic. As such, this HNLC area is of particular interest in regard to understanding changes in the biological pump and carbon sequestration and predicting how biogeochemical processes will influence, or be influenced by, future climate change. While it has been suggested that changes in iron supply and/or ocean stratification could explain fluctuations in nutrient utilization and productivity in the subarctic Pacific, short records of nutrient utilization have previously hindered the evaluation of these potential mechanisms over long timescales. Here we present new, high-resolution records of bulk sediment δ15N from 0-1.2 Ma from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Exp. 323 Site U1342, which are used to calculate Δδ15N (U1342 δ15Nbulk – ODP Site 1012 δ15Nbulk) as a nitrate utilization proxy. The unprecedented length and resolution of this new record allows us, for the first time, to determine orbital-scale systematic behavior in subarctic Pacific nutrient utilization over many glacial/interglacial cycles. Spectral analyses demonstrate that enhanced nutrient utilization was paced by climate on Milankovitch orbital cycles since the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT; ~800 ka). Nitrate utilization maxima is statistically correlated with glacial maxima and enhanced dust/iron availability (represented by existing records of EPICA ice core dust, Southern Pacific Ocean sediment iron, and China loess) but shows low correlation to primary productivity, suggesting that stratification has systematically exerted an important control on subarctic Pacific nutrient utilization since the MPT. These findings imply that the presence of iron helped to change the region into a nitrate-limited, rather than iron-limited, region during glacials and that stratification, which inhibits nutrient upwelling, became the dominant control on biological productivity. Additionally, nitrate utilization (and thus stratification) is in phase with pCO2 minima, implying that strong glacial stratification may have provided an important climate feedback by reducing oceanic CO2 “leakage” to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely believed that reconnection is the underlying mechanism of many explosive processes observed both in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. However, both the questions of how magnetic reconnection is triggered in high Lundquist (S) and Reynolds (R) number plasmas, and how it can then occur on fast, ideal, time-scales remain open. Indeed, it has been argued that fast reconnection rates could be achieved once kinetic scales are reached, or, alternatively, by the onset of the so-called plasmoid instability within Sweet-Parker current sheets.\nHowever, it has been shown recently that a tearing mode instability (the “ideal tearing”) can grow on an ideal, i.e., S-independent, timescale once the width a of a current sheet becomes thin enough with respect to its macroscopic length L, a/L ~ S-1/3. This suggests that current sheet thinning down to such a threshold aspect ratio —much larger, for S>>1, than the Sweet-Parker one that scales as a/L ~ S-1/2— might provide the trigger for fast reconnection even within the fluid plasma framework.\nHere we discuss the transition to fast reconnection by studying with visco-resistive MHD simulations the onset and evolution of the tearing instability within a single collapsing current sheet. We indeed show that the transition to a fast tearing mode instability takes place when an inverse aspect ratio of the order of the threshold a/L ~ S-1/3 is reached, and that the secondary current sheets forming nonlinearly become the source of a succession of recursive tearing instabilities. The latter is reminiscent of the fractal reconnection model of flares, which we modify in the light of the “ideal tearing” scenario.",

The duration and magnitude of landfalling ARs is correlated to their hydrological impacts on land. The forecast of these hydrologically significant landfalling events can be improved through a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to their formation and evolution prior to landfall. In order to investigate these mechanisms, an analysis of the interaction and feedback between intense lower-level moisture transport and associated upper-level dynamics is performed using simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. \nA subset of persistent landfalling AR events is identified using 3hrly MERRA reanalysis and validated against observational datasets. These events are identified as lower tropospheric wind and moisture features with extended geometry that persist over the coastline for longer than two days. A composite analysis of persistent landfalling events shows an eastward extended, perturbed upper-level jet and anticyclonic overturning of potential vorticity contours, indicating anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking. The role of lower-level moisture transport in the development of these upper-level characteristics and impact on the duration of the event are investigated. ",

This presentation describes a study of nitrogen cycle in groundwater-surface water interaction zone (GSIZ) at the US Department of Energy’s Hanford Site. Groundwater at Hanford sites has long been documented with nitrate contamination. Nearby Columbia River stage changes of up to 3 m every day because of daily discharge fluctuation from upstream Priest Rapids Dam; resulting an exchange of groundwater and surface water in a short time period. Yet, nitrogen cycle in the GSIZ at Hanford Site remains unclear. Column studies have been used to identify nitrogen metabolism pathways and investigate kinetics of nitrogen cycle in groundwater saturated zone, surface water saturated zone, and GSIZ. Functional gene and protein abundances were determined by qPCR and PRISM-SRM (high-pressure, high-resolution separations coupled with intelligent selection and multiplexing for sensitive selected reaction monitoring) to identify key enzymatic reactions and metabolic pathways of nitrogen cycle. The results showed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) competed with denitrification under anaerobic conditions, reducing 30% of NO3- to NH4+, a cation strongly retained on the sediments. As dissolved oxygen intruded the anaerobic zone with river water, NH4+ was oxidized to NO3-, increasing the mobility of NO3-. Multiplicative Monod models were established to describe nitrogen cycle in columns fed with O2 depleted synthetic groundwater and O2 saturated synthetic river water, respectively. The two models were then coupled to predict the dynamic kinetics of nitrogen cycle in GSIZ.",

The sea surface temperature (SST) history of this region in past millennia is poorly constrained due to the lack of in situ records with appropriate resolution. Here we present a ~2700 year sub-centennially resolved SST reconstruction from Mg/Ca ratios of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from Galápagos sediments. The ETP SST record exhibits a long-term cooling trend of over 0.2°C/ky that is similar to Northern Hemisphere multi-proxy temperature trends suggesting a common origin, likely due to insolation forcing. The ETP remains in-phase with Northern Hemisphere climate records through the warm Roman Climate Optimum (~0-400CE), cooler Dark Ages Cold Period (~450-850CE), and through the peak warming of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (900-1150 CE) when SST is within error of modern. Following peak MCA, the ETP cooled rapidly and then rebounded at ~1500 CE during the coldest portion of the Little Ice Age. Overall the data suggest an out-of-phase relationship during much of the last millennium, which we attribute to dynamical adjustments consistent with the “dynamical ocean thermostat” mechanism. Further evidence for these dynamical adjustments comes from reconstructions of the east-west zonal SST gradient using existing Mg/Ca SST reconstructions from the western Pacific warm pool. The last millennium has been the most dynamic period over the past 2700 years, with significant (~1 °C) SST variability in the ETP and modulation of the zonal gradient. A combination of dynamical and thermodynamic mechanisms are invoked to explain the region’s complex SST history.",

The highest peak CO2 release temperature (478-502°C) has been attributed to either a Fe-rich carbonate or nano-phase Mg-carbonate. The objective of this experimental study was to evaluate the thermal evolved gas analysis (T/EGA) characteristics of a series of terrestrial Fe-rich carbonates under analog SAM operating conditions to compare with the RN CO2 releases. Natural Fe-rich carbonates (<53µm) with varying Fe amounts (Fe0.66X0.34- to Fe0.99X0.01-CO3, where X refers to Mg and/or Mn) were selected for T/EGA. The carbonates were heated from 25 to 715°C (35°C min-1) and evolved CO2 was measured as a function of temperature. The highest Fe containing carbonates (e.g., Fe0.99X0.01-CO3) yielded CO2 peak temperatures between 466-487°C, which is consistent with the high temperature RN CO2 release. The lower Fe-bearing carbonates (e.g., Fe0.66X0.34CO3) did not have peak CO2 release temperatures that matched the RN peak CO2 temperatures; however, their entire CO2 releases did occur within RN temperature range of the high temperature CO2 release. Results from this laboratory analog analysis demonstrate that the high temperature RN CO2 release is consistent with Fe-rich carbonate (~0.7 to 1 wt.% FeCO3). The similar RN geochemistry with other materials in Gale Crater and elsewhere on Mars (e.g., Gusev Crater, Meridiani) suggests that up to 1 wt. % Fe-rich carbonate may occur throughout the Gale Crater region and could be widespread on Mars. The Rocknest Fe-carbonate may have formed from the interaction of reduced Fe phases (e.g., Fe2+ bearing olivine) with atmospheric CO2 and transient water. Alternatively, the Rocknest Fe-carbonate could be derived by eolian processes that have eroded distally exposed deep crustal material that possesses Fe-carbonate that may have formed through metamorphic and/or metasomatic processes.",

The morphology of the ice sheet at this scale is a result of a complex interaction between katabatic winds, synoptic storms, and the slope of the surface, all driving local patterns of snow accretion and sublimation. In megadune regions, the accumulation, surface slope, and surface roughness are highly correlated with slope. Smooth glazed surfaces are present on the steeper leeward wind-faces, and much rougher snow-accreting megadunes are present on the windward (depositional) slope. However, the highest elevation areas near the ridge crest of the EAIS (above ~3200 m) have a converse relationship between roughness and accumulation. Here, very low wind ridge crest areas are smooth and have higher accumulation than adjacent, slightly steeper regions that exhibit a slight increase in roughness. Below the main regions of megadunes (<~2000 m) wind glaze areas gradually become rougher as wind scouring and erosion dominate locally steeper regions. In coastal areas (<~1000), roughness is highly variable, and is tied to frequent synoptic storm deposition.\nWe compare roughness data derived from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and Landsat 8 acquisitions with available wind and accumulation data from climate model results and field measurements. Roughness is determined by sunlight scattering relative to viewing geometry (MISR) or from the amplitude of textural characteristics tied to surface sastrugi (Landsat 8). Both are validated by comparison with meter-scale images (WorldView-1) and field observations. MISR roughness mapping shows persistent qualitative patterns of surface roughness across the EAIS, but an absolute roughness scale mapping is difficult to generate because of complex viewing, illumination, and bi-directional reflectance variations of the snow surface. Landsat 8 band 8 provides a more constrained viewing geometry (nadir, sun-synchronous observations) and has a high radiometric sensitivity and adequate resolution (15 m) to reveal textural details in a consistent and quantitative way.",

            "abstract": "Large-volume springs are a significant source of water to communities in Shasta County. Aquifers in this region are developed in young volcanic formations and the age and flow of groundwater is not well characterized, making predicting the impact of drought and climate change on spring flow difficult. To better understand the water resources and the hydrogeology of the region and to better constrain the age of water produced by springs, we have sampled water from wells, springs, and streams for a suite of geochemical and isotopic tracers. We are using isotopic tracers because of the limited number of sampling points over a large area, leaving traditional hydrogeologic methods such as water levels and pump tests inadequate for a regional study.\nWe analyzed samples for sulfur-35 (87.4 day half-life) and found detections in two springs, confirming the presence of a fraction of recently (1-2 years) recharged groundwater. Tritium (12.3 year half-life) activities show that some wells produce water recharged more than 5 decades ago, but most produce more recently recharged water. We will also report results for sodium-22 (2.6 year half-life), krypton-85 (10.8 year half-life), carbon-14 (5,730 year half-life), dissolved noble gases, stable isotopes of water, and helium isotopic composition. These isotopes are applied to determine the age (residence time) of groundwater over a broad age distribution, from less than one year to tens of thousands of years. These tracers should also provide information on aquifer volumes, help delineate groundwater flow, and help to identify recharge areas. A collection of groundwater ages from springs at high elevations to wells in the upper Sacramento Valley will help delineate groundwater flowpaths. Finally, groundwater residence times will help determine groundwater volume and recharge rates, and resolve questions related to drought vulnerability and effective adjustments in water resource management.",

            "abstract": "New marine surveying and submersible sampling of Kaul‘a Volcano, located 100 km off the axis of the Hawaiian Chain, have revealed widespread areas of young volcanism. New 40Ar/39Ar and geochemical analyses of the olivine-phyric submarine and subaerial volcanic rocks show that Kaul‘a is shrouded with young alkalic basalts (1.9 to 0.5 Ma). The ages and chemistry of these rocks overlap with rejuvenated lavas from nearby shields Ni‘ihau, Kaua‘i and South Kaua‘i Swell. Collectively, rejuvenated lavas cover a vast area (~7000 km2) in the northern Hawaiian Islands. Kaul‘a rejuvenated lavas show a much larger (5x) variation of incompatible elements than those from adjacent Ni‘ihau but comparable to Honolulu rejuvenated lavas. Unlike both suites, heavy REE elements in Kaul‘a lavas are pinned at Ybn 10, indicating a strong garnet signature in the source. Rejuvenated lavas from the Kaua‘i Ridge have slightly higher radiogenic Pb isotope ratios than those from the southern Hawaiian Islands (Maui to O‘ahu) and partly straddle the LOA-KEA boundary. Rejuvenated volcanism was nearly coeval occurrence from ~0.3 to 0.6 Ma along a 450 km segment of the Hawaiian Islands (West Maui to north of Ni‘ihau), which is inconsistent with most models for rejuvenated volcanism except the Ballmer et al.2 dynamic melting model. This model invokes increasing pyroxenite contributions and the interaction with scale-scale convection rolls in the lithosphere to enhance the volume and duration of rejuvenation volcanism. Thus, a pyroxenite-bearing, mixed Kea-Loa source component may have contributed to the prolonged and extensive rejuvenated volcanism in the northern Hawaiian Islands.\n1Robinson & Eakins 2006, J.

However, simultaneous observations of EMIC waves and equatorial electron pitch angle distributions, which can be used to directly quantify the EMIC wave scattering effect, are still very limited. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of EMIC waves on the pitch angle scattering of relativistic and ultrarelativistic (0.5-5 MeV) electrons during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, when intense EMIC wave activity was observed in situ (in the plasma plume region with high plasma density) on both the Van Allen Probes and one of the THEMIS probes. EMIC waves captured on the ground across the Canadian Array for Real-time Investigations of Magnetic Activity (CARISMA) and enhanced precipitation of >~0.7 MeV electrons captured by POES are used to infer the MLT coverage of EMIC waves. Based on the observed EMIC wave spectra, local fpe and fce, we estimate the wave diffusion rates and model the evolution of electron pitch angle distributions. By comparing the modeled results with local observations of pitch angle distributions, for the first time, we are able to show direct, quantitative evidence of EMIC wave-driven relativistic electron loss in the Earth’s outer radiation belt.",

We know now that our best available models are not adequate for many sought after purposes. To throw some light on the maximum fidelity expected from a given generation of models, and thereby aid both policy making and model development, we can test the weaknesses of a model as a dynamical system to get an informed idea of its potential applicability at various lead times. Shadowing times reflect the duration on which a GCM reflects the observations; extracting the shortcomings of the model which limit shadowing times allows informed speculation regarding the fidelity of the model in the future. More specifically, the relevant phenomena limiting model fidelity can be learned by identifying the reasons models cannot shadow; the time scales on which feedbacks on the system (which are not active in the model) are likely to result in model irrelevance can be discerned. The methodology is developed in the “low dimensional laboratory” of relatively simple dynamical systems, for example Lorenz 95 systems. The results are presented in Lorenz 95 systems, high dimensional fluid dynamical simulations of rotating annulus and GCMs. There are severe limits on the light shadowing experiments can shine on GCM predictions. Never the less, they appear to be one of the brightest lights we can shine to illuminate the likely fidelity of GCM extrapolations into the future.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_poster_v3.pdf\nTo study earthquake interaction, it is important to objectively find a group of earthquakes occurred closely in space and time. Earthquake clusters are chosen with previous techniques that characterize them as mainshock-aftershock sequences or swarm sequences by empirical laws (e.g., Omori-Utsu; ETAS) or direct assumptions about physical processes such as stress transfer, transient stress loading, and fluid migration. Recent papers instead proposed non-parameterized techniques such as a kernel-based smoothing method. The cumulative rate clustering method (CURATE, Jacobs et al., 2013) is one of the approaches without any direct assumptions. The CURATE method was applied in New Zealand and provided a good result for selecting the swarm sequences comparing with the ETAS model. However, it is still difficult to choose a proper confined area and a time interval for extracting sequences from the catalog. To avoid arbitrariness in space and time parameters, here we propose a new method modifying the CURATE approach. We first identify the spatial clusters by looking into the spatial distribution in a 2-D cell-gridded map. The spatial clusters defined as multiple neighboring cells, each of which contains at least one earthquake in a time period T. From the selected spatial clusters, we then evaluate temporal clustering which is defined as a transient increase of seismicity rate comparing to the rate before the target event. We tested this method focusing on shallow crustal seismicity, northern Honshu, Japan. We chose the parameter range from T = 1 to 100 days and cell size = 0.01°to 0.1°. As a result, the number of the clusters increase with longer T and larger cell size. By choosing the T = 30 days and cell size = 0.05°, we successfully selected the long-lasting aftershock sequences associated with the 2004 M6.8 Chuetsu and 2007 M6.8 Chuetsu-oki earthquakes, while other empirical models and CURATE method failed to decluster.",

            "abstract": "There is no evidence that the partial pressure of atmospheric nitrogen (pN2) changed greatly in the Phanerozoic but the Precambrian is different. Some suggest that Archean pN2 was higher because it would pressure broaden absorption lines of greenhouse gases and counteract a fainter young Sun [1]. However, analysis of raindrop imprints and fluid inclusions indicate that pN2 was no more than ~0.5-1.2 bar [2, 3] while basalt vesicles show pN2 < 0.5 bar at 2.7 Ga [4]. Low pN2 suggests that the Archean N cycle operated differently than today, which is unsurprising given the absence of O2.\nThe coupling of the N cycle to oxygenation can be understood by comparing modern and ancient fluxes. Today, the long-term N source is from volcanism and metamorphism as well as oxidative weathering of organics. The geologic sink is the burial of organic matter, with minor subduction. But in the Archean, ammonium would have been the dominant N species in seawater. NH4+ substitutes for K+ in seafloor phyllosilicates. NH4+ in silicates can be stable under igneous and metamorphic conditions. Thus, the subduction sink should have been larger. Moreover, the N source from oxidative weathering was absent. With a more efficient geologic sink than today and smaller relative degassing, the steady-state pN2 would be lower.\nNitrogen levels can be modeled and with plausible fluxes, Archean pN2 is lower. Once O2 becomes available, nitrifying chemoautotrophs make nitrate and the sink via ammonium declines. A speculative possibility is that oxidized sediments after the Great Oxidation raised the redox state in subduction zones. Higher oxygen fugacity would lead to more N2 degassing [5]. In any case, pN2 changes need not have been monotonic. [1] Goldblatt C. et al. (2009) Nat Geosci 2, 891-896. [2] Som S. M. et al. (2012) Nature 484, 359-362. [3] Marty B. et al.

This set of downscaled forecasts is then used to drive hydrologic models to produce a range of forecasts with uncertainty estimates suitable for water resources planning in African pilot basins (i.e. Upper Zambezi, Mara Basin). In an effort to characterize the utility of these forecasts, we will present an evaluation of these forecast ensembles over the pilot basins, and discuss insights as to their operational applicability by regional actors. Further, these forecasts will be contrasted with those from a standard Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) approach to seasonal forecasting. The case studies presented here have been developed in the setting of the NASA SERVIR Applied Sciences Team and within the broader context of operational seasonal forecasting in Africa.

            "abstract": "Explosions at shallow depth-of-burial can cause nonlinear material response, such as fracturing and spalling, up to the ground surface above the shot point. These motions at the surface affect the generation of acoustic waves into the atmosphere, as well as the surface-reflected compressional and shear waves. Standard source scaling models for explosions do not account for such nonlinear interactions above the shot, while some recent studies introduce a non-isotropic addition to the moment tensor to represent them (e.g., Patton and Taylor, 2011). We are using Sandia’s CTH shock physics code to model the material response in the vicinity of underground explosions, up to the overlying ground surface. Across a boundary where the motions have decayed to nearly linear behavior, we couple the signals from CTH into a linear finite-difference (FD) seismoacoustic code to efficiently propagate the wavefields to greater distances. If we assume only one-way transmission of energy through the boundary, then the particle velocities there suffice as inputs for the FD code, simplifying the specification of the boundary condition. The FD algorithm we use applies the wave equations for velocity in an elastic medium and pressure in an acoustic one, and matches the normal traction and displacement across the interface. Initially we are developing and testing a 2D, axisymmetric seismoacoustic routine; CTH can use this geometry in the source region as well. The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) in Nevada has collected seismic and acoustic data on numerous explosions at different scaled depths, providing an excellent testbed for investigating explosion phenomena (Snelson et al., 2013). We present simulations for shots SPE-4’ and SPE-5, illustrating the importance of nonlinear behavior up to the ground surface. Our goal is to develop the capability for accurately predicting the relative signal strengths in the air and ground for a given combination of source yield and depth.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

Recent model predictions offer some insight into the mechanisms underlying some of these transitions. However, there are few direct observations, and tests providing empirical verification are sparse. The White Sands dune field exhibits all three of the aforementioned transitions in sequence, from the upwind to downwind margin, and has the potential to be a testing ground for these predictions. Repeat LiDAR data at White Sands provide an excellent opportunity to study not only dune structure, but also dune dynamics, which can provide insight into how dunes destabilize from one dune morphology into another. We employ a recently developed method for decomposing dune migration into two components: “translation” of a dune, and changes in dune shape referred to as “deformation”. We find that the fastest moving dunes (i.e. the dunes translating most quickly) have the largest amount of deformation. Patterns of deformation also vary depending on dune type: transverse dunes experience coherent deformation, while parabolic dunes exhibit highly localized and apparently random deformation. Only a fraction of the deformation can be explained by the migration rate. A significant amount of deformation appears to be attributable to dune-dune interactions, which destabilize dune patterns in locations where dune density is high. At the interface between the transverse to barchan dune patterns, we describe how transverse dunes break up into barchans and compare it to published model results. Regarding the barchan to parabolic transition, we find that the onset of vegetation drives a gradual slowdown in migration rates, while the magnitude of deformation drops and becomes localized to dune crests as the arms are stabilized by plants.",

However, recent studies have indicated that dark production of H2O2 in deep seawater, principally by biological production, is potentially on par with photochemical generation. Here, we present evidence for abiotic dark generation of H2O2 in groundwater in an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River near Rifle, CO. Background H2O2 concentrations were determined in situ using a sensitive chemiluminescence-based method. Our results suggest H2O2 concentrations ranged from lower than the detection limit (1 nM) to 54 nM in different monitoring wells at the site, and the concentrations exhibited close correlations with profiles of dissolved oxygen and iron concentrations in the wells, indicating a possible metal redox cycling mechanism. In addition, dissolved natural organic matter, which could potentially coordinate the interconversion of ferric and ferrous species, might also play an important role in H2O2 formation. While biologically mediated activities have been recognized as the major sink of H2O2, the detected H2O2 pattern in groundwater suggests the existence of a balance between H2O2 source and decay, which potentially involves a cascade of biogeochemically significant processes, including the interconversion of ferrous/ferric species, the generation of more reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radical, the depletion of dissolved oxygen and further transformation of natural organic matter and other chemical pollutants.",

            "abstract": "Many universities look to start-up companies as a way to attract faculty, supporting research and students as traditional federal sources become harder to come by. University affiliated start-up companies can apply for a broader suite of grants, as well as market their services to a broad customer base. Often university administrators see this as a potential panacea, but national statistics show this is not the case. Rarely do universities profit significantly from their start-ups. With a success rates of around 20%, most start-ups end up costing the university money as well as faculty-time. For the faculty, assuming they want to continue in academia, a start-up is often unattractive because it commonly leads out of academia. Running a successful business as well as maintaining a strong teaching and research load is almost impossible to do at the same time. Most business models and business professionals work outside of academia, and the models taught in business schools do not merge well in a university environment. To mitigate this a new business model is proposed where university start-ups are aligned with the academic and research missions of the university. A university start-up must work within the university, directly support research and students, and the work done maintaining the business be recognized as part of the faculty member’s university obligations. This requires a complex conflict of interest management plan and for the companies to be non-profit in order to not jeopardize the university’s status. This approach may not work well for all universities, but would be ideal for many to conserve resources and ensure a harmonious relationship with their start-ups and faculty.",

It supports the sharing of and collaboration around “resources” which are defined primarily by standardized metadata, content data models for each resource type, and an overarching resource data model based on the Open Archives Initiative’s Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) standard and a hierarchical file packaging system called “BagIt”. HydroShare expands the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated to include geospatial and multidimensional space-time datasets commonly used in hydrology. HydroShare also includes new capability for sharing models, model components, and analytical tools and will take advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models. It also supports web services and server/cloud based computation operating on resources for the execution of hydrologic models and analysis and visualization of hydrologic data. HydroShare uses iRODS as a network file system for underlying storage of datasets and models. Collaboration is enabled by casting datasets and models as \"social objects\". Social functions include both private and public sharing, formation of collaborative groups of users, and value-added annotation of shared datasets and models. The HydroShare web interface and social media functions were developed using the Django web application framework coupled to iRODS. Data visualization and analysis is supported through the Tethys Platform web GIS software stack. Links to external systems are supported by RESTful web service interfaces to HydroShare’s content. This presentation will introduce the HydroShare functionality developed to date and describe ongoing development of functionality to support collaboration and integration of data and models.",

            "abstract": "Micrometeorite impacts greatly modify surfaces exposed to the space environment. This interaction vaporizes the surficial material and allows for the re-precipitation of minerals and iron. Characterizing the recondensed iron or nanophase metallic iron (npFe0) improves our interpretations in remote sensing of planetary surfaces. We irradiated olivine samples with energies simulating micrometeorite impact energies from around the inner Solar System. They revealed npFe0 as single domain (SD) and superparamagnetic (SPM) iron grains varying in size. Spectrally they changed the spectral reflectance of silicate minerals and contribute to “space weathering”: (1) darkens the overall reflectance, (2) steepens (or reddens) the spectral slope, and (3) decreases the contrast in the silicate 1 µm band. Using frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility (MS), we revealed patterns of npFe0 sizes. Fresh samples contained some nanophase magnetic sources due to decreasing magnetic susceptibility, when changing frequency from 4 kHz to 16 kHz. Using the fresh olivine as a standard, the lunar analog displayed increased MS at the lower 4 kHz indicating that more iron was transformed into magnetic sources. At 16 kHz, the MS decreased due to SPM particles that were being formed with sizes <10 nm. With the Mercury analog, at higher 16 kHz frequencies the MS increased rather than decreased. We can infer that the excess energy from our laser converted the amount of smaller <10 nm SPM particles by growth into an increasing volume of >10 nm particles. With the asteroid analog, we found a lower MS at 16 kHz, but nothing less MS than the Lunar analog. The 4 kHz MS was similar to the fresh olivine. At the lowest irradiation energy for the asteroid sample we have evidence that we are producing npFe0 particles. Our data compares well with traditional methods of forming npFe0, such as thermal processing of olivine, suggesting that with laser irradiation there is a linear increase of nanoparticles with SW time, and a logarithmic increase in spectral change also with SW time.",

            "abstract": "General Circulation Models (GCMs) have promise for investigating the potential for natural hazards, such as landslides and floods, under a range of climate conditions. However, even downscaled output from GCMs can be too coarse to account for subgrid-scale variability in rainfall, especially in mountainous areas where orographic effects can enhance rainfall intensities to levels that trigger landslides. In order to investigate the potential for landslides, orographic enhancement of rainfall needs to be incorporated into downscaled rainfall estimates. Here, we describe one approach to account for orographic enhancement of rainfall estimates from dynamically downscaled GCM output. We use a stochastic simulation algorithm that generates site-specific rainfall time series conditioned on downscaled output. We demonstrate our approach by using this algorithm to generate rainfall time series at a 3-hour time step for a portion of Marin County, California over the time period 1990-2013. The conditioning data, which includes temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, were derived from output of the RegCM3 regional climate model at a spatial resolution of 15 km and a temporal resolution of 3 hours. We generated rainfall time series corresponding to several established rain gauge sites located from sea level to over 400 m in elevation to span a range of rainfall enhancement due to orographic forcing. This technique is applicable to areas with a sufficient rain gauge record, and will allow us to use downscaled output to investigate the potential for landslides under future climate conditions.",

These clouds produce upward currents from the top of thunderstorms which help maintain the potential difference between earth’s surface and the upper atmosphere. Previously, currents for different types of electrified clouds were estimated from overflights of the NASA ER-2 aircraft and compared with radar derived dynamical and microphysical properties. In this study, model output from two simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) are compared with conduction currents and other data derived from the lightning imaging sensor (LIS) and precipitation radar (RP) onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The intention is to determine CESM’s skill at representing these microphysical and dynamical properties of storms as well as to infer the global distributions of conduction currents over different spatial scales.\nSeveral variables from CESM were examined, including convective mass flux, in cloud ice water path, and convective precipitation. All three variables show a relationship with the derived currents based on TRMM measurements, yet these vary across different regimes and spatial scales. As will be shown, using the derived relationships, the total conduction current from CESM represents averaged diurnal variations of the fair weather electric field well. Also, averaged annual, monthly and diurnal variations of conduction currents will be shown for different regions of the world.",

            "abstract": "Many traditional landscape evolution models assume steady-state hydrology when computing discharge, and generally route flow in a single direction, along the path of steepest descent. Previous work has demonstrated that, for larger watersheds or short-duration storms, hydrologic steady-state may not be achieved. In semiarid regions, often dominated by convective summertime storms, landscapes are likely heavily influenced by these short-duration but high-intensity periods of rainfall. To capture these geomorphically significant bursts of rain, a new overland flow method has been implemented in the Landlab modeling framework. This overland flow method routes a hydrograph across a landscape, and allows flow to travel in multiple directions out of a given grid node. This study compares traditional steady-state flow routing and incision methods to the new, hydrograph-driven overland flow and erosion model in Landlab. We propose that for short-duration, high-intensity precipitation events, steady-state, single-direction flow routing models will significantly overestimate discharge and erosion when compared with non-steady, multiple flow direction model solutions. To test this hypothesis, discharge and erosion are modeled using both steady-state and hydrograph methods. A stochastic storm generator is used to generate short-duration, high-intensity precipitation intervals, which drive modeled discharge and erosion across a watershed imported from a digital elevation model, highlighting Landlab’s robust raster-gridding library and watershed modeling capabilities. For each storm event in this analysis, peak discharge at the outlet, incision rate at the outlet, as well as total discharge and erosion depth are compared between methods. Additionally, these results are organized by storm duration and intensity to understand how erosion rates scale with precipitation between both flow routing methods. Results show that in many cases traditional steady-state methods overestimate discharge and incision by orders of magnitude when compared to the hydrograph method. This suggests that the choice of flow-routing method can significantly impact evolving topography, especially if extrapolated across centennial-to-millennial timescales.",

            "abstract": "Vertical motions are essential in parameterizing convection in large-scale models. Yet in tropical systems vertical motions are difficult to obtain, especially in areas of active convection. This study uses three months of profiler data from Darwin, Australia to directly compare vertical velocity and spectrum width with reflectivity at a height of 1 km (a near-surface rain proxy) for shallow, mid-level, and deep convective clouds. Vertical velocities for all convective clouds were also compared to echo-top heights of varying reflectivities to better understand convective cloud dynamics in relation to their vertical structure.\nIn shallow convective clouds (tops <4 km) three distinct regimes appear: a weak up-and downdraft couplet at low reflectivities (0-15 dBz), a robust updraft at moderate reflectivities (20-35 dBz), and strong downdrafts at large reflectivities (>40 dBz). These regimes could represent different stages in the convective cloud life cycle with strong updrafts and moderate reflectivity occurring in the growing phase and strong downdrafts and large reflectivity occurring in the mature phase. The weak up-and downdraft couplet and low reflectivities suggest a dissipating phase. Mid-level convective clouds (tops 4-8 km) also show three distinct regimes: moderate updrafts at low reflectivities (possible growing phase), a weak up-and downdraft couplet at moderate reflectivities (possible dissipating phase), and strong up-and downdrafts at large reflectivities (mature phase). Deep convective clouds (tops >8 km) show strong updrafts above 4 km for all reflectivities with the strongest downdrafts occurring at large reflectivities. While maximum updrafts vary in height and occur at different reflectivities among cloud types, mean downdraft depth never exceeds 3 km and is always strongest at large reflectivities, which may allow better characterization of cold pool properties. Throughout all convective cloud types, spectrum width has the highest values at lower heights than where the strongest up-and downdrafts occur while also showing a maximum value core around the transition height. In addition, maximum vertical motions occur at or just beneath the 30-dBz echo-top height in all convective clouds, notably in the mixed phase region, suggesting possible links to electrification.",

            "abstract": "The idea that climatically modulated erosion may impact orogenic processes has challenged geoscientists for decades, However, to date, field-based work has produced controversial results. The central-western Alborz Mts. of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone are characterized by asymmetric precipitation superimposed on spatiotemporal changes in exhumation rates, deformation patterns, and prolonged, km-scale base-level changes. Our analysis suggests that despite the existence of a strong climatic gradient at least since 17.5 Ma, the early orogenic evolution was characterized by decoupled orographic precipitation and tectonics. In particular, faster exhumation and sedimentation along the more arid southern orogenic flank point to a north-directed accretionary flux and underthrusting of Central Iran. Conversely, from ~ 6 to 3 Ma, erosion rates along the northern orogenic flank became higher than those in the south, where they dropped to minimum values. This change occurred during a ~3-Myr-long, km-scale, base-level lowering event in the Caspian Sea. We speculate that mass redistribution processes along the northern flank of the Alborz Mts. and presumably across all mountain belts adjacent to the South Caspian Basin the Eurasian plate increased the sediment load in the basin leading to the underthusting of the Caspian Basin beneath the Alborz Mts. This underthrusting in turn triggered a new phase of northward orogenic expansion, transformed the wetter northern flank into a new pro-wedge, and led to the establishment of apparent steady-state conditions along the northern orogenic flank. Conversely, the southern mountain front became the retro-wedge and experienced limited tectonic activity. These observations overall raise the possibility that mass-distribution processes during a pronounced erosion phase driven by base-level changes may have contributed to the inferred regional plate-tectonic reorganization of the northern Arabia-Eurasia collision during the last ~ 5 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Lawsonite (CaAl2Si2O7(OH)2.H2O) is a hydrous mineral with a high overall water content of ~11.5 wt.%. It is a significant carrier of water in subduction zones to depths greater than ~150 km. The structure of lawsonite has been extensively studied under room temperature, high-pressure conditions. However, simultaneous high-pressure and high-temperature experiments are scarce. We have conducted synchrotron-based simultaneous high-pressure and temperature single crystal experiments on lawsonite up to a maximum pressure of 8.4 GPa at ambient and high temperatures. We used a natural sample of lawsonite from Valley Ford, California (Sonoma County). At room pressure and temperature lawsonite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with Cmcm symmetry. Room temperature compression indicates that lawsonite remains in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group up to ~9.0 GPa. Our 5.0 GPa crystal structure is similar to the room pressure structure, and shows almost isotropic compression of the crystallographic axes. Unit cell parameters at 5.0 GPa are a- 5.7835(10), b- 8.694(2), and c- 13.009(3). Single-crystal measurements at simultaneous high-pressure and temperature (e.g., >8.0 GPa and ~100 oC) can be indexed to a monoclinic P-centered unit cell. Interestingly, a modest temperature increase of ~100 oC appears to initiate the orthorhombic to monoclinic phase transition at ~0.6-2.4 GPa lower than room temperature compression studies have shown. There is no evidence of dehydration or H atom disorder under these conditions. This suggests that the orthorhombic to monoclinic transition could be kinetically impeded at 298 K, and that monoclinic lawsonite could be the dominant water carrier through much of the depth range of upper mantle subduction processes.",

            "abstract": "NO and NO2 (=NOx) have a large effect on air quality and chemistry. Oxidation reactions transform NOx into other reactive nitrogen species such as PAN, HNO3, organic nitrates and N2O5, which can act either as sinks or reservoirs of NOx. Together with NOx, the sum of these oxidized reactive nitrogen species is termed NOy. Ozone serves as a principal oxidant source for many of these reactions, and it is also produced or destroyed during subsequent chemical cycles. Therefore, simultaneous measurements of all four species (NO, NO2, NOy, and O3) are desirable.\nPrevious measurements of these species have principally been made by converting the compound of interest to NO, which is then detected using chemiluminescence. Alternatively, these species can be converted to NO2, which can then be detected using absorption spectroscopy. The use of a cavity ring down instrument allows for the accurate and rapid detection of NO2 in a compact and robust platform suitable for field deployments on numerous platforms, including vehicles and airplanes.\nIn this work we describe the first aircraft deployment of a four-channel cavity ring-down instrument capable of simultaneously measuring NO2, NO, NOy, and O3. This deployment took place during the 2015 Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) field campaign in the western United States. The instrument flew in tandem with a chemiluminescence instrument, which measured the same set of compounds. A separate instrument that measured NO2 by a related absorption technique, broadband cavity enhanced spectroscopy (BBCES) was also on board the aircraft. An intercomparison between these instruments will be presented, as well as data from the SONGNEX flights that illustrate the capabilities of the CRDS insrument.",

            "abstract": "Year-to-year variations in crop yields can have major impacts on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and may trigger significant global price fluctuations with particularly severe consequences for people in developing countries. The fluctuations can be induced by weather conditions but also by management decisions, diseases, and pests. To get a better understanding of future sensitivities to climate change it is important to quantify the degree to which historical crop yields are determined by weather fluctuations. This separation from other influences is usually done by highly simplified empirical models. In contrast, here we provide a conservative estimate of the fraction of the observed national yield variability that is caused by weather, using state-of-the-art process-based crop model simulations. As these models provide a detailed representation of our current understanding of the underlying processes they are also suitable to assess potential adaptation options. We provide an identification of the countries where the weather induced variability of crop yields is particularly high (explained variance > 50%). In addition, inhibiting water stress by simulating yields assuming full irrigation shows that water limitation is the main driver of the observed variations in most of these countries.",

Our approach is based on monitoring simultaneously a series of different physical parameters from space: Outgoing long-wavelength radiation (OLR) on the top of the atmosphere, electron and electron density variations in the ionosphere via GPS Total Electron Content (GPS/TEC), and ULF radiation and radiation belt electron precipitation (RBEP) accompanied by VLF wave activity into the topside ionosphere. In particular, we analyzed prospectively and retrospectively the temporal and spatial variations of various parameters characterizing the state of the atmosphere and ionosphere several days before the two M6.9 earthquakes. Concerning the Methoni EQ, DEMETER data confirm an almost standard profile before large EQs, with TEC, ULF, VLF and RBEP activity preceding some (four) days the EQ occurrence and silence the day of EQ; furthermore, during the period before the EQ, a progressive concentration of ULF emission centers around the future epicenter was confirmed. Concerning the recent Greek EQ of May 24, 2014, thermal anomaly was discovered 30 days and TEC anomaly 38 hours in advance accordingly. The spatial characteristics of pre-earthquake anomalous behavior were associated with the epicentral region. Our analysis of simultaneous space measurements before the great EQs suggests that they follow a general temporal-spatial pattern, which has been seen in other large EQs worldwide.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, data assimilation (DA) has emerged as a competitive method for climate field reconstruction (CFR). DA blends information from climate models with proxy observations to estimate the most plausible climate state that could have given rise to a set of observations, together with uncertainties about this state. The DA framework allows one to explicitly represent proxy complexity via proxy system models (PSMs), which are physically-based, potentially nonlinear models of proxy systems. In contrast, most (regression-based) CFR approaches make a number of strong assumptions that may not be met in practice, including the use of linear temperature-proxy relationships, or ignoring the confounding effects of dating uncertainties in proxy data.\nIn this study, we combine DA-based CFR techniques with proxy system modeling (PSM) to investigate uncertainties that arise as a result of these assumptions. We use PSM-generated pseudoproxy experiments to address three questions: (1) how much information is lost assuming proxies are linear, univariate responders to temperature? (2) does a misspecified proxy system contribute to poor climatic interpretations? and (3) given perfectly constrained proxy system parameters, what is the role of age uncertainties in blurring the retrieved climate signal?\nWe find that employing linearized models for complex proxy systems contributes to substantial information loss in climate field reconstructions, while other complications (including age uncertainties) may not prove as problematic in a multi-proxy framework. We investigate the utility of embedding PSMs in DA techniques for paleoclimate state estimation, and use them to explore new uncertainties in paleodata-model comparison associated with linearity and nonstationarity. Implications for the potential of paleoclimate reanalyses are discussed.",

However, due to solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) interactions, electric currents are induced which create an induced magnetosphere. As MAVEN passes through the ionosphere of Mars, the magnetometer on board continuously measures the induced magnetic field in the ionosphere. Using Ampere’s Law (∇ × B = µ0j) along with these measurements of the induced magnetic field, we can quantify the electric currents in the ionosphere. We are particularly interested in magnetic field profiles that have a radial component that is less than or equal to 5 nanoteslas in magnitude. By only using measurements where the radial component of the magnetic field satisfies the aforementioned condition and assuming that there are no horizontal gradients in the magnetic field, we will calculate horizontal currents in the ionosphere. Using these calculated currents, we will analyze altitudinal variations in magnitude and direction of the currents. Measuring these horizontal currents can give us insights into how the solar wind and IMF can affect the upper atmosphere of Mars. For example, induced electric currents can cause Joule heating in the atmosphere, which can potentially modify its neutral dynamics.",

Changing climate, especially increasing temperatures and frequency of extreme climate events, may cause changes in the frequency of blowdowns, but there has been little spatiotemporal analysis to associate the interannual variation in the frequency of blowdowns with annual climate parameters. We mapped blowdowns greater than 25 ha using a time series of Landsat images from 1984-2012 in the northwestern Amazon to estimate the annual size distribution of these blowdowns. The difference in forest area affected by blowdowns between the years with the highest and lowest blowdown activity were on the order of 10 – 30 times greater depending on location. Spatially, we found the probability of large blowdowns to be higher in regions with higher annual rainfall. Temporally, we found a positive correlation between the probability of large blowdown events and maximum dry season air temperature (R2 = 0.1-0.46). Mean and maximum blowdown size also increased with maximum dry season air temperature. The strength of these relationships varied between scene locations which may be related to cloud cover obscuring the land surface in the satellite images, or biophysical characteristics of the sites. Potentially, elevated dry season temperatures during the transition from the dry season to the wet season (October – December) may exacerbate atmospheric instabilities, which promote downburst occurrences. Most global circulation models predict dry season air temperatures to increase 2-5 ℃ in the northwestern Amazon by 2050. Should the blowdown disturbance regime continue increasing with elevated dry season temperatures, the northwestern Amazon is likely to experience more catastrophic tree mortality events which has direct consequences for both the carbon emissions and carbon storage capacity of the northwestern Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Ship tracks are clear manifestations of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI), which occur within confined linear structures and exclusively within strongly constrained environmental conditions. Furthermore a wide range of processes including the large-scale forcing, radiation, cloud dynamics and cloud microphysics are essential in the formation of such tracks. We therefore argue that they provide an ideal platform for studying and evaluating existing parameterisations and their interaction within the marine stratocumulus regime in real-case simulations.\nWe are using the COSMO model at resolutions between 1 and 50 km to investigate an episode of observed ship tracks over the Bay of Biscay. We have previously shown that the COSMO model with extensions from Zubler et al. (2011) including two-moment aerosol (Vignati et al 2004) and cloud microphysical parameterisations (Seifert and Beheng, 2006) is able to capture the essence of ship tracks in warm-phase stratocumulus in a shallow (cloud top below 700m) boundary layer at a 2-km resolution (Possner et al, 2015). The boundary layer structure of these simulations closely matched observed soundings obtained along the coast of the Bay of Biscay (Possner et al, 2014). The cloud brightening of the track (in terms of optical thickness τ) as observed by MODIS was found to be in good agreement with the simulations. Furthermore, the cloud microphysical response (in terms of cloud droplet number concentration and effective radius) was found to be in range of observed responses in various field campaigns.\nBuilding upon these initial results, we further explore the resolution dependence of the ACI in stratocumulus as we approach GCM resolution from the kilometer scale. Decreasing the spatio-temporal resolution from 2 km (20s) down to 50 km (180s) was found to lead to significant changes in the cloud radiative effect of the tracks of almost 300%, which can be tied to changes in vertical mixing and loss of spatial variability. Implications of this effect for low-resolution ship-track studies will also be discussed.",

At the same time, a USGS stream gauge on Sonoma Creek registered a coseismic increase in discharge. Public interest in the increased flow was heightened by a state of extreme drought in California. The combination of the earthquake and drought provides an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the origin of the new water because the flows did not mix with pre-existing surface waters and thus preserved their pristine composition. Following the earthquake we repeatedly surveyed the new streams and one spring, collecting data to test hypotheses about the origin of the new flows. We show that the new flows were meteoric in origin and likely groundwater in nearby mountains released by the earthquake. We also simulate the flows and estimate the total amount of new water to be of the order of 106 m3, about 1/40 of the annual water use in the Napa-Sonoma region. Our model makes a testable prediction that seismic velocity in the shallow crust would show a post-seismic decrease. ",

Since SOCCR diverse lines of inquiry on urbanization, urban areas and the carbon cycle have advanced our understanding of some of the societal processes through which energy and land uses affect carbon. This presentation provides an overview of these diverse perspectives. It suggests the need for approaches that complement and combine the plethora of existing insights into interdisciplinary explorations of how different urbanization processes, and socio-ecological and technological components of urban areas affect the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon emissions, differentially over time and within and across cities. It also calls for a more holistic approach to examining the carbon implications of urbanization and urban areas as places, based not only on demographics or income, but also on such other interconnected features of urban development pathways as urban form, economic function, economic growth policies and climate policies.",

            "abstract": "The neotectonics of the Anatolian and Aegean regions is the result of the African plate subduction along the Hellenic and Cyprus trenches and the Anatolian plate collision with the Eurosian plate. The African slab, as imaged by seismic tomography, penetrates the lower mantle and exhibits two major lateral tears below the Anatolian plate. The tears in the slab are related to low velocity structures in the sub-lithospheric mantle. The presence of low velocity structures in the upper mantle is a clear indication of anomalous asthenosphere (asthenospheric windows). What remains unclear is, however, how and to what extent the crust and upper mantle structure beneath the Anatolian region has been modified by the upwelling hot asthenospheric material.\nTo determine the effects of the upwelling hot asthenospheric material in the region, we developed a 3-D gravity model of the crust and upper mantle structure of the Aegean and Anatolian regions (24°-33° E and 34°-40° N). The gravity model is based on satellite-derived gravity data from GRACE, LAGEOS and GOCE missions (EIGEN 6C2). The results of the gravity modelling, as constrained by seismic tomography, shows that the crust above the asthenospheric window, where the subducted African slab exhibits major lateral tears, is relatively thin. The crustal thickness variation within the asthenospheric window area is between 24 & 29 km. In contrast, the regions outside the asthenospheric window area exhibit by far the largest crustal thickness (30 – 42 km). We therefore conclude that the observed crustal thinning in the asthenospheric window area might be attributed to thermal erosion induced by the upwelling hot asthenospheric material and extensional tectonics related to the Southwest retreating Hellenic trench and westward movement of the Anatolian micro plate. The thinning may also be responsible for the high geothermal gradient in the Denizli graben area where two major grabens (i.e., Alaşehir and Bűyűk Menderes Grabens) of Western Anatolia join together.",

In 2015 we mapped this submarine volcano in unprecedented detail with two submergence vehicles in tandem, facilitating a wide and comprehensive geological survey and sampling mission. These efforts and observations show highly complex and often simultaneous eruptive behavior from more than 14 vents along two 3 km-long fissures that represent massive ruptures of the caldera walls. This survey also revealed an important role for pre- and inter-eruptive periods of mass wasting processes derived from the intrusion of magma and destablisation of caldera walls. The detailed characterization of the eruption products, and quantification of timescales provides the scientific community with the first glimpse of the nature of submarine, intermediate magnitude, deep silicic caldera eruptions and permits unanswered yet first order fundamental questions of submarine eruption and transport processes to be addressed in the decades to come.",

            "abstract": "In urban settings where humans interact in complex ways with ecosystems, there may be hidden or unanticipated benefits (services) or harm (disservices) conferred by the built environment. We examined interactions of a highly vulnerable population, the homeless, with urban waterways and wetlands in the desert city of Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A. Climate change models project increases in heat, droughts, and extreme floods for the southwestern U.S. These projected changes pose a number of problems for sustainability and quality of future water supply, and the ability of human populations to mitigate heat stress and avoid fatalities. Urban wetlands that are created \"accidentally\" (by water pooling in abandoned areas of the landscape) have many structural (e.g., soils and hydrology) and functional (e.g., high denitrification) elements that mimic natural, unaltered aquatic systems. Accidental wetland systems in the dry bed of the Salt River, fed by storm and waste water from urban Phoenix, are located within economically depressed sections of the city, and show the potential for pollutant and heat mitigation. We used a mixed-method socio-ecological approach to examine wetland ecosystem functions and the ways in which homeless populations utilize Salt River wetlands for ecosystem services. Interviews and trash surveys indicated that homeless people are accessing and utilizing the wetlands as a source of running water, for sanitary and heat mitigation services, and for recreation and habitation. Environmental monitoring demonstrated that the wetlands can provide a reliable source of running water, nutrient and pathogen removal, heat mitigation, and privacy, but they may also pose a health risk to individuals coming in contact with the water through drinking or bathing. Whether wetlands provided a net benefit vs. harm varied according to site, season, and particular service, and several tradeoffs were identified. For example, heat is highest during the summer storm season, when pathogen loading is also high at most sites. These wetlands and waterways are not maintained and managed for ecosystem functions or services; our research suggests that accidental systems should be further examined to determine how they might be utilized and sustained by urban populations, particularly those who are socially vulnerable.",

            "abstract": "Engineering fracture systems in low permeable formations to increase energy production, accelerate heat extraction, or to enhance injectivity for storing anthropogenic CO2, is a challenging endeavor. To complicate matters, caprocks, essential components of subsurface reservoirs, need to maintain their sealing integrity in this modified subsurface system. Supercritical CO2 (scCO2), a proposed non-aqueous based working fluid, is capable of driving mineral transformations in fracture environments. Water dissolution in scCO2 significantly impacts the reactivity of this fluid, largely due to the development of thin adsorbed H2O films on the surfaces of exposed rocks and minerals. Adsorbed H2O films are geochemically complex microenvironments that host mineral dissolution and precipitation processes that could be tailored to influence overall formation permeability. Furthermore, manipulating the composition of injected CO2 (e.g., moisture content and/or reactive gases such as O2, NOx, or SOx) could stimulate targeted mineral transformations that enhance or sustain reservoir performance. PNNL has developed specialized experimental techniques that can be used to characterize chemical reactions occurring between minerals and pressurized gases. For example, hydration of a natural shale sample (Woodford Shale) has been characterized by an in situ infrared spectroscopic technique as water partitions from the scCO2 onto the shale. Mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation reactions were tracked by monitoring changes of Si-O and C-O stretching bands, respectively Structural changes indicated expandable clays in the shale such as montmorillonite are intercalated with scCO2, a process not observed with the non-expandable kaolinite component. Extreme scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used in conjunction with model mineral systems to identify the driving force and mechanism of water films. They showed that the film nucleation and formation on minerals is driven by both enthalpic and entropic requirements. Collectively, the synergy between laboratory observations, state-of-the-art atomistic simulations and reservoir modeling has generated important insights for the design and engineering of subsurface reservoirs for CO2 storage and energy extraction.",

Observations of MCSs were collected using a large array of mobile and fixed instrumentation, including ground-based radars, soundings, PECAN Integrated Sounding Arrays (PISAs), and aircraft. In addition to these observations, three mobile Parsivel disdrometers were deployed to obtain drop-size distribution (DSD) measurements to further explore microphysical processes in convective and stratiform regions of nocturnal MCSs. Disdrometers were deployed within close range of a multiple frequency network of mobile and fixed dual-polarization radars (5 – 30 km range), and near mobile sounding units and PISAs. Using mobile disdrometer and multiple-wavelength, dual-polarization radar data, microphysical properties of convective and stratiform regions of MCSs are investigated. The analysis will also examine coordinated Range-Height Indicator (RHI) scans over the disdrometers to elucidate vertical DSD structure. Analysis of dense observations obtained during PECAN in combination with mobile disdrometer DSD measurements contributes to a greater understanding of the structural characteristics and evolution of nocturnal MCSs.

We investigated the importance of glacial habitat characteristics in determining narwhal visitation. Narwhals (n=18) were instrumented with satellite transmitters in September 1993-1994 and 2006-2007 in Melville Bay, West Greenland. Daily narwhal locations were interpolated using a correlated random walk based on observed filtered locations and associated positional error. We also compiled a database on physical features of 41 glaciers along the northwest Greenland coast. This covered the entire coastal region with narwhal activity. Parameters included glacier ice velocity (km/yr) from radar satellite data, glacier front advance and retreat, and glacier width (km) at the ice-ocean interface derived using front position data digitized from 20-100m resolution radar image mosaics and Landsat imagery. We also quantified relative volumes and extent of glacial ice discharge, thickness of the glacial ice at the terminus (m), and water depth at the terminus (m) from gravity and airborne radar data, sediment flux from satellite-based analysis, and freshwater runoff from a regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO2.3). We quantified whale visits to glaciers at three distances (5, 7, and 10 km) and conducted proximity analyses on annual and monthly time steps. We estimated 1) narwhal presence or absence, 2) the number of 24 h periods spent at glaciers, and 3) the fraction of study animals that visited each glacier. The use of glacial habitat by narwhals expanded to the north and south between the 1990s (n=9 unique glaciers visited) and the 2000s (n=30 visited), likely due to loss of summer fast ice and later fall freeze-up trends (3.5 weeks later since 1979). We used a generalized linear mixed effects framework to quantify the glacier and fjord habitat characteristics preferred by narwhals.",

            "abstract": "The styles of basaltic explosive eruptions have a wide variety, which is usually attributed to the separation of volcanic gas from the surrounding silicate melt. As a mechanism of gas separation, shear deformation has been suggested. However, the bubble shape evolution under large strain at high strain rate and its effects on viscosity have not yet understood well.\nWe thus performed shear deformation experiments of bubbly liquid under high shear rate and large strain with in situ observation of bubble deformation and viscosity measurements. We used syrup solution as a magma analogue whose viscosity of 3, 50, 500 Pa s, similar to that of basaltic magma. We rotated disc-shaped bubbly syrup at shear rates of 0.03-10 s-1 with strains of 3-1000. Experiments show that deformed bubbles coalesce into larger bubbles and finally generate concentric air rings, resulting that the striped shape of air and liquid parts appears. The widths of air rings greatly exceed the bubble sizes and can be long outgassing pathways if those exist in a volcanic conduit. During the evolution of air rings the measured effective viscosity decreases, while after reaching to a steady state, viscous resistance increases again. At this stage, bubble volume and size in the liquid parts become considerably small. Time evolution of bubble size distribution suggests that most of bubbles are assimilated into the air rings and the remnants in the liquid parts break up into small bubbles.\nSimilar shear deformation of bubbly magma could occur in volcanic conduits, which generates large bubbles at a depth where the lower effective viscosity enhances the ascending velocity. The large bubbles may originate Strombolian eruption or suppresses the explosive eruption by making the long outgassing pathways reaching to the Earth’s surface. In both cases, bubble free dense melt accumulates at a shallow conduit. Our experiments suggest that, for larger melt viscosity and narrower conduit, the gas separation occurs efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Ideally, uncertainty estimation should be treated as an intrinsic part of solving an inverse problem, and techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion provide a route to achieving this. However, these approaches involve `posterior sampling’, and the (often significant) computational investment is entirely targeted towards one specific dataset.\nIn those cases where similar inverse problems must be solved repeatedly (perhaps for multiple locations on the Earth’s surface), or where results must be obtained within very limited timescales (e.g. earthquake early warning), this presents a barrier to use of methods such as MCMC. In such cases, approaches based on `prior sampling’ may be preferable. This separates the computationally-expensive step (generating samples in the joint data-model space) from the dataset-specific inversion stage, and permits one set of samples to be recycled for many different datasets. The essential difference between prior and posterior sampling is the stage at which the solution is conditioned on a given dataset.\nWe show that prior sampling can be implemented effectively, using learning algorithms to assimilate and apply information on the mapping between data and model spaces. We illustrate that this can be successfully applied in a range of geophysical problems. By comparing solutions based on prior sampling to those obtained via posterior sampling, we show that results are compatible---although the less focussed nature of prior sampling typically leads to more conservative uncertainty estimates in any given case. Nevertheless, for certain classes of problems, prior sampling appears to be a promising way forward.",

Data from two different field studies centered in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado and the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota will be used to perform a comprehensive source apportionment study. Measurements at both locations include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM2.5 and their precursor gases, and meteorological variables. Both sites are located near concentrated oil and natural gas operations but other local and regional emission sources differ. Other potential sources near Theodore Roosevelt National Park include increased diesel truck traffic, coal fired power plants and road dust. Rocky Mountain National Park is impacted by the transport of emissions from urban centers and agriculture in eastern Colorado. Additionally, the study at Theodore Roosevelt National Park occurred over two consecutive winters and the measurements at Rocky Mountain National Park were collected during the summer. Using these field study data and the EPA positive matrix factorization (PMF) tool, the different source factors for each field site will be investigated. In particular, the differences in the oil and gas factor from each study location will be discussed.",

Currently, high resolution spectra data for SO2 is very limited at 296K and mainly for the primary isotopologue 626. It cannot effectively support the observed data analysis and simulations. Recently we published a semi-empirically refined potential energy surface, denoted Ames-1, and Ames-296K IR line lists for SO2 626 and a few symmetric isotopologues including 646, 636, 666 and 828. The accuracy of line positions is around 0.01 - 0.03 cm-1 for most transitions. For intensities, most deviations are less than 5-15%. Now we have carried out new potential energy surface refinements by including latest experimental data and those of isotopologues. On the newly fitted surface, for the first time we have computed 296K line lists for the two most abundant asymmetric isotopologues, SO2 628 and SO2 627. We will present the spectra simulations of SO2 628 and SO2 627, and compare it with latest high resolution experimental spectroscopy of SO2 628. A composite \"natural\" line list at 296K is also available with terrestial abundances. These line lists will be available to download at\nhttp://huang.seti.org\n.",

            "abstract": "Field and laboratory observations reveal a source of primary marine organic aerosol that is emitted to the atmosphere along with inorganic sea salt during the wind-driven production of sea spray aerosol (SSA). Surface seawater processes and properties that control the amount and the composition of organics emitted to the atmosphere are not well understood. Ramifications of the emission of primary marine organic aerosol on clouds and climate have been suggested but not confirmed. An oceanic, biological impact on clouds and climate by primary marine aerosol requires that a) the organic fraction of SSA is controlled by surface ocean biological processes and b) that primary marine aerosol makes up a significant number fraction of CCN in the marine boundary layer.\nGeneration and characterization of freshly emitted SSA in the laboratory and at sea have revealed information about the size, composition, volatility, and hygroscopicity of primary marine aerosol. It has been shown that SSA is an internal mixture of sea salt and organics with the organic fraction increasing with decreasing particle size. In addition, quantification of the enrichment of organic matter in freshly emitted SSA relative to seawater has shown that high enrichments occur in regions of both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, indicating that enrichment can be decoupled from local biological activity.\nMeasurements of ambient (not generated) marine aerosol number size distributions and size-segregated chemical composition can be used to estimate the number fraction of CCN attributable to primary marine aerosol. An analysis of Eastern Pacific, Northern Atlantic, and Southern Ocean marine aerosol indicates that the primary marine aerosol makes up only a small fraction of the total CCN in the marine atmosphere.\nThis presentation will consider current evidence derived from generation of freshly emitted SSA and measurements of ambient marine aerosol to assess the role of primary marine aerosol organics in the biological regulation of climate.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the past decade, shale gas operations have moved closer to urban centers and densely populated areas, contributing to growing public concerns regarding exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). These HAPs include gases like hexane, 1,3-butadiene and BTEX compounds, which can cause minor health effects from short-term exposure or possibly cancer due to prolonged exposure. During the Barnett Shale Coordinated Campaign in October, 2013, ground-based whole air samples revealed enhancements in several of these toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) downwind of natural gas well pads and compressor stations. Two methods were used to estimate the emission rate of several HAPs in the Barnett Shale. The first method utilized CH4 flux measurements derived from the Picarro Mobile Flux Plane (MFP) and taken concurrently with whole air samples, while the second used a CH4 emissions inventory developed for the Barnett Shale region. From these two approaches, the regional emission estimate for benzene (C6H6) ranged from 48 ± 16 to 84 ± 26 kg C6H6 hr-1. A significant regional source of atmospheric benzene is evident, despite measurement uncertainty and limited number of samples. The extent to which these emission rates equate to a larger public health risk is unclear, but is of particular interest as natural gas productions continues to expand.",

Scanning electron microscopy at 900x magnification was used to image thin sections and identify peaks in iodine intensity using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy in three specimens from the Gulf of Mexico. Age determination by counting visual growth bands and iodine peaks were compared to both radiocarbon and U/Th-derived ages. The first specimen (GOM-JSL04-4734-BC1) has an iodine peak count age of 695 ±70, and growth band age of 785 ± 80 which compare quite well to the radiocarbon age of 670 ±40 years and a U/Th age of 780 ±16 years. There was similar agreement between the radiocarbon ages (1399 ±30 and 670 ±35 years) and the iodine peak count ages (1240 ±125 and 715±70 years) for the remaining two specimens with growth rates ranging from 11 ±3 to 16 ±2 µm yr-1 for all 3 specimens. Using the independent (iodine derived) age models in conjunction with the radiocarbon data, a high resolution ocean reservoir age record was developed for the last 600 years. Reservoir ages varied from 120 to 550 14C years on decadal to centennial time scales. The modern reservoir age in the GOM is 235 ±11 14C years. The preferred explanation for the variability found in these reservoir ages is related to changes in the strength of the Yucatan Current. This novel approach combines the identification of growth bands captured in high-resolution SEM in combination with synchronous peaks in skeleton iodine composition and is the first to validate that both can be used as annual chronometers. Using the independent iodine age models in conjunction with the radiocarbon records, ocean reservoir age records can be developed for the last ~500 to 1000 years.",

            "abstract": "Thaw lakes cover a large proportion of arctic coastal plains in the US, Canada, and Russia. These lakes are replenished by spring snowmelt and lose water to stream discharge and evapotranspiration during the short arctic summer. While some lakes display nearly static water levels throughout the summer, many fluctuate with some losing more than 50% of their water. We investigated the biogeochemical implications of these water level changes on nutrient fluxes and cycling by sampling several lakes over multiple years and using these data to build a simple lake nutrient cycling model. We find that lakes that lose greater than 20 % of their water display substantially higher nutrient concentrations than lakes with static water levels. The seasonal trend in nutrients, chlorophyll, and other basic water quality parameters suggests low, but positive rates of aquatic ecosystem productivity during the summer. Drained areas on lake margins remained moist for much of the summer and were used extensively by water birds. As lake water levels increased in the fall, a pulse of nutrients entered the lake, likely related to flushing and inundation of this terrestrial ecosystem. Chemical trends along a flowpath from the drained lake outlet into the drainage network suggests continued biogeochemical cycling and the potential importance of drained lake nutrients to downstream environments including river networks and coastal environments. Together, these findings indicate that drained lakes are relatively eutrophic and ecologically-productive, and thus need to be considered to understand nutrient cycling on the arctic coastal plain.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of the Arctic Ocean has been hugely advanced by release of gridded bathymetry and potential field anomaly grids. The Arctic Gravity Project grid achieves excellent, near-isotropic coverage of the earth north of 64˚N by combining land, satellite, airborne, submarine, surface ship and ice set-out measurements of gravity anomalies. Since the release of the V 2.0 grid in 2008, there has been extensive icebreaker activity across the Amerasia Basin due to mapping of the Arctic coastal nation’s Extended Continental Shelves (ECS). While grid resolution has been steadily improving over time, addition of higher resolution and better navigated data highlights some distortions in the grid that may influence interpretation.\nIn addition to the new ECS data sets, gravity anomaly data has been collected from other vessels; notably the Korean Icebreaker Araon, the Japanese icebreaker Mirai and the German icebreaker Polarstern. Also the GRAV-D project of the US National Geodetic Survey has flown airborne surveys over much of Alaska. These data will be Included in the new AGP grid, which will result in a much improved product when version 3.0 is released in 2015.\nTo make use of these measurements, it is necessary to compile them into a continuous spatial representation. Compilation is complicated by differences in survey parameters, gravimeter sensitivity and reduction methods. Cross-over errors are the classic means to assess repeatability of track measurements. Prior to the introduction of near-universal GPS positioning, positional uncertainty was evaluated by cross-over analysis. GPS positions can be treated as more or less true, enabling evaluation of differences due to contrasting sensitivity, reference and reduction techniques. For the most part, cross-over errors for racks of gravity anomaly data collected since 2008 are less than 0.5 mGals, supporting the compilation of these data with only slight adjustments.\nGiven the different platforms used for various Arctic Ocean surveys, registration between bathymetric and gravity anomaly grids cannot be assumed. Inverse methods, which assume co-registration of data produce, sometimes surprising results when well-constrained gravity grid values are inverted against interpolated bathymetry.",

            "abstract": "This work is a part of a study to identify available and reliable sources of solar irradiation data in Brazil – with a strong focus on their relevance for PV and CSP applications. One of these sources is the Meteonorm <http://meteonorm.com/>. Meteonorm is a comprehensive meteorological reference. It gives access to a catalogue of solar radiation data and meteorological data for solar applications and system design at any desired location in the world. The current report provides an evaluation of the solar irradiation data derived from version 7.0 of the Meteonorm software for Brazil. This evaluation was made by using the observation data of horizontal global solar irradiation from the SONDA/BSRN network <http://sonda.ccst.inpe.br/> for Petrolina (PTR), Brasilia (BRB), and São Martinho do Serra (SMS). These sites were chosen based on a careful data quality control, absence of daily gaps, and less than 60% of missing data per month. The Meteonorm data were generated with real input monthly average for each selected validation sites for the years 2011, 2013, and 2014. The analysis was performed by relative and cumulative frequency of annual and seasonal solar irradiance, based on the methodology proposed by Pierre Inechen, 2006. The results showed little interannual variability for the validation sites and presented a recurrent occurrence of the value of 1000W.m-2 for stations PTR and BRB. The Meteonorm was able to represent the high frequencies in these locations, however, presented an interannual variation greater than observed, and an overestimation of values. As for the seasonal analysis, it was possible to verify that the quarters which varied the most from one year to the next were the Dec-Jan-Feb and Sep-Oct-Nov in BRB station; Dec-Jan-Feb and Mar-Apr-May in the PTR station; and Dec-Jan-Feb in the SMS station. The Meteornorm was able identify the months of highest and lowest variability in the BRB and SMS stations, except PTR station which yielded a large variability for all quarters. Regarding the relative frequency of the clearness index, the Meteonorm overestimated the lowest values and underestimated the highest values. We concluded that the Meteonorm software it proved to be a valid alternative in pre-feasibility studies for solar energy projects in Brazil.\nSupported by Petrobras contract No. 23000.0073552011-96",

The SCCSC made it a priority to include the tribes as partners from its inception and both the Chickasaw Nation and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma participate in the center’s activities as consortium members. Under this arrangement, the SCCSC employs a full-time tribal liaison to facilitate relations with the tribes, develop partnerships for climate-relevant projects, build tribal stakeholder capacity, and organize tribal youth programs.\nIn 2014, the SCCSC published its Tribal Engagement Strategy (USGS Circular 1396) to outline its approach for developing tribal relationships. The conceptual plan covers each step in the multi-year process from initial introductory meetings and outreach to demonstrate commitment and interest in working with tribal staff, building tribal capacity in climate related areas while also building researcher capacity in ethical research, and facilitating the co-production of climate-relevant research projects. As the tribes begin to develop their internal capacity and find novel ways to integrate their interests, the plan ultimately leads to tribes developing their own independent research projects and integrating climate science into their various vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans.\nThis presentation will outline the multiple steps in the SCCSC’s Tribal Engagement Strategy and provide examples of our ongoing work in support of each step.",

            "abstract": "Satellite-based retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) are highly sensitive to the optical properties of the atmosphere, including clouds. Cloudy pixels, in particular, are screened in order to avoid potential retrieval contamination in their presence. Due to the lack of continuous in-situ observations across the global oceans, though, SSTs calculated from satellite radiances are often the most practical way to obtain a sufficient global estimate. Cloud clearing techniques struggle to flag cloudy retrievals from passive radiometers with cloud optical depths less than 0.3. These optically-thin clouds are almost exclusively cirrus. Corresponding radiance biases associated with unscreened cirrus can be significant due to their inherently cold cloud top temperatures.\nTo investigate frequency of such cloud contamination, 1-km SST observations over tropical oceans (±30° latitude) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite (AQUA-MODIS) are collocated with cloud profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument aboard NASA’s CALIPSO satellite. Potential SST biases based on radiance retrievals for MODIS, AVHRR and VIIRS are solved using a radiative transfer model (RTM) with integrated cirrus cloud properties of varying cloud top height and optical depth. Frequencies of occurrence for each cloud top height and optical depth from the collocated CALIOP/AQUA-MODIS data are superimposed upon the conceptual cloud SST radiance bias models to estimate potential net bias. Using the CALIPSO-MODIS collocations, clouds of all types are found to be present in the best quality AQUA-MODIS Level-2 data at a frequency of 25%, with over 90% of those clouds being cirrus. The RTM simulations suggest that when cirrus are present, the mean SST bias due only to cloud is over 0.6°C over the tropical oceans.",

            "abstract": "Recent thinning of Arctic sea ice has increased its drift from currents and winds. Increased ice drift could affect movements and energy balance of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) which rely, almost exclusively, on this substrate for hunting seals. Foraging by polar bears is a relatively sedentary behavior, as they typically capture their main prey by waiting at breathing holes, where seals haul-out along leads, or by short-distance stalking. We examined the response of polar bears to ice drift in the Beaufort (BS) and Chukchi (CS) seas, and between two periods with different sea ice characteristics: 1987-1998 and 1999-2013. We used satellite-tracked adult female polar bear locations, standardized by a continuous-time correlated random walk, coupled with modeled ice drift, to estimate displacement and drift-corrected bear movements along east-west and north-south axes. Sea ice drift in both regions increased with greater westward and more extreme northward and southward rates from 1987-1998 to 1999-2013. Polar bears responded with greater eastward movements and, in the CS greater movements north and south. We show that efforts by polar bears to compensate for greater westward ice drift in recent years translated into a model-derived estimate of 5.7-7.2% increase in energy expenditure. We also estimated that polar bears increased their travel time 18-20% between the two time periods, suggesting time allocated to foraging was reduced. Increased energetic costs and travel time resulting from greater ice drift, in conjunction with ongoing habitat loss, suggest that recent changes to Arctic sea ice may affect movements and energy balance of polar bears.",

            "abstract": "Glacial loading by continental ice sheets has been linked to large (> M6) Late Pleistocene and Holocene seismicity in Scandinavia and North America along with sedimentary basin blowout features such as Lake Howe, Manitoba Canada and glacio-tectonic thrust structures. The specter of future glaciations is considered one of the most important factors to consider in siting of high-level nuclear wastes in Switzerland, Canada, and Sweden. To date, continental-scale analysis of crustal failure has focused on mechanical failure which has neglected the effects of pore pressure and permeability changes. We have developed a two-dimensional, Cartesian, elastic, plane strain control volume finite element (CVFEM) model to investigate the effect of pore pressure on the failure potential along a cross-sectional transect stretching from the Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Our analysis considers fluid flow and pore pressure eveolution within the upper 10km of the earths crust and mechanical deformation within at 100 km thick lithosphere. We imposed 4 cycles of glaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet during the Last Late Pleistocene. The geomechanical deformation is coupled to the fluid flow through time dependent changes in the mean normal stress. We have conducted a sensitivity study in which we have varied the permeability of the upper crust between a range of 10-20 to 10-14 m2. We solve a series of one-dimensional heat transfer equations to determine regions where the Laurentide ice sheet is wet based or frozen. A Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria was used to analyze the potential of seismicity and permeability changes along pre-existing critically stressed faults. Mechanically failure (neglecting pore pressure evolution, see Figure A attached) caused by ice sheet induced stress perturbation were found to be primarily concentrate in the forebulge region of the ice sheet with the effective Coulomb stress being 4.4 MPa. However, when pore pressure evolution is considered in the failure analysis(see Figure B attached), a much higher effective Coulomb stress of 22 MPa has been seen underneath the interior of the ice sheet thickness, posing a failure over a broader region.",

            "abstract": "Depleted oil fields have been suggested as potential sites for sequestration of CO2 generated from the burning of hydrocarbons. However, to be effective for removing CO2 from the atmosphere, the injected CO2 must remain within the reservoir. The role of atmospheric CO2 in rock weathering is well known and a growing body of experimental work indicates that under reservoir conditions supercritical CO2 also reacts with sedimentary rocks. In order to predict the behavior of injected CO2 in a given reservoir, detailed knowledge of the mineralogy is required. In addition, post-injection monitoring may include analyzing core samples to examine interactions between reservoir rocks and the CO2. Thus, documentation of the natural diagenetic processes within the reservoir is necessary so that changes caused by reactions with CO2 can be recognized.\nKern County, California has been a major petroleum producing area for over a century and has three oil fields that have been identified as potential sites for CO2 sequestration. Two of these, Rio Bravo-Greeley and McKittrick, have no previously published mineralogic studies. Samples from these (and nearby Wasco) oil fields were studied using transmitted-light petrography and scanning electron microscopy. At Rio Bravo-Greeley-Wasco, Kreyenhagen (Eocene) and Vedder (Oligocene) sandstones are mainly arkosic arenites with only small amounts of volcanic rock fragments. Detrital feldspars exhibit wide compositional ranges (up to Or75Ab25 & Ab50An50). Diagenesis has greatly altered the rocks. There are significant amounts of relatively pure authigenic K-feldspar and albite. Small amounts of authigenic quartz, calcite, dolomite, ankerite, kaolinite, illite/smectite, chlorite, zeolite, and pyrite are present. Plagioclase has been preferentially dissolved, with andesine more susceptible than oligoclase. Al3+ has been exported from the sandstones. At McKittrick, Temblor sandstones (Oligocene-Miocene) contain up to 33% volcanic rock fragments. Detrital plagioclase is generally less calcic (<Ab70An30) than at Rio Bravo-Greeley. In spite of these differences, diagenesis was similar in both areas. Future modeling must take into account the wide compositional ranges of components; monitoring will need to consider the significant natural diagenetic alteration.",

These data include timing and volumes of eruptions, as well as erupted compositions. Thus models must take into account the coupled nature of physical attributes.\nHere we combine a thermo-mechanical model for magma chamber growth and pressurization with a chemical model for evolving chamber compositions, in the limit of rapid mixing, to study controls on eruption cycles and compositions through time. We solve for the mechanical evolution of a 1D magma chamber containing melt, crystals and bubbles, in a thermally evolving and viscoelastic crust. This pressure and temperature evolution constrains the input values of a chemical box model (Lee et al., 2013) that accounts for recharge, eruption, assimilation and fractional crystallization (REAFC) within the chamber. We plan to study the influence of melt supply, input composition, and chamber depth eruptive fluxes and compositions. Ultimately we will explore multiple chambers coupled by elastic-walled dikes. We expect that this framework will facilitate self-consistent inversion of long-term eruptive histories in terms of magma transport physics.\nLee, C.-T. A., Lee, T.-C., Wu, C.-T., 2013.

            "abstract": "The longstanding problem of the solar atmosphere heating has been addressed by many theoretical studies. Two specific mechanisms have been shown to play a key role in those : magnetic reconnection and waves. On the other hand the necessity of treating together chromosphere and corona has also been been stressed, with debates going on about the possibility of heating coronal plasma by energetic phenomena observed in the chromosphere,based on many key observations such as spicules, tornadoes….\nWe present some recent results about the modeling of quiet Sun heating in which magnetic fields are generated by a subphotospheric fluid dynamo which is connected to granulation. The model shows a topologically complex magnetic field of 160 G on the Sun's surface, agreeing with inferences obtained from spectropolarimetric observations.\nThose generated magnetic fields emerge into the chromosphere, providing the required energy flux and then small-scale eruptions releasing magnetic energy and driving sonic motions. Some of the more energetic eruptions can affect the very low corona only.\nIt is also found that taking into account a vertical weak network magnetic field then allows to provide energy higher in the corona, while leaving unchanged the physics of chromospheric eruptions. The coronal heating mechanism rests on the eventual dissipation of Alfven waves generated inside the chromosphere and carrying upwards an adequate energy flux, while more energetic phenomena contribute only weakly to the heating of the corona.",

            "abstract": "Stress drop, the difference between shear stress acting across a fault before and after an earthquake, is a fundamental parameter of the earthquake source process and the generation of strong ground motions. Higher stress drops usually lead to more high-frequency ground motions. Hough [2014 and 2015] observed low intensities in “Did You Feel It?” data for injection-induced earthquakes, and interpreted them to be a result of low stress drops. It is also possible that the low recorded intensities could be a result of propagation effects. Atkinson et al. [2015] show that the shallow depth of injection-induced earthquakes can lead to a lack of high-frequency ground motion as well.\nWe apply the spectral ratio method of Imanishi and Ellsworth [2006] to analyze stress drops of injection-induced earthquakes, using smaller earthquakes with similar waveforms as empirical Green’s functions (eGfs). Both the effects of path and linear site response should be cancelled out through the spectral ratio analysis. We apply this technique to the Guy-Greenbrier earthquake sequence in central Arkansas. The earthquakes migrated along the Guy-Greenbrier Fault while nearby injection wells were operating in 2010-2011. Huang and Beroza [GRL, 2015] improved the magnitude of completeness to about -1 using template matching and found that the earthquakes deviated from Gutenberg-Richter statistics during the operation of nearby injection wells. We identify 49 clusters of highly similar events in the Huang and Beroza [2015] catalog and calculate stress drops using the source model described in Imanishi and Ellsworth [2006]. Our results suggest that stress drops of the Guy-Greenbrier sequence are similar to tectonic earthquakes at Parkfield, California (the attached figure). We will also present stress drop analysis of other suspected induced earthquake sequences using the same method.",

Our collaborative engagement with stakeholders, especially in the transboundary Mara Basin (Kenya & Tanzania) will be presented, based on the efforts of our SERVIR Applied Sciences Team Project and collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD, Nairobi) and a range of Kenyan Water Resources Agencies at several levels. The evolving process of our dialogue with users and stakeholders will be highlighted: from the early stages of the project to characterize monitoring and forecasting needs, through the co-development of applications, communication of model results, feedbacks, synergies, current uses, next steps and lessons learned. From these and other collective experiences, we outline a policy approach – or best practices – to understand decision context and maximize the relevance and adoption of Earth Observation applications for water and environmental management in Africa, and thus building capacity in local organizations.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_2015_rev0.pdf\nSince landing in August 2012, DAN has provided a wealth of scientific data from the successful surface operation in both Active mode and Passive mode. The main scientific objectives of DAN are twofold. The primary objective is to measure the bulk hydrogen abundance (in forms of water or hydrated minerals) of the subsurface. The secondary objective is to measure the background neutron environment at the surface. DAN achieves the first objective by using the pulsed neutron generator (PNG) as a pulsed 14 MeV neutron source (active mode). When no neutron pulse is used (passive mode), DAN measures the neutron background environment at the Martian surface. The DAN active data have extensively and successfully used in estimating the near-surface contents of hydrogen (in terms of “water equivalent hydrogen” or WEH) and chlorine (in terms of “absorption equivalent chlorine” or AEC) at multiple locations in Gale crater. In the mean time, DAN has been accumulating the passive mode data in almost all sols since landing, and it is the main topic of this presentation. Particularly, we want to show the DAN data on Sol 991 and 992 where we observed very high passive thermal neutron count – a factor of ~2 higher than usual count. As a reminder, note that many different factors would influence the amplitude of DAN passive thermal neutron counts – GCR condition, soil compositions, water/chlorine contents, etc.\nThe Sol 991/992 location, which is at a region near a rock target called Elk in Marias Pass, was also analyzed by another MSL instrument ChemCAM. And interestingly, its data show that the Elk target is estimated to contain as high as 80 wt% of SiO2, which is radically different from what we have used as a reference soil composition for the interpretation of the DAN passive data. This means that the DAN passive data simulations have to be revisited to account for different soil composition data at the Elk target region. In the final presentation, we will present new simulation results based on the ChemCAM measured soil composition at Elk and the impact of water/chlorine content variation to the DAN passive thermal neutron counts. The DAN active data at Elk will be discussed in a companion paper by M. Litvak.",

Metal contamination from mining effluent can modify the biofilm community structure, diversity, and activity. Developing a mechanistic understanding of the biofilm response to metal contamination could provide a useful bioindicator of metal toxicity due to the ease of standard biofilm sampling, environmental ubiquity of biofilms and the rapid response of biofilms to environmental perturbation and metal toxicity. Here we present data on the structure of the biofilm community (e.g., microbial population composition and diversity) and trace metal concentrations in water, bed sediment and biota (benthic insects) across 15 sites in the Clark Fork Basin. Sample sites were selected across a historically-monitored metal pollution gradient at shallow riffles with bed sediment predominantly composed of pebbles, cobbles, and sand. Bed-sediment samples (for biofilm analysis) were obtained from the top 20 centimeters of the hyporheic zone and sieved using sterile sieves to obtain homogeneous sediment samples with particle sizes ranging from 1.70 to 2.36 millimeters. Linear discriminant analysis and effect size statistical methods were used to integrate the metals concentration data (for water and benthic-insects samples) with the microbial community analysis to identify microbial biomarkers of metal toxicity. The development of rapid microbial biomarker tools could provide reproducible and quantitative insights into the effectiveness of remediation activities on metal toxicity and advances in the field of environmental biomonitoring.",

As oceanography matured after WWII, a new style of collaborative program emerged that focused on specific processes or problems rather than general exploration; the International Geophysical Year (IGY, 1957-58) was followed by the International Decade of Ocean Exploration (IDOE, 1970s). The latter set the stage for regular campaign-style oceanography focused on large-scale problems beyond the capability of individuals or small groups. These have become a staple of international oceanography and provide a framework around which oceanographers from around the world can contribute to global ocean discovery regardless of the capabilities of their individual nations. These collaborations have explored everything from processes controlling and associated with the formation of new ocean floor (RIDGE) to the Census of Marine Life. New collaborations have extended the concept of the international campaign to networks of autonomous vehicles (ARGO) in which all data are freely available. Regardless of the immediate discoveries associated with a campaign, much of its influence derives from the free availability of the data. Those research programs that have made digital data freely available have had an enormous follow-on impact as new models (digital and otherwise) are applied to the results.\n.",

            "abstract": "To account for the presence of seismic anisotropy within the crust and to estimate the relevant parameters, we first discuss a robust technique for the analysis of shear-wave splitting in layered anisotropic media by using converted shear phases. We use a combined approach that involves time-shifting and stacking of radial receiver functions and energy-minimization of transverse receiver functions to constrain the splitting parameters (i.e. the fast-polarization direction and the delay time) for an anisotropic layer. In multi-layered anisotropic media, the splitting parameters for the individual layers can be inferred by a layer-stripping approach, where the splitting effects due to shallower layers on converted phases from deeper discontinuities are successively corrected.\nThe effect of anisotropy on the estimates of crustal thickness and average bulk Vp/Vs ratio can be significant. Recently, we extended the approach of Zhu & Kanamori (2000) to include P-to-S converted waves and their crustal reverberations generated in the anisotropic case. The anisotropic parameters of the medium are first estimated using the splitting analysis of the Ps-phase as described above. Then, a grid-search is performed over layer thickness and Vp/Vs ratio, while accounting for all relevant arrivals (up to 20 phases) in the anisotropic medium.\nWe apply these techniques to receiver-function data from seismological stations across the Turkish-Anatolian Plateau to study seismic anisotropy in the crust and its relationship to crustal tectonics. Preliminary results reveal significant crustal anisotropy and indicate that the strength and direction of the anisotropy vary across the main tectonic boundaries. We also improve the estimates of the crustal thickness and the bulk Vp/Vs ratio by accounting for the presence of crustal anisotropy beneath the station.\n",

Whose interests are served by such changes? Two common mistakes are assuming stability in the community of stakeholders and consistency in stakeholder behavior. Stakeholder communities can reconfigure dramatically as some leave the discussion, others enter, and circumstances shift — all resulting in dynamic points of alignment and misalignment . New stakeholders can bring new interests, and existing stakeholders can change their positions.

            "abstract": "Fluids and minor phases have an important influence on the bulk rheology of a deforming rock mass, but they are not uniformly distributed at any scale within fault zones. Additionally, exhumed ductile shear zones show little interconnected porosity or static permeability, requiring a dynamic process at depth to allow fluids to access the deforming rock mass. It was recently recognized that reactive fluids interact with high-strain sites to generate cavities on quartz grain boundaries, increasing the grain-scale porosity and dynamic permeability of the rock and allowing for additional fluids to infiltrate the shear zone along interlinking cavities, stimulating further reaction and cavitation. Grain-boundary cavities and fine-grained secondary phases impede grain-boundary mobility and cause a transition in deformation mechanisms from grain-size insensitive dislocation creep to grain-size sensitive creep, which is recognized as a weakening mechanism that promotes strain localisation.\nAt present, it is unclear how the distribution of grain-boundary pores within fault rocks reflects the bulk mineralogy and phase arrangement, which is a function of shear strain. We have used micro-computed x-ray tomography (μ-CT), SEM imaging, and EDS analyses to examine how the distribution of grain-boundary pores varies in relation to the arrangement of secondary phases in exhumed protomylonites, mylonites, and ultramylonites within the actively-deforming Alpine Fault zone, and in samples acquired from the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP). Additionally, EBSD is coupled with µ-CT and EDS analyses to characterise the evolution of microstructures in three dimensions across a finite strain gradient. Here we examine the relationship and competition between grain-boundary cavitation and microstructural processes during deformation in a high-strain shear zone, and discuss the implications of these grain-scale deformation processes on strain localisation and continental fault zone dynamics.",

Since then and until April 2015, the social perception changed according to different factors: age, location, education, culture, vulnerability. This variability produces a maze of challenges that go beyond the scientific knowledge. Volcanic health hazards began to be understood in 2008 after the eruption of Chaiten volcano. The particle size of ashfall (<10 μ) and the silica composition were the main factors of concern on epidemiological monitoring. In 2011 the volcanic complex Puyehue - Cordon Caulle eruption produced ashfall through plumes that reached densely populated cities like San Carlos de Bariloche and Buenos Aires. Farther away in South Africa and New Zealand ash plumes forced airlines to cancel local and international flights for several weeks. The fear of another eruption did not wait long when Calbuco volcano started activity in April 2015, it came at a time when Villarrica volcano was also in an eruptive phase, and the SERNAGEOMIN Chile, through the Observatory OVDAS of the Southern Andes, faced multiple natural disasters at the same time, 3 volcanoes in activity, lahars, pyroclastic flows and floods in the North. In Argentina, critical infrastructure, farming, livestock and primary supplies were affected mainly in the western region. Copahue volcano, is increasing unstability on seismic and geochemistry data since 2012. Caviahue resort village, distant only 8 Km. from the active vent happens to be a high vulnerable location. In 2014 GEVAS (Geology, Volcanoes, Environment and Health) Network ARGENTINA Civil Association started collaborative activities with SEGEMAR and in 2015 with the IAPG (Geoethics, Argentina), intending to promote Best Practices in volcanic and geological hazards. Geoscientists and the volcano vulnerable population are aware about the governmental commitment to assume a strategic planning for mitigation, facing a volcanic emergency. Recently, university undergraduate students from Chile and Argentina are networking to acquire the skills needed for a better preparedness to the next volcanic eruption.",

The escaping neutrals are photoionized and the heavy ions (N2+) move away from Pluto in the direction perpendicular to the solar wind flow (i.e., nearly unmagnetized relative to the length scales of the plasma interaction region). The turning distance of the solar wind protons at the magnetic pileup boundary is large compared to the interaction region. As a result, large ion gyroradius effects determine Pluto's highly asymmetric interaction with the solar wind. We use a three-dimensional hybrid code (fluid electrons, kinetic ions) to investigate the geometry of the interaction region using recent atmospheric models for hybrid simulation input. We will present initial results, showing the sensitivity of bow shock location to variations in the model atmosphere as well as variations in the solar wind conditions. Synthetic energy spectrograms taken from the simluations could be directly compared with the New Horizons plasma data to further constrain model input parameters. Initial results indicate that a full bow shock could form with possible structuring in the wake region due to bi-ion waves and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves.",

Compressed High-Intensity Radiated Pulse (CHIRP) records from 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler were obtained from the cruise: NBP0703 (2007); and pinger 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler records from the cruises: ECA-50 INACH (2014), and First Colombian Expedition (2015). Several seismic facies were recognized in all studied areas with some variability on their thickness and extent, and indicate the occurrence of similar sedimentary processes. These are: SSD facies (strong to weak intensity, stratified, draped sheet external shape), is interpreted as sedimentary deposits originated from suspended sediments from glaciar plumes and/or ice-rafting. This facies, in general, is thicker in the fjords of King George Island than in the larger fjords of the Danco Coast; on the other hand, within the Danco Coast area, this facies is thinner and more scarce in the smaller fjords and bays. MCM facies (moderate intensity, chaotic and with mounds) is associated with moraine deposits and/or basement. This is present in all areas, being most abundant in the Danco Coast area. WIC facies (weak intensity and chaotic) is interpreted as debris flows, which are present in both regions, but is most common in small fjords or bays in the Danco Coast, perhaps due to higher slopes of the seabed. In this work we discuss the influence of local climate, sediment plumes from the glaciers and other sedimentary processes on the distribution and geometry of the identified seismic facies.",

            "abstract": "It has long been known that basal mechanics of ice streams are sensitive to short- timescale hourly to seasonal forcings, such as water pressure fluctuations and tidal loading as well as long-timescale (yearly to decadal) thinning. Designing SAR short repeat time observations to cover nearly an entire test-site in Antarctica from ascending and descending orbital directions, using every available SAR satellite is fundamental for understanding a new class of phenomena, underlying the physics of glaciers and ice streams. Understanding grounding-line dynamics is necessary for predictions of long-term ice-sheet stability. However, despite growing observations of the tidal influence on grounding-line migration, this short-timescale migration is poorly understood, with most modeling attempts assuming beam theory to calculate displacements. Knowing the position of the grounding line with accuracy is important for the global mass balance of ice sheets or for quantitatively modeling the mechanical interaction between ice shelves and ice sheets. Here we present a general method for retrieving three dimensional displacement vector given a set of multiple tracks, multiple geometry SAR acquisitions. The algorithm extends the single line of sight mathematical framework to the four spatial and temporal dimensions including both range and azimuth measurements. We designed COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) observations of Rutford Ice Stream to cover nearly the grounding zone from ascending and descending orbital directions using every available CSK satellite This spatially comprehensive observational scheme allowed us to derive time series of the 3-dimensional surface displacement for the grounding zone, facilitating studies of ice stream mechanics and tidally induced grounding line migrations with unprecedented spatial extent and temporal resolution. Having a constellation with occasional 1- day repeat time and an average 4-days repeat time is beneficial when looking at displacements of more than a meter per day. We compared our results with GPS time series and optical offset maps showing the fundamental role of short repeat time-series to disentangle secular velocities from tidal effects deforming the ice stream periodically.",

            "abstract": "Public STEM events are an excellent method to implement informal education and for scientists and educators to interact with their community. The benefits of such events are twofold. First and foremost, science enthusiasts and students both young and old, in particular, are exposed to STEM in a way that is accessible, fun, and not as stringent as may be presented in classrooms where testing is an underlying goal. Second, scientists and educators are given the opportunity to engage with the public and share their science to an audience who may not have a scientific background, thereby encouraging scientists to develop good communication practices and skills.\nIn 2009 graduate student members of Astronomy Live!, an outreach organization in the UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy, started a free and public event on the campus that featured a dozen hands-on outreach activities. The event, though small at the time, was a success and it was decided to make it an annual occurrence. Thus, Exploring Your Universe (EYU) was born. Primarily through word of mouth, the event has grown every year, both in number of attendees and number of volunteers. In 2009, approximately 1000 people attended and 20 students volunteered over the course of an eight-hour day. In 2014, participation was at an all-time high with close to 6000 attendees and over 400 volunteers from all departments in the Division of Physical Sciences (plus many non-divisional departments and institutes, as well as non-UCLA organizations). The event, which is the largest STEM event at UCLA and one of the largest in Los Angeles, now features near 100 hands-on activities that span many STEM fields. EYU has been featured by the UCLA news outlets, Daily Bruin and UCLA Today, and is often lauded as their favorite event of the year by attendees and volunteers alike.\nThe event is entirely student-run, though volunteers include faculty, staff, researchers and students alike. As the event has grown, new systems for managing its many aspects have been adopted. Here, we will present the details of how the event was created and has remained successful, and sustainable.",

            "abstract": "The concepts of virtual water and water footprint are becoming widely used in the scientific literature and they are proving their usefulness in a number of multidisciplinary contexts. With such growing interest a measure of data reliability (and uncertainty) is becoming pressing but, as of today, assessments of data sensitivity to model parameters, performed at the global scale, are not known. This contribution aims at filling this gap.\nStarting point of this study is the evaluation of the green and blue virtual water content (VWC) of four staple crops (i.e. wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) at a global high resolution scale. In each grid cell, the crop VWC is given by the ratio between the total crop evapotranspiration over the growing season and the crop actual yield, where evapotranspiration is determined with a detailed daily soil water balance and actual yield is estimated using country-based data, adjusted to account for spatial variability. The model provides estimates of the VWC at a 5x5 arc minutes and it improves on previous works by using the newest available data and including multi-cropping practices in the evaluation. The model is then used as the basis for a sensitivity analysis, in order to evaluate the role of model parameters in affecting the VWC and to understand how uncertainties in input data propagate and impact the VWC accounting. In each cell, small changes are exerted to one parameter at a time, and a sensitivity index is determined as the ratio between the relative change of VWC and the relative change of the input parameter with respect to its reference value. At the global scale, VWC is found to be most sensitive to the planting date, with a positive (direct) or negative (inverse) sensitivity index depending on the typical season of crop planting date. VWC is also markedly dependent on the length of the growing period, with an increase in length always producing an increase of VWC, but with higher spatial variability for rice than for other crops. The sensitivity to the reference evapotranspiration is highly variable with the considered crop and ranges from positive values (for soybean), to negative values (for rice and maize) and near-zero values for wheat. This variability reflects the different yield response factors of crops, which expresses their tolerance to water stress.",

The students interact with faculty conducting cutting edge research and with resource managers facing decision-making under uncertainty. This internship format allows the participants to see the direct impacts of climate variability and change on the Texas Hill Country, prairie and forest ecosystems and tribal cultures in Oklahoma, and the bayous, delta and coastline of Louisiana.\nImmersive experiences are key for exposing students to academic research and providing them with the skills and experiences needed to continue on in their professional careers. The SCCSC’s program introduces students to how research is conducted, gives them a broad perspective on how collaborations form, and starts each student on the path to building a large and diverse professional network. By providing participants with a “buffet” of options, our internship serves as a launching pad from which each student can move forward towards experiences such as participating in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, gaining employment in a STEM-related career path, and being accepted into a graduate degree program.\nThis presentation will describe the components of the SCCSC’s internship program and provide a summary of post-internship student successes.",

In this article, we propose a search engine framework for mining and utilizing dataset relevancy from oceanographic dataset metadata, usage metrics, and user feedback. The objective is to improve discovery accuracy of oceanographic data and reduce time for scientist to discover, download and reformat data for their projects. Experiments and a search example show that the propose engine helps both scientists and general users search for more accurate results with enhanced performance and user experience through a user-friendly interface.",

            "abstract": "Urban stormwater is an on-going management concern in municipalities of all sizes. In both combined or separated sewer systems, pollutants from stormwater runoff enter the natural waterway system during heavy rain events. Urban flooding during frequent and more intense storms are also a growing concern. Therefore, stormwater best-management practices (BMPs) are being implemented in efforts to reduce and manage stormwater pollution and overflow. The majority of BMP water quality studies focus on the small-scale, individual effects of the BMP, and the change in water quality directly from the runoff of these infrastructures. At the watershed scale, it is difficult to establish statistically whether or not these BMPs are making a difference in water quality, given that watershed scale monitoring is often costly and time consuming, relying on significant sources of funds, which a city may not have. Hence, there is a need to quantify the level of sampling needed to detect the water quality impact of BMPs at the watershed scale. In this study, a power analysis was performed on data from an urban watershed in Lafayette, Indiana, to determine the frequency of sampling required to detect a significant change in water quality measurements. Using the R platform, results indicate that detecting a significant change in watershed level water quality would require hundreds of weekly measurements, even when improvement is present. The second part of this study investigates whether the difficulty in demonstrating water quality change represents a barrier to adoption of stormwater BMPs. Semi-structured interviews of community residents and organizations in Chicago, IL are being used to investigate residents understanding of water quality and best management practices and identify their attitudes and perceptions towards stormwater BMPs. Second round interviews will examine how information on uncertainty in water quality improvements influences their BMP attitudes and perceptions.",

            "abstract": "Rock salt is a potential medium for the underground disposal of nuclear waste because it has several assets, such as its ability to creep and heal fractures and its water and gas tightness in the undisturbed state. In this research, we focus on disposal of heat-generating nuclear waste and we consider a generic salt repository with in-drift emplacement of waste packages and crushed salt backfill. As the natural salt creeps, the crushed salt backfill gets progressively compacted and an engineered barrier system is subsequently created [1].\nThe safety requirements for such a repository impose that long time scales be considered, during which the integrity of the natural and engineered barriers have to be demonstrated. In order to evaluate this long-term integrity, we perform numerical modeling based on state-of-the-art knowledge. Here, we analyze the impacts of halite dissolution and precipitation within the backfill and the host rock. For this purpose, we use an enhanced equation-of-state module of TOUGH2 that properly includes temperature-dependent solubility constraints [2]. We perform coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical modeling and we investigate the influence of the mentioned impacts. The TOUGH-FLAC simulator, adapted for large strains and creep, is used [3].\nIn order to quantify the importance of salt dissolution and precipitation on the effective porosity, permeability, pore pressure, temperature and stress field, we compare numerical results that include or disregard fluids of variable salinity. The sensitivity of the results to some parameters, such as the initial saturation within the backfill, is also addressed.\n",

            "abstract": "The instruments on board the CASSINI spacecraft observed large carbonaceous molecules in the upper atmosphere of Titan. How these large polyatomic molecules are synthesized in such exotic conditions is, thus far, unknown. Molecular ions, including positive and negative ions, especially large anions, are in abundance in the ionosphere of Titan. Barrier-less ion-molecule interactions may play a major role ­– ions provide electrostatic steering force – in guiding molecules towards each other and initiating reactions. We study these condensation pathways to determine whether they are a viable means of forming large pure hydrocarbon molecules, and nitrogen-containing carbonaceous chains, stacks, and even cyclic compounds. We employ accurate quantum chemical methods to investigate the processes of growth, structures, nature of bonding, mechanisms, and spectroscopic properties of the ensuing ionic products after pairing small carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen-containing molecules with major ions observed in the upper atmosphere of Titan, e.g. C2H5+ and HCNH+, apart from a whole host of small hydrocarbons. We also studied the ion-neutral association pathways involving pure-carbon molecules e.g. acetylene, ethylene and other hydrocarbons, and their dissociation fragments in a plasma discharge. We found the molecular building blocks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenyl cations can form very easily by the combination of smaller hydrocarbons followed by hydrogen loss. We have investigated how nitrogen atoms are incorporated into the carbon ring during growth. Specifically, we explored the mechanisms by which the synthesis of pyrimidine will be feasible in the atmosphere of Titan in conjunction with ion-mobility experiments. Futher, we study the formation process of anions, and study their potential energy surfaces. We have used accurate ab initio coupled cluster theory, Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, density functional theory (DFT), and coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)) quantum chemical methods together with large correlation consistent basis sets in these investigations. We found that a series of hydrocarbons with a specific stoichiometric composition prefers cyclic molecule formation rather than chains.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind electron velocity distribution function (eVDF) exhibits a great variety of non-thermal features that deviate from thermal equilibrium. These deviations from thermal equilibrium provide a local source for electromagnetic fluctuation emissions, which among others include the electron whistler-cyclotron and firehose instabilities. We present a systematic analysis of Wind-SWE-VEIS observations of solar wind electron plasma and their associated Wind-MFI observed magnetic fluctuations. We show for the first time clear evidence that the temperature anisotropy threshold of the parallel electron anisotropic instability bounds solar wind electrons — when the full electron distribution and its moments are considered — during slow solar wind periods. Analysis shows that during slow solar wind periods, collisional effects are dominant. During fast solar wind periods, magnetic fluctuations and solar wind anisotropies are enhanced above the parallel whistler anisotropic threshold boundary and collisional effects are drastically reduced. Preliminary calculations further show that the oblique electron whistler mirror anisotropic instability bounds both the slow and fast solar wind. Regardless of solar wind speed, the solar wind electron thermal anisotropy appears globally bounded by the parallel electron firehose instability for anisotropies Te,perp / Te,parallel < 1. When considering collisional effects, our results indicate that collisions are rare in the solar wind, yet appear to play a necessary role in regulating the eVDFs. The results of our analysis are strikingly different from those for solar wind ions suggesting that the slow solar wind electron plasma is only marginally stable with respect to parallel propagating instabilities.",

            "abstract": "Scientists and engineers design river topography for a wide variety of uses, such as experimentation, site remediation, dam mitigation, flood management, and river restoration. A recent advancement has been the notion of topographical design to yield specific fluvial mechanisms in conjunction with natural or environmental flow releases. For example, the flow convergence routing mechanism, whereby shear stress and spatially convergent flow migrate or jump from the topographic high (riffle) to the low point (pool) from low to high discharge, is thought to be a key process able to maintain undular relief in gravel bedded rivers. This work develops an approach to creating riffle-pool topography with a form-process linkage to the flow convergence routing mechanism using an adjustable, quasi equilibrium synthetic channel model. The link from form to process is made through conceptualizing form-process relationships for riffle-pool couplets into geomorphic covariance structures (GCSs) that are then quantitatively embedded in a synthetic channel model. Herein, GCSs were used to parameterize a geometric model to create five straight, synthetic river channels with varying combinations of bed and width undulations. Shear stress and flow direction predictions from 2D hydrodynamic modeling were used to determine if scenarios recreated aspects of the flow convergence routing mechanism. Results show that the creation of riffle-pool couplets that experience flow convergence in straight channels require GCSs with positively covarying bed and width undulations in their topography as supported in the literature. This shows that GCSs are a useful way to translate conceptualizations models of form-process linkages into quantitative models of channel form. Beyond synthetic examples, several real-world examples of restoration projects that use this approach are shown and discussed.",

It remains to be tested if natural and induced earthquakes share the same behavior. The Coso Geothermal Field is one of the most seismically active areas in California and features an abundance of natural seismicity due to active tectonics and a large number of induced earthquakes resulting from geothermal power production since 1987. We study natural and induced earthquakes comparatively in the same tectonic setting at the Coso Geothermal Field. Covering the pre- and co-production periods from 1981 to 2013, we analyze inter-event times, spatial dimension, and frequency-size distributions for natural and induced earthquakes. Individually, these distributions are statistically indistinguishable.\nDetermining the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances in a combined space-time-magnitude metric lets us identify the triggering relationship of an earthquake pair. Nearest-neighbor pairs naturally fall into two populations that are categorized as either clustered (triggered) or background (independent) events.\nAt Coso, induced earthquakes feature a larger fraction of background seismicity compared to natural earthquakes. Furthermore, they contain a population of independent pairs at large magnitude-rescaled times and small magnitude-rescaled distances. This implies that unlike tectonic processes, stress changes induced by the field operations occur on much smaller time scales and appear to be large enough to drive small-scale faults through several seismic cycles during relatively short observation period. As a result, we record events close to previous hypocenters that occur up to a year after the preceding earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Soil dust and plant fragment emissions from agricultural harvesting and natural ecosystems are two potentially large, yet unquantified and largely uncharacterized, sources of ice nucleating particles (INPs). Both organic and mineral components have been shown to contribute to the ice-nucleating ability of soil dust, but apart from the likely presence of ice nucleation-active bacteria, little is known about the ice nucleating potential of plant tissues. This work aims to identify and differentiate the organic and inorganic contributions of soil and plant INP sources emitted from harvesting activities and natural landscapes. For this purpose, the CSU Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC) and the Ice Spectrometer (IS) were utilized in a combination of ambient measurements and laboratory studies. Small variability and low INP numbers (< 10 L-1 at -30 °C) characterized measurements made in air over the grazed Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado, while more variable INP over croplands around the DOE-ARM SGP site in Oklahoma appear linked to regional wind, humidity, and rainfall conditions. Harvesting of milo (grain sorghum), soybean, and wheat at an experimental research farm in Kansas resulted in spikes of INPs, with wheat harvesting producing the largest INP concentrations (up to 100 L-1 at -30 °C). In-situ use of heating tubes upstream of the CFDC to deactivate organic INP showed that milo and wheat harvest emissions showed a stronger reduction of INPs at warm temperatures than soybean emissions, suggesting a larger contribution of organics to their INP activity. Further characterization of the sources and organic and inorganic contributions to terrestrially emitted INPs by comparison to laboratory studies on collected soil dust and plant samples will also be presented.",

The intention of the investigation is to gain insight into the details of interaction between the electromagnetic fluctuations, the proton population, and the electron population. In particular, the manner in which each population is heated while the fluctuation energy dissipates is of interest. The results show that electrons are preferentially heated in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field, while ions are preferentially heated perpendicular to the background field. These behaviors appear to be universal with respect to the plasma βe and the initial fluctuation amplitudes. In order to better understand how such heating scales at variable plasma parameters two parametric studies have been carried out. The first study holds β(t=0) fixed at βe = βi = 0.25, and varies the initial fluctuation energy density ε0 = Σ δB2/B02 = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, while the second study holds ε0(t=0) fixed at ε0 = 0.1 and varies βe = βi = 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0. The investigations show that the ion heating rates scale approximately linearly with ε0, while they have a far weaker scaling with βe.",

This study is focused on passive seismic monitoring at the carbon injection site to measure, locate, and catalog any induced seismic events. A Geometrics Geode system is being utilized for continuous recording of the passive seismic downhole bore array in a monitoring well. The array consists of 3-component dual Geospace OMNI-2400 15Hz geophones with a vertical spacing of 30.5m. Downhole temperature and pressure are also monitored. Seismic data is recorded continuously and is produced at a rate of over 900GB per month, which must be archived and reviewed. A Short Term Average/Long Term Average (STA/LTA) algorithm was evaluated for its ability to search for events, including identification and quantification of any false positive events. It was determined that the algorithm was not appropriate for event detection with the background level of noise at the field site and for the recording equipment as configured. Alternatives are being investigated. The final intended outcome of the passive seismic monitoring is to mine the continuous database and develop a catalog of microseismic events/locations and to determine if there is any relationship to CO2 injection in the field. Identifying the location of any microseismic events will allow for correlation with carbon injection locations and previously characterized geological and structural features such as faults and paleoslopes. Additionally, the borehole array has recorded over 1200 active sources with three sweeps at each source location that were acquired during a nearby 3D VSP. These data were evaluated for their usability and location within an effective radius of the array and were stacked to improve signal-noise ratio and are used to calibrate a full field velocity model to enhance event location accuracy.\nFunding for this project is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy under Award No. DE-FC26-05NT42591.",

Previous studies have investigated the plausibility of an ancient ocean on Mars by examining the topography of ancient putative sea-level markers on the planet's surface. A previous study has argued that topographic benches, or contacts, are ancient shorelines, and that these contacts display long-wavelength topographic variations consistent with post-depositional true polar wander (Perron et al., Nature, 2007). In contrast, a second study has argued that the topography of ancient deltaic deposits associated with an ocean on early Mars are not consistent with the true polar wander scenario (Achille & Hynek, Nature Geosci., 2010). We revisit this issue by examining another marker of ancient shorelines --- the fluvial valley networks observed on the surface of Mars. Our results provide further evidence that a true polar wander event drove significant post-depositional deflection of surface features related to an ancient Martian ocean.",

The Lower Roanoke is almost completely disconnected from the upper reaches by a series of dams, with the furthest downstream dam located at the fall line. The dams effectively restrict the suspended sediment delivery from headwaters, making soils and sediments from the Lower Roanoke River basin, the sole source of suspended sediment. In flow-regulated rivers, bank erosion, especially mass wasting, is the major contributor to the suspended matter. Additional sources of the suspended sediment considered in this study are river channel, surface soils, floodplain surface sediments, and erosion of the delta front and prodelta. Here, we examine spatial and temporal variations in those sources.\nThis study combined the use of flow and grain size data with a sediment fingerprinting method, to examine the contribution of surface and subsurface sediments to the observed suspended sediment load along the Lower Roanoke River. The fingerprinting method utilized radionuclide tracers 210Pb (natural atmospheric fallout), and 137Cs (produced by thermonuclear bomb testing). The contributions of surface and subsurface sources to the suspended sediment were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using a Monte-Carlo numerical mixing model.\nOur results show that with decreasing river slope and changing hydrography along the river, the contribution of surface sediments increases and becomes a main source of sediments in the Roanoke bayhead delta. At the river mouth, the surface sediment contribution decreases and is replaced by sediments eroded from the delta front and prodelta. The area of high surface sediment contribution is within the middle and upper parts of the delta, which are considered net depositional. Our study demonstrates that floodplains, often regarded to be a sediment sink, are also a sediment source, and they should be factored into sediment, carbon and nutrient budgets.",

Several studies have looked to the cooling of the central and eastern Tropical Pacific from 1980 - 2013 as potential drivers of these unexpected trends, via Rossby wave teleconnections and increased ocean heat uptake in the subtropical Pacific. Rossby waves emanating from the tropical Pacific are known to impact high latitudes, but their role in the recent expansion of Antarctic Sea ice is still a subject of debate. Furthermore, the wind-driven cooling of the tropical Pacific may change the rate of surface warming through an increase in ocean heat uptake, thus the Pacific may also be causing the reported hiatus. We test both of these hypothesis in two experiments carried out with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, the Community Earth System Model 1.1. The first method uses an energy conserving flux adjustment to reproduce the observed cooling in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. The second method introduces a new tool to CESM; it adds an anomalous wind stress to the tropical Pacific while preserving the atmosphere-ocean coupling.\nWe find that both forcing methods are able to simulate a cooling trend in the tropical Pacific and the attendant changes in tropical convection. Yet neither method reproduces a slowdown in global warming. Furthermore, the teleconnections to Antarctica show a modest effect on sea ice extent, but do not fully account for the recent expansion in Antarctic Sea Ice.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter decomposition depends on physical, chemical, and biological factors, such as the amount and quality of the organic matter stored, abiotic conditions (such as soil temperature and moisture), microbial community dynamics, and physical protection by soil minerals. Soils store immense amounts of carbon with 1330-1580 Pg of carbon in the permafrost region alone. Increasing temperatures in the Arctic will thaw large amounts of previously frozen organic carbon making it available for decomposition. The rate at which carbon is being released from permafrost soils is crucial for understanding future changes in permafrost carbon storage and carbon flux to the atmosphere.\nThe potential magnitude and form of carbon release (carbon dioxide or methane) from permafrost can be investigated using soil incubation studies. Over the past 20 years, many incubation studies have been published with soils from the permafrost zone and three recent syntheses have summarized current findings from aerobic and anaerobic incubation studies. However, the breadth of the incubation synthesis projects was hampered by incomplete meta-data and the use of different methods. Here, we provide recommendations to improve and standardize future soil incubation studies (which are not limited to permafrost soils) to make individual studies useful for inclusion in syntheses and meta-analyses, which helps to broaden their impact on our understanding of organic matter cycling. Additionally, we identify gaps in the understanding of permafrost carbon decomposability, that, when coupled with emerging knowledge from field observations and experiments, can be implemented in future studies to gain a better overview of the overall decomposability of permafrost carbon.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to explore how episodic sediment supply affects particle mobility and bed surface adjustments in mountain streams. We conducted a set of runs in a 1 m-wide, 18 m-long tilting flume. Seven consecutive runs, each lasting 40 hours, were conducted under constant flow (65 l/s) but varying sediment supply rates for a total duration of 280 hours. The feed rate for the runs was as follow: no feed (runs 1 and 7), constant feed of 2.1 g/m/s (runs 2 and 6), one pulse of 83 g/m/s (run 3), four pulses of 83 g/m/s (run 4) and two pulses of 83 g/m/s (run 5). The total mass of sediment supplied during each of runs 2-6 was 300 kg. The feed texture was identical to that of the original mixture (Dmin = 0.5 mm, Dmax = 64 mm, Dg = 5.65 mm and sg = 3.05) with a bed slope of 0.0218 m/m. Bed surface images of a 2 m-long reach in the middle of the flume were processed. Bed surface areas covered by particle sizes coarser than 5.66 mm were automatically identified. Thus, we can easily obtain fractional particle mobility, i.e. how much bed area covered by a particular grain size changed at a given time.\nPreliminary analyses of the experiments show that the bed surface texture systematically adjusts to each change in the sediment supply. Thus, (i) bed surface gradually coarsens during no feed runs 1 and 7, (ii) suddenly fines and subsequently coarsens after each episodic sediment supply event (runs 3-5) and (iii) remains approximately constant during runs 2 and 6 under constant feed conditions. Surface coarsening during run 1 was accompanied by the formation of bed structures and particle clusters. However, the amplitude of the changes of the bed surface texture is relatively small compared to the texture obtained after the first 40 h under no feed in run 1. This does not imply that the bed particles remain immobile. Conversely, bed particles on the surface move, bed structures loosen while the bed surface texture maintains, overall, the same grain size distribution. Preliminary results of run 3 (one sediment pulse between t = 0 h and t = 1 h) illustrate an asymptotic trend in the mobility of the bed: 63%, 75%, 80%, 83% and 86% of the bed area changed at t = 2 h, t = 7 h, t = 10 h, t = 20 h and t = 40h compared the bed surface at the beginning of the run, respectively.",

            "abstract": "A mountain pine beetle epidemic in the Snowy Range Mountains of Wyoming peaked in 2008 coinciding with changes in climate. The combination of the two effects have potentially changed hydrologic response in mountain watersheds. Shorter snowmelt duration and an earlier onset of snowmelt are hypothesized to occur as results of both mountain pine beetle epidemics and global climate change, while beetle effects likely point to increased total flows, baseflows, and peak flows. We used statistical analysis to identify changes in hydrologic response over the past four decades by comparing hydrograph components from 2012–2014 water years to hydrograph components from the 1960’s–1980’s water years using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including a precipitation covariate. The 2012–2014 group was found to be associated with (1) shorter snowmelt duration, (2) earlier onset of snowmelt, and (3) increased baseflows. No differences in total discharge, snowmelt discharge, stormflow discharge, peak discharge, or day of peak discharge were detected.\nPearson’s correlation coefficients between watershed and runoff characteristics for six mountain watersheds were calculated for the 2013 and 2014 water years. Watershed characteristics include percent green conifers, percent red phase conifers, and percent grey phase conifers derived from a Random Forest land classification map. For the 2013 water year, watershed area expressed as percent red phase conifer was found to be significantly correlated to watershed discharge expressed as percent baseflow with a Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient of +0.95 (alpha level = 0.05). The positive correlation between red phase conifer and baseflow may be considered corroborating evidence of a mountain pine beetle induced change on mountain hydrology detected in the ANOVA/ANCOVA analysis. No significant correlations between beetle phase and either snowmelt duration or onset of snowmelt were detected.",

The ionosphere, the topic of this session, has the potential of being a harbinger of impending seismic events when used as an enormous worldwide detector with the total mass of only a few pickup trucks. Here, we report on the ionospheric response to impending seismic events, not days or weeks before a quake, but a reliable 45±5 minutes beforehand. We support this report with data from hundreds of GPS stations in Japan operating before and during the recent, very large earthquake/tsunami event. We also show similar precursors from other large quakes, in addition to data from the Stanford ELF/VLF system before the Loma Prieta (aka, the World Series earthquake). This system detected a magnetic field fluctuation at ground level 40 minutes before that quake. A theory explaining the mechanism for these ionospheric changes will be presented.",

To prepare current and future weather forecasters in application of these data sets, Proving Ground activities have been established that demonstrate future JPSS capabilities through use of similar sensors aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, and the S-NPP mission. As part of these efforts, NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center in Huntsville, Alabama partners with near real-time providers of S-NPP products (e.g., NASA, UW/CIMSS, UAF/GINA, etc.) to demonstrate future capabilities of JPSS. This includes training materials and product distribution of multi-spectral false color composites of the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands of MODIS and VIIRS. These are designed to highlight phenomena of interest to help forecasters digest the multispectral data provided by the VIIRS sensor. In addition, forecasters have been trained on the use of the VIIRS day-night band, which provides imagery of moonlit clouds, surface, and lights emitted by human activities. Hyperspectral information from the S-NPP/CrIS instrument provides thermodynamic profiles that aid in the detection of extremely cold air aloft, helping to map specific aviation hazards at high latitudes. Hyperspectral data also support the estimation of ozone concentration, which can highlight the presence of much drier stratospheric air, and map its interaction with mid-latitude or tropical cyclones to improve predictions of their strengthening or decay.\nProving Ground activities are reviewed, including training materials and methods that have been provided to forecasters, and forecaster feedback on these products that has been acquired through formal, detailed assessment of their applicability to a given forecast threat or task. Future opportunities for collaborations around the delivery of training are proposed, along with other applications of multispectral data and derived, more quantitative products.",

The pace and breadth of change in information management across the data lifecycle means that no one country or institution can unilaterally provide the leadership and resources required to use data and information effectively, or needed to support a coordinated, global e-infrastructure.\nAn 18-month long process involving ~120 experts in domain, computer, and social sciences from more than a dozen countries resulted in a formal set of recommendations to the Belmont Forum collaboration of national science funding agencies and others on what they are best suited to implement for development of an e-infrastructure in support of global change research, including:\nadoption of data principles that promote a global, interoperable e-infrastructure\nestablishment of information and data officers for coordination of global data management and e-infrastructure efforts\npromotion of effective data planning\ndetermination of best practices\ndevelopment of a cross-disciplinary training curriculum on data management and curation\nThe Belmont Forum is ideally poised to play a vital and transformative leadership role in establishing a sustained human and technical international data e-infrastructure to support global change research. The international collaborative process that went into forming these recommendations is contributing to national governments and funding agencies and international bodies working together to execute them.",

            "abstract": "We propose a geomorphologically-based statistical framework where the distribution of travel times in a basin following an instantaneous rainfall is derived from the pdf of hillslope and channel lengths. Based on previous works, marginal distributions for hillslope and channel length pdfs are assumed to be Gamma and Beta with variation coefficients 0,4 and 0,9 respectively, while the bivariate probability model is obtained assuming a Gaussian copula function. We consider different scenarios involving both deterministic and random hillslope velocity (while a reference, constant channel velocity is kept); this allows to explore the role of the kinematic component of basin response across different scales. Further, we employ drainage density as a proxy measure to explore the effects of the variability of runoff yield. This conceptual framework is used as a virtual laboratory to understand what controls the scatter of arrival times of water drops and the peak flow of the hydrologic response. Numerical simulations are performed varying the following contolling factors (i) the ratio between streamflow velocity and average hillslope velocity (ii) the geomorphological characteristics and the scale of the basin and (iii) the correlation coefficient r’ between hillslope and channel lengths.\nThe approach is suitable to investigate how the relative roles of dispersion mechanisms change due to upscaling effects, up to very large scales (where channels completely dominates), and how this affects the hypothesis of simple scaling of peak floods.\nWe find that the hillslope kinematic dispersion alters the scatter of arrival times in a wide range of basin scales: it abridges the pdf of travel times for basin with negative r’ (which involves higher peak flows), while increases the dispersion of travel times when r’ is positive. Nonetheless, when random hillslope velocity with increasing variation coefficients are considered, the contribution of kinematic dispersion becomes invariantly positive, i.e. results in higher travel times variance and smaller peak flows. Non-uniform runoff production, represented through local drainage density as a proxy measure, introduces an additional component of dispersion which doesn't fade away under asymptotic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The landmark discovery showing that the 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the accessible modern terrestrial mantle is greater than ordinary-chondrites has remarkable implications for the formation, as well as the geodynamic, magnetic and climatic histories of Earth. If Earth is derived from ordinary chondrite precursors, mass balance requires that a missing reservoir with 142Nd/144Nd lower than ordinary chondrites was isolated from the accessible mantle within 20–30 Myr following accretion. Critically for Earth evolution, this reservoir hosts the equivalent of the modern continents’ budget of radioactive heat-producing elements (U, Th and K). If this reservoir was lost to space through mechanical erosion by early impactors, the planet’s radiogenic heat generation is 18–45% lower than chondrite-based compositional estimates. Recent geodynamic calculations suggest that this reduced heat production will favor the emergence of Earth-like plate tectonics. However, parameterized thermal history calculations favor a relatively recent transition from mostly Atlantic-sized plates to the current plate tectonic mode characterized predominantly by the subduction of Pacific-sized plates. Such a transition in the style of Earth’s plate tectonics is also consistent with a delayed dynamo and an evolving rate of volcanic outgassing that ultimately favors Earth’s long-term clement climate. By contrast, relatively enhanced radiogenic heat production related to a less early impact erosion reduces the likelihood of present day plate tectonics: A chondritic Earth has a stronger likelihood to evolve as a Venus-like planet characterized by potentially wild swings in tectonic and climatic regime. Indeed, differences in internal heat production related to varying extents of impact erosion may exert strong control over Earth’s climate and explain aspects of the differences among the current climatic regimes of Earth, Venus and Mars.",

            "abstract": "The glacial buzzsaw hypothesis predicts that maximum elevations in orogens at high latitudes are depressed relative to temperate latitudes, as maximum elevation and hypsography of glaciated orogens are functions of the glacial equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and the modern and last glacial maximum (LGM) snowlines. As a consequence crustal thickness, density, or both must change with increasing latitude to maintain isostatic balance. For Airy compensation crustal thickness should decrease toward polar latitudes, whereas for Pratt compensation crustal densities should increase. For similar convergence rates, higher latitude orogens should have higher grade, and presumably higher density rocks in the crustal column due to more efficient glacial erosion. We have examined a number of global and regional crustal models to see if these predictions appear in the models. Crustal thickness is straightforward to examine, crustal density less so. The different crustal models generally agree with one another, but do show some major differences. We used a standard tectonic classification scheme of the crust for data selection.\nThe globally averaged orogens show crustal thicknesses that decrease toward high latitudes, almost reflecting topography, in both the individual crustal models and the models averaged together. The most convincing is the western hemisphere cordillera, where elevations and crustal thicknesses decrease toward the poles, and also toward lower latitudes (the equatorial minimum is at ~12oN). The elevation differences and Airy prediction of crustal thickness changes are in reasonable agreement in the North American Cordillera, but in South America the observed crustal thickness change is larger than the Airy prediction. The Alpine-Himalayan chain shows similar trends, however the strike of the chain makes interpretation ambiguous.\nWe also examined cratons with ice sheets during the last glacial period to see if continental glaciation also thins the crust toward higher latitudes. The glaciated North American and European cratons show a trend of modest thinning (~3km), and glaciated western Asia minor thinning (~1.5 km). These values are at the level of model uncertainties, but we note that cratons without ice sheets during the last glacial period show substantially different patterns.",

We have worked with curriculum developers and scientists to develop the Climate Concept Inventory (CCI), which meets goals of the EarthLabs Climate on-line curriculum. The developed concept inventory includes 19 content-driven multiple choice questions, six affective-based multiple choice questions, one confidence question, three open-ended questions, and eight demographic questions. Our analysis of the instrument applies item response theory and uses item characteristic curves. We have assessed over 500 students in nearly twenty high school classrooms in Mississippi and Texas that have engaged in the implementation of the EarthLabs curriculum and completed the CCI. Results indicate that students had pre-post gains on 9 out of 10 of the content-based multiple choice questions with positive gains in answer choice selection ranging from 1.72% to 42%. Students significantly reported increased confidence with 15% more students reporting that they were either very or fairly confident with their answers. Of the six affective questions posed, 5 out of 6 showed significant shifts towards gains in knowledge, awareness, and information about Earth’s climate system. The research has resulted in a robust and validated climate concept inventory for use with advanced high school students, where we have been able to apply its use within the EarthLabs project.",

This visualization tool provides scientists with a structure for presenting research within the broad context of global change, and supports educators with a framework for teaching and assessing student understanding of complex global change processes. This new approach to teaching the science of global change is currently being piloted and refined based on feedback from educators and scientists in anticipation of a 2016 website launch.\nGlobal change concepts are categorized within the infographic as causes of global change (e.g., burning of fossil fuels, volcanism), ongoing Earth system processes (e.g., ocean circulation, the greenhouse effect), and the changes scientists measure in Earth’s physical and biological systems (e.g., temperature, extinctions/radiations). The infographic will appear on all website content pages and provides a template for the creation of flowcharts, which are conceptual models that allow teachers and students to visualize the interdependencies and feedbacks among processes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. The development of this resource is timely given that the newly adopted Next Generation Science Standards emphasize cross-cutting concepts, including model building, and Earth system science. Flowchart activities will be available on the website to scaffold inquiry-based lessons, determine student preconceptions, and assess student content knowledge.\nThe infographic has already served as a learning and evaluation tool during professional development workshops at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. At these workshops, scientists and educators used the infographic to highlight how their research and activities reinforce conceptual links among global change topics. Pre- and post-workshop assessment results and responses to questionnaires have guided the refinement of classroom activities and assessment tools utilizing flowcharts as models for global change processes.",

            "abstract": "In mountainous regions, the redistribution of snow by wind can increase the effective precipitation available to vegetation. Moisture subsidies caused by drifting snow may be critical to plant productivity in semi-arid ecosystems. However, with increasing temperatures, the distribution of precipitation is becoming more uniform as rain replaces drifting snow. Understanding the ecohydrological interactions between sagebrush steppe vegetation communities and the heterogeneous distribution of soil moisture is essential for predicting and mitigating future losses in ecosystem diversity and productivity in regions characterized by snow dominated precipitation regimes. To address the dependence of vegetation productivity on redistributed snow, we simulated the net primary production (NPP) of aspen, sagebrush, and C3 grass plant functional types spanning a precipitation phase (rain:snow) gradient in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory (RCEW-CZO). The biogeochemical process model Biome-BGC was used to simulate NPP at three sites located directly below snowdrifts that provide melt water late into the spring. To assess climate change impacts on future plant productivity, mid-century (2046-2065) NPP was simulated using the average temperature increase from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) data set under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. At the driest site, mid-century projections of decreased snow cover and increased growing season evaporative demand resulted in limiting soil moisture up to 30 and 40 days earlier for aspen and sage respectively. While spring green up for aspen occurred an average of 13 days earlier under climate change scenarios, NPP remained negative up to 40 days longer during the growing season. These results indicate that the loss of the soil moisture subsidy stemming from prolonged redistributed snow water resources can directly influence ecosystem productivity in the rain:snow transition zone.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster.pdf\nBoth the oscillation of magma in volcanic conduits and resonance of fluid-filled cracks (dikes and sills) are appealing explanations for very long period signals recorded at many active volcanoes. While these processes have been studied in isolation, real volcanic systems involve interconnected networks of conduits and cracks. The overall objective of our work is to develop a model of wave propagation and ultimately eruptive fluid dynamics through this coupled system. Here, we present a linearized model for wave propagation through a conduit with multiple cracks branching off of it. The fluid is compressible and viscous, and is comprised of a mixture of liquid melt and gas bubbles. Nonequilibrium bubble growth and resorption (BGR) is quantified by introducing a time scale for mass exchange between phases, following the treatment in Karlstrom and Dunham (2015). We start by deriving the dispersion relation for crack waves travelling along the multiphase-magma-filled crack embedded in an elastic solid. Dissipation arises from magma viscosity, nonequilibrium BGR, and radiation of seismic waves into the solid. We next introduce coupling conditions between the conduit and crack, expressing conservation of mass and the balance of forces across the junction. Waves in the conduit, like those in the crack, are influenced by nonequilibrium BGR, but the deformability of the surrounding solid is far less important than for cracks. Solution of the coupled system of equations provides the evolution of pressure and fluid velocity within the conduit-crack system. The system has various resonant modes that are sensitive to fluid properties and to the geometry of the conduit and cracks. Numerical modeling of seismic waves in the solid allows us to generate synthetic seismograms.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions are triggered either by “bottom-up” processes such as magmatic intrusion and recharge or by “top-down” processes such as unloading by flank failure. Eruptions end when conduit pressure drops below lithostatic pressure because of depletion of magmatic gases or cessation of magmatic replenishment, or alternatively, as a consequence of plugging of the conduit by crystallization. Examples from the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) show that it is possible to forecast the beginning, changes during, and the end of eruptions using a combination of multi-parametric monitoring, geologic constraints and applicable information from global databases. \nBeginning: Magmatic intrusions can be detected from patterns of precursory seismicity, CO2 emissions, and inflation. The probability that a particular intrusive episode leads to eruption can be estimated from global data modified by the local history of past eruptions and by characteristic progressions in monitoring parameters. \nMiddle: Increased probability of a more explosive phase during a long-lived dome-forming eruption may be forecast on the basis of high extrusion rates and recurrence of deep or distal VT earthquakes; both indicate more rapid magma ascent and increased gas pressure. Alternatively, increased seismicity coincident with a rapid decrease in gas emission and extrusion rate may signal conduit plugging, which can also lead to an explosive phase. \nEnd: The end of long-lived eruptions may be forecast using a combination of: 1) global data on duration of similar eruptions, 2) comparison of eruptive volumes to those of past eruptions, 3) projection of effusion rate trends to zero, 4) reversal of regional deflation to inflation and near-vent inflation to deflation, and 5) change in morphology or composition indicative of more viscous crystalline magma. \nWe find that forecasting using the criteria such as described above is best conducted by multidisciplinary teams using probabilistic event trees.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation planning assessments often rely on single methods for climate projection downscaling and hydrologic analysis, do not reveal uncertainties from associated method choices, and thus likely produce overly confident decision-support information. Recent work by the authors has highlighted this issue by identifying strengths and weaknesses of widely applied methods for downscaling climate projections and assessing hydrologic impacts. This work has shown that many of the methodological choices made can alter the magnitude, and even the sign of the climate change signal. Such results motivate consideration of both sources of method uncertainty within an impacts assessment. Consequently, the authors have pursued development of improved downscaling techniques spanning a range of method classes (quasi-dynamical and circulation-based statistical methods) and developed approaches to better account for hydrologic analysis uncertainty (multi-model; regional parameter estimation under forcing uncertainty).\nThis presentation summarizes progress in the development of these methods, as well as implications of pursuing these developments. First, having access to these methods creates an opportunity to better reveal impacts uncertainty through multi-method ensembles, expanding on present-practice ensembles which are often based only on emissions scenarios and GCM choices. Second, such expansion of uncertainty treatment combined with an ever-expanding wealth of global climate projection information creates a challenge of how to use such a large ensemble for local adaptation planning. To address this challenge, the authors are evaluating methods for ensemble selection (considering the principles of fidelity, diversity and sensitivity) that is compatible with present-practice approaches for abstracting change scenarios from any “ensemble of opportunity”. Early examples from this development will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Imbibition dynamics were investigated by measuring upward imbibition rates in laboratory vertical columns that were filled with sandy loam soil media. The contribution of films and capillary water which drives the infiltrating wetting front was successfully quantified. It was demonstrated that films move ahead of the wetting front only after capillary water has ceased driving percolation, and that the hydraulic diffusion coefficient (Dh) of film flow varied from 10-70% of the hydraulic diffusion coefficient of capillary water. The magnitude of Dh depended upon particle size distribution, surface roughness and initial moisture content of the media.\nWhat is the potential value of this mechanism in soil moisture dynamics research? (1) In coarse textured soils with low capillary potential, film that stretches well beyond the capillary wetting front can provide moisture to microbiota and mycorhyza, thereby increasing nutrient diffusion to a broader area than by capillary based models (e.g., modeling of drip irrigation systems). Even though the potential role of films in these processes has been previously discussed, the magnitude of potential moisture delivery has not been measured. (2) Films surging ahead of a decelerating capillary front may reduce the effect of subsurface water repellency. It is known that over time, moisture decreases both the contact angle of water against silica and water repellent soils. Therefore, in time, a film may predispose sandy soil to greater imbibition capacity. (3) The need to maximize water efficiency becomes exceedingly important in drought threatened, semi-arid irrigated agriculture.\nA thoughtful, yet realistic balance must be reached between water conservation and crop production. As our climate changes and water needs increase, protecting against crop failure will require a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that control soil moisture dynamics. This study adds to this conversation by investigating higher level complexities than are presently understood, including the associated complexities provided by particle shapes, sizes, mineral content, roughness, microbial activity and antecedent moisture. The intent of this project is to provide a mathematical relationship that is useful in numerical modeling of real soil media moisture dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the consequence of sea-level rise for coastal cities has long lead times and huge political implications. Civilisation has emerged and developed during a period of several thousand years during which in geological terms sea level has been unusually stable. We have now moved out of this period raising important challenges for the future. In 2005 there were 136 coastal cities with a population exceeding one million people and a collective population of 400 million people. All these cities are threatened by flooding from the sea to varying degrees and these risks are increasing due to growing exposure (people and assets), rising sea levels due to climate change, and in some cities, significant coastal subsidence due to human agency (drainage and groundwater withdrawals from susceptible soils). City abandonment due to sea-level rise is widely discussed in the media, but most of the discussion is speculative. The limits to adaptation and abandonment of cities are not predictable in a formal sense – while the rise in mean sea level raises the likelihood of a catastrophic flood, extreme events are what cause damage and trigger a response, be it abandonment or a defence upgrade. Several types of potential adaptation limits can be recognised: (1) physical/engineering limits; (2) economic/financial limits; and (3) socio-political limits. The latter two types of limits are much less understood, and yet issues such as loss of confidence rather than a simple engineering failure may be instrumental in the future of a coastal city. There are few studies which quantify the sea-level rise threshold at which cities will be challenged, especially for large rises exceeding a metre or more. Exceptions include London and the Thames Estuary and the Amsterdam and Rotterdam (the Netherlands) where adaptation to a rise of sea level of up to 4 m or more appears feasible. This lack of knowledge on sea-level rise thresholds for coastal cities is of concern, and similar assessments could be considered more widely. By taking a proactive approach to adaptation assessment the full scale of the long term challenge can be illuminated and appropriate long term adaptive actions developed which work with the long-term development of the city.",

            "abstract": "Much of the central Himalaya features an abrupt rise in mean elevation from ~1.5 km in the Lesser Himalaya to ~4-5 km Greater Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau. This physiographic transition is known as PT2, and is often interpreted as the surface expression of transport over a ramp in the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). In western Nepal, however, the same rise in elevation occurs over two distinct topographic steps (PT2-N and PT2-S). In previous work, Harvey et al. (2015) argue that this anomalous topography is the result of recent southward-migration of mid-crustal deformation along the MHT. Due to the seismogenic potential of the MHT it is important to constrain its geometry in the western Nepal seismic gap, which has not had a large earthquake in over 600 years.\nTo test the above hypothesis, we perform [U-Th]/He dating on 39 apatite and 47 zircon samples collected along seven relief transects throughout western Nepal. We constrain exhumation histories by inverting these new cooling ages with the 3-D thermo-kinematic model Pecube. Five transects collected from the Greater Himalaya north of PT2-N are best fit by relatively rapid exhumation rates (~1-2 km/Myr) since ~4 Ma. The other two, collected from farther south near PT2-S, require rapid (~1-2 km/Myr) exhumation until around 8-11 Ma, followed by much slower (~0.1-0.2 km/Myr) exhumation until at least the late Pliocene.\nAssuming that exhumation rates reflect uplift rates, the rapid Plio-Pleistocene exhumation in the Greater Himalaya north of PT2-N suggest that this physiographic transition is similar to that at the foot of the Greater Himalaya in central Nepal. It follows that active deformation is occurring along a NW-trend as much as 100 km farther north than would be expected if simply projecting PT2 across western Nepal. This finding is consistent with transport over a more northerly MHT ramp or perhaps oblique slip along the recently identified, surface-breaking WNFZ. Although the geomorphology and microseismicity along PT2-S hints at rejuvenated uplift in this zone, late Miocene cooling ages require very slow rock uplift for much of its post-Miocene history. This does not rule out the hypothesized young mid-crustal duplex, but it limits the magnitude of associated uplift and exhumation.",

During larger (and rarer) events responsible science agencies may find themselves facing new and intensified demands for information and unprepared for effectively resourcing communications. In a study of the communication of aftershock information during the 2010-12 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence (New Zealand), issues are identified and implications for communication strategy noted.\nCommunication issues during the responses included reliability and timeliness of communication channels for immediate and short decision time frames; access to scientists by those who needed information; unfamiliar emergency management frameworks; information needs of multiple audiences, audience readiness to use the information; and how best to convey empathy during traumatic events and refer to other information sources about what to do and how to cope. Other science communication challenges included meeting an increased demand for earthquake education, getting attention on aftershock forecasts; responding to rumor management; supporting uptake of information by critical infrastructure and government and for the application of scientific information in complex societal decisions; dealing with repetitive information requests; addressing diverse needs of multiple audiences for scientific information; and coordinating communications within and outside the science domain.\nFor a science agency, a communication strategy would consider training scientists in communication, establishing relationships with university scientists and other disaster communication roles, coordinating messages, prioritizing audiences, deliberating forecasts with community leaders, identifying user needs and familiarizing them with the products ahead of time, and practicing the delivery and use of information via scenario planning and exercises.",

            "abstract": "Evaluating the ionospheric electric fields and current systems surrounding auroral arcs aids in distinguishing physical mechanisms that drive arc generation and current closure. Auroral forms involve spatial scales that are small in comparison with the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system, and yet these forms are thought to be closely tied to the overall system response. Spatially resolved measurements of the horizontal ionospheric current can, in principle, be used to determine the field-aligned currents (FAC) that are responsible for energy transfer between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere, leading to heating and upwelling of the neutral gas and acceleration of ion upflows and outflows. Furthermore, the closure of FACs in the ionosphere regulates modes of magnetospheric convection and substorms.\nAn algorithm has been developed to image the local structure in the convection electric field using multibeam incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements. Given the inherent difficulty of reconstructing vector quantities from line of sight (LOS) velocity measurements, the algorithm's aim is to select from the solution space for the possible field configurations a unique solution for the electric field distribution by constraining the reconstructed electric field to reproduce the LOS measurements within measurement errors while simultaneously minimizing a measure of the field's curvature and absolute gradient. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, the algorithm regularizes the underdetermined problem defined by the LOS radar velocity measurements and guarantees a unique solution when the average measurement error is smaller than the average measurement amplitude.\nThe algorithm is tested on a variety of simulated fields in a sensitivity study to determine the extent to which the solution depends on the a priori assumptions and the observation geometry. In addition, a case study of a quiescent auroral arc observed by the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar is presented, in which the algorithm is used to analyze the flow structure around the arc to infer currents and address the causal mechanisms thereof.",

This system measures changes in methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen concentrations as well as the stable carbon isotopes of methane and carbon dioxide with time.

This presentation will detail the results obtained from samples collected inside the Hudson Canyon at the edge of the methane clathrate stability zone and outside the Hudson Canyon, not influenced by the methane seepage. These results show that in both environments along the Atlantic margin, methane was consumed aggressively but the timing of consumption varied based on location. In addition, these results are leading to insights into the chemical requirements needed for aerobic methane oxidation and the resulting isotopic fractionation.",

Basal sliding is controlled by\nthe transport of water at the glacier's bed, which can be accomplished\nthrough both high pressure, low discharge, distributed flow, or low\npressure, high discharge, channelized flow. Higher pressures are\ngenerally associated with more complete decoupling of a glacier from\nits bed and faster flow. As the intensity of summer melt in Greenland\nhas increased, our poor understanding of the drainage network's\ndischarge capacity and its coupling to sliding has generated\nfundamental questions, such as: will larger fluxes of liquid water\npromote or inhibit basal sliding? To investigate this question we have\nimplemented a model of distributed and channelized flow developed by\nWerder et. al 2013. The sensitivity of the modeled\nchannel network to basal and surface geometry, melt rate,\nboundary conditions, and other parameters is examined in a sequence of\nexperiments using synthetic geometries. Expanding on these\nexperiments, we run the model with realistic surface and bedrock\ndata from Issunguata Sermia in Western Central Greenland. These\nexperiments benefit from a wealth of in-situ data, including\nobservations of basal water pressure. Our results suggest that the\ndevelopment of large channels is limited to the margins of the ice\nsheet, and that higher pressures continue to prevail in the interior.",

Global real-time detection of lightning strokes including their time, location and energy, is conducted with the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). In the ionosphere, these sferics couple into very low frequency (VLF) whistler waves which propagate obliquely to the Earth's magnetic field. In our previous work, one-to-one coincidence between lightning and whistler waves is already found by the conjunction work between WWLLN and Van Allen Probes (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)). The previous global study showed a good match between WWLLN sferics and RBSP lightning whistlers at low L-shell region (L < 3). More case studies indicated that this kind of one-to-one coincidence can be extended to a high L-shell region. Since September 2012 to now (July 2015), EMFISIS instrument has already recorded 3-D waveform data with 35 ksamples/s for 527,279 and 542,346 of 6-second snapshots, respectively for RBSP-A and RBSP-B. 461,572 and 478,510 of snapshots with L-shell value larger than 3 are used in our work.

            "abstract": "At the scale of hillslopes, topography strongly regulates soil formation, affecting hillslope hydrology and biological activities. Topographic control of soil formation is particularly strong for semi-arid landscapes where soil thickening is induced by pedoturbation and soil creep. Thus, terrain attributes hold great potential for modeling full profile soil C and N stocks at the hillslope scale in these landscapes. In this study, we developed predictions of grassland soil C and N stocks using digital terrain attributes scaled to the signal of site-specific hillslope geomorphic processes. We found that soil thickness was the major control of soil organic C and N stocks and was best predicted by mean curvature. This curvature dependency of soil thickness affected prediction of organic C and N stocks because of the C and N added by taking subsoil into account. We also found that curvature was positively correlated with depth to carbonate reflecting drier soil conditions in convex hillslope positions and wetter soil conditions in concave areas. Slope aspect also had a marginal effect on soil C and N stocks; soil organic C and N stocks on the north-facing slope tended to be higher than those on the south-facing slope. We found that terrain attributes at medium resolutions (8 to 16 m) were most effective in modeling soil C and N stocks. Overall, terrain attributes explained 61% of the variation in soil thickness and 49% of the variation in soil organic C stock. Our results suggest that curvature-induced soil thickening, coupled with aspect, likely exerts a first-order control on soil organic C and N accumulation rates, and these changes occur predominantly in subsoil. Thus our data highlight the importance of subsoil in mapping soil C and N stocks and other soil properties. Our model also demonstrates how scale-driven analysis may guide soil C and N prediction in other hillslope dominated regions.",

            "abstract": "Southern Africa produces almost a third of the Earth’s biomass burning (BB) aerosol particles. Particles lofted into the mid-troposphere are transported westward over the South-East (SE) Atlantic, home to one of the three permanent subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The SE Atlantic stratocumulus deck interacts with the dense layers of BB aerosols that initially overlay the cloud deck, but later subside and may mix into the clouds. These interactions include adjustments to aerosol-induced solar heating and microphysical effects, and their global representation in climate models remains one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of future climate. Hence, new observations over the SE Atlantic have significant implications for global climate change scenarios.\nOur understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions in the SE Atlantic is hindered both by the lack of knowledge on aerosol and cloud properties, as well as the lack of knowledge about detailed physical processes involved. Most notably, we are missing knowledge on the absorptive and cloud nucleating properties of aerosols, including their vertical distribution relative to clouds, on the locations and degree of aerosol mixing into clouds, on the processes that govern cloud property adjustments, and on the importance of aerosol effects on clouds relative to co-varying synoptic scale meteorology.\nWe discuss the current knowledge of aerosol and cloud property distributions based on satellite observations and sparse suborbital sampling. Recent efforts to make full use of A-Train aerosol sensor synergies will be highlighted. We describe planned field campaigns in the region to address the existing knowledge gaps. Specifically, we describe the scientific objectives and implementation of the five synergistic, international research activities aimed at providing some of the key aerosol and cloud properties and a process-level understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions over the SE Atlantic: NASA’s ORACLES, the UK Met Office’s CLARIFY-2016, the DoE’s LASIC, NSF’s ONFIRE, and CNRS’ AEROCLO-SA.",

Ground based monitoring has the potential to continuously offer high temporal and spatial resolution for a particular region. With the installment of a stereo camera pair spaced approximately one kilometer apart, ground-based stereo can provide 3D coordinates of cloud features in a region as far as tens of kilometers away. With such a setup at the central facility of Southern Great Plains ARM site in Oklahoma, we developed and implemented an automatic stereo matching and reconstruction algorithm to retrieve and record cloud feature coordinates visible in the field of view of both cameras. Our cameras synchronously record image frames at a 30-second time interval during the day time. The algorithm identifies regions of clouds, matches high texture cloud features across synchronized frames and retrieves 3D positions of the matched features. In a three month campaign from mid April to mid July, 35 million cloud feature points are collected along with their 3D positions and the results are validated against Raman lidar measurements. Stereo imaging is able to make the distinction between clouds and rain or aerosols where Raman lidar suffers from confusion between these in the boundary layer. Stereo imaging also enables the estimation of vertical and horizontal velocities of cloud layers by tracking the cloud features in successive image frames in time. Overall, the analysis shows that ground based stereo imaging can successfully complement the current atmospheric measurement instruments by providing reliable, continuous, and high-resolution data over clouds in a localized region.",

One of the type of TDS is electrostatic electron-acoustic double layers (DL). Observed DLs are frequently accompanied by field-aligned (bi-directional) pitch angle distributions (PAD) of electrons with energies from hundred eVs up to several keV (rarely up to tens of keV). We perform numerical simulations of the DL interaction with thermal electrons making use of the test particle approach. DL parameters assumed in the simulations are adopted from observations. We show that DLs accelerate thermal electrons parallel to the magnetic field via the electrostatic Fermi mechanism, i.e. due to reflections from DL potential humps. Due to this interaction some fraction of electrons is scattered into the loss cone. The electron energy gain is larger for larger DL scalar potential amplitudes and higher propagation velocities. In addition to the Fermi mechanism electrons can be trapped by DLs in their generation region and accelerated due to transport to higher latitudes. Both mechanisms result in formation of field-aligned PADs for electrons with energies comparable to those found in observations. The Fermi mechanism provides field-aligned PADs for <1 keV electrons, while the trapping mechanism extends field-aligned PADs to higher energy electrons.",

Since solar and terrestrial radiation control energy budget of global climate, developing an accurate yet computationally efficient radiative transfer model in GCMs is important. However, in most of the GCMs, absorption of ice cloud is the only mechanism considered for the longwave radiative transfer process. Implementation of longwave scattering in GCMs requires parameterizations of ice cloud. This study utilizes spectrally consistent ice particle model in MODIS collection 6 and more than 14,000 particle size distributions from aircraft in-situ observations to parameterize ice cloud longwave optical properties. The new parameterizations are compared with Fu-Liou parameterization implemented in the RRTM_LW (Longwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Model). As accurate and computationally efficient radiative transfer model is important in GCMs, comparison of different radiative transfer methods are performed. Specifically, RRTMG_LW (GCM version of RRTM_LW), one of the most widely utilized radiative transfer schemes in the GCMs, will be modified to include different scattering approximation methods. To evaluate the accuracy, DISORT (Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer Program for a Multi-Layered Plane-Parallel Medium) is implemented and compared with other methods in terms of cloud radiative effect and heating rate.",

            "abstract": "At the end of the 20-th century Raymond Roble suggested an ambitious target of developing an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) that spans from the surface to the thermosphere for modeling the coupled atmosphere-ionosphere with drivers from terrestrial meteorology and solar-geomagnetic inputs. He pointed out several areas of research and applications that would benefit highly from the development and improvement of whole atmosphere modeling. At present several research groups using middle and whole atmosphere models have attempted to perform coupled ionosphere-thermosphere predictions to interpret the “unexpected” anomalies in the electron content, ions and plasma drifts observed during recent stratospheric warming events. The recent whole atmosphere inter-comparison case studies also displayed striking differences in simulations of prevailing flows, planetary waves and dominant tidal modes even when the lower atmosphere domain of those models were constrained by similar meteorological analyses. We will present the possible reasons of such differences between data-constrained whole atmosphere simulations when analyses with 6-hour time resolution are used and discuss the potential model-data and model-model differences above the stratopause. The possible shortcomings of the whole atmosphere simulations associated with model physics, dynamical cores and resolutions will be discussed. With the increased confidence in the space-borne temperature, winds and ozone observations and extensive collections of ground-based upper atmosphere observational facilities, the whole atmosphere modelers will be able to quantify annual and year-to-variability of the zonal mean flows, planetary wave and tides. We will demonstrate the value of tidal and planetary wave variability deduced from the space-borne data and ground-based systems for evaluation and tune-up of whole atmosphere simulations including corrections of systematic model errors. Several success stories on the middle and whole atmosphere simulations coupled with the ionosphere models will be highlighted, and future perspectives for links of the space and terrestrial weather predictions constrained by current and scheduled ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere satellite missions will be presented",

            "abstract": "The choice of method applied for mapping the soil carbon is an important source of uncertainty when comparing observed soil carbon stocks to modeled outputs. Large scale soil mapping often relies on non-random and opportunistically collected soils data to make predictions over remote areas where few observations are available for independent validation. Addressing model choice and non-random sampling is problematic when models use the data for the calibration and validation of historical outputs. One potential way to address this uncertainty is to compare the modeled outputs to a range of soil carbon observations from different soil carbon maps that are more likely to capture the true soil carbon value than one map alone. The current analysis demonstrates this approach in Alaska, which despite suffering from a non-random sample, still has one of the richest datasets among the northern circumpolar regions. The outputs from 11 ESMs (from the 5th Climate Model Intercomparison Project) and the Dynamic Organic Soil version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DOS-TEM) were compared to 4 different soil carbon maps. In the most detailed comparison, DOS-TEM simulated total profile soil carbon stocks that were within the range of the 4 maps for 18 of 23 Alaskan ecosystems, whereas the results fell within the 95% confidence interval of only 8 when compared to just one commonly used soil carbon map (NCSCDv2). At the ecoregion level, the range of soil carbon map estimates overlapped the range of ESM outputs in every ecoregion, although the mean value of the soil carbon maps was between 17% (Southern Interior) and 63% (Arctic) higher than the mean of the ESM outputs. For the whole state of Alaska, the DOS-TEM output and 3 of the 11 ESM outputs fell within the range of the 4 soil carbon map estimates. However, when compared to only one map and its 95% confidence interval (NCSCDv2), the DOS-TEM result fell outside the interval and only two ESM’s fell within the observed interval. Overall, these results challenge how we view the accuracy of soil carbon reference data and our interpretation of model output validity. The example in Alaska also gives a reference for understanding similar issues when using soil carbon maps for comparison within other data-sparse northern circumpolar regions.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Dailey_AGUPoster_Final_Compressed.pdf\nThe Miocene topaz rhyolite at Spor Mountain in western Utah hosts one of the largest beryllium deposits in the world and was responsible for producing 85% of the beryllium mined worldwide in 2010 (Boland, 2012). The Spor Mountain rhyolite is composed primarily of Ca-poor plagioclase (An8), sodic sanidine (Or40), Fe-rich biotite (Fe/(Fe+Mg)>0.95; Al 1.2-1.4 apfu), and Ti-poor quartz, along with several trace-element rich accessory phases including zircon, monazite, thorite, columbite, and allanite. Cathodoluminescence (CL) studies of quartz show oscillatory zoning, with 80% of the examined crystals displaying euhedral edges and slightly darker rims. CL images were used to guide laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS analysis of quartz, along with analyses of plagioclase, sanidine, biotite, and glass. Ti concentrations in quartz are 20±6 ppm; there is no quantifiable variation of Ti from core to rim within the diameter of the laser spot (53 microns). Temperatures, calculated using Ti in quartz (at 2 kb, aTiO2=0.34), vary between 529±10 C (Thomas et al., 2011), 669±13 C (Huang and Audetat, 2012), and 691±13 C (Wark and Watson, 2006). Two feldspar thermometry yield temperatures of 686±33 C (Elkins and Grove, 1990) and 670±41 C (Benisek et al., 2010). Zr saturation temperatures (Watson and Harrison, 1983) average 711±28 C. Analysis of the glass reveal the Spor Mountain rhyolite is greatly enriched in rare elements (i.e. Li, Be, F, Ga, Rb, Nb, Mo, Sn, and Ta) compared to average continental crust (Rudnick and Gao, 2003). Be in the glass can have as much as 100 ppm, nearly 50 times the concentration in continental crust. REE partition coefficients for sanidine are 2 to 3 times higher in the Spor Mountain rhyolite when compared to other silicic magmas (Nash and Crecraft, 1985; Mahood and Hildreth, 1983), although plagioclase tends to have lower partition coefficients; biotite has lower partition coefficients for LREE and higher partition coefficients for HREE. The patterns of trace element enrichment and depletion are similar to those of the measured partition coefficients, consistent with a major role for extensive fractional crystallization in the origin of the Be enriched magma.",

            "abstract": "In order to study surface water and groundwater exchange and renewal capacity of groundwater system of Qaidam Basin, inland northwest China, TOUGH2 (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat 2) simulation software was used to establish a two-dimensional variable saturated numerical model of a typical cross-section from the Nuomuhong river to the Amunike mountain. According to previous results, evaporation is a function of soil saturation given as an upper boundary to characterize water transport near surface through iterative calculation. Parameters were calibrated with 52 groundwater observation data by trial-and-error method. Particle tracking and isotopic dating results were combined to simulate groundwater age and calibrate models. The results showed that the typical profile of Qaidam basin can be divided into three lumped groundwater flow systems: (1) The circulation depth (CD) of local groundwater flow system is about 200m, where discharge in this lumped system accounts for 74.4% of the total amount of discharge (TAD), of which spring overflow constitutes large fraction. Groundwater age is generally less than 500 years and renewal rate is 1.13% a-1; (2) The CD of middle flow system can reach 800m, where it takes up 18.5% of TAD, evaporation and river overflows is the main outlet of discharge. Groundwater age is generally less than 10ka and renewal rate is 0.094% a-1; (3) The CD of regional flow system is from 1000 to 1500m. It accounts for 7.1% of TAD, of which evaporation is the largest component. Groundwater age is from 10ka to 50ka and renewal rate of which is 0.0074% a-1. Sulingguole river is the discharge area of regional groundwater system, the age of which is greater than 30ka. The method used here can obtain the renewal capacity of groundwater system and better reflect regional circulation characteristics, which have certain significance for the urgent study of regional groundwater circulation and flow systems in areas with limited available data.",

            "abstract": "A linear wave theory for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), previously developed by Sobel and Maloney, is extended upon in this study. Using column-integrated moisture as a prognostic variable, a dispersion relation is derived that solely depends on the convective adjustment timescale, a parameter that indicates the amount of moisture available for propagation and the distance that free Kelvin waves are able to travel in the presence of dissipation.\nThe dispersion relation adequately describes the MJO's signal in the wavenumber-frequency spectrum and defines the MJO as a dispersive equatorial moist wave with a westward group velocity. On the basis of linear regression analysis of the time varying field of outgoing longwave radiation, it is estimated that that the MJO's group velocity is 2/5 as large as its eastward phase speed. This dispersion is the result of the anomalous winds in the Kelvin and Rossby wave responses modulating the mean distribution of moisture such that the moisture anomaly propagates eastward while wave energy propagates westward.\nAdditionally, it is found that cloud-radiation feedbacks cause growth of the moist wave to be largest at the planetary scales. It is hypothesized that this scale selection mechanism is the result of upper-level cloudiness exhibiting a larger zonal extent than precipitation. The longwave radiative heating from these upper-level clouds causes an expansion of the region of ascent under weak-temperature gradient balance.",

In TOKAMAK (one type of fusion experiment device), sudden disruption of confined plasma are observed when plasma beta is high and is called high-beta disruption. The main cause of the disruption is ballooning instability (or localized interchange instability). This instability can happen also in the solar atmosphere when conditions are satisfied. Not only high gas pressure but also plasma flow along curved magnetic field triggers ballooning instability. The most probable location of the instability is around the loop top where the magnetic field is the weakest. Impulsive heating of confined plasma and particle acceleration can be expected by discharge process of the space charge which is created by drift motion of plasma particles perpendicular to the magnetic field. Associated with disruption, shock waves and turbulences will be generated due to sudden expansion of plasma. Recent high-resolution, high-cadence and multiple wavelength (visible-UV-EUV) observations by SDO show many of these events.",

These adaptation strategies can be managed via market trade in water and commodities to identify those strategies most likely to be adopted.\nThis work combines the physically-based University of New Hampshire Water Balance Model (WBM) with the macro-scale Purdue University Simplified International Model of agricultural Prices Land use and the Environment (SIMPLE) to explore the interaction of supply and demand for fresh water globally. In this work we use a newly developed grid cell-based version of SIMPLE to achieve a more direct connection between the two modeling paradigms of physically-based models with optimization-driven approaches characteristic of economic models.\nWe explore questions related to the global and regional impact of water scarcity and water surplus on the ability of regions to adapt to future change. Allowing for a variety of adaptation strategies such as direct trade of water and expanding the built water infrastructure, as well as indirect trade in commodities, will reduce overall global water stress and, in some regions, significantly reduce their vulnerability to these future changes.",

            "abstract": "In terrestrial basalts, iron isotope ratios are observed to weakly fractionate as a function of olivine and pyroxene crystallization. However, a ~0.1‰ difference between chondrites and MORB had been reported (Dauphas et al. 2009, Teng et al. 2013 and ref. therein). This observation could illustrate an isotope fractionation occurring during partial melting, as a function of the Fe valence in melt versus crystals.\nHere, we present high-precision Fe isotopic data measured by MC-ICP-MS on well-characterized samples from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR, n=9) and from the Garrett Transform Fault (n=8). These samples allow exploring the Fe isotope fractionation between melt and magnetite, and the role of partial melting on Fe isotope fractionation.\nOur average δ56Fe value is +0.095±0.013‰ (95% confidence, n=17), indistinguishable from a previous estimate of +0.105±0.006‰ (95% confidence, n=43, see ref. 2). Our δ56Fe values correlate weakly with MgO contents, and correlate positively with K/Ti ratios.\nPAC1 DR10 shows the largest Ti and Fe depletion after titanomagnetite fractionation, with a δ56Fe value of +0.076±0.036‰. This is ~0.05‰ below other samples at a given MgO. This may illustrate a significant Fe isotope fractionation between the melt and titanomagnetite, in agreement with experimental determination (Shahar et al. 2008).\nGN09-02, the most incompatible-element depleted sample, has a δ56Fe value of 0.037±0.020‰. This is the lowest high-precision δ56Fe value recorded for a MORB worldwide. This basalt displays an incompatible-element depletion consistent with re-melting beneath the transform fault of mantle source that was depleted during a first melting event, beneath the ridge axis (Wendt et al. 1999). The Fe isotope observation could indicate that its mantle source underwent 56Fe depletion after a first melting event. It could alternatively indicate a lower Fe isotope fractionation during re-melting, if the source was depleted of its Fe3+, likely producing a relatively reduced melt. These hypotheses are testable, and will be discussed in detail at the conference.",

We utilize a suite of satellite based MODIS-derived datasets to distinguish three surface types as they change daily: 1) exposed glacier ice, 2) snow over ice and 3) snow over land. The MODIS products include fractional snow cover from MODSCAG and permanent ice and snow from MODICE, both at 500 m resolution, that are used jointly with albedo or grain size. The method provides a means to systematically analyze the cycle of snow and glacier ice over large regional extents. We compare the time series of these surfaces for sub-basins of the Upper Indus Basin and characterize the variability over the MODIS record. We use the Randolph Glacier Inventory to categorize by glacier size within the sub-basins and analyze small, medium, and large glaciers to characterize their variability and investigate changes to the cryosphere at different scales.\nIn addition to analyses of the surface conditions, we use the surface classification to understand the source of melt volumes from glacier ice and seasonal snow cover. We model snow and ice melt in the Hunza and Gilgit sub-basins of the Upper Indus basin. We apply two melt models, a temperature index model and an energy balance model. For our temperature index model, we use lapse rates derived from ERA-Interim to downscale temperatures to 500 m and aggregate by elevation bands. Our spatially-distributed energy-balance model requires solar and longwave radiation, temperature, and wind data; we downscale to 500 m from GLDAS NOAH surface simulations. We compare results from the two models with measured streamflow, and evaluate the model computation times, accuracies and ease of diagnosing output errors. We include comparisons of model results using different remote sensing products (MCD43, MOD10A1, MODSCAG, MODDRFS) to partition surface types. Uncertainty is estimated through the use of multiple models and the different remote sensing products used in the surface classification.",

            "abstract": "Central Asia presents a perfect case study to understand the dynamic, and often conflicting, linkages between food, energy, and water in natural systems. The destruction of the Aral Sea is a well-known environmental disaster, largely driven by increased irrigation demand on the rivers that feed the endorheic sea. Continued reliance on these rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, often place available water resources at odds between hydropower demands upstream and irrigation requirements downstream. A combination of tools is required to understand these linkages and how they may change in the future as a function of climate change and population growth. In addition, the region is geopolitically complex as the former Soviet basin states develop management strategies to sustainably manage shared resources. This complexity increases the importance of relying upon publically available information sources and tools. Preliminary work has shown potential for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to recreate the natural water balance in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins by comparing results to total terrestrial water storage changes observed from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Modeled streamflow is well correlated to observed streamflow at upstream gauges prior to the large-scale expansion of irrigation and hydropower. However, current modeled results are unable to capture the human influence of water use on downstream flow. This study examines the utility of a crop simulation model, CropSyst, to represent irrigation demand and GRACE to improve modeled streamflow estimates in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins. Specifically we determine crop water demand with CropSyst utilizing available data on irrigation schemes and cropping patterns. We determine how this demand can be met either by surface water, modeled by VIC with a reservoir operation scheme, and/or by groundwater derived from GRACE. Finally, we assess how the inclusion of CropSyst and groundwater to model and meet irrigation demand improves modeled streamflow from VIC throughout the basins. The results of this work are integrated into a decision support platform to assist the basin states in understanding water availability and the impact of management decisions on available resources.",

The Arctic has been warming more than any other part of the earth (“polar amplification”) and is projected to rise at a rate about twice the global mean over the next century. Continuous monitoring of the Arctic surface temperature is critical to understanding Arctic climate change. Ice surface temperature has been measured with optical and thermal infrared sensors like the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for many years. With the ice surface temperature (IST) Environmental Data Record (EDR) available from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the SuomiNPP and future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites, we can continue to monitor and investigate Arctic climate change based on over 30 years of data.\nThis work evaluates the quality of the VIIRS IST EDR for use in near real-time applications as well as for extending the IST climate data record. Validation is performed through comparisons with multiple in situ, aircraft, model, and satellite datasets, including NASA IceBridge KT-19 infrared ice surface temperature observations, observations from the Arctic drifting buoys, IST from collocated MODIS, and surface air temperature from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis. Results show bias of 0.09 K ( -0.14, -3.60, and -3.67 K) and root mean squared error of 0.95 K (1.33, 3.8, and 7.07 K) for VIIRS IST EDR compared to KT-19 (MODIS, drifting buoy, and NCEP reanalysis).",

NGDS currently serves information from hundreds of the U.S. Department of Energy's sponsored projects and geologic data feeds from 60+ data providers in all 50 states, using free and open source software, in a federated system where data owners maintain control of their data. This interactive online system is opening new exploration opportunities and shortening project development by making data easily discoverable, accessible, and interoperable at no cost to users.\nUSGIN Foundation, Inc. was established in 2014 as a not-for-profit company to deploy the USGIN data integration framework for other natural resource (energy, water, and minerals), natural hazards, and geoscience investigations applications, nationally and worldwide.\nThe USGIN vision is that as each data node adds to its data repositories, the system-wide USGIN functions become increasingly valuable to it. Each data provider will have created a value-added service that is transportable and scalable to cover all data in its possession. Thus, there are benefits to each participant to continue to add data to the system and maintain it. The long term goal is that the data network reach a ‘tipping point’ at which it becomes like a data equivalent to the World Wide Web – where everyone will maintain the function because it is expected by its clientele and it fills critical needs. Applying this vision to NGDS, it also opens the door for additional data providers external to geothermal development, thus increasing the value of data integration platform, USGIN.\nUSGIN meets all the requirements of the White House Open Data Access Initiative that applies to (almost) all federally-funded research and all federally-maintained data, opening up huge opportunities for further deployment.",

            "abstract": "Foams have been used for decades as displacing fluids for EOR and aquifer remediation, and more recently as carriers of chemical amendments for the remediation of the vadose zone. Apart from various interesting physico-chemical and biochemical properties, foams are better injection fluids due to their low sensitivity to gravity and their peculiar rheology: for foams with bubbles on the order of at least the typical pore size, viscous dissipation arises mostly from the contact zones between the soap films and the walls.\nIn most experimental studies no local information of the foam structure is possible, and only global quantities such as the effective viscosity can be measured. We investigate foam flow through a two-dimensional porous medium consisting of circular obstacles positioned randomly in a horizontal transparent Hele-Shaw cell. The local foam structure is recorded in situ, which provides a measure of the spatial distribution of bubble velocities and sizes at regular time intervals. The flow exhibits a rich phenomenology including preferential flow paths and local flow intermittency/non-stationarity despite the imposed permanent global flow rate. Moreover, the medium selects the bubble size distribution through lamella division-triggered bubble fragmentation. Varying the mean bubble size of the injected foam, its water content, and mean velocity, we characterize those processes systematically and show that the distributions of bubble sizes and velocities are to some extent correlated. We furthermore measure the evolution, along the flow direction, of the distribution of bubble sizes, and measure the efficiency of bubble fragmentation as a function of the control parameters. The bubble fragmentation can be modeled numerically and to some extent analytically, based on statistical measures inferred from the experimental data. This study sheds new light on the local rheology of foams in porous media and opens the way towards quantitative characterization of the relationship between medium geometry and foam flow properties.",

            "abstract": "Significant carbonyl sulfide (COS) exchange by soils limits the applicability of net ecosystem COS flux observations as a proxy for stomatal trace gas exchange. High frequency measurements of COS over urban and natural ecosystems offer a potential window into processes regulating the carbon and water cycle: photosynthetic carbon uptake and stomatal conductance. COS diffuses through plant stomata and is irreversibly consumed by enzymes involved in photosynthesis. In certain environments, the magnitude of soil COS fluxes may constitute one-quarter of COS uptake by plants. Here we present a way of anticipating conditions when anomalously large soil COS fluxes are likely to occur and be taken into account.\nPrevious studies have pointed to either a tendency for soil uptake of COS from the atmosphere with a soil moisture optimum, or exponential COS production coincident with temperature. Data from field and laboratory studies were used to deconvolve the two processes. CO2 and COS fluxes were observed from forest, desert, grassland, and agricultural soils under a range of temperature and soil moisture conditions. We demonstrate how to estimate temperature and soil moisture impacts on COS soil production based on our cross-site incubations. By building a model of soil COS exchange that combines production and consumption terms, we offer a framework for interpreting the two disparate conclusions about soil COS exchange in previous studies. Such a construction should be used in ecosystem and continental scale modeling of COS fluxes to anticipate where the influence of soil COS exchange needs to be accounted for, resulting in greater utility of carbonyl sulfide as a tracer of plant physiological processes.",

            "abstract": "On March 22, 2014, the Oso landslide, located in northwestern Washington State, catastrophically mobilized about 8 million m3 of mixed glacial sediment, creating a valley-wide blockage that impounded the North Fork Stillaguamish River to a height of 8 m. The river overtopped the landslide blockage within several days and incised a new channel through predominately fine-grained, cohesive glaciolacustrine sediment in the center of the deposit. Our research focuses on the evolution of this new channel. Using a consumer-grade digital camera mounted on a fixed wing-aircraft, we used structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to produce 25 cm digital elevation models (DEMs) of the channel at one-month intervals between November 2014 and July 2015. A large RTK GPS validation dataset and inter-survey comparisons documents sub-decimeter vertical and horizontal accuracies. In combination with aerial lidar surveys acquired in March and April 2014, this dataset provides a uniquely resolved look at the erosion of a landslide dam. The newly-formed channel incised rapidly, lowering to within a meter of its pre-slide elevation by May 2014 despite modest flows. During high flows of the 2014-2015 winter flood season, erosion was dominated by channel widening of tens of meters with an overall stable planform. Incision fully returned the channel to pre-slide elevations by December 2014. A total of 510,000 +/- 50,000 m3 of material was eroded between March 2014 and July 2015, split evenly between the initial period of incision and the later period of widening. Sediment yield and channel morphology showed asymptotic trends towards stability. Measurements of deposit bulk density and grain size allowed conversion of volumetric sediment yields to mass yields by size classes. Over the 16 months after the slide, the river eroded about 0.82 +/- 0.1 Mt of sediment, of which 0.78 Mt was finer than 2mm. This yield agrees within 15% of an independent estimate based on concurrent sediment gaging in the reach, and represents about 400% of the background sediment yield over that same period.",

            "abstract": "One problem facing the sciences is communicating results and recommendations to policymakers. This is perhaps particularly difficult in the geosciences where results are often based on probabilistic models, as probability is often and unduly equated with a specific kind of uncertainty or unreliability in the results. This leads to a great deal of miscommunication and misguided policy decisions. It is, then, valid to ask how scientists should talk about probability, uncertainty, and models in a way that correctly conveys what the users of these models intend. What I propose is a new way to think and, importantly, talk about probability which will hopefully make this much more transparent to both users and policy makers. Rather than using a frequentist (prior percentages) or Bayesian (observer uncertainty) framework, we should talk about probability as a tool for defining a possibility space for measurements. This model is conceptually simple and makes probability a tool of refinement rather than a source of inaccuracy. A similar possibility-space model has proven useful in the climate sciences and there is good reason to believe it will have similar applications in hydrology.",

Exemplars within the science community operate data management systems that are extensively planned before implementation, staffed with robust data management expertise, equipped with appropriate services and technologies, and often highly structured. However, this is not the only approach to data management and almost certainly not the typical experience. The other end of the spectrum is often an ad hoc practitioner team, with changing requirements, limited training in data management, and resource constrained for both equipment and human resources. Much of the existing data management literature serves the exemplar community and ignores the ad hoc practitioners. Somewhere in the middle are examples where data are repurposed for new uses thereby generating new data management challenges.\n\nThis submission presents a conceptualization of an Agile Data Curation approach that provides foundational principles for data management efforts operating across the spectrum of data generation and use from large science systems to efforts with constrained resources, limited expertise, and evolving requirements. The underlying principles to Agile Data Curation are a reapplication of agile software development principles to data management. The historical reality for many data management efforts is operating in a practioner environment so Agile Data Curation utilizes historical and current case studies to validate the foundational principles and through comparison learn lessons for future application. This submission will provide an overview of the Agile Data Curation, cover the foundational principles to the approach, and introduce a framework for gathering, classifying, and applying lessons from case studies of practitioner data management.",

(2010) is used to represent the unresolved features of organized tropical convection. Results from nonlinear stochastic simulations are presented and demonstrate that the model reproduce well the mean local Hadley cell structure and some monsoon-like features such as the signature of the monsoon trough and convective mesoscale variability.",

This research followed and collected tweets about climate change as they related to two events: (i) the June 18, 2015 release of the Encyclical by Pope Francis which included content about climate change and (ii) the upcoming COP21 conference, a United Nations climate change conference, to be held on Dec. 7-8, 2015 in Paris. Using a Twitter account and Ncapture we were able to collect tens of thousands of climate change related tweets that were then loaded into a program called Nvivo which stored the tweets and associated publically available user information. We followed a few major hashtags such as COP21, UNFCCC, @climate, and the Pope. We examined twitter users, the information sources, locations, number of re-tweets, and frequency of tweets as well as the category of the tweet in regard to positive, negative, and neutral positions about climate. Frequency analysis of tweets over a 10 day period of the Encyclical event showed that ~200 tweets per day were made prior to the event, with ~1000 made on the day of the event, and ~100 per day following the event. For the COP21 event, activity ranged from 2000-3000 tweets per day. For the Encyclical event, an analysis of 1100 tweets on the day of release indicated that 47% of the tweets had a positive perspective about climate change, 50% were neutral, 1% negative, and 2% were unclear. For the COP21 event, an analysis of 342 tweets randomly sampled from 31,721 tweets, showed that 53% of the tweets had a positive perspective about climate change, 12% were neutral, 13% negative, and 22% were unclear. Differences in the frequency and perspectives of tweets were likely due to the nature of the events, one a long-term and recurring international event and the other a single international religious-oriented event. We tabulated the top 10 tweets about climate change as they relate to these two events and interpreted why these tweets may have persisted in the twitter space. From our observations, we provide some best practices in how to create climate messages that have high reach and longevity in order to assist climate change communicators in understanding the role Twitter plays in regard to climate change discourse and how to most efficiently utilize it.",

            "abstract": "Tellurium is a rare metalloid that has received minimal research regarding environmental mobility. Observations of Tellurium mobility are mainly based on observations of related metalloids such as selenium and beryllium; yet little research has been done on specific Tellurium behavior.\nThis laboratory work established the environmental controls that influence Tellurium mobility and chemical speciation in aqueous driven systems. Theoretical simulations show possible mobility of Te as Te(OH)3[+] at highly oxidizing and acidic conditions. Movement as TeO3[2-] under more basic conditions may also be possible in elevated Eh conditions. Mobility in reducing environments is theoretically not as likely.\nFor a practical approach to investigate mobility conditions for Te, a site with known Tellurium content was chosen in Colorado. Composite samples were selected from the top, center and bottom of a tailings pile for elution experiments. These samples were disintegrated using a rock crusher and pulverized with an automated mortar and pestle. The material was then classified to 70 microns. A 10g sample split was digested in concentrated HNO3 and HF and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy to determine initial Te concentrations. Additional 10g splits from each location were subjected to elution in 100 mL of each of the following solutions; nitric acid to a pH of 1.0, sulfuric acid to a pH of 2.0, sodium hydroxide to a pH of 12, ammonium hydroxide to a pH of 10, a pine needle/soil tea from material within the vicinity of the collection site to a pH of 3.5 and lastly distilled water to serve as control with a pH of 7. Sulfuric acid was purposefully chosen to simulate acid mine drainage from the decomposition of pyrite within the mine tailings. Sample sub sets were also inundated with 10mL of a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to induce oxidizing conditions. All collected eluates were then analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) to measure Tellurium concentrations in each sample.\nThe results provide a comparison of possible environmental Te mobility factors. While the process of bioavailability is not specifically addressed, preliminary data indicate a reference to perhaps assess impact to the local community and livestock relying on the San Miguel River, which is effected by run-off from the mine site.",

With the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as the forward model for the physical retrieval, a 1-dimensional variational method finds the atmospheric state which minimizes the difference between observed and simulated brightness temperatures. A key innovation of the algorithm development is a method to calculate the sensor error covariance matrix that is specific to the forward model employed and includes off-diagonal elements, allowing the algorithm to handle various forward models and sensors with little cross-talk. The water vapor profile is resolved by way of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and then summed to get total precipitable water (TPW).\nValidation of retrieved 10m wind speed, TPW, and sea surface temperature (SST) is performed via comparison with buoys and radiosondes as well as global models and other remotely sensed products. In addition to the validation, sensitivity experiments investigate the impact of ancillary data on the under-constrained retrieval, a concern for climate data records that strive to be independent of model biases. The introduction of model analysis data is found to aid the algorithm most at high frequency channels and affect TPW retrievals, whereas wind and cloud water retrievals show little effect from ingesting further ancillary data.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015Brakenridge2.pdf\nSince the mid-1970s, satellite observation has gathered an exceptionally valuable but largely un-harvested record of flood inundation world-wide. Commencing in late 1999, the two MODIS sensors also obtained daily surveillance of all of the Earth’s surface waters. These data are analogous to the record of earthquake seismicity provided by seismographic stations; they provide the only objective characterization of many extreme, damaging flood events. This information should be deployed to its maximum utility in defining areas of flood risk. In the developing nations, the remote sensing archive provides the immediate opportunity, without hydrological data infrastructure, to directly identify hazardous land areas. As well, satellite passive microwave radiometry, commencing with near-daily global coverage in 1998, has the ability to characterize at-a-site flood hydrographs. When combined with the satellite record of mapped inundation, this allows exceedance probabilities to be placed on observed inundation limits. The coupled data set can then be used to validate predictive flood modeling. As climate changes, flood statistics change. Yet hazard evaluation has for many decades proceeded using assumed stationarity of flood frequency distributions. New floods-of-record at any location thereby present a dilemma to policy makers and to hydrologists: immediately include the new extreme flood in the flow series, and thus increase the size of the regulatory floodplain, or use the pre-flood flow records to label the exceptional new event as, for example, “the 1000 yr flood”. The remote sensing record also includes defended floodplains where levees have failed, sometimes even during relatively common floods. We can use the powerful observations provided by remote sensing to confront the old probability estimates directly: by arguing that the recent observed record of inundation from actual floods must take priority in guiding public policy.",

            "abstract": "The small watershed ecosystem as a unit of experimental manipulation and analysis has been a hallmark of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest for 60 years. Water and nutrient budgets of headwater catchments have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the response of forested ecosystems to disturbances such as air pollution and land management. A limitation in the practice of this approach is that point-scale measurements are compiled to create catchment scale estimates of fluxes and stores, thus losing process information that could be gained from spatial patterns that depend on position along hydrologic or biogeochemical pathways. Beginning in 2007, high frequency measurements of water table fluctuation, made possible by inexpensive sensor technology, highlighted the previously underappreciated role of groundwater in these steep headwater catchments. Hydropedologic units (HPUs), identified by morphological differences in soil profiles, and reflecting distinct groundwater regimes, were defined and arranged along a generalized toposequence to describe a conceptual model which partitions spatial variation into predictable, repeatable landscape units. Stratification of point scale measurements of soil and water quality elucidates spatial patterns of variation and allows identification of hot spots, or zones of the catchment where certain processes prevail. Specific HPUs are associated with high rates of dissolved organic matter production, nitrification, denitrification and delivery of mineral weathering products to the surface. Moving beyond the small watershed, contrasting spatial patterns in surface water chemistry at the basin scale suggest differing prevalence of various HPUs among headwater catchments. Comparison of water quality patterns with HPU distribution allows identification of catchment properties responsible for regulation of water quality at the point to the catchment to the basin scales.",

            "abstract": "Radium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal found in many subsurface environments. Radium isotopes are generated by uranium and thorium decay, and are particularly abundant within groundwaters where minimal porewater flux leads to accumulation. These isotopes are used as natural tracers for estimating submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) [1], allowing for large scale estimation of GW fluxes into and out of the ocean [2]. They also represent a substantial hazard in wastewater produced after hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction [3], resulting in a significant risk of environmental release to surface and near-surface waters, and increased cost for water treatment or disposal.\nAdsorption to mineral surfaces represents a dominant pathway of radium retention in subsurface environments. For SGD studies, adsorption processes impact estimates of GW fluxes, while in hydraulic fracturing, radium adsorption to aquifer solids mediates wastewater radium activities. Analysis of past sorption studies revealed large variability in partition coefficients [4], while examination of radium adsorption kinetics and surface complexation have only recently started [5]. Accordingly, we present the results of sorption and column experiments of radium with a suite of iron minerals representative of those found within deep saline and near-surface (freshwater) aquifers, and evaluate impacts of varying salinity solutions through artificial waters. Further, we explore the impacts of pyrite oxidation and ferrihydrite transformation to other iron-bearing secondary minerals on the transport and retention of radium. These results will provide critical information on the mineralogical controls on radium retention in subsurface environments, and will therefore improve predictions of radium groundwater transport in natural and contaminated systems.\n[1] Charette, M.A., Buesseler, K.O. & Andrews, J.E., Limnol.

            "abstract": "The radiation pattern emitted from earthquakes is not currently considered in many seismic hazard assessments. This may be due to the fact that the focal mechanisms of potential ruptures are not well studied or are assumed to be random. In this case, all mechanisms are given equal likelihood, and the effect of radiation pattern is essentially averaged. But for about a dozen earthquake sources in the central and eastern United States (CEUS), faults with known mechanism are incorporated into the hazard assessment, but the radiation pattern is not included. In this study, we investigate the radiation pattern from larger CEUS earthquakes, one of which, the 2011 M5.7 Prague earthquake, was sampled by the relatively uniform and broad coverage of USArray. The radiation pattern from this event is readily apparent below about 1 Hz out to several hundred kilometers from the epicenter and decays with increasing frequency and distance, consistent with the effects of scattering attenuation. This decay is modeled with an apparent attenuation that is 5–­10 times greater than the attenuation of Lg waves for the CEUS. We consider the radiation pattern of potential sources in the New Madrid seismic zone to show the effect of radiation pattern on the seismic hazard assessment of major metropolitan areas in the region including Memphis, Tenn., Evansville, Ind., St Louis, Mo., and Little Rock, Ark. For the scenarios we choose, earthquakes with expected mechanisms within the seismic zone, both strike-slip and thrust, tend to focus energy to the southwest towards Little Rock and to the northeast towards Evansville. Eastern Memphis and St Louis, on the other hand, tend to be in lobes of reduced seismic shaking. This can have a significant impact on seismic hazard assessment for these cities, increasing hazard for the former and decreasing it for the latter, particularly for larger structures that are sensitive to longer shaking periods. It is more complicated, however, when considering that this effect would be coupled with smaller aleatory ground motion variability, channeling of seismic energy to the northeast and southwest by the Reelfoot rift, and potential site amplification and resonance by soft sediments in the Mississippi embayment.",

            "abstract": "Despite decades of study, the distribution of fault slip within the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) remains incompletely understood. Along the Panamint Valley fault system (PVFS), Late Pleistocene - Holocene slip rates are sparse, limited to a single site along the southernmost fault segment (~2-3 mm/yr). However, geodetic results along the Hunter Mountain fault, a strike-slip fault linked to the northern PVFS, suggest slip rates as high as 5-6 mm/yr. Here, we present preliminary results from an investigation of displaced alluvial fan surfaces along the central PVFS, near Jail Canyon. We utilize LiDAR-derived high resolution topography, field mapping, and soil characterization to reconstruct displacement. Comparison of soil characteristics to a calibrated regional soil chronosequence constrains the age of alluvial surfaces; analysis of a depth profile using 10Be cosmogenic isotopes is underway.\nThe PVFS near the mouth of Jail Canyon is characterized by a ~500 m wide zone of distributed deformation. Dextral offset of channels and associated alluvial surfaces across a N45W strike-slip fault marks lateral displacement, while N-S striking normal faults accomplish E-W extension. We exploit the preservation of a large relict channel to reconstruct the cumulative displacement from these faults. Offset crests of the channel levees suggest 115±10 m of right-lateral displacement, while the sum of extension across the fault zone is 34±3 m. Together, these suggest a cumulative slip of 148±13m oriented in a 310° direction, consistent with dextral-oblique motion across the PVFS. Soil development in alluvial surfaces is consistent with soils dated regionally between 30 – 50 ka. These preliminary results suggest that a minimum slip rate across the central PVFS is 4.1±1.3 mm/yr. Our results imply that the PVFS accomplishes a greater fraction of dextral shear, north of the Garlock fault, than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster.pdf\nRecent space observations revealed that pressure anisotropies in the solar wind are restricted to a clearly constrained parameter space. The observed constraints are believed to stem from kinetic plasma instabilities which feed on the free energy supplied by the pressure anisotropies. E.g., if the parallel pressure sufficiently exceeds the perpendicular pressure, a plasma eventually becomes subject to the parallel and the oblique firehose instability. The nonlinear saturation mechanisms of both instabilities are expected to shape the upper boundary of the pressure anisotropies observed in the solar wind, in the regime pparallel > pperp. However, it is still an open question which instability dominates this process. Despite the nonlinear nature of the saturation process, the linear instability threshold is expected to be of major importance, since it sets the limit for marginal stability. Only recently, first attempts were made to study the linear growth of the parallel firehose instability assuming more realistic bi-kappa velocity distributions instead of traditionally used bi-Maxwellians. We apply a newly developed, fully kinetic dispersion solver to numerically derive the instability thresholds for both firehose instabilities. In contrast to former findings, we observe that suprathermal particle populations lead to an enhancement of the parallel firehose instability close to the threshold, implying a lowering of the threshold especially for low beta setups. This is supposedly due to enhanced cyclotron resonance. For the first time ever, we also look at the oblique firehose threshold and find a contrary picture. Here, the presence of suprathermal particles leads to an increase of the instability threshold. Our findings deepen the understanding of the competition of both instabilities in the solar wind and call for a critical re-examination of existing models.",

            "abstract": "“You are what you eat, +1‰” is a central principle of carbon stable isotope (δ13C) distributions and is widely applied to understand the structure and ordering of macrobiotic ecosystems. Although based on observations from multicellular organisms that are able to ingest “food”, this idea also has been applied to Precambrian ecosystems dominated by unicellular, microbial life, with the suggestion that such systems could sustain ordered trophic structures observable in their isotopes. However, using a new approach to community profiling known as protein stable isotope fingerprinting (P-SIF), we find that the carbon isotope ratios of whole proteins separated from environmental samples show differences only between metabolically-distinct autotrophs; heterotrophs are not 13C-enriched. In parallel, a survey of the relative distribution of 13C between biochemical classes – specifically acetogenic lipids, isoprenoid lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids/sugars – across a variety of bacterial species appears to be a function of the main carbon metabolite, not an indicator of heterotrophy vs. autotrophy. Indeed, autotrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy all are indistinguishable when the primary food source is fresh photosynthate, i.e., sugar. Significant assimilation of acetate is diagnosed by acetogenic lipids that are relatively 13C-enriched vs. isoprenoid lipids. Mixed-substrate heterotrophy, in contrast, satisfies the classic “…+1‰” rule for bulk biomass, yet simultaneously it collapses the biochemical patterns of 13C almost completely. Together these observations point to a paradigm shift for understanding the preservation of bulk organic and lipid δ13C signatures in the rock record, suggesting that patterns of δ13Corg must primarily reflect changing carbon inputs, not the extent or intensity of heterotrophy.",

Thermal models based on these records predict downslope retreat of the MHSZ by ~1-2 km (~40 m in depth), potentially destabilizing methane hydrate and releasing CH4into the sediment and water column.\nTo test for contemporaneous methane hydrate dissociation along the UCS of the WA margin, we conducted a comprehensive geophysical and geochemical survey of active seep sites at the upper limit of the MHSZ from 48° to 46°N on the R/V Thompson in October 2014. We identified 9 active seep sites within this corridor and imaged 22 bubble plumes that commonly rise to ~300 m water depth with some reaching to near the sea surface. Some seep sites appear to be controlled by local margin structure, mainly extensional faults and ridges. We collected 22 gravity cores and 20 CTD/hydrocasts from the 9 seeps and processed ~350 sediment samples for pore water chemistry. Hydrocarbons heavier than CH4were not detected in bottom water samples, suggesting any gas hydrate present is Structure I. Preliminary pore water data show decreasing salinity downcore at each site with measured values as low as 10 psu and the sulfate-methane transition zone occurs between 50-80 cm below the sea floor. Pore water solute, noble gas, and isotope ratio data indicate freshening from at least one site is not the result of hydrate dissociation, but rather is due to clay dehydration at depths where temperatures exceed 60°C.\nVery few of the sites show pore water profiles that are in steady state, suggesting a dynamic biogeochemical system at the UCS along the entire WA margin. Further analyses and modeling are underway to constrain the nature and timing of these transient profiles and whether they are the result of recent methane hydrate dissociation.",

            "abstract": "One of the underlying problems in the investigation of CME genesis and evolution is relating remote- sensing observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to in-situ observations of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). Typically, remote-sensing observations of an eruption are first observed in the low corona, followed by coronagraph observations of the global structure of the CME projected onto the plane of the sky, and then finally local, highly-quantitative measurements of an ICME are made in situ along a spacecraft trajectory. However, the dramatic change in solar activity in recent years has raised awareness of “stealth” CMEs, which are CMEs observed in coronagraph data but not in coronal images, especially in disk view. Largely identified during the deep minimum of cycle 23/24, stealth CMEs appear to be on the rise. Since solar cycle 25 brings with it the possibility of yet another low activity cycle, it is very likely that the number of stealth CMEs will remain a significant fraction of ejecta. We investigate the properties of stealth CMEs during the rise of solar cycle 24 and through the current solar maximum, paying special attention to their proximity to coronal holes. We investigate the existence of mismatched polarity reversals in the magnetic field and electron strahl measured in situ within ICMEs associated with stealth CMEs. We discuss the plausibility of interaction with solar wind emanating from coronal holes as a key element of stealth CME eruption as evidenced by expanding coronal hole boundaries during eruption and the presence of interchange reconnection within ICMEs.",

The 2007 M7.2 and 2013 M7.0 Andreanof Islands earthquakes were representative of the most common source of significant seismic activity in the region, the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust. The 2013 M7.5 Craig earthquake, a strike-slip event on the Queen-Charlotte fault, occurred along the transform plate boundary in southeast Alaska. The largest earthquake of the past decade, the 2014 M7.9 Little Sitkin event in the western Aleutians, occurred at an intermediate depth and ruptured along a gently dipping fault through nearly the entire thickness of the subducted Pacific plate. Along with these major earthquakes, the Alaska Earthquake Center reported over 250,000 seismic events in the state over the last decade, and its earthquake catalog surpassed 500,000 events in mid-2015. Improvements in monitoring networks and processing techniques allowed an unprecedented glimpse into earthquake patterns in Alaska. Some notable recent earthquake sequences include the 2008 Kasatochi eruption, the 2006-2008 M6+ crustal earthquakes in the central and western Aleutians, the 2010 and 2015 Bering Sea earthquakes, the 2014 Noatak swarm, and the 2014 Minto earthquake sequence. In 2013, the Earthscope USArray project made its way into Alaska. There are now almost 40 new Transportable Array stations in Alaska along with over 20 upgraded sites. This project is changing the earthquake-monitoring scene in Alaska, lowering magnitude of completeness across large, newly instrumented parts of the state.",

In September 2013 a field test was conducted at the NEES@UCSB Garner Valley field site in Southern California incorporating DAS technology. A 762-meter-long fiber-optic cable was trenched to a depth of about 0.3 m in a rectangular design with two interior diagonal segments. The fiber was excited by a number of sources, including a 45 kN shear shaker and a smaller 450 N portable mass shaker, both of which were available through NEES@UCLA. In addition to these sources, signals were recorded from a minivib source and hammer blows on a steel plate, as well as 8 hours of overnight ambient noise recording. One goal of the field test was to evaluate the use of DAS for tomographic studies. The large number of measurement points inherent to DAS lends itself well to this type of study. Tomograms were constructed using two of the active-sources at multiple locations. There were 8 minivib locations within the array and 13 hammer locations along the boundary of the array. Travel-time data were collected with the DAS array. Two-dimensional velocity tomograms were constructed for different resolutions from the two active sources and compared. In all the images, the lowest velocities lie near the center of the array with higher velocities surrounding this area. The impact results, however, may contain an artifact due to multiple propagation modes. This research is part of the DOE’s PoroTomo project.",

            "abstract": "CSU, Chico is a comprehensive university with high expectations for both teaching (4 courses per semester) and scholarly work. In an attempt to introduce faculty to their new positions, a two-day New Faculty Orientation has been offered for the last two decades. In AY 2014-15, in an attempt to improve the first year experience for new faculty, the Office of Faculty Affairs established and assessed a New Faculty Mentoring program. Eight college-based mentors were selected based on recommendations by College Deans who suggested successful teachers and scholars who could provide the social and leadership skills to effectively guide others. Based on a needs-assessment survey new faculty completed during orientation, mentors met with their new faculty cohort at least monthly to discuss campus resources, host workshops and provide other support in areas of time management, work-life balance, teaching pedagogies, discipline-specific internal and external funding resources, student support resources, and the preparation of Review/Retention documents. Mentors were paid a small stipend for their work and met twice each semester to discuss readings on mentoring best practices, their mentoring activities with new faculty and to compare the needs of their mentees. Survey results from 28 of 37 new faculty respondents indicate they valued Review/Retention workshops, mentor reviews of teaching and the opportunity to visit mentor classrooms for examples of good teaching practices. Social events helped establish cohorts, although some mentees indicated that some cohorts were too large. An unforeseen outcome was recognition that mid-year hires need to also be included in new faculty cohort groups. Moving forward, mentors will continue to work with their original mentees for a 2nd year. A new group of mentors will be identified for faculty starting in fall 2015 who will work with smaller first-year faculty cohorts and will coordinate with the first generation mentors for peer support.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial hydrological system, including surface and subsurface water, is an essential component of the Earth's climate system. Over the past few decades, land surface modelers have built one-dimensional (1D) models resolving the vertical flow of water through the soil column for use in Earth system models (ESMs). These models generally have a relatively coarse model grid size (~25-100 km) and only account for sub-grid lateral hydrological variations using simple parameterization schemes. At the same time, hydrologists have developed detailed high-resolution (~0.1-10 km grid size) three dimensional (3D) models and showed the importance of accounting for the vertical and lateral redistribution of surface and subsurface water on soil moisture, the surface energy balance and ecosystem dynamics on these smaller scales. However, computational constraints have limited the implementation of the high-resolution models for continental and global scale applications.\nThe current work presents a hybrid-3D hydrological approach is presented, where the 1D vertical soil column model (available in many ESMs) is coupled with a high-resolution lateral flow model (h2D) to simulate subsurface flow and overland flow. H2D accounts for both local-scale hillslope and regional-scale unconfined aquifer responses (i.e. riparian zone and wetlands). This approach was shown to give comparable results as those obtained by an explicit 3D Richards model for the subsurface, but improves runtime efficiency considerably.\nThe h3D approach is implemented for the Delaware river basin, where Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) is used to calculated vertical energy and water exchanges with the atmosphere using a 10km grid resolution. Noah-MP was coupled within the WRF-Hydro infrastructure with the lateral 1km grid resolution h2D model, for which the average depth-to-bedrock, hillslope width function and soil parameters were estimated from digital datasets.\nThe ability of this h3D approach to simulate the hydrological dynamics of the Delaware River basin will be assessed by comparing the model results (both hydrological performance and numerical efficiency) with the standard setup of the NOAH-MP model and a high-resolution (1km) version of NOAH-MP, which also explicitly accounts for lateral subsurface and overland flow.",

Within the Tarapacá Region of the Atacama Desert, the Pampa del Tamarugal Aquifer (PTA) is the primary source of water for agriculture, industry, mining, and residential uses. The PTA covers 5,000 km2, and is located in the Pampa del Tamarugal Basin, which is situated between the Andes and the Coastal Cordillera, and is filled with ~1700m of Miocene and younger sediments. The source of recharge for the PTA originates as precipitation in the high Andes, which can receive up to 400 mm/yr of precipitation; however, the mechanisms and magnitude of recharge to the PTA are still poorly understood. Here, we present a regional scale, non-isothermal 2-D numerical groundwater model is developed to analyze the time scales and geological controls on fluid flow paths recharging the PTA. Results from this work suggest that (1) both shallow groundwater flow and deep (>1km) hydrothermal fluid circulation are responsible for recharging the PTA; (2) topography and geothermal gradients are the main driving factors for regional groundwater flow; (3) the Altos de Pica member 4, an ignimbrite layer in the sedimentary basin controls both heat and fluid flow in the western part of the basin, this is evident due to the presence of convection cells and meteoric water upwelling and presenting itself as surface water (salars); and (4) it takes meteoric water 100,000 years to travel from the high Andes to reach Pica and 1,000,000 years for salar formation. In addition, this work provides a theoretical basis for the spatial distribution of highly alkaline surface water bodies, known as salars in the western Atacama Desert.",

During the 2013-2014 austral summer field season refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols were quantified by a single particle soot photometer (SP2) in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The dark rBC particles absorb more radiation thereby increasing atmospheric heating, as well as reducing surface albedo and enhancing hydrologic melt when deposited on highly reflective surfaces such as snow and ice. Quantifying both local and long-range atmospheric transport of rBC to this region of a remote continent mostly covered by ice and snow would be useful in understanding meltwater generation as climate changes. Although the Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, they contain many alpine glaciers, some of which are fed from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Continuous rBC measurements were collected at Lake Hoare Camp in the Taylor Valley for two months, along with shorter periods at more remote locations within the Dry Valleys. Conditions at the Lake Hoare Camp were dominated by up-valley winds from McMurdo Sound, however, winds also brought air down-valley from the EAIS polar plateau. Here we investigated periods dominated by both up and down-valley winds to explore differences in rBC concentrations, size distributions, and scattering properties. The average background rBC mass concentration was 1ng/m3, though concentrations as high as 50 ng/m3 were observed at times, likely due to local sources.",

As dispersed remnant ice becomes more common in the future it will be increasingly important to understand its ecological role for upper trophic levels such as marine mammals and its role for supporting primary productivity of ice-associated algae. Potential sparse ice habitat at sea ice concentrations below 15% is difficult to detect using remote sensing data alone. A combination of high resolution satellite imagery (including Synthetic Aperture Radar), data from the Barrow sea ice radar, and local observations from indigenous sea ice experts was used to detect sparse sea ice in the Alaska Arctic. Traditional knowledge on sea ice use by marine mammals was used to delimit the scales where sparse ice could still be used as habitat for seals and walrus. Potential sparse ice habitat was quantified with respect to overall spatial extent, size of ice floes, and density of floes. Sparse ice persistence offshore did not prevent the occurrence of large coastal walrus haul outs, but the lack of sparse ice and early sea ice retreat coincided with local observations of ringed seal pup mortality. Observations from indigenous hunters will continue to be an important source of information for validating remote sensing detections of sparse ice, and improving understanding of marine mammal adaptations to sea ice change.",

The existing fracture network models have been developed to describe groundwater flow behavior in fracture rock, typically assuming that flow in all fractures has uniform characteristics, i.e., flow is either laminar or turbulent. However, turbulent and laminar flow may occur at the same time in the fracture rock with wide range of fracture sizes. In this study, we develop an improved approach to calculate flow rate and pressure distribution in the fracture network where both laminar and turbulent flows may exist. Reynolds number is used to distinguish flow characteristics in individual fracture. In fractures where flow is laminar, we use the cubic law for the transmissivity in conjunction with Darcy’s law to calculate the pressure distribution and flow behaviors. If the flow is turbulent, non-linear equations are used to describe the flow behaviors. Pressure and flow behaviors are examined in relation to fracture aperture sizes, boundary conditions, and fracture surface friction coefficients. Differences between the pressure distributions and flow rates in the fracture network from this study and those from previous approaches are explored and discussed. In particular, we examine the potential errors from the uniform flow characteristics assumption and investigate how the errors are related to fracture sizes and orientation distributions.",

We will evaluate water isotope data (δ18O, δD) collected and analyzed at The University of Alabama (33°13'N, 87°33'W) since June 2005. The monitoring station, central to the Southeast, was established to provide long-term water isotope data needed for reconstructing paleo-rainfall records of the region.\nProxy data (e.g., δ18Ocalcite) archived in speleothems have been demonstrated to provide trustworthy information about past climate conditions; however, present-day monitoring of both local rainfall and cave dripwater are crucial. The decade-long (June 2005 – May 2015) rainfall record allows for the establishment of the relationship between water isotopes (δ18O, δD) and monthly air temperature, rainfall amount, as well as the general differences between summer and winter rainfall. Dripwater from Cathedral Caverns (34°34'N, 86°13'W), located in northeastern Alabama, has been sampled at a monthly resolution since January 2015 to determine if the water chemistry in the cave represents an annual mean for the rainfall or if it is seasonally biased. The ultimate goal of this study is to better understand how atmospheric air currents (specifically the strength/position of the Polar Jet Stream, PJS), and hence rainfall in the Southeast, varied during past periods of relative warming (e.g., Dansgaard-Oeschger events) and cooling (e.g., Heinrich events) of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere. Future GCMs will be improved if a reliable high-resolution paleo-rainfall record can be produced for the Southeast.",

            "abstract": "Injection of CO2 into low permeability shale formations leads to additional gas recovery and reduces the flux of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus combining a strong economic incentive with a permanent storage option for CO2. Reduced formation transmissivity due to clay swelling is a concern in CO2-enhanced gas production. Clay minerals partly determine the physical (i.e. permeability, brittleness) and certain chemical properties (i.e. wetting ability, gas adsorption) of shales, and montmorillonites are of particular interest because they swell by the uptake of species in their interlayer.\nIn this study, the hydration and expansion of Na-, Cs-, and NH4+-saturated montmorillonite (Na-, Cs-, and NH4-SWy-2) in high-pressure (90 bar) and moderate temperature (50 °C) methane, carbon dioxide, and CO2/CH4 mixtures (3 and 25 mole% CO2) were investigated using in situ IR spectroscopic titrations, in situ XRD, in situ MAS-NMR, and ab initio electronic structure calculations. The overarching goal was to better understand the hydration/expansion behavior of Na-SWy-2 in CO2/CH4 fluid mixtures by comparison to Cs-, and NH4+-saturated clays. Specific aims were to (1) determine if CH4 intercalates the clays, (2) probe the effects of increasing dissolved CO2 and H2O concentrations, and (3) understand the role of cation solvation by H2O and/or CO2.\nIn pure CH4, no evidence of CH4 intercalation was detected by IR for any of the clays. Similarly, no measurable changes to the basal spacing were observed by XRD in the presence of pure CH4. However, when dry Cs- and NH4-SWy-2 were exposed to dry fluids containing CO2, IR showed maximum CO2 penetrated the interlayer, XRD indicated the clays expanded, and NMR showed evidence for cation solvation by CO2, in line with theoretical predictions. IR titration of these clays with water showed sorbed H2O concentrations decreased with increasing dissolved CO2, suggesting competition for interlayer residency by CO2 and H2O. For Na-SWy-2, on the other hand, CO2 intercalated the clay and was at a maximum only after a minimum sorbed H2O was achieved. Further increases in sorbed H2O led to displacement of intercalated CO2. These findings demonstrate that complicated H2O and CO2 intercalation processes could lead to permeability changes that directly impact methane transmissivity in shales.",

Fecal microorganisms are the leading cause of surface water impairment, presenting a problem of national importance. In the US, approximately 93,000 river and stream miles contain elevated levels of fecal bacteria. Because microbial fate and transport are driven by inherently random environmental processes taking place in complex, multi-component environmental systems, a systems-based stochastic approach is needed to better understand patterns of microbial contamination. We have applied systems reliability theory to compute the spatio-temporal distribution of probability of water contamination in dendritic flow networks. This approach allows to measure probabilistically the impact of watershed components and microbial sources on overall water quality, and to determine watershed characteristics and external environmental parameters to which microbial water quality is most sensitive. This, in turn, helps (1) identify the “hot spots” exerting the highest impact, and (2) quantify of sustainability metrics such as reliability, vulnerability and resilience – all of which will, in turn, guide prioritization of management measures under various conditions.",

            "abstract": "The April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake excited a moderate tsunami which turned on the national alert of tsunami threat. This earthquake was located in the well-known seismic gap in northern Chile which had a high seismic potential (~ Mw 9.0) after the two main large historic events of 1868 and 1877. Nonetheless, studies of the seismic source performed with seismic data inversions suggest that the event exhibited a main patch located around 19.8° S at 40 km of depth with a seismic moment equivalent to Mw = 8.2. Thus, a large seismic deficit remains in the gap being capable to release an event of Mw = 8.8-8.9.\nTo understand the importance of the tsunami threat in this zone, a seismic source modeling of the Iquique Earthquake is performed. A new approach based on stochastic k2 seismic sources is presented. A set of those sources is generated and for each one, a full numerical tsunami model is performed in order to obtain the run-up heights along the coastline. The results are compared with the available field run-up measurements and with the tide gauges that registered the signal. The comparison is not uniform; it penalizes more when the discrepancies are larger close to the peak run-up location. This criterion allows to identify the best seismic source from the set of scenarios that explains better the observations from a statistical point of view.\nBy the other hand, a L2 norm minimization is used to invert the seismic source by comparing the peak nearshore tsunami amplitude (PNTA) with the run-up observations. This method searches in a space of solutions the best seismic configuration by retrieving the Green’s function coefficients in order to explain the field measurements.\n The results obtained confirm that a concentrated down-dip patch slip adequately models the run-up data.",

            "abstract": "Urban water supply systems are often stressed during seasonal outdoor water use as water demands related to the climate are variable in nature making it difficult to optimize the operation of the water supply system. Urban water demand forecasts (UWD) failing to include meteorological conditions as inputs to the forecast model may produce poor forecasts as they cannot account for the increase/decrease in demand related to meteorological conditions. Meteorological records stochastically simulated into the future can be used as inputs to data-driven UWD forecasts generally resulting in improved forecast accuracy. This study aims to produce data-driven UWD forecasts for two different Canadian water utilities (Montreal and Victoria) using machine learning methods by first selecting historical UWD and meteorological records derived from a stochastic weather generator using nonlinear input variable selection. The nonlinear input variable selection methods considered in this work are derived from the concept of conditional mutual information, a nonlinear dependency measure based on (multivariate) probability density functions and accounts for relevancy, conditional relevancy, and redundancy from a potential set of input variables. The results of our study indicate that stochastic weather inputs can improve UWD forecast accuracy for the two sites considered in this work. Nonlinear input variable selection is suggested as a means to identify which meteorological conditions should be utilized in the forecast.",

            "abstract": "The Surat Basin in south-eastern Queensland is one of Australia’s main coal bed methane production areas. It has also been subject to coal exploration over many years and consequently there are thousands of abandoned exploration boreholes throughout the region. Here, we present some results of field measurements aimed at locating leaking legacy exploration boreholes in the Surat Basin and to quantify their emission rates. We also discuss emission measurements made on abandoned CBM wells in Queensland and NSW that have been decommissioned according to modern practices.\nLeaking boreholes were located using a Picarro 2301 CH4 analyser mounted in a vehicle that was driven through gas fields in the Surat Basin. Where surface emissions were indicated by elevated ambient CH4 levels, the emission rate was measured using soil flux chambers at each site. For comparison, soil gas flux measurements were also made on natural surfaces and agricultural land throughout the study areas. Ten borehole sources were located during the surveys, yielding emission rates from less than 0.1 kg CH4 day-1 to more than 100 kg CH4 day-1. A number of other known exploration borehole sites were examined which had no detectable CH4 emissions. Plugged and abandoned CBM wells showed no CH4 emissions except in two cases where emission rates of about 0.07 g CH4 day-1 were detected, which were comparable to natural wetland CH4 emissions.\nPreliminary results suggest that modern decommissioning practices appear to be effective in preventing CH4 leakage from CBM abandoned wells. However, legacy coal exploration boreholes may represent a significant source of CH4 in the Surat Basin, although the proportion of these holes leaking CH4 is yet to be determined. Moreover, it is not yet clear if emissions from boreholes are affected by changes in groundwater induced by water extraction associated with gas production and agriculture. This is an area requiring further research.",

            "abstract": "We used the eddy covariance method to continuously measure the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide for seven years from a snow-scoured alpine tundra meadow on Niwot Ridge in Colorado, USA that may be underlain by sporadic permafrost. On average, the alpine tundra was a net annual source of 232 g C m-2 to the atmosphere, and the source strength of this ecosystem increased over the length of the seven year period due to both reduced carbon uptake during the growing season and increased respiration throughout the winter. To constrain the contribution of permafrost degradation to observed carbon emissions, we also measured the radiocarbon content of actively cycling, occluded, and mineral soil carbon pools across a meso-scale soil moisture and (possible) permafrost gradient within this meadow, as well as the seasonal radiocarbon content of soil respiration. These data suggest that wintertime soil respiration is limited to patches of wet meadow tundra that may be associated with permafrost. Furthermore, soil respiration from one of these locations indicates preferential turnover of a relatively slow cycling carbon pool during the winter. Given that summer air temperatures and positive degree days have been increasing on Niwot Ridge since the middle of the 20th century, this research suggests that an alpine tundra permafrost-respiration feedback to climate change, similar to that observed in arctic tundra ecosystems, may be currently underway.",

From this lesson, NIED is now constructing S-net (Seafloor Observation Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis along the Japan Trench) which consists of 150 ocean bottom observatories with seismometers and pressure gauges (tsunamimeters) linked by fiber optic cables. To take full advantage of S-net, we develop a new methodology of real-time tsunami inundation forecast using ocean bottom observation data and construct a prototype system that implements the developed forecasting method for the Pacific coast of Chiba prefecture (Sotobo area). We employ a database-based approach because inundation is a strongly non-linear phenomenon and its calculation costs are rather heavy. We prepare tsunami scenario bank in advance, by constructing the possible tsunami sources, and calculating the tsunami waveforms at S-net stations, coastal tsunami heights and tsunami inundation on land. To calculate the inundation for target Sotobo area, we construct the 10-m-mesh precise elevation model with coastal structures. Based on the sensitivities analyses, we construct the tsunami scenario bank that efficiently covers possible tsunami scenarios affecting the Sotobo area. A real-time forecast is carried out by selecting several possible scenarios which can well explain real-time tsunami data observed at S-net from tsunami scenario bank. An advantage of our method is that tsunami inundations are estimated directly from the actual tsunami data without any source information, which may have large estimation errors. In addition to the forecast system, we develop Web services, APIs, and smartphone applications and brush them up through social experiments to provide the real-time tsunami observation and forecast information in easy way to understand toward urging people to evacuate.",

In California, up to 60% of the annual precipitation depends on the arrival of a small number of AR. Despite their importance, state-of-the art atmospheric circulation models are consistently poor in predicting AR location and timing. We will demonstrate that model predictions also contain large errors in the magnitude of AR horizontal vapor transport. In this study we aim to compare the prediction skill in horizontal water vapor transport from a modified version of the Weather Research and Forecast (West-WRF) and the Global Forecast System (GFS) models. We verify model skill using dropsonde observations taken from the CalWater 2014 - 2015 field campaigns and a ground-based network of co-located wind profiling radar and GPS receivers. We compare each model across a large number of lead times ranging from 12 hours to 8 days. Our preliminary results suggest that the Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) and total vapor flux are more accurately predicted by the higher resolution West-WRF model. Furthermore, we find that GFS typically has a consistent 2-6 hour lag in the timing of peak water vapor flux compared to the West-WRF model. Physical explanations of the more accurate West-WRF horizontal vapor transport and the apparent delay in peak vapor flux timing are also examined.",

The recent emergence of a suite of omics driven technologies offers powerful tools for investigating functionality of this community. However, these tools provide only a static snapshot of the community in space and time. The temporal nature of stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments expands the depth at which microbial communities can be investigated and understood. While selectively targeting only metabolically active organisms in a community, the labeled substrate can be tracked spatially, temporally and phylo-genetically and linked to active functions, organism interactions and exchanges.\nSingle SIP technologies are limited in their ability to describe the biological system as a whole. However, integration of multiple SIP based analytics offers a more comprehensive description of substrate fate. The phototroph based microbial mat community resident in Hot Lake, a hypersaline lake located in Washington State, offers a tractable system for testing the multi analytic approach. We exposed the mat to three different 13C-labeled substrates (HCO3-, glucose and acetate) in situ at midday, and subsequently analyzed the mat 24 hours after incubation.\nThe approach revealed different metabolic fates and organism specific uptake. When compared to acetate, glucose and HCO3- showed a greater incorporation into extracellular material, while acetate had a greater conversion to intracellular fatty acids, suggesting that HCO3- and glucose could be more readily shared as a community currency than acetate. All substrates were converted to amino acids and proteins, but while glucose and HCO3- demonstrated considerable incorporation into heterotrophic proteins, the conversion of acetate to these proteins was minimal, potentially implying that acetate derived intermediates are not a currency of metabolic exchange in the community. Functional analyses revealed the predominance of synthesis of photosynthetic proteins in the HCO3- incubations and transporters in the glucose and acetate incubations potentially indicating the repression of photosynthetic activity in the presence of an alternative carbon source.",

            "abstract": "The response of a biological indicator to N deposition can indicate that an ecosystem has surpassed a critical load and is at risk of significant change. The importance of this exceedance is often difficult to digest by policy makers and public audiences if the change is not linked to a familiar ecosystem endpoint. A workshop was held to bring together scientists, resource managers, and policy makers with expertise in ecosystem functioning, critical loads, and economics in an effort to identify the ecosystem services impacted by air pollution. This was completed within the framework of the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS) Classification System to produce a product that identified distinct interactions between society and the effects of nitrogen pollution. From each change in a biological indicator, we created multiple ecological production functions to identify the cascading effects of the change to a measureable ecosystem service that a user interacts with either by enjoying, consuming, or appreciating the good or service, or using it as an input in the human economy. This FEGS metric was then linked to a beneficiary group that interacts with the service.\nChains detailing the links from the biological indicator to the beneficiary group were created for aquatic and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication at the workshop, and here we present a subset of the workshop results by highlighting for 9 different ecosystems affected by terrestrial eutrophication. A total of 213 chains that linked to 37 unique FEGS metrics and impacted 15 beneficiary groups were identified based on nitrogen deposition mediated changes to biological indicators. The chains within each ecosystem were combined in flow charts to show the complex, overlapping relationships among biological indicators, ecosystem services, and beneficiary groups. Strength of relationship values were calculated for each chain based on support for the link in the scientific literature. We produced the complex diagrams to provide details to scientists and experts, identify research gaps, and understand the complexity of critical load exceedances. We then simplified the flow charts into stories that could produce an emotional connection and resonate with a general audience. These stories are important steps to breach the gaps between science and policy.",

This near real-time capability will enable advanced technologies like the Cloudera Impala-based Structured Query Language (SQL) query capabilities and Hadoop-based MapReduce analytics over native NetCDF files while providing a platform for community experimentation with emerging analytic technologies. (2) We are building a full-featured Reanalysis Ensemble Service comprising monthly means data from six reanalysis data sets. The service will provide a basic set of commonly used operations over the reanalysis collections. The operations will be made accessible through NASA's climate data analytics Web services and our client-side Climate Data Services (CDS) API. (3) We are establishing an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) WPS-compliant Web service interface to our climate data analytics service that will enable greater interoperability with next-generation ESGF capabilities. The CDS API will be extended to accommodate the new WPS Web service endpoints as well as ESGF's Web service endpoints. These activities address some of the most important technical challenges for server-side analytics and support the research community's requirements for improved interoperability and improved access to reanalysis data.",

            "abstract": "Potential changes in soil moisture may have significant societal impacts, as soil moisture directly influences agriculture. Soil moisture is also a critical factor in climate simulations as it is the moisture source for evapotranspiration over land. Climate model projections generally show reduced soil moisture in future warmer climate conditions, and the scale of potential adverse impacts means that validation of those projections is a science priority. Our understanding of soil moisture dynamics is hampered by limited suitable observational data, but the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site offers a unique resource for this purpose, with over a decade of simultaneous measurements of soil moisture profiles and measurements of moisture fluxes and aboveground variables. In this work we use stations across SGP to identify statistical relationships in drivers of soil moisture dynamics. We also compare observed soil moisture dynamics to those in the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4), running CLM4 in an offline mode with observationally derived atmospheric forcing, to identify similarities and discrepancies in resulting soil moisture evolution in observations and model. Preliminary comparison of metrics such as soil moisture characteristic time, soil moisture infiltration rate, etc. suggests that the governing hydrological and/or biophysical processes in models need improvements. The spatial heterogeneity of the SGP measurement stations also provides insight into the role of sub-grid scale features and the role of spatial resolution in producing accurate representations of soil moisture in climate models.",

Identifying the relative roles of these processes is essential for explaining past regional and seasonal trends in temperature extremes. Here, we examine regional trends in daily temperature extremes in winter and summer over Northern Hemisphere land areas since 1979. We first consider to what extent changes in external radiative forcing have constrained regional trends in seasonal-mean temperatures and highest and lowest daily extremes over this period. We then assess the sensitivity of the same trends to internal climate variations through climate model experiments subject to specified boundary forcings and unforced internal atmospheric variability. Several physical processes contribute to regional trends in temperature extremes over this period, with their relative importance varying by season and geographic location. The results highlight the need to consider such factors in estimating future regional trends in temperature extremes, as well as possible ranges in trends over specific time periods.",

            "abstract": "The structural architecture of Alaska is the product of a complex history of deformation along both the Cordilleran and Arctic margins of North America through interactions with ocean plates and with continental elements of Laurentia, Siberia, and Baltica. We use geological constraints to assign areal deformation to 14 time intervals and map their distributions in Alaska. Alaska can be divided into three domains with differing histories of deformation. The northern domain experienced the Early Cretaceous Brookian orogeny, an oceanic arc-continent collisional orogeny, followed by a mid-Cretaceous extensional overprint. Opening of the oceanic Canada Basin rifted the orogen from the Canadian Arctic margin, producing the bent trends of the orogen. The second domain constitutes the Phanerozoic Peninsular-Wrangellia-Alexander arc terrane and its paired Mesozoic accretionary prisms. Its structural history is unrelated to domains to the north until a shared history of Late Cretaceous deformation. The third domain, situated between the first two domains and roughly bounded by the Cenozoic dextral Denali and Tintina faults, includes the Yukon Composite terrane (Laurentian origin) and the large Farewell (Baltica origin) terrane. These terranes are not linked until Late Cretaceous sedimentary overlap, but we have not identified a shared deformation between these two terranes that might mark their juxtaposition by collisional processes. Similar early Late Cretaceous sedimentary linkages stitch the northern and central domains. Late Late Cretaceous folding and thrusting across much of Alaska south of the Brooks Range correlates temporally with the collision of the southern domain with the remainder of Alaska. Early Cenozoic shortening is mild across much of the state but is significant in the Brooks Range, and correlates in time with dextral faulting, ridge subduction, and rotation of western Alaska. Late Cenozoic shortening is significant in southern Alaska inboard of the underthrusting Yakutat terrane at the Pacific margin.",

In this study, the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) was derived to simulate the probability distribution in two-dimensional probability space, snow depth versus snow density. This FPE describes the evolution of probability density function of the state variables throughout the snow season. The snow depth and snow density were selected as stochastic state variables while snow temperature was left deterministic. In this equation, the snowmelt and snow accumulation are treated as external sources of stochasticity. This means that both the mean and variance parts of these variables are taken into consideration in the FPE as advection convection and diffusion effects in the probability domain, respectively. The major challenge of the FPE is calculation of the covariance terms appeared in the diffusion terms due to limitation of the data. In this study, several possible simplifications of the FPE will be discussed. We will test the following hypotheses for the simplifications: (1) the convection correction term is small enough to be neglected compared to the mean convection term, (2) snowmelt and snow accumulation are independent each other, and (3) snow accumulation term can be evaluated by measured snow depth data. For the estimation of snowmelt terms, outputs of a distributed snow model may also be used to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of snowmelt. Finally, the FPE will be solved with a numerical method in the probability domain of snow depth versus snow density.",

The system can be fed using any source of time varying vector fields, such as hydrodynamic models. The cases used here, the Indian Ocean (HYCOM), the Wadden Sea (Delft3D Curvilinear), San Francisco Bay (3Di subgrid and Delft3D Flexible Mesh), show that the method used is suitable for different time and spatial scales.\nHigh resolution numerical models become interactive paintings by exchanging their velocity fields with a high resolution (>=1M cells) image based flow visualization that runs in a html5 compatible web browser. The image based flow visualization combines three images into a new image: the current image, a drawing, and a uv + mask field. The advection scheme that computes the resultant image is executed in the graphics card using WebGL, allowing for 1M grid cells at 60Hz performance on mediocre graphic cards.\nThe software is provided as open source software.\nBy using different sources for a drawing one can gain insight into several aspects of the velocity fields.

            "abstract": "Geodesy, the science of determining Earth’s shape, gravity field and rotation, has been in existence for millennia. Today, few geoscientists identify with the pure science of geodesy, though many use geodetic tools and data for their research. In 2014, we interviewed members of the UNAVCO community and asked, “Do you call yourself a geodesist?” Most replied that they used geodesy, but would call themselves “geophysicists”. This “use of geodesy” for other fields of study, particularly for geophysics-related fields, is consistent with an analysis of AGU’s sections and focus groups. Additional analysis of geoscience departments at U.S. universities would suggest a similar trend.\nThe expanding use of geodetic tools and geodetic data for many fields of research such as geophysics, tectonophysics, geodynamics, space physics, geology, geomorphology, seismology, hydrology, volcanology, glaciology, paleontology, paleoseismology, structural geology, meteorology, ecology, archaeology, oceanography, geography, soil science, atmospheric science, and snow science, may provide an approach to bringing diverse fields together under the moniker of geoscience and geoscientists. Scientists using a shared approach to research and education might be able to see themselves under the broader identity of geoscientist. The hurdle to making this transformation towards a larger shared voice in public discourse, is the more common use of “geophysicist” among the geodesy community, which is tied to the strong foundation of physics and mathematics needed to work with geodetic data and tools.",

Coupling to the stratosphere via planetary waves has significant impacts on the tropospheric circulation of both hemispheres and it is important to understand which coupled climate models can reproduce this phenomenon. A dynamical metric based on extreme stratospheric planetary-scale wave heat flux events, defined as the 10th and 90th percentiles of the daily high-latitude wave-1 heat flux distribution at 50hPa, developed for the Northern Hemisphere is applied to the Southern Hemisphere. Extreme negative (positive) heat flux events occur with a strengthening (weakening) of the Southern Ocean jet and anomalously warm (cool) temperatures over the Amundsen Sea. The metric is used to evaluate troposphere-stratosphere coupling in models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and compare their performance across hemispheres. Some models, mostly low-top models, are found to have a degraded representation of stratospheric extremes. A large bias in the wave-2 and -3 tropospheric geopotential height eddy climatology of the CMIP5 models masks the effect of stratosphere-troposphere planetary wave coupling on the climatology. After removing the climatalogy, it is shown that planetary wave coupling is linked to tropospheric temperature variability over the Amundsen Sea. Models which fail to capture the extremes in stratospheric heat flux, significantly under-estimate the magnitude of temperature anomalies over the Amundsen Sea Low.",

            "abstract": "Amazonia is a unique place to study the impact of anthropogenic emissions on atmospheric photochemistry, fueled by large inputs of solar radiation, humidity, biogenic emissions and turbulent mixing. In the wet season, thousands of km2 of Amazonian forest areas can be considered pristine, whereas in the dry season biomass burning emissions in regional scale add to picture. The Amazon region is also going through localized urban development, in particular, the Manaus city, with 2 million inhabitants. The GoAmazon2014/5 experiment seeks to understand the interactions between urban and biogenic emissions in Amazonia. The combination of biogenic volatile organic compounds and urban NOx emissions is expected to increase tropospheric O3 production, with impacts to the ecosystem and human health. To investigate this issue, surface O3 measurements were taken between Feb and Dec 2014 at two sites in Amazonia: T2, located in the outflow of the Manaus urban plume, and T3, sitting 60 km downwind of the city. The influence of the urban plume at T3 site was detected by a combination of typical ΔCN/ΔCO ratios, Hysplit backtrajectories and threshold concentrations of tracers such as particle number and black carbon. The transport from T2 to T3 typically lasted 7 hours. At T2, the O3 diurnal cycle showed a diurnal peak of 20 ppb in the wet season and of 35 ppb in the dry season, suggesting the contribution of regional biomass burning to O3 photochemical production. In the absence of urban or biomass burning emissions, O3 diurnal cycle at T3 showed a peak of 15 ppb, similar to observations taken in pristine forest areas in Amazonia. When the Manaus plume reached the T3 site in the afternoon, the diurnal O3 peak increased to 40 ppb, indicating a net O3 production rate of 3.6 ppb h-1 along this diurnal transport. When the Manaus plume reached the T3 site before sunrise, i.e., a transport during the night, the diurnal peak was anticipated and reached 25 ppb.",

Science, v.344, p.1500, 2014, ) have been used to infer temperatures of formation of methane gas. However, departures from thermodynamic equilibrium isotopic bond ordering will result from any fractionating process that do not include bond rupture and reformation, including mixing, diffusion, and kinetic processing. This is because the isotopic bond ordering no longer reflects the bulk isotopic composition once fractionation occurs. A direct measure of departures from thermodynamic equilibrium isotopic bond ordering in methane comes from both Δ12CH2D2 and Δ13CH3D in the same gas. Until now, this has not been possible due to instrumental limitations.\nWe have carried out measurements of Δ12CH2D2 and Δ13CH3D in methane gas mixtures using a unique, large-geometry double-focusing isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS), the Panorama, in order to investigate the usefulness of these two mass-18 isotopologues as tracers of mixing of methane sources. This instrument has a dispersion/magnification ratio, the parameter of merit for mass resolving power, of ~ 1400 mm that exceeds that of any other gas-source IRMS by more than 3.5x and is slightly larger than that for large-geometry SIMS instruments. With this geometry we routinely operate with mass resolving power (M/ΔM, 5% and 95%) of 40,000 or greater with useful sensitivity for isotope ratio analysis.\nFor these experiments we mixed two gases with bulk D/H differing by 100 ‰. The results follow theoretical expectations within uncertainties of 0.5 ‰ for Δ12CH2D2 and 0.1 ‰ for Δ13CH3D. Precision is sufficient to detect as little as 10% mixing in this system. This precision would also be capable of detecting subtle departures from equilibrium caused by diffusion and kinetic bond rupture (e.g. CH4 + OH).",

While this has been a productive strategy in increasing agricultural production and maintaining high yields, groundwater resources are depleting at a quicker rate than natural resources can replace. This issue gains relevance as climate variability concurrently adds to yearly fluctuations in farmer demand for irrigation each year, which can create high risk for farmers that depend on consistent yields, but do not have access to dwindling water resources. This study investigates variability in groundwater levels from 2005 to 2013 in relation to crop prices and production by analyzing district-level datasets made available through India’s government. Through this analysis, we show the impact of groundwater variability on price variability, crop yield, and production during these years. By examining this nine-year timescale, we extend our analysis to forthcoming years to demonstrate the increasing importance of groundwater resources in irrigation, and suggest strategies to reduce the impact of groundwater shortages on crop production and prices.",

Thus we have the familiar polar caps of \nEarth and Mars, but cold equatorial regions for planets with \nobliquities between 54 and 126 degrees. Furthermore, for \ntilts between 45-66 degrees and 114-135 degrees the minimum incident \nenergy occurs neither at the pole nor the equator. We find that the \nannual average insolation is always symmetric about Pluto's equator \nand is fully independent of the relative locations of the planet's \npericenter and equinoxes. Remarkably, this symmetry holds for \narbitrary orbital eccentricities and obliquities, and so we provide a \nshort proof in the margin of this abstract. \nThe current obliquity of Pluto is 119 degrees, giving it minima in \naverage annual insolation at +/- 27 degrees latitude, with ~1.5% more \nflux to the equator and ~15% more to the poles. But the obliquity of \nPluto also varies sinusoidally from 102-126 degrees and so, over the \npast million years, Pluto's annual equatorial and polar fluxes have changed \nby +15% and -13%, respectively. Interestingly, the energy flux \nreceived by latitudes between 25-35 degrees remains nearly constant \nover the presumably billions of years since Pluto acquired its current \norbit and spin properties. Thus these latitudes are continuously cold \nand should be favored for the long-term deposition of volatile ices; \nthe bright heart of Pluto, Sputnik Planum, extends not coincidentally \nacross these latitudes. \nReflected light and emitted thermal radiation from Charon increases \nannual insolation to one side of Pluto by of order 0.02%. Although \nsmall, the bulk of the energy is delivered at night to Pluto's cold \nequatorial regions. Furthermore, Charon's thermal IR is delivered very \nefficiently to icy deposits.

            "abstract": "Orogenic plateaus and their flanking ranges strongly impact regional and global hydrology, vegetation, and erosion patterns. In the last decade, reconstructions of the topographic evolution of plateaus and mountain belts have increasingly relied on leaf wax hydrogen isotope data (δDwax), a paleo-hydrology proxy obtained from organic material in sedimentary rocks. Today, the isotopic composition of precipitation and leaf waxes is influenced by orography, and sedimentary strata deposited during topographic growth in the geologic past may record this relationship. We use a multi-isotope-proxy approach with δDwax and δ13Cwax from the 4-km-high Andean Plateau (Pastos Grandes Basin - PGB, 24°38' S, 66°40' W) and a 2-km-high intermontane basin (Angastaco Basin, 25°41' S, 66°04' W) located farther east in the E Cordillera to separate potential influences and to decipher spatiotemporal patterns of (eco) hydrological changes during Tertiary topographic growth.\nThe PGB hosts folded sediments that span 9 to 2 Ma, and it has been an integral part of the Andean Plateau since at least 15 Ma. δDwax values in the PGB sediments record a decrease from -125 to -203 ‰ between 8.5 and 7.6 Ma, which coincides with the disappearance of red beds and evaporites. A similar, but less pronounced D-depletion from -107 to -144 ‰ is recorded by the Angastaco Basin sediments over the same time interval. We suggest that this regional signal may reflect the onset of moisture transport into this inherently dry region via the South American Low-Level Jet. Concurrently, δ13Cwax values on the plateau increased from -32.5 to -27.5 ‰ and reflect (eco) hydrological changes, while no such changes are observed in the Angastaco Basin. Subsequent folding of PGB strata documents continuous intrabasinal deformation until 2 Ma, with potential elevation gain within the plateau. δDwax values from the plateau increase from -218 to -152 ‰ over this time interval. Our observations suggest enhanced aridification in the plateau realm, whereas the Angastaco Basin and the eastern flank of the Andean Plateau transitioned into humid conditions, and subsequently back to semi-arid conditions and reduced moisture transport toward the orogen interior due to orographic barrier formation starting from ca. 6.5 Ma.",

            "abstract": "We will present our progress on the development of a wireless sensor network that will determine the source and rate of detected methane leaks. The targeted leak detection threshold is 2 g/min with a rate estimation error of 20% and localization error of 1 m within an outdoor area of 100 m2. The network itself is composed of low-cost, high-performance sensor nodes based on printed nanomaterials with expected sensitivity below 1 ppmv methane. High sensitivity to methane is achieved by modifying high surface-area-to-volume-ratio single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with materials that adsorb methane molecules. Because the modified SWNTs are not perfectly selective to methane, the sensor nodes contain arrays of variously-modified SWNTs to build diversity of response towards gases with adsorption affinity. Methane selectivity is achieved through advanced pattern-matching algorithms of the array’s ensemble response. The system is low power and designed to operate for a year on a single small battery. The SWNT sensing elements consume only microwatts. The largest power consumer is the wireless communication, which provides robust, real-time measurement data. Methane leak localization and rate estimation will be performed by machine-learning algorithms built with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas plume formation. This sensor system can be broadly applied at gas wells, distribution systems, refineries, and other downstream facilities. It also can be utilized for industrial and residential safety applications, and adapted to other gases and gas combinations.",

            "abstract": "The presence of pressurized air pockets in combined sewer systems is argued to produce geyser flows, which is an oscillating jetting of a mixture of gas-liquid flows through vertical shafts. A 1D numerical model is developed for predicting pressure and velocity oscillations of a compressed air-pocket in a vertical shaft which in turn attempts to simulate geyser like flows. The vertical shaft is closed at the bottom and open to ambient pressure at the top. Initially, the lower section of the vertical shaft is filled with compressed air and the upper section with water. The interaction between the pressurized air pocket and the water column in the vertical shaft exhibits an oscillatory motion of the water column that decays over time. The model accounts for steady and unsteady friction to estimate the energy dissipation. The model also includes the falling flow of water around the external perimeter of the pressurized air pocket by assuming that any expansion in the pressurized air pocket would result in the falling volume of water. The acceleration of air-water interface is predicted through a force balance between the pressurized air pocket and the water column combined with the Method of Characteristics that resolves pressure and velocity within the water column. The expansion and compression of the pressurized air pocket is assumed to follow either isothermal process or adiabatic process. Results for both assumptions; isothermal and adiabatic processes, are presented. The performance of the developed 1D numerical model is compared with that of a commercial 3D CFD model. Overall, a good agreement between both models is obtained for pressure and velocity oscillations. The paper will also present a sensitivity analysis of the 3D CFD model.",

It serves as a remote measurement station in the Amazon forest with continuous aerosol, trace gas, micrometeorological, and ecological measurements. During part of the rainy season, the atmospheric state approximates pre-industrial conditions, in strong contrast to the dry season, which is dominated by significant pollution from deforestation fires and urban emissions.\nThis presentation will focus on aerosol studies of the past three years. It aims to provide a brief overview of the characteristic seasonality of the aerosol burden at the ATTO site. Moreover, it will discuss the following key questions and current results of the ongoing observations: (i) During the wet season and in the absence of long-range advection of African aerosols, atmospheric conditions at the ATTO site approximate a pristine state, which reveals the genuine contribution of biogenic aerosols. Biogenic particles in the super- and submicron range have been observed and their properties as well as potential sources will be discussed. (ii) In contrast to the classical new particle formation, the occurrence of ultrafine particles is comparably sparse and mainly occurs as short ‘bursts’, indicating a rather localized character. Our current understanding of this phenomenon and its significance for the overall aerosol burden will be addressed. (iii) Aerosol absorptivity is mainly caused by black carbon, however, indications for the presence of other light absorbing aerosol species have been found. Current results on light absorbing aerosol under clean and polluted conditions will be presented. (iv) Aerosol particles at the ATTO site are typically strongly aged and comprise pronounced internal mixtures, with important implications for their properties. Microspectroscopic analysis helps to obtain insights into atmospheric processing and its impact on particle morphology and phase state.",

            "abstract": "The role that anthropogenic aerosols play in cloud formation is uncertain and contributes largely to the uncertainty in predicting future climate. One region of particular importance is the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for over half of the world’s rainforest. During GoAmazon2014/15 IOP2, aerosol samples were collected at multiple sites in and around the rapidly growing industrial city of Manaus in the Amazon basin. Manaus is of scientific interest due to the pristine nature of the surrounding rainforest and the high levels of pollution coming from the city in the form of SO2, NOx, and soot. Some sites, such as the Terrestrial Ecosystem Science center (TES, also designated ZF2) located to the north of Manaus, represent air masses which have not interacted with emissions from the city. The comparison of pristine atmosphere with heavy pollution allows both for the determination of a natural baseline level of pollutants, as well as the study of pollutant’s impact on the conversion of biogenic volatile organic compounds to secondary organic aerosols. Towards this goal, samples from ZF2 and other unpolluted sites will be compared to samples from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) climate research facility in Manacapuru (T3), which is southwest (downwind) of Manaus. Spatially resolved spectra were recorded at the sub-particle level using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) at the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen K-absorption edges. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) was also performed on to characterize higher Z elements. These two techniques together will allow for the mass fraction of atmospherically relevant elements to be determined on a per-particle basis. We will apply established procedures to determine the mixing state index for samples collected at ZF2 and T3 using elemental mass fractions. Preliminary results will be presented which focus on investigating the difference between mixing state indices of aerosol samples collected at these two sites, due to anthropogenic emissions. The ultimate goal is to use the mixing state index as a parameter which enables changes in the composition of aerosols to be modeled with more certainty as well enabling a quantification of the anthropogenic effects on natural rainforest atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "A network of ablation stakes has been maintained on the Austre Lovén glacier (Svalbard) over the last 8 years. Data collected thanks to this in-situ equipment served as a basis to obtain annual mass balance values. Interpolation methods were used to generalize the values measured at the stakes to the entire surface of the glacier (4.5km²). This allows for a precise quantification of the glacier’s dynamics including areas where data are not easy to collect directly on the field such as the glacier snout or steep accumulation zones.\nOver the last 4 years, repeat terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys have been undertaken twice a year. Scans were acquired at the end of the expected annual snow maximum (April) and near the end of the melting season (August). Even though these scans do not cover the entire glacier, they yield high density point clouds of the glacier surface in crucial areas. The glacier terminus, the equilibrium line area and accumulation cirques were among the zones specifically scanned.\nThe comparison of mass balance results derived from ablation stakes data and digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from TLS measurements allowed for an assessment of the quality and uncertainty of these methods. Local variability proves higher than initially expected, especially in key areas of the glacier having the greatest impact on the global balance. Even though the Austre Lovén glacier displays a seemingly smooth and homogeneous surface, local variations have to be taken into consideration. The potential consequences of this variability on the annual mass balance will be explored.",

            "abstract": "We present a thermochemical interpretation of the S-wave speed structure beneath Europe, as obtained from full waveform seismic tomography.\nThe European upper mantle is characterised by seismic wave speeds that are slower than the global average. However, especially low velocities (< 4.0 km/s) are seen beneath Iceland and other parts of the mid-Atlantic ridge, as well as beneath Iberia, reaching a maximum between 120-130 km. Using experimental data from mineral physics and statistical thermodynamic modelling, we seek to reconstruct the observed Vs distributions with appropriate thermochemical models. By working with a high-resolution tomography model in which the wave speed structure is given in terms of absolute rather than relative (% anomaly) velocities, we can in turn constrain absolute properties of the thermochemical structure rather than just the amplitude of lateral variations. Using Vs alone, in the absence of any other observable (e.g. Vp, density), it is difficult to constrain the chemical composition. This is because chemistry (C) and temperature (T) have sensitivities to Vs which trade off with each other. At the same time, we find that 3-D variations in chemical composition are required by the data in order to avoid unrealistically large temperature variations and over-interpretation of the seismic structure in terms of temperature.\nEven with taking into account mineral intrinsic anelasticity and allowing for the presence of fluids, it is very difficult to create sufficiently low velocities to fit the slowest regions of the tomography model, using simple variations in T or C. Doing so requires either extremely high temperatures or unfeasibly high attenuation. However, the slowest velocities can readily be modelled by including a few percent melt. Additionally the anisotropy structure in the slow regions is broadly compatible with predicted models of melt storage in the upper mantle. We discuss whether melt provides the most likely explanation for the slow regions, considering also the effect of more advanced anelasticity models such as “elastically accommodated grain boundary sliding”, recently suggested by Karato et al (2015).",

            "abstract": "ICESat-2 is NASA’s next-generation laser altimeter, designed to measure changes in ice sheet height and sea ice freeboard. Over the ice sheets, it will use a continuous repeat-track pointing strategy to ensure that it accurately measures elevation changes along a set of reference tracks. Over most of the area of Earth’s ice sheets, ICESat-2 will provide coverage with a track-to-track spacing better than ~3 km. The onboard ATLAS instrument will use a photon-counting approach to provide a global geolocated photon point cloud, which is then converted into surface-specific elevation data sets. In this presentation, we will outline our strategy for taking the low-level photon point cloud and turning it into measurements posted at 20 m along-track for a set of pre-defined reference points by (1) selecting groups of photon events (PEs) around each along-track point, (2) refining the initial PE selection by fitting selected PEs with an along-track segment model and eliminating outliers to the model, (3) applying histogram-based corrections to the surface height based on the residuals to the along-track segment model, (4) calculate error estimates based on estimates of relative contributions of signal and noise PEs to the observed PE count, and (5) determining the final location and surface height of the along-track segment. These measurements are then corrected for short-scale (100-200 m) across-track surface topography around the reference points to develop a time series of land ice heights. The resulting data products will allow us to measure ice sheet elevation change with a point-for-point accuracy of a few centimeters over Earth’s ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Improved Arcitc sea ice thickness projections AGU.pdf\nProjections of Arctic sea ice thickness (SIT) have the potential to inform stakeholders about accessibility to the region, but are currently rather uncertain. The latest suite of CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs) produce a wide range of simulated SIT in the historical period (1979–2014) and exhibit various spatial and temporal biases when compared with the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) sea ice reanalysis. We present a new method to constrain such GCM simulations of SIT to narrow projection uncertainty via a statistical bias correction technique. The bias correction successfully constrains the spatial SIT distribution and temporal variability in the CMIP5 projections whilst retaining the climatic fluctuations from individual ensemble members. The bias correction acts to reduce the uncertainty in projections of SIT and reveals the significant contributions of sea ice internal variability in the first half of the century and of scenario uncertainty from mid-century onwards. The projected date of ice-free conditions in the Arctic under the RCP8.5 high emission scenario occurs in the 2050s, which is a decade earlier than without the bias correction, with potentially significant implications for stakeholders in the Arctic such as the shipping industry. The bias correction methodology developed could be similarly applied to other variables to narrow uncertainty in climate projections more generally.",

            "abstract": "In addition to nominal grid observation, TANSO-FTS onboard GOSAT has functionality of target observations using agile pointing mechanism, which are scheduled and modified daily bases. At the beginning, target observations were limited to calibration and validation sites but now for large emission sources such as mega cities, oil field, landfill, and volcano. Towards emission inventory, combination of satellite, airplane and ground-based observations are essential. Generally large emission sources have thick aerosol and their topographies are not flat. For custom target observations of limited data set during the observation campaigns, satellite data processing must be quick and light. We had used RemoTeC algorithm for Level 1 algorithm for end (interferogram) to end (XCO2 and XCH4) test purposed. Now we apply its tunable functions to target observations. RemoTeC uses metrology surface pressure as an input in order to maximize retrievable aerosol parameters. In the operational RemoTeC retrieval, the ERA-Interim dataset, which is a global atmospheric reanalysis data with 80km spatial resolution and with 60 vertical levels from surface up to 0.1hPa provided by ECMWF, is applied as meteorology dataset. These dataset is published with charge free, and will be available about 3 months later from observation time. To quick validation between GOSAT observation and others within short time delay, NCEP FNL Operational Model Global Tropospheric Analyses dataset is newly applied. The special resolution and vertical levels of NCEP FNL data are 1degree x 1degree and 26, respectively. The spatial and vertical resolutions are coarser than that of ECWMF products, but the time delay from observation period is less. To characterize the biases of XCO2 and XCH4, and the accuracy of retrieval with NCEP meteorology dataset, over Lamont data are compared during June 2009 to March 2011. The results present clearly that the retrieved XCO2 with NCEP dataset have around -0.37 ppm systematic bias against that with ECMWF dataset. In contrast, the agreement between NCEP based XCH4 and ECMWF based XCH4 is good as well as CHI2. Within a few days from observation time period, these retrieved data provide us XCO2 and XCH4 products with scatter of 2.09 ppm and 14.1 ppb, respectively.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Sadeghi et al (2015) - AGU RS.pdf\nA recently developed physically-based model to retrieve soil moisture from optical images was evaluated in this study. The model was derived based on a simple two-flux radiative transfer model describing diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The model exhibited an unprecedented linear relationship between a novel transformed reflectance and the surface soil moisture in the shortwave infrared bands such as bands 6 and 7 of Landsat 8. Accuracy of the model was tested based on laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of a broad range of Arizona soils in the optical domain (400 – 2500 nm). Additionally, the original model was further simplified by combining bands 6 and 7 data which reduced the number of model parameters from two to one. The remaining physically-significant parameter was directly measured for the Arizona soils, exhibiting little variability among those varied soil textures. New findings in this study significantly advance this new method toward its application without the need for ground-based model calibration. Further study of potentials and limitations of this model for large-scale application using optical satellite data (e.g. Landsat, MODIS) remains a goal of future research.",

            "abstract": "Water quality observations are usually not available on a continuous basis because of the expensive cost and labor requirements so calibrating and validating a mechanistic model is often difficult. Further, any model predictions inherently have bias (i.e., under/over estimation) and require techniques that preserve the long-term mean monthly attributes. This study suggests and compares two multivariate bias-correction techniques to improve the performance of the SWAT model in predicting daily streamflow, TN Loads across the southeast based on split-sample validation. The first approach is a dimension reduction technique, canonical correlation analysis that regresses the observed multivariate attributes with the SWAT model simulated values. The second approach is from signal processing, importance weighting, that applies a weight based off the ratio of the observed and model densities to the model data to shift the mean, variance, and cross-correlation towards the observed values. These procedures were applied to 3 watersheds chosen from the Water Quality Network in the Southeast Region; specifically watersheds with sufficiently large drainage areas and number of observed data points. The performance of these two approaches are also compared with independent estimates from the USGS LOADEST model. Uncertainties in the bias-corrected estimates due to limited water quality observations are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Charge exchange between ions and neutral atoms plays a major role in the solar wind (SW) interaction with the local interstellar medium (LISM). Charge exchange in front of the heliopause is known to produce a hydrogen wall. So-called neutral SW is due to charge exchange of the LISM hydrogen atoms with the SW protons in the supersonic region. Another population of neutral H atoms is born in the inner heliosheath – the region between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause. It is well- known that secondary H atoms can affect the LISM flow at large distances from the heliopause. As a result, this flow can become subfast magnetosonic and the conditions necessary for the formation of a bow shock are not satisfied. We present a more quantitative description of this effect using adaptive mesh refinement MHD simulations involving a kinetic treatment of the H atom transport throughout the heliosphere. The main result is that the traditional meaning of a bow shock is no longer valid for realistic LISM properties. More precisely, the contribution of a shock transition to the overall change of plasma quantities across the outer heliosheath (OHS) is minor (20-25%) even for the unperturbed interstellar magnetic field strength of 2.5 microG. For the field strength of 3 microG, the contribution of a shock transition is only a few per cent, while the LISM flow is still superfast magnetosonic. It is therefore clear that no analysis of the unperturbed LISM flow is able to answer the question about the exact contribution of a shock transition. Moreover, for all realistic purposes the distribution of quantities in the OHS may be considered as nearly smooth and only the width of the transition depends on the LISM properties.",

Gas and water data have been collected at 25 monitoring sites on 10 of the highest-risk volcanoes in the Cascade Range. These sites include summit-fumarole groups and springs/streams that show clear evidence of magmatic influence in the form of high 3He/4He ratios and (or) large fluxes of magmatic CO2 or heat. The monitoring data are intended to (1) be suitable for comparison with other continuous geophysical monitoring data and (2) provide baseline data that will be useful during future episodes of volcanic unrest. Site records consist mainly of hourly temperature and (or) hydrothermal solute flux data spanning multiple years. Many of the hydrothermal time series data show considerable variability during quiescent periods, including diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual variability. Having established baseline conditions, we are reducing our monitoring frequency, and data are being archived and analyzed with a view to providing useful and succinct summaries of baseline behavior during quiescent periods. The hydrothermal response to recent (November 2014 to present) unrest at Lassen Volcanic Center demonstrates the utility of long-term background data, which has made it straightforward to isolate symptoms of unrest.",

In this work, we include the effects of an external static magnetic field. Previous studies have shown that the magnetic field has a great influence on the electron motion at higher altitudes, e.g. Lehtinen et al., 1997, and Gurevich et al., 1996. This result proves important when studying phenomena such as Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes, and their effects on the upper atmosphere. Therefore, electron avalanche rates, feedback rates, and electron energy distribution functions will be analyzed and compared to the results of previous studies that did not include a magnetic field. The runaway electron avalanche model (REAM) is a Monte Carlo code that simulates the generation, interactions, and propagation of relativistic runaway electrons in air [Dwyer, 2003, 2004, 2007]. We use this simulation for varying strengths and angles between the electric and magnetic fields to calculate avalanche lengths and angular distribution functions of the relativistic runaway electrons. We will also show electron distribution functions in momentum space. Finally, we will discuss the important regimes for which the magnetic field becomes significant in studying the properties of runaway electron avalanches and relativistic feedback.",

We demonstrate that reconnection leads to a nonthermally dominated particle acceleration for both electrons and protons with a power-law energy distribution in the nonrelativistic low-β regime but not in the high-β regime. A guiding-center current description is used to reveal the role of particle drift motions during the bulk nonthermal energization. We find that the main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-type acceleration accomplished by the particle curvature drift motion along the electric field induced by the reconnection outflows. Although the acceleration mechanism is similar for different plasma β regime, the reconnection in the low-β regime drives much faster particle energization because of the faster Alfvénic outflows. The nonthermally dominated acceleration resulting from magnetic reconnection in the low-β regime may have strong implications to the highly efficient particle acceleration in solar flares and other astrophysical systems.",

Together these data provide complementary metrics quantifying available plant water supply. We use these data to investigate the supply changes from water components at different depth in relation to satellite based vegetation metrics, including vegetation greenness (NDVI) measures from MODIS and related higher order productivity (GPP) before, during and following the major drought events observed in the continental US for the past 14 years. We observe consistent trends and significant correlations between monthly time series of TWS, SM, NDVI and GPP. We study how changes in atmosphere moisture stress and coupling of water storage components at different depth impact on the spatial and temporal correlation between TWS, SM and vegetation metrics. In Texas, we find that surface SM and GRACE TWS agree with each other in general, and both capture the underlying water supply constraints to vegetation growth. Triggered by a transit increase in precipitation following the 2011 hydrological drought, vegetation productivity in Texas shows more sensitivity to surface SM than TWS. In the Great Plains, the correspondence between TWS and vegetation productivity is modulated by temperature-induced atmosphere moisture stress and by the coupling between surface soil moisture and groundwater through irrigation.",

At Canterbury University's Mt. John University Observatory on the south island of New Zealand, in clear sky, we used our POETS frame-transfer CCD at 10 Hz with GPS timing on the 1-m McLellan telescope as well as an infrared camera on an 0.6-m telescope and three-color photometry at a slower cadence on a second 0.6-m telescope. The light curves show a central flash, indicating that we were close to the center of the occultation path, and allowing us to explore Pluto's atmosphere lower than usual. The light curves show that Pluto's atmosphere remained robust. Observations from 0.5- and 0.4-m telescopes at the Auckland Observatory gave the first half of the occultation before clouds came in. We coordinated our observations with aircraft observations with NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and its High Speed Imaging Photometer for Occultations (HIPO). Our ground-based and airborne stellar-occultation effort came only just over two weeks of Earth days and two Pluto days (based on Pluto's rotational period) before the flyby of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, meaning that the mission's exquisite snapshot of Pluto's atmosphere can be placed in the context of our series of ground-based occultation observations carried out on a regular basis since 2002 following a first Pluto occultation observed in 1988 from aloft.

In order to explore the influence of RSL change on the stratigraphic record, we conducted three physical experiments which shared identical boundary conditions but differed in their RSL characteristics. Specifically, the three experiments differed with respect to two non-dimensional numbers that compare the magnitude and periodicity of RSL cycles to the spatial and temporal scales of autogenic processes, respectively. The magnitude of RSL change is quantified with H*, defined as the peak to trough difference in RSL during a cycle divided by a system’s maximum autogenic channel depth. The periodicity of RSL change is quantified with T*, defined as the period of RSL cycles divided by the time required to deposit one channel depth of sediment, on average, everywhere in the basin. Experiments performed included: 1) a control experiment lacking RSL cycles, used to define a system’s autogenics, 2) a high magnitude, high frequency RSL cycles experiment, and 3) a low magnitude, low frequency cycles experiment. We observe that the high magnitude, high frequency experiment resulted in the thickest channel bodies with the lowest width-to-depth ratios, while the low magnitude, long period experiment preserves a record of gradual shoreline transgression and regression producing facies that are the most continuous in space. We plan to integrate our experimental results with Delft3D numerical experiments models that sample similar non-dimensional characteristics of RSL cycles. Quantifying the influence of RSL change, normalized as a function of the spatial and temporal scales of autogenic processes will strengthen our ability to predict stratigraphic architecture and invert stratigraphy for paleo-environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Magnetized rocks can record the history of a planet’s magnetic field, a key constraint for understanding interior evolution. From orbital vector magnetic field measurements of Mercury taken by the MESSENGER spacecraft at altitudes below 150 km, we have detected fields indicative of crustal magnetization. Fields from non-crustal sources, which dominate the observations even at low altitudes, were estimated and subtracted from the observations using both magnetospheric models and signal filtering. The resulting high-pass filtered fields have amplitudes of a few to 20 nT. The first low-altitude signals were detected over the Suisei Planitia region and were confirmed by upward continuation to be of crustal origin. At least some contribution from thermoremanent magnetization is required to account for these signals, and we infer a lower bound on the average age of magnetization of 3.7–3.9 Ga on the basis of correlation of crustal magnetic fields with volcanic units of that age range. Ancient field strengths that range from those similar to Mercury’s present dipole field to Earth-like values are consistent with the magnetic field observations and with the low iron content of Mercury’s crust derived from MESSENGER elemental composition data. Here, we extend these initial results with observations obtained at spacecraft altitudes below 60 km at all body-fixed longitudes from ~40°N to ~75°N. The strongest crustal fields occur in the region 120°E to 210°E, and weaker signals characterize the northern volcanic plains. We test the hypothesis that the longest-wavelength crustal field signals in this region reflect magnetization contrasts between the Caloris basin and the surrounding intercrater plains and circum-Caloris plains. We report the spatial distribution of observed crustal fields, together with magnetization models derived from them and the implications of these models, particularly for the depth distribution of sources compatible with the observations.",

            "abstract": "The Eocene was a tectonically and volcanically complex time in the Pacific Northwest, characterized by regional extension, rapid uplift, widespread magmatism, and a high thermal flux. Extension was manifested by core complex formation, normal faulting, and dike emplacement, the latter represented by the 48 Ma Teanaway swarm (TS), 53-46 Ma dikes associated with the Colville Igneous Complex (CIC), the 46.6 Ma Corbaley Canyon swarm (CCS), and a previously unstudied cluster near Lake Chelan (LC) that is the focus of this study.\nLC dikes generally strike NW, range up to 8m in width, and are compositionally diverse with a general NE-ward increase in SiO2 (47-84 wt. % SiO2) over a distance of ~120 km. All dikes display arc affinities (calc-alkaline, HFSE depletions) but can be divided into two suites: (1) basalt-andesite-dacite-rhyolite (BADR), and (2) adakites (Sr/Y > 40, La/YbN > 10, Sr > 350ppm, Y < 18ppm, Yb < 1.8ppm). Sr and Nd isotopic data (87Sr/86Sri = 0.70360 – 0.70530; εNd(t) = +4.45 to -1.92) for the two suites overlap, suggesting both are mixtures of material from depleted mantle and older crustal sources. We suggest LC basalt dikes represent mantle-derived magmas that drove melting of thick arc crust, generating adakite melts from an eclogite lower crust and, at shallower depths, andesite-rhyolite melts from a combination of fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation/melting.\nLC dikes share chemical similarities with volcanic rocks of the CIC and CCS including calc-alkaline trends and compositions that range from basalt to rhyolite. The TS dikes however, are distinctly different in chemical composition (tholeiitic, dominantly basaltic andesites), Sr-Nd isotopic composition, and orientation (NW-striking). Ongoing U-Pb dating of LC dikes should help to determine the extent to which changes in dike chemistry and orientation are temporal or spatial or both.",

If not only sonar echo intensity (squared magnitude of acoustic pressure) but also the cross-correlation between successive echoes is measured, then temporal changes in sound speed in the near-bottom environment can be determined. This, in turn, allows estimation of the change of environmental parameters, e.g. temperature variations, as there is a simple linear relationship between sound speed and temperature changes. Stochastic modeling shows that the dependence of the echo decorrelation on the lag time has a relationship with the statistics of temperature variations above the seabed that determine their spatial and temporal scales, power spectra, and structure functions. This approach has been applied to quantify the bottom diffuse hydrothermal flow activity at the Main Endeavour Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge using the Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar (COVIS) connected to the Ocean Network Canada’s NEPTUNE observatory. In contrast to our previous work, which was focused on spatial imaging of acoustic decorrelation at fixed lag, here the lag dependence of the acoustic structure function is measured and analyzed. This allows extraction of additional parameters of temperature fluctuation statistics. A potential to map diffuse flow using a ROV/HOV is discussed.",

To reliably infer ecosystem driver-response relationships, two contradicting requirements need to be considered: Both types of observations should be representative of the same target area while minimally impacting each other. For this purpose, a simple model was created that determines an optimal area for collocating plot-based manual field sampling activities with respect to the automated measurements.\nThe maximum and minimum distances of the collocation areas were determined from the instrument source area distribution function in combination with sampling densities and a threshold, respectively. Specifically, the maximum distance was taken as the extent from within which 90% of the value observed by an instrument is sourced. Sampling densities were then generated through virtually distributing activity-specific impact estimates across the instrument source area. The minimum distance was determined as the position closest to the instrument location where the sampling density falls below a threshold that ensures <10% impact on the source area informing the instrument measurements. At most sites, a 30m minimum distance ensured minimal impact of manual field sampling on instrument measurements, however, sensitive sites (e.g., tundra) required a larger minimum distance.\nTo determine how the model responds to uncertainties in its inputs, a numerical sensitivity analysis was conducted based on multivariate error distributions that retain the covariance structure. In 90% of all cases, the model was shown to be robust against 10% (1 σ) deviations in its inputs, continuing to yield a minimum distance of 30 m. For the remaining 10% of all cases, preliminary results suggest a prominent dependence of the minimum distance on climate decomposition index, which we use here as a proxy for the sensitivity of an environment to disturbance.",

In many states in the US detailed river geometry has been collected for floodplain mapping and is available in Flood Risk Information Systems (FRIS). In particular, North Carolina has, for its 100 Counties, developed a database of numerous HEC-RAS models which are available through its Flood Risk Information System (FRIS). These models that include over 260 variables were developed and updated by numerous contractors. They contain detailed surveyed or LiDAR derived cross-sections and modeled flood extents for different extreme event return periods. In this work, over 4700 HEC-RAS models’ data was integrated and upscaled to utilize detailed cross-section information and 100-year modelled flood extent information to enable river restoration prioritization for the entire state of North Carolina. We developed procedures to extract geomorphic properties such as entrenchment ratio, incision ratio, etc. from these models. Entrenchment ratio quantifies the vertical containment of rivers and thereby their vulnerability to flooding and incision ratio quantifies the depth per unit width. A map of entrenchment ratio for the whole state was derived by linking these model results to a geodatabase. A ranking of highly entrenched counties enabling prioritization for flood allowance and mitigation was obtained. The results were shared through HydroShare and web maps developed for their visualization using Google Maps Engine API.",

            "abstract": "Depending on the metallicity of the protoplanetary disk, the details of gas accretion during planetary formation, and atmospheric loss during planetary evolution, the atmospheres of sub-Jupiter-sized planets could exhibit a variety of bulk compositions. Examples include hydrogen-dominated atmospheres like Jupiter, more metal-rich atmospheres like Neptune, evaporated atmospheres dominated by helium, or of course carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen, and other heavy molecules as exhibited by terrestrial planets in the solar system. Here we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets using an idealized three-dimensional general circulation model (GCM). Composition—in particular, the molecular mass and specific heat—affect the sound speed, gravity wave speeds, atmospheric scale height, and Rossby deformation radius, and therefore in principle can exert significant controls on the atmospheric circulation, including the day-night temperature difference and other observables. We performed numerous simulations exploring a wide range of molecular masses and molar specific heats. The effect of molecular weight dominates. We found that a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal light curve, and a narrower equatorial super-rotating jet that occurs in a deeper atmosphere. The zonal-mean zonal wind is smaller and more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. If the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar specific heat will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere. We are also working on analytical theories to explain aspects of the simulations relevant for possible observables on tidally locked exoplanets, such as the day-night temperature difference, thermal phase shift and root-mean-square of the wind speed. Our analytical predictions are quantitatively compared with our numerical simulations and may provide potential indicators for determining the atmospheric compositions in future observations.",

            "abstract": "Heinrich events are characterized by episodic iceberg discharge events from the Laurentide ice sheet via the Hudson Strait Ice Stream (HSIS) and into the North Atlantic. Although their occurrence throughout late Pleistocene glaciations has been well documented in the oceanic sediment record, the triggering mechanism for Heinrich events is still poorly understood. Recent work (Marcott et al., 2011) has shown that subsurface ocean (~1200 m) warming in response to a shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could lead to accelerated melting and destabilization of an ice shelf fronting the Laurentide Ice Sheet and subsequently trigger Heinrich events. However, evidence for this subsurface warming remains restricted to one core site. Here we use Labrador Sea cores HU2001043-008pc/twc and HU2006040-006pc from the Flemish Cap and Hamilton Spur, respectively, to assess spatial and depth coverage of this signal. We infer surface and subsurface temperature variability using δ18O in benthic and planktic foraminifera. We also develop a corresponding suite of other sediment core proxies in order to identify Heinrich layers, including X-Ray Fluorescence, Ca/Sr, and % dolomite/calcite data. This research will allow us to evaluate changes in the thermodynamic structure of the Labrador basin due to changes in the strength of the AMOC and their relation to Heinrich events. Results will be used to substantiate existing research and coupled ocean-atmospheric models that suggest a reduced AMOC and associated subsurface warming as the trigger for Heinrich events.",

The study examines changes in GMST from 1860 to present with particular attention focused on two time periods: 1998 to 2012, the time of the so-called global warming hiatus and 1979 to 2010, a three decade span for which researchers have attempted to quantify the human influence on GMST. We will show that the existence of the global warming hiatus depends on which dataset is used to define GMST: in our model framework there is little or no global warming hiatus upon use of either the recent NOAA record for GMST (Karl et al., 2015) or the use of a revision to the CRU4 dataset suggested by Cowtan and Way (2014). Next, we show that humans have been responsible for 0.13±0.06°C/decade rise in GMST during the past three decades (1979 to 2010), considerably less than the rise in GMST attributed to humans over this same time period (0.17±0.01°C/decade) by Foster and Rahmstorf (2011). We suggest this prior study obtained an erroneously high value due to their neglect of the influence of variations in the strength of the AMOC on global climate. Finally, we’ll provide projections of GMST over the next four decades based on the rise in greenhouse gases (GHGs) given in the four Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios of IPCC AR5. These projections include detailed quantitative assessments of the sensitivity of global warming to the efficiency of ocean heat export, resulting in a probability distribution function of future GMST for each RCP scenario.",

The only time hydraulic tests are performed is when drilling encounters a large-transmissivity zone as evidenced by a large loss (or high return) of drilling fluid. The present paper proposes a new approach, that of conducting Flowing Fluid Electric Conductivity (FFEC) logging during the drilling period, with negligible impact on drilling schedule, yet providing important and accurate information on depth locations of both high- and low-transmissivity zones and their in-situ hydraulic conductivities. The information can be used to guide downhole fluid sampling and post-drilling detailed testing of the borehole. The proposed method has been applied to the drilling of a 2500-m borehole at Åre, Northern Sweden, which was initiated on April 28 and completed on August 26, 2014, with 99% core recovery. This borehole, named COSC-1, was drilled as part of the Swedish Scientific Deep Drilling COSC project, where COSC stands for Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides. The project is a multidisciplinary project with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of mountain belt dynamics in the Scandinavian Caledonides. Scientific investigations which include a range of topics from studies of ancient orogeny to the present-day hydrological cycle are conducted under six working groups: (1) tectonics, (2) geophysics, (3) geothermics, (4) hydrology, (5) microbiology and (6) drilling management and technology. In this talk, the new approach to hydrologic testing during the drilling period will be described and its application to the drilling of COSC-1 borehole presented.

            "abstract": "Land is an increasingly scarce global resource that is subject to competing pressures from agriculture, human settlement, and energy development. As countries concerned about climate change seek to decarbonize their power sectors, renewable energy sources like wind and solar offer obvious advantages. However, the land needed for new energy infrastructure is also an important environmental consideration. The land requirement of different electricity sources varies considerably, but there are very few studies that offer a normalized comparison. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to calculate the land-use intensity (LUI) of the following electricity generation sources: wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), hydropower, geothermal, nuclear, biomass, natural gas, and coal. We used data from existing studies as well as original data gathered from public records and geospatial analysis. Our land-use metric includes land needed for the generation facility (e.g., power plant or wind farm) as well as the area needed to mine fuel for natural gas, coal, and nuclear power plants. Our results found the lowest total LUI for nuclear power (115 ha/TWh/y) and the highest LUI for biomass (114,817 ha/TWh/y). Solar PV and CSP had a considerably lower LUI than wind power, but both were an order of magnitude higher than fossil fuels (which ranged from 435 ha/TWh/y for natural gas to 579 ha/TWh/y for coal). Our results suggest that a large build-out of renewable electricity, though it would offer many environmental advantages over fossil fuel power sources, would require considerable land area. Among low-carbon energy sources, relatively compact sources like nuclear and solar have the potential to reduce land requirements.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the Asian Monsoon driven by Tibetan Plateau uplift have been invoked to explain late Miocene–Pliocene biological turnover and increases in erosion and sediment accumulation. However, documentation of pre-Miocene uplift of the plateau and evidence for early appearance of the Asian Monsoon system has called these conclusions into question. We present a high-resolution, long-term record of environmental change at 3.5-4.5 km essential to understanding the impact and causes of monsoon variation. The O and C isotopic record of authigenic carbonate in 566 samples from the Zhada Basin extends from 8.99 to 1.75 Ma. Both the δ18O and stratigraphic record indicate long-term changes in basin hydrology which may reflect the impact of regional tectonics on drainage reorganization. These long-term changes are characterized by an onset of lacustrine deposition coupled with an increase in mean δ18O values at 6.11 Ma followed by a return to palustrine/fluvial deposition and a decrease in mean δ18O values at 3.24 Ma. These Miocene-early Pleistocene Zhada Basin results mimic late Pleistocene–Holocene paleoclimatic records across the Tibetan Plateau suggesting similar driving mechanisms.\nFrequency analysis of the δ18O record reveals that Milankovitch cycles are recorded in the Zhada Basin; suggesting that insolation-driven climate change drove high-frequency environmental changes in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Counterintuitively, non-stationary frequency analysis of the δ18O record indicates strengthening in the 100 kyr (eccentricity) band: coincident with initial onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation, but ~2.4 Myr prior to strengthening in the marine record. The discrepancy between marine and high-elevation records suggests that changes in the character of the ISM may be responding to cooling in the Pacific Ocean, and may be responsible for widespread mid-Pliocene changes observed on the peripheries of the Tibetan Plateau.",

In order to compensate for technique-specific weaknesses, four different space-geodetic observing systems are currently exploited for the realization of the ITRF. The connection between the different technique networks is provided by local ties measured at co-located ground sites.\nThis work addresses the potential of combining two of the currently used techniques, namely theGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), exploiting their space tie. This approach is based on the SLR tracking of GNSS satellites equipped withretroreflector arrays, as it allows determining the spacecraft orbit by means of both the optical and the microwave signals.

            "abstract": "The 11 March 2011 Tohoku megathrust earthquake ruptured through the shallowest part of the subduction zone boundary, resulting in tens of meters of displacement at the seafloor. This extreme shallow slip generated a devastating tsunami. The elastic properties of off-fault materials have an important role in determining slip along a fault. Laboratory ultrasonic velocity measurements performed on samples of rock obtained from the area surrounding the Tohoku earthquake principal fault zone during the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST) have shown that shallow off-fault materials are extremely compliant – P-wave velocities of 2.0-2.4 km/s, S-wave velocities of 0.7-1.0 km/s, and shear moduli ranging from 1.0-2.2 GPa. Seismic imaging around the JFAST drill site corroborates the presence of a weak, low-velocity frontal prism at the toe of the hanging wall. This compliant wedge is likely a fairly robust feature across the horizontal extent of the Japan Trench and may have contributed to the large amount of displacement recorded. In order to investigate the impact of weak off fault materials on earthquake rupture and tsunamigenesis, we employ a 2-D finite difference method that models the full seismic and tsunami wavefield associated with dynamic rupture on a dipping fault in a heterogeneous medium. Our numerical method rigorously couples the elastodynamic response of the solid Earth to that of a compressible ocean in the presence of gravity. Preliminary results of Tohoku-like models indicate that the presence of compliant off-fault elastic materials leads to greatly increased slip velocity, slip, and seafloor deformation.",

This large C pool may be attributed to a large fraction of NPP allocated belowground to crowns and roots and a high root:shoot ratio. Analyzing climate change effects on grass crowns, roots, and soil organic C (SOC) may aid in understanding and predicting the fate of grassland soil C, which is critical, as grassland soils may shift from C sinks to C sources with climate change.\nTo assess climate change effects on belowground grassland C we analyzed species- and community-level 1) crown and root biomass, 2) root chemistry, morphology, and decomposition, and 3) root-induced priming of SOC following seven years of Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) in Wyoming, USA. We sampled plants and soil from five replicate plots of four field treatments; ambient, warmed, elevated CO2, and combined warmed and elevated CO2. We found the sedge, Carex eleocharis, had greater root biomass under elevated CO2 and greater crown biomass under warming with elevated CO2, suggesting it may become a more prominent species in this semi-arid grassland. Furthermore, for Pascopyrum smithii we found longer and thinner roots under elevated CO2 and positive, linear relationships between root length, surface area, and root C, indicating a resource-acquisition strategy under elevated CO2 for this species. Across field treatments, adding P. smithii roots to soil induced short-term, negative SOC priming and reduced cumulative SOC decomposition by 10.7%. This indicates potential, future SOC sequestration; however, applying laboratory results to the field is multifaceted because of other factors, such as fluctuations in precipitation, temperature, and plant and microbial composition, in the field. The unique belowground species- and community-level trait responses to climate change suggest shifts in plant community composition may be important for understanding the fate of C in this semi-arid grassland.",

In this study, we applied dynamical process network (DPN) approach combined with eco-climate system sensitivity model and used the global FLUXNET eddy covariance measurements (subdaily net ecosystem exchange of CO2, air temperature, and precipitation) to access eco-climate system sensitivity to climate and biophysical factors at the flux site level. For the first time, eco-climate system sensitivity was estimated at the global flux sites and extrapolated to all possible land covers by employing artificial neural network approach and using the MODIS phenology and land cover products, the long-term climate GLDAS-2 product, and the GMTED2010 Global Grid elevation dataset. We produced the seasonal eco-climate system DPN maps, which revealed how global carbon dynamics driven by temperature and precipitation. We also found that the eco-climate system dynamical process structures are more sensitive to temperature, whether directly or indirectly via phenology. Interestingly, if temperature continues rising, the temperature-NEE coupling may increase in tropical rain forest areas while decrease in tropical desert or Savanna areas, which means that rising temperature in the future could lead to more carbon sequestration in tropical forests whereas less carbon sequestration in tropical drylands. At the same time, phenology showed a positive effect on the temperature-NEE coupling at all pixels, which suggests increased greenness may increase temperature driven carbon dynamics and consequently carbon sequestration globally. Precipitation showed relatively strong influence on the precipitation-NEE coupling, especially indirectly via phenology. This study has the potential to conduct eco-climate system short-term and long-term forecasting.",

Most of the predictions that have been made about reconnection on the MHD and ion scales have been confirmed and new questions posed, particularly at smaller scales. MMS is designed to probe reconnection down to the smallest scales possible thereby allowing the assessment of electron-scale pressure gradients and inertial effects as possible important drivers of magnetic reconnection. Multipoint measurements of 3D electric and magnetic fields and plasma distributions at the required spatial resolution are required along with plasma waves, energetic particles and ion composition to open this new window on reconnection and solve its remaining mysteries. With a wide range of new and vastly improved measurements at 4 locations with separations down to 10 km, MMS is fully operational and nearing the dayside magnetopause where its exploration begins.

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a fundamental state variable that provides the water necessary for plant growth and evapotranspiration. Soil moisture has been extensively studied in the context of bare surface soils and root zones. Less attention has focused on the effects of sparse vegetation distributions, such as those typical of agricultural cropland and other natural surface environments, on soil moisture dynamics. The current study explores root zone, bulk soil, and near-surface atmosphere interactions in terms of soil moisture under different distributions of sparse vegetation using multi-scale laboratory experimentation and numerical simulation. This research is driven by the need to advance our fundamental understanding of soil moisture dynamics in the context of improving water conservation and next generation heat and mass transfer numerical models. Experimentation is performed in a two-dimensional 7.3 m long intermediate scale soil tank interfaced with a climate-controlled wind tunnel, both of which are outfitted with current sensor technologies for measuring atmospheric and soil variables. The soil tank is packed so that a sparsely vegetated soil is surrounded by bulk bare soil; the two regions are separated by porous membranes to isolate the root zone from the bulk soil. Results show that in the absence of vegetation, evaporation rates vary along the soil tank in response to longitudinal changes in humidity; soil dries fastest upstream where evaporation rates are highest. In the presence of vegetation, soil moisture in the bulk soil closest to a vegetated region decreases more rapidly than the bulk soil farther away. Evapotranspiration rates in this region are also higher than the bulk soil region. This study is the first step towards the development of more generalized models that account for non-uniformly distributed vegetation and land surfaces exhibiting micro-topology.",

Geoscience related job growth is expected to steeply climb in the United States, however many of these positions will be left unfilled. One untapped population of Americans is ethnic minorities, who have historically been underrepresented in the geosciences. In 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that black and Hispanics only make 8.1% of geoscience related jobs, while making up nearly 30% of Americans. This pattern of underrepresentation has been attributed to 1) minority serving institutions lacking geoscience programs, 2) low interest in the outdoors due to a lack of opportunity, and 3) negative and low prestigious perceptions of geoscientists.\nOur project focuses specifically on the first barrier. Preliminary research suggests that only 2.5% of institutions with geoscience programs (n= 609) are also minority serving. The goals of the Geo-Needs project are to identify obstacles to and opportunities for better use of existing educational resources in two-year and minority-serving institutions, and to explore “ideal” models of resources, partnerships, and other support for geoscience faculty and students in these institutions. Four focus group meetings were held in August 2015 bringing administrators, instructors, resource providers, and education researchers together to discuss and develop these models. Activities at the meetings included small and whole group prompted discussion, guest speakers, gallery walks, and individual reflection. Content from the focus group meetings is available at the project’s website: http://serc.carleton.edu/geoneeds/index.html. Findings from the meetings can be used to inform future efforts aimed toward broadening access to the geosciences at two-year and minority-serving institutions.",

            "abstract": "Recurring droughts in southwestern U.S. particularly California, have strained the existing water reserves of the region. Frequency, severity and duration of these recurring drought events may not be captured by the available instrumental records. Thus streamflow reconstruction becomes imperative to identify the historic hydroclimatic extremes of a region and assists in developing better water management strategies, vital for sustainability of water reserves. Tree ring chronologies (TRC) are conventionally used to reconstruct streamflows, since tree rings are representative of climatic information. Studies have shown that sea surface temperature (SST) and climate indices of southern oscillation index (SOI) and pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) influence U.S. streamflow volumes. The purpose of this study was to improve the traditional reconstruction methodology by incorporating the oceanic-atmospheric variables of PDO, SOI, and Pacific Ocean SST, alongwith TRC as predictors in a step-wise linear regression model. The methodology of singular value decomposition was used to identify teleconnected regions of streamflow and SST. The approach was tested on eleven gage stations in Sacramento River Basin (SRB) and San Joaquin River Basin (JRB). The reconstructions were successfully generated from 1800-1980, having an overlap period of 1932-1980. Improved results were exhibited when using the predictor variable of SST along with TRC (calibration r2=0.6-0.91) compared to when using TRC in combination with SOI and PDO (calibration r2=0.51-0.78) or when using TRC by itself (calibration r2=0.51-0.86). For future work, this approach can be replicated for other watersheds by using the oceanic-atmospheric climate variables influencing that region.",

            "abstract": "Most seismic disasters in northern Turkey have been caused by large earthquakes generated along the huge active fault called the North Anatolian Fault. We can also see that these large earthquakes occurred sequentially from east to west. Since the latest large earthquake, 1999 Kocaeli earthquake occurred close to Izumit, which is neighboring Istanbul, a next large earthquake can occur in the westernmost segment only several tens km away from Istanbul. Therefore, the seismic risk assessment of Istanbul must be an urgent issue and this study has been carried out for the purpose of an accurate assessment.\nTo increase the accuracy of seismic risk assessment, we introduced two approaches into this study. The first approach is based on historical seismology. We compiled data of actual seismic damage by investigating past seismic disasters in Istanbul. The experts in Turkish history and seismology examined historical documents and collecting data of actual seismic damage written in them. In particular, there exist photos of seismic damage in the 19th century and later. For example, the figure shows the damage of buildings caused by the 1894 earthquake. We performed a preliminary analysis on these data.\nThe second approach is based on structural engineering. For useful risk assessments for the people and society of Istanbul, not only the past damage data but also data on currently existing buildings are necessary. For this purpose, we performed cyclic lateral-loading tests on a RC building in the redevelopment area. The experts on structural engineering and earthquake engineering analyzed the data obtained from this full-scale experiment. Finally, we concluded this study by integrating the results of the two approaches.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive knowledge of the groundwater flow patterns associated with geothermal resources is critical to sustainable resource management and to discovering blind geothermal systems. Magnetotellurics (MT), which provides subsurface electrical conductivity information to substantial depths, has the ability to image geothermal reservoir features, such as conductive clay caps and hot, saline groundwater circulating within geothermal systems. We have used MT data along with 2D hydrothermal modeling, constrained by temperature, salinity and carbon-14 data, to explore possible deep groundwater circulation scenarios near the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, in the Rio Grande Rift, central New Mexico. The area is underlain by a 100 to 150-m thick molten sill emplaced approximately 19 km below the surface. This sill is referred to locally as the Socorro Magma Body (SMB). Previous studies by Mailloux et al. (1999) and Pepin et al. (2015) suggest that the crystalline basement rocks in this region of the Rio Grande Rift can be significantly fractured to depths of 4-8 km and have permeabilities as high as 10-14 to 10-12 m2. The combination of high permeability conditions and the presence of the SMB makes this particular region a promising candidate for discovering a blind geothermal system at depth. We constructed a 2D hydrothermal model that traverses a 64-km zone of active uplift that is associated with the SMB. We also completed a 12-km long, 9-station MT transect across a portion of this profile, where land access was permitted and electromagnetic noise was minimal. Preliminary results suggest a deep convection-dominated system is a possibility, although further analysis of the MT data is necessary and ongoing. We hypothesize that using hydrothermal modeling in conjunction with MT surveys may prove to be an effective approach to discovering and managing deep regional hydrothermal resources.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - posterAGU2015_inkscape.pdf\nThe ability of L-band passive microwave satellite observations to provide soil moisture (mv) measurements is well known. Despite its high sensitivity to near-surface mv, radiometric technology suffers from having a relatively low spatial resolution. Conversely active microwave observations, although their finer resolution, are difficult to be interpreted for mv content due to the confounding effects of vegetation and roughness.\nThere have been and there are strong motivations for the realization of satellite missions that carry passive and active microwave instruments on board. This has also led to important contributions in algorithm development. In this line of work, NASA-CONAE SAC-D/Aquarius mission had on board an L band radiometer and scatterometer. This was followed by the launch of NASA SMAP mission (Soil Moisture Active Passive), as well as several airborne campaigns that provide active and passive measurements.\nWithin this frame, a new combined active/passive mv retrieval algorithm is proposed by deriving an analytical expression of brightness temperature and radar backscattering relation using explicit semi-empirical models. Simple models (i.e. that can be easily inverted and have relatively low amount of ancillary parameters) were selected: ω-τ model (Jackson et al., 1982, Water Resources Research) and radar-only model (Narvekar et al., 2015, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing). A major challenge involves coupling the active and passive models to be consistent with observations. Coupling equations can be derived using theoretical active/passive high-order radiative transfer models, such as 3D Numerical Method of Maxwell equations (Zhou et al., 2004, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing) and Tor Vergata (Ferrazzoli et al., 1995,Remote Sensing of Environment) models. In this context, different coupling equations can be optimized for different land covers using theoretical forward models with specific parametrization for each land cover type. The quality of the coupling equations derived is discussed in relation with different land surface conditions using Aquarius/SAC-D observations. This is done in preparation for SMAP and future SAOCOM data.",

            "abstract": "After forest harvest significant amounts of woody residues are left dispersed on site and some subsequently piled and burned. Quantification of residues is required for estimating C budgets, billable waste, harvest efficiency, bioenergy potential and smoke emissions. Trofymow (et al 2014 CJFR) compared remote sensing methods to ground-based waste and residue survey (WRS) methods for residue piles in 4 cutblocks in the Oyster River (OR) area in coastal BC. Compared to geospatial methods using 15cm orthophotos and LiDAR acquired in 2011 by helicopter, the WRS method underestimated pile wood by 30% to 50% while a USFS volume method overestimated pile wood by 50% if site specific packing ratios were not used. A geospatial method was developed in PCI Geomatica to analyze 2-bit images of logs >15cm diameters to determine dispersed wood residues in OR and compare to WRS methods. Across blocks, geospatial and WRS method wood volumes were correlated (R2=0.69), however volumes were 2.5 times larger for the geospatial vs WRS method. Methods for dispersed residues could not be properly compared as individual WRS plots were not georeferenced, only 12 plots were sampled in total, and low-resolution images poorly resolved logs. Thus, a new study in 2 cutblocks in the Northwest Bay (NWB) area acquired 2cm resolution RGB air-photography in 2014-15 using an Aeryon Sky Ranger UAV prior to and after burn pile construction. A total of 57 dispersed WRS plots and 24 WRS pile or accumulation plots were georeferenced and measured. Stero-pairs were used to generate point-clouds for pile bulk volumes. Images processed to 8-bit grey scale are being analyzed with a revised PCI method that better accounts for log overlaps. WRS methods depend on a good sample of plots and accurate determination of stratum (dispersed, roadside, piles, accumulations) areas. Analysis of NWB blocks shows WRS field methods for stratum area differ by 5-20% from that determined using orthophotos. Plot-level wood volumes in each plot and stratum determined by geospatial and WRS methods will be compared. While geospatial methods for residue determination is a 100% sample, compared to sample-based WRS method, difficulties in resolving logs in the images may mean the best method for determining residues requires a combination of geospatial and ground plot measurements.\n.",

            "abstract": "Sinabung is a 2460 m high andesitic stratovolcano in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Its ongoing eruption has produced a 2.9 km long lava flow with two active summit lobes and frequent pyroclastic flows (≤ 5 km long) with associated plumes over 5 km high. Large viscous lava flows of this type are common at volcanoes around the world, but are rarely observed while active. This eruption therefore provides a special opportunity to observe and study the mechanisms of emplacement and growth of an active lava flow. In September 2014, we conducted a field campaign to collect ground-based photographs to analyze with Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric techniques. We built multiple 3D models from which we estimate the volume of the lava flow and identify areas where the flow was most active. Thermal infrared and visual satellite images provide information on the effusive eruption from its initiation in December 2013 to the present and allow us to estimate the eruption rate, advance rate and rheological characteristics of the flow. According to our DEMs the flow volume as of September 2014 was 100 Mm3, providing an average flow rate of 4.5 m3/s, while comparison of two DEMs from that month suggests that most growth occurred at the SE nose of the flow. Flow advancement was initially controlled by the yield strength of the flow crust while eruption and flow advance rates were at their highest in January-March 2014. A period of slow front advancement and inflation from March – October 2014 suggests that the flow’s interior had cooled and that propagation was limited by the interior yield strength. This interpretation is supported by the simultaneous generation of pyroclastic flows due to collapse of the upper portion of the lava flow and consequent lava breakout and creation of new flow lobes originating from the upper reaches in October 2014 and June 2015. Both lobes remain active as of August 2015 and present a significant hazard for collapse and generation of pyroclastic flows. We use a pre-eruption DEM of Sinabung provided by the Badan Informasi Geospasial (Indonesia) to identify over 20 older lava flows at Sinabung. The active flow appears to represent a typical eruption of Sinabung, with its length and area similar to previous flows.",

            "abstract": "Uranium mobility in the subsurface is controlled by the redox state and chemical speciation, generally as minimally soluble U(IV) or soluble U(VI) species. In the presence of even low carbonate concentrations the uranyl-carbonato complex quickly becomes the dominant aqueous species; they are, in fact, the primary aqueous species in most groundwaters. Calcium in groundwater leads to ternary calcium-uranyl-carbonato complexes that limit the rate and extent of U(VI) reduction. This decrease in reduction rate has been attributed to surface processes, thermodynamic limitations, and kinetic factors. Here we present a new mechanism for the inhibition of ferrous iron reduction of uranyl-carbonato species in the presence of calcium. A series of experiments under variable Ca conditions were preformed to determine the role of Ca in the inhibition of U reduction by ferrous iron. Calcium ions in the Ca2UO2(CO3)3  complex sterically prevent the interaction of Fe(II) with U(VI), in turn preventing the Fe(II)-U(VI) distance required for electron transfer. The mechanism described here helps to predict U redox transformations in suboxic environments and clarifies the role of Ca in the fate and mobility of U. Electrochemical measurements further show the decrease of the U(VI) to U(V) redox potential of the uranyl–carbonato complex with decreasing pH suggesting the first electron transfer is critical determining the rate and extent of uranium reduction.",

            "abstract": "Art can support the scientific process during different phases of a scientific discovery. Art can help explain and extend the scientific concepts for the general public; in this way art is a powerful tool for communication. Art can aid the scientist in processing and interpreting the data towards an understanding of the concepts and processes; in this way art is powerful – if often subconscious – tool to inform the process of discovery. Less often acknowledged, art can help engage students and inspire scientists during the initial development of ideas, observations, and questions; in this way art is a powerful tool to develop scientific questions and hypotheses.\nWhen we use art as a tool for communication of scientific discoveries, it helps break down barriers and makes science concepts less intimidating and more accessible and understandable for the learner. Scientists themselves use artistic concepts and processes – directly or indirectly – to help deepen their understanding. Teachers are following suit by using art more to stimulate students’ creative thinking and problem solving.\nWe show the value of teaching students to use the artistic “way of seeing” to develop their skills in observation, questioning, and critical thinking. In this way, art can be a powerful tool to engage students (from elementary to graduate) in the beginning phase of a scientific discovery, which is catalyzed by inquiry and curiosity. Through qualitative assessment of the Girls on Ice program, we show that many of the specific techniques taught by art teachers are valuable for science students to develop their observation skills. In particular, the concepts of contour drawing, squinting, gesture drawing, inverted drawing, and others can provide valuable training for student scientists. These art techniques encourage students to let go of preconceptions and “see” the world (the “data”) in new ways they help students focus on both large-scale patterns and small-scale details.",

Autonomous underwater mapping vehicle (AUV), remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and shipboard methods were used to acquire a dense grid of high-resolution chirp profiles (150 m line spacing; 11 cm vertical resolution), multibeam bathymetry (2 m grid), and targeted sediment core samples (<2 m length). Detailed interpretation of Holocene deposits in the chirp profiles combined with radiocarbon dating and laser particle-size analyses allow correlation of Holocene sediment thickness and seafloor gradient with sediment gravity flow deposits. Holocene down-slope flows appear to have been generated by mass wasting processes, primarily on the upper slope (~100–200 m water depth) where shipboard multibeam bathymetry reveals submarine landslide headwall scarps in a region that has been isolated from terrigenous sediment sources throughout the Holocene. Submarine landslides appear to have transformed into sandy and organic-rich turbidity currents that created up-slope migrating sediment waves, a low relief (<5 m) fault-bounded channel, and a series of depocenters. A down-slope gradient profile and a Holocene isopach down-slope profile show that the primary depocenter occurs within a small pull-apart basin associated with a decrease in seafloor gradient of ~1.5°. Holocene sediment-flow deposits vary in number, thickness, and character with subtle changes in seabed gradient (<0.5°) and depositional environment. These results help quantify morphodynamic sensitivity to seafloor gradients and have implications for down-slope flow dynamics, deep-water depositional architecture, Holocene sediment, nutrient, and contaminant transport, and turbidite paleoseismology along other margins.",

We also report detections at several T-phase stations in the Pacific, including Socorro Island at a distance of nearly 10500 km.

The breadth and depth of the science that has been fostered by the NACP is impressive, and matched only by the strength of the community that it has helped to create. Following the first NACP All Investigators’ meeting in 2007, the NACP community came together to embark on a variety of synthesis efforts aimed at gleaning deeper scientific insights through systematic intercomparison studies. These syntheses span a variety of scales, a variety of greenhouse gases, and include both land and coastal regions. The last five years have seen a dramatic return on this investment, and in many ways the community continues to gain momentum. This talk will provide an overview of the science enabled by the NACP and its synthesis efforts, as well as of the community’s vision for the future of carbon cycle science in the United States.",

The convergence behavior of envelope inversion can be well-explained by renormalization and renormalization group (RG) theory/method. The local integration (local interaction) of the envelope operator and the local re-linearization of the envelope inversion solve the divergence problem, although it can only recover the large-scale background structure (low resolution inversion). The combined inversion of envelope inversion and waveform inversion (SEI+FWI) can substantially reduce the starting model dependence of the regular full-waveform inversion.

Naturally-occurring neutrons at Mars are produced from the interactions of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar energetic particles (SEP) with the Martian atmosphere and surface material. The neutron data from these simultaneous orbital and surface measurements are a good indicator for the state of general ambient radiation environments at Mars and can be also used as a means to infer how the ambient radiation is transported through the Martian atmosphere. Both HEND and DAN are healthy, and they provide the unique data sources valuable to study these phenomena for the period since the MSL landing in August 2012. Understanding of why there is correlation or no correlation between the two measurements will provide a key clue to understand the processes of GCR/SEP propagation through the Mars atmosphere and the interaction with the Mars surface materials. More detailed comparison between the two data sets and analysis of HEND/DAN data will be presented in the final presentation. Also, the long-term trend of the HEND/DAN data will be also compared with a general space weather condition.\nWe used only publicly available HEND/DAN data in this study, e.g., open literature and/or planetary data system (PDS).",

            "abstract": "Diffuse soil CO2 flux and stable isotopic surveys are widely utilized approaches for the assessment of carbon-cycle dynamics in geothermal systems. Flux measurements are traditionally performed in the field, whereas, δ13CO2 is more commonly determined in the laboratory following soil gas sampling in the field. Separation of flux measurements and isotopic determinations into temporally distinct stages precludes field reactive high-resolution sampling of soil gas emission sites with anomalous carbon isotope compositions in single field campaigns. Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) overcomes this limitation by enabling in situ δ13CO2 analysis. However, spectroscopic interference from H2S has prevented field-based CRDS techniques from being applied in H2S-rich geothermal settings. Here we report on the use of a continuous flow in-line Cu wire trap to remove H2S from an accumulated soil gas stream during soil gas analysis by CRDS in the field and lab. Successful removal of H2S from the soil gas stream enabled CRDS isotopic measurement of gas streams with H2S concentration as high as ~250 ppmv in lab trials and at higher concentrations in the Rotorua, New Zealand, geothermal system. Our findings demonstrate that CRDS can be successfully deployed in H2S-rich geothermal systems, allowing for the simultaneous rapid determination of both CO2 flux and δ13CO2 in the field. Improving our knowledge and understanding of the mechanics of global carbon-cycle processes and conditions remains a grand challenge in modern biogeoscience. The field-based diffuse soil gas analytical system we have developed creates unprecedented opportunities to quantify and apportion CO2 and CH4 fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution in diverse natural settings.",

We obtain time series of daily estimates of position for all the available data, from which we isolate the post-seismic deformation signal. Also, we estimate co-seismic and pre-seismic crustal deformation signals from 30s positions obtained the day of the earthquake and the 3 weeks preceding it. We present our inferences of pre-, co- and post- seismic slip associated with the Pisagua earthquake and compare it with current models of inter-seismic coupling. We analyze our results in the context of the seismotectonics of the region in order to better characterize the mechanical properties at the subduction megathrust and discuss its implications for earthquake potential in the surrounding region.",

Many studies have indicated that topographic convergence of hillslope area leads to more sustained hydrologic connectivity. However, we still do not fully understand how soil heterogeneity may lead to differences in subsurface flow rates, and therefore runoff contributions, across hydrologically connected hillslope positions. To address this knowledge gap we collected 260 measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) across a 350,000 m2 hillslope in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, MT, USA. We will compare the spatial patterns of Ksat to shallow groundwater responses across a network of 30 recording wells and changes in streamflow measured at the base of the hillslope. Our preliminary analyses indicate that Ksat is reduced in topographic low points relative to planar and divergent positions. These are also locations that exhibited more sustained hydrologic connectivity and elevated shallow groundwater heights. These initial observations suggest a potential linkage between landscape topography, soils, hydraulic conductivity and the duration and rate of hillslope runoff contributions to streams.",

            "abstract": "We use shear wave splitting of local earthquakes to characterize seismic anisotropy along the central portion of the transpressive, plate-bounding Alpine Fault and surrounding the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) boreholes. We combine data from the SAMBA network of 2 Hz borehole seismometers, the DFDP10 short-period surface network, and the GeoNet broadband network. Using the MFAST automatic shear wave splitting program applied to hand-picked S arrivals, 1.5 years of data yielded 15,902 measurements. Of these, 1291 measurements from 23 stations were of high quality (grades of A or B); their fast azimuths exhibit three predominant trends: one NE/SW, subparallel to the Alpine Fault, one perpendicular to it and the third E-W. The last of these, observed at the six stations closest to the fault, is roughly parallel to the maximum principal stress direction. Some stations show a single population of fast directions and others show two or more populations. We consider that the orientations are likely caused by a combination of stress-controlled, crack-induced anisotropy and structure-controlled anisotropy associated with the fault fabric and its interaction with the dominantly schistose rocks in the region. Delay times for the highest-quality measurements average 0.067±0.002 s, consistent with small splitting of the high-frequency phases (dominant frequencies 6.9±0.07 Hz) with short path lengths (4.5±0.09 s travel-time). If the anisotropy is present along the entire path, the percentage anisotropy is 1. 5%. However, delay times do not increase much with hypocentral distance, suggesting near-surface effects are dominant and hence that anisotropy is larger near the surface. To ensure the shear-wave splitting results do not depend on the particular algorithm used, a second semi-automated processing routine with different shear-wave splitting criteria is applied. A comparison of the results is anticipated to help to eliminate any possible artefacts.",

            "abstract": "Gases exsolving from magma are a key force that drives eruptive activity, and emissions from Kīlauea’s East Rift Zone (ERZ) dominated the volcano’s gas release from the beginning of the long-running and voluminous Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō eruption in 1983, through February 2008. In the months prior to the March 2008 onset of eruptive activity within Halema‘uma‘u Crater, however, SO2 degassing at the summit climbed substantially, and summit gas release has remained elevated since. These unprecedented emissions associated with the new summit eruption effectively began robbing gas from magma destined for Kīlauea’s ERZ. As a result, ERZ SO2discharge, which had averaged 1,700 +-380 t/d for the previous 15 years, declined sharply and steadily beginning in September, 2008, and reached a new steady low of 380 +- 100 t/d by early 2011. This level persisted through mid-2015.\nIn the years since the late 2008 downturn in ERZ SO2 emissions, there has been an overall slowdown in ERZ eruptive activity. Elevated emissions and effusive activity occurred briefly during the 2011 Kamoamoa fissure eruption and two other outbreaks at Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō , but otherwise ERZ eruptive activity had waned by 2010, when effusion rates were measured at about half of the long-term rate. Also, the sulfur preserved in ERZ olivine melt-inclusions, which provides a record of pre-eruptive SO2degassing, has steadily declined along with equilibration temperatures of host olivine phenocrysts, since 2008. We suggest that the drop in gas content of magma reaching the ERZ, owing to summit pre-eruptive degassing, has contributed significantly to the downturn in ERZ activity.\nWhile SO2 emissions from the ERZ have dropped to sustained levels lower than anything seen in the past 20 years, summit emissions have remained some of the highest recorded since regular measurements began at Kīlauea in 1979. Overall, average total SO2 discharge from Kīlauea in 2014, summit and ERZ, is still about 50% higher than for the 15 years prior to 2008. The effects of summit pre-eruptive degassing observed at Kilauea may have application at other summit-rift shield volcanoes.",

The rupture extended about 120 km from near the northern tip of the Gulf of California to the US – Mexican border south of the Elsinore fault zone. Most of the aftershocks occurred within days of the main event. On 14 June 2010 a M 5.7 late aftershock occurred 8 km southeast of Ocotillo, CA and is the largest aftershock in the sequence. The right-lateral event occurred in a cluster of aftershocks and was followed by its own aftershock sequence. UAVSAR data were collected for a swath covering the aftershock on 13 April, 2010 just after the El Mayor – Cucapah earthquake and before the earthquake on 21 October 2009. The line was reflown 1 July 2010 after the M 5.7 14 June 2010 aftershock. Data have been continued to be collected semi yearly to yearly since then. Repeat Pass Interferomety (RPI) products spanning the aftershock show the growth of a lineament that with an azimuth of 121.5° or a strike of -58.5°. The interferograms suggest that a stepover develops following the earthquake. The epicenter of the M 5.7 aftershock is proximal to the linear discontinuity in the postseismic interferogram and the mechanism of the event is consistent with slip on this stepover. Inversions for slip on the northeast linear structure that steps west of the mainshock rupture yield a moment magnitude ranging from 5.5 – 5.8, which is consistent with the magnitude of the aftershock. Slip occurs at a depth of 2-10 km on a steeply dipping fault.",

            "abstract": "This research evaluates the public education earthquake information prior to the Canterbury Earthquake sequence (2010-present), and examines communication learnings to create recommendations for improvement in implementation for these types of campaigns in future. The research comes from a practitioner perspective of someone who worked on these campaigns in Canterbury prior to the Earthquake Sequence and who also was the Public Information Manager Second in Command during the earthquake response in February 2011.\nDocuments, specifically those addressing seismic risk, that were created prior to the earthquake sequence, were analyzed, using a “best practice matrix” created by the researcher, for how closely these aligned to best practice academic research. Readability tests and word counts are also employed to assist with triangulation of the data as was practitioner involvement. This research also outlines the lessons learned by practitioners and explores their experiences in regards to creating these materials and how they perceive these now, given all that has happened since the inception of the booklets. The findings from the research showed these documents lacked many of the attributes of best practice. The overly long, jargon filled text had little positive outcome expectancy messages. This probably would have failed to persuade anyone that earthquakes were a real threat in Canterbury. Paradoxically, it is likely these booklets may have created fatalism in publics who read the booklets. While the overall intention was positive, for scientists to explain earthquakes, tsunami, landslides and other risks to encourage the public to prepare for these events, the implementation could be greatly improved. This final component of the research highlights points of improvement for implementation for more successful campaigns in future.\nThe importance of preparedness and science information campaigns can be not only in preparing the population but also into development of crisis communication plans. These plans are prepared in advance of a major emergency and symbiotic development of strategies, messages, themes and organizational structures in the preparedness stage can impact successful crisis communication plan implementation during an emergency.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_TianGan.pdf\nHydroShare is a collaborative environment being developed for sharing hydrological data and models. It includes capability to upload data in many formats as resources that can be shared. The HydroShare data model for resources uses a specific format for the representation of each type of data and specifies metadata common to all resource types as well as metadata unique to specific resource types. The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) was chosen as the format for multidimensional space-time data in HydroShare. NetCDF is widely used in hydrological and other geoscience modeling because it contains self-describing metadata and supports the creation of array-oriented datasets that may include three spatial dimensions, a time dimension and other user defined dimensions. For example, NetCDF may be used to represent precipitation or surface air temperature fields that have two dimensions in space and one dimension in time. This presentation will illustrate how NetCDF files are used in HydroShare. When a NetCDF file is loaded into HydroShare, header information is extracted using the “ncdump” utility. Python functions developed for the Django web framework on which HydroShare is based, extract science metadata present in the NetCDF file, saving the user from having to enter it. Where the file follows Climate Forecast (CF) convention and Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) standards, metadata is thus automatically populated. Users also have the ability to add metadata to the resource that may not have been present in the original NetCDF file. HydroShare’s metadata editing functionality then writes this science metadata back into the NetCDF file to maintain consistency between the science metadata in HydroShare and the metadata in the NetCDF file. This further helps researchers easily add metadata information following the CF and ACDD conventions. Additional data inspection and subsetting functions were developed, taking advantage of Python and command line libraries for working with NetCDF files. We describe the design and implementation of these features and illustrate how NetCDF files from a modeling application may be curated in HydroShare and thus enhance reproducibility of the associated research. We also discuss future development planned for multidimensional space-time data in HydroShare.",

Although it has been reported that unstable faulting occurred during antigorite dehydration even at higher pressures than ~2 GPa (e.g., Jung et al., 2009), the recent study by Chernak and Hirth (2011) revealed that the syndefromational antigorite dehydration does not produces stick-slip instabilities but stable fault slip. In the present study, we newly developed an AE monitoring system for high-pressure reaction-deformation processes combined with D-DIA and synchrotron monochromatic X-ray to observe reaction kinetics, creep behaviors, and AE activities simultaneously. We applied this technique to investigate shear instability during syndeformational antigorite dehydration. High-pressure deformation experiments were conducted up to ~8 GPa, ~1050 K, and strain rates of 3.4-9.2 x 10-5 s-1 in compression using a D-DIA type apparatus installed at BL-04B1, SPring-8. 50 keV mono X-ray were used to measure reaction kinetics and stress-strain data. To monitor shear instabilities by detecting AEs, six piezoelectric devices were positioned between first and second stage anvils of MA 6-6 type system. We used three kinds of starting materials of polycrystalline antigorite, fine-grained forsterite polycrystal, and two-phase mixtures of antigorite and San Carlos olivine (10%, 30%, and 50%atg). Clear contrasts were observed in AE activities between forsterite and antigorite samples. AE activities detected within the forsterite polycrystal suggested (semi) brittle behaviors at low pressures during the cold compression stage. Almost no AEs were detected within the antigorite samples during any stages of cold compression, ramping, deformation, and syndeformational dehydration although localized deformation textures were observed in recovered samples. Instead, we detected some AEs outside the sample, indicating the stick slipping at the boundaries of cylindrical parts. Our results suggest that localized deformation and dehydration of antigorite do not enhance shear instability at high pressures at least in compression under drained condition.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic tomography was performed in July 2015 in contaminated fractured mudstone beds at the former Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) in the Newark Basin near Trenton, NJ using seven existing wells. The spatial arrangement of wells (in a circle of 9 m radius with one central well), the use of packers to divide the wells into multiple monitoring intervals, and the deployment of fiber optic pressure transducers enabled collection of a hydraulic tomography dataset comprising high-resolution drawdown observations at an unprecedented level of spatial detail for fractured rocks. The experiment involved 45-minute cross-hole aquifer tests, conducted by pumping from a given packer-isolated well interval and continuously monitoring drawdowns in all other well intervals. The collective set of drawdown data from all tests and intervals displays a wide range of behavior suggestive of highly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) within the tested volume, such as: drawdown curves for different well intervals crossing one another on drawdown-time plots; variable drawdown curve shapes, including linear segments on log-log plots; variable order and magnitude of time-lag and/or drawdown for intervals of a given well in response to pumping from similar fractures or stratigraphic units in different wells; and variable groupings of wells and intervals showing similar responses for different pumping tests. The observed behavior is consistent with previous testing at the NAWC indicating that K within and across individual mudstone beds can vary by orders of magnitude over scales of meters. Preliminary assessment of the drawdown data together with a rich set of geophysical logs suggests an initial conceptual model that includes densely distributed fractures of moderate K at the shallowest depths of the tested volume, connected high-K bedding-plane-parting fractures at intermediate depths, and sparse low-K fractures in the deeper rocks. Future work will involve tomographic inversion of the data to estimate the K distribution at a scale of ~1 m3 in the upper two-thirds of the investigated volume where observation density is greatest.",

            "abstract": "Fine scale tropical forest structure characterization has been performed by means of field measurements techniques that record both the specie and the diameter at the breast height (dbh) for every tree within a given area. Due to dense and complex vegetation, additional important ecological variables (e.g. the tree height and crown size) are usually not measured because they are hardly recognized from the ground. The poor knowledge on the 3D tropical forest structure has been a major limitation for the understanding of different ecological issues such as the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, regeneration and competition dynamics and light penetration gradient assessments.\nAirborne laser scanning (ALS) is an active remote sensing technique that provides georeferenced distance measurements between the aircraft and the surface. It provides an unstructured 3D point cloud that is a high-resolution model of the forest. This study presents the first approach for tropical forest characterization at a fine scale using remote sensing data. The multi-modal lidar point cloud is decomposed into 3D clusters that correspond to single trees by means of a technique called Adaptive Mean Shift Segmentation (AMS3D). The ability of the corresponding individual tree metrics (tree height, crown area and crown volume) for the estimation of above ground biomass (agb) over the 50 ha CTFS plot in Barro Colorado Island is here assessed. We conclude that our approach is able to map the agb spatial distribution with an error of nearly 12% (RMSE=28 Mg ha-1) compared with field-based estimates over 1ha plots.",

            "abstract": "Beach sand near the shoreline acts as a reservoir for fecal contaminants with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) often orders of magnitude higher than in adjacent surface waters. This reservoir poses a human health risk and can also act as an important non-point contamination source for surface waters. Beach water quality advisories or closures can be issued when FIB (Escherichia coli (E. coli), enterococci (ENT)) concentrations are elevated in the surface water. The factors controlling the transport and accumulation of FIB in the foreshore sand are not well understood, though this is required to manage and mitigate this source. Multiple sources may contribute to the accumulation of FIB in sand, with recent studies suggesting that the continuous influx of surface water across the sediment-water interface may be a dominant source at many beaches.\nThe study objective was to develop understanding of the physical processes controlling the accumulation and transport of FIB in beach sand. Field measurements were combined with numerical modelling to evaluate the role of low-energy lapping waves in delivering FIB to the saturated foreshore sand at freshwater beaches. E. coli and ENT were measured at two beaches in Ontario, Canada at depths of up to 1 and 2 m, respectively, below the water table. A numerical model simulating wave-induced groundwater recirculations coupled with microbial transport (using colloid filtration theory) showed that the different FIB distributions measured at the two beaches was due mainly to the different beach slope and terrestrial groundwater flow. The model was applied to assess the impact of beach, wave and bacterial parameters on FIB accumulation. The infiltration zone width, average infiltration velocity and infiltration rate were shown to ultimately control the amount and spatial distribution of FIB in the sand. The study findings are important in understanding factors controlling the transport of FIB at the sediment-water interface of freshwater lakes.",

            "abstract": "Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play an important role in the climate system through the indirect aerosol effect (IAE). IAE is one of the least understood aspects of the climate system as many cloud processes are complicated. Many studies of aerosol-cloud interaction involve CCN interaction with cloud droplet concentrations (Nc), cloud microphysics, and radiative properties. However, fewer studies investigate how cloud processes modify CCN. Upon evaporation from non-precipitating clouds, CCN distributions develop bimodal shaped distributions (Hoppel et al. 1986). Activated CCN participate in cloud processing that is either chemical: aqueous oxidation; or physical: Brownian scavenging, collision and coalescence. Chemical processing does not change CCN concentration (NCCN) but reduces critical supersaturations (Sc; larger size) (Feingold and Kreidenweis, 2000) while physical processing reduces NCCN and Sc. These processes create the minima in the bimodal CCN distributions (Hudson et al., 2015). Updraft velocity (W) and NCCN are major factors on how these modified CCN distributions affect clouds. Panel a shows two nearby CCN distributions in the MArine Stratus/stratocumulus Experiment (MASE), which have similar concentrations, but the bimodal one (red) has been modified by cloud processing. In a simplified cloud droplet model, the modified CCN then produces higher Nc (panel b) and smaller droplet mean diameters (MD; panel c) when compared to the unmodified CCN (black) for W lower than 50 cm/s. The better CCN (lower Sc) increase competition among droplets reducing MD and droplet distribution spread (σ) which acts to reduce drizzle. Competition is created by limited available condensate due to lower S created by the low W (<50 cm/s) typical of stratus. The increased Nc of the modified CCN in stratus then increases IAE in the climate system. At higher W (>50 cm/s) typical of cumuli, Ncis reduced and MD is increased from the modified CCN distribution (panels b & c). Here, CCN cloud processing increases MD and σ leading to increased drizzle. Improved climate prediction requires a better understanding of these cyclical CCN-cloud interactions.\nFeingold and Kreidenweis, 2000, JGRA, 105(D19), 24351-24361.\nHoppel, Frick, and Larson, 1986, GRL, 13(1), 125–128.\nHudson, Noble and Tabor, 2015, JGRA, 120.",

            "abstract": "Environmental models are abstract simplifications of real systems. As a result, the elements of these models, including system architecture (structure), process parameterization and parameters inherit a high level of approximation and simplification. In a conventional model building exercise the parameter values are the only elements of a model which can vary while the rest of the modeling elements are often fixed a priori and therefore not subjected to change. Once chosen the process parametrization and model structure usually remains the same throughout the modeling process. The only flexibility comes from the changing parameter values, thereby enabling these models to reproduce the desired observation. This part of modeling practice, parameter identification and uncertainty, has attracted a significant attention in the literature during the last years. However what remains unexplored in our point of view is to what extent the process parameterization and system architecture (model structure) can support each other. In other words “Does a specific form of process parameterization emerge for a specific model given its system architecture and data while no or little assumption has been made about the process parameterization itself? In this study we relax the assumption regarding a specific pre-determined form for the process parameterizations of a rainfall/runoff model and examine how varying the complexity of the system architecture can lead to different or possibly contradictory parameterization forms than what would have been decided otherwise. This comparison implicitly and explicitly provides us with an assessment of how uncertain is our perception of model process parameterization in respect to the extent the data can support.",

            "abstract": "Western Grand Canyon is characterized by a steep inner gorge inset into broad upland plateaus. The uplands preserve sediments and volcanic rock from a period of relatively stable baselevel during the Tertiary coeval with the erosional beveling of the Hualapai Plateau to a low relief surface that cross cuts dipping erosionally resistant carbonates and weaker shale and sandstone units. Low erosion rates on the plateau surface persist, but more recent baselevel fall likely drove dissection of the plateau by the Colorado River and its tributaries. Baselevel of the western Grand Canyon region was likely lowered a net ~1000 m during basin and range extension coincident with slip on the Grand Wash fault between 18 and 12 million years ago and associated sedimentation. The tributaries draining into the Grand Wash Trough produce canyons and rugged topography, but these channels and surrounding hillslopes are not as steep as in the western Grand Canyon. Channel steepness and hillslope gradient are positively correlated with erosion rate where lithology and climate are similar and we infer that erosion rate is higher and began more recently in western Grand Canyon than along the Grand Wash Cliffs.\nThe tributaries of western Grand Canyon express a variety of knickpoint forms, opening several questions about the controls on channel form due to baselevel fall. Knickpoints here are often expressed at lithologic contacts however there is no predictive relationship between lithology and the magnitude or shape of an associated knickpoint. Large tributaries tend toward gentle knickpoints, with few small or no waterfalls, while small tributaries tend toward localized abrupt knickpoints with ephemeral waterfalls reaching over 100 m in height. We hypothesize the large, waterfall-style knickpoints may be fluvial hanging valleys and are exploring whether they are associated with a threshold contributing drainage area. However, variable contributions of sediment type and size may significantly influence knickpoint evolution by setting drainage area thresholds. New analyses presented will explore the complex relationships between knickpoint form and sediment metrics.",

(U-Th)/He chronometry is well suited for dating these phases but potential diffusive loss of 4He can complicate interpretations. Here we show that measuring He diffusion kinetics of dated samples can resolve whether ages record formation or cooling. Proterozoic (1.6 Ga) volcanics in Aravaipa Canyon, southern Arizona, contain 1.4-1.6-Ga quartz-vein-hosted hematite, as well as 1.0-1.1-Ga hematite precipitated on fractures and overlain by 20-30-Ma Mn-oxide. Hematite 4He/3He age spectra and multi-domain (MD) diffusion models are consistent with a small proportion (4-10%) of domains between 1-500 nm, larger proportions (5-15%) of 1-10 μm domains, and a majority (60-75%) of domains of 80-150 μm. Although the smallest domains would have extremely low He retentivity, models predict bulk “closure temperatures” of 180-200 °C. The 1.4-1.6-Ga quartz-vein hematite likely formed soon after eruption of its host rock, and has not been hotter than ~250 °C for Ma durations. The 1.0-1.1 Ga age of the fracture-fill hematite likely also records the timing of precipitation, but from fluids associated with nearby diabase of the same age. In contrast, the 4He/3He MD model of the 20-30-Ma Mn-oxide requires ~80% of 1-100 nm domains and 20% between 1-10 μm. Although the Mn-oxide likely formed at the same time as the hematite it coats, its age records transient heating from overlying 28-Ma volcanics. In all cases, approximate crystal sizes observed in SEM images are consistent with the predictions of MD modeling, and support the assumed kinetics of He diffusion (~147-157 kJ/mol and ~2.2×10-4 cm2/s for hematite, and ~134 kJ/mol and ~4×10-3 cm2/s for Mn-oxide).These results suggest that specular hematite can have bulk He closure temperatures at least as high as 200 °C and in some cases record precipitation; this is supported by our results on specularite from other locations as old as 2.2 Ga.",

LiDAR technology provides accurate estimates of aboveground biomass in different ecosystems, minimizing the signal saturation problems that are common with other remote sensing technologies. LiDAR data processing can be based on two different approaches. The first is based on deriving structural metrics from returns classified as vegetation, while the second one is based on metrics derived from the canopy height model (CHM). The CHM is obtained by subtracting the digital elevation model (DEM) that was created from the ground returns, from the digital surface model (DSM), which was itself constructed using the maximum height within each grid cell. The former approach provides a better description of the vertical distribution of the vegetation, whereas the latter significantly reduces the computational burden involved in processing point cloud data at the expense of losing information. This study evaluates the performance of both approaches for biomass estimation over very different ecosystems, including a Mediterranean forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and a tropical forest in Barro Colorado Island (Panama). In addition, the effect of point density on the variables derived, and ultimately on the estimated biomass, will be assessed.",

To investigate Hg transport during snowmelt, we collected samples for filtered and unfiltered total Hg (THg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in snowpack and snowmelt runoff across three snow-dominated watersheds in northern Utah: Logan River, Provo River, and Little Cottonwood Creek. The watersheds were selected to cover a range of geologic and hydrologic conditions typical of the Rocky Mountain region. Initial results show that snowpack THg concentrations were similar across the watersheds (0.87 – 1.69 ng/L) but river THg concentrations were highly variable. The Provo River showed the highest THg concentrations approaching 6 ng/L during peak flows, whereas maximum THg concentrations in the Logan River were <2 ng/L. Little Cottonwood Creek showed intermediate THg concentrations. THg and DOC showed strong positive correlation in the Provo River (R2=0.68) but were not correlated in the Logan River (R2=0.04). Notably, the Provo River showed the highest fraction of “dissolved” THg (calculated as the fraction of filtered/unfiltered concentration) averaging 75% compared with the other sites where the “dissolved” fraction was <45%. These results suggest that the majority of THg is transported in association with DOC in the Provo River but is more strongly associated with suspended sediments in the Logan River and Little Cottonwood Creek. These findings have implications for understanding Hg cycling in the Provo River watershed where Jordanelle Reservoir has fish consumption advisories due elevated Hg concentrations. The dissolved load of THg, possibly associated with DOC, is likely methylated in Jordanelle Reservoir where it bio-accumulates up the food web.",

            "abstract": "Temporal variations in the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of the mantle may have been transmitted to Earth’s atmosphere and oceans by volcanic degassing. However, it is unclear how redox states of volatiles relate to their source magmas because degassing and assimilation can impact fO2 before or during eruption. To explore this, we present µ-XANES measurements of the oxidation states of Fe and S and laser fluorination measurements of 18O/16O ratios in submarine glasses from two settings where degassing is recorded: 1) submarine glasses from the Reykjanes Ridge as it shoals to Iceland, including subglacial glasses from the Reykjanes Peninsula; and 2) submarine glasses from Mauna Kea recovered by the Hawaii Shield Drilling Program (HSDP).\nGlasses from both settings are basalts with 5.5-9.9 wt% MgO and 350-1790 ppm S. Submarine Reykjanes glasses are sulfide saturated. Subglacial Reykjanes and HSDP glasses are not sulfide saturated, and S and H2O contents are consistent with S+H2O degassing.\nSubmarine Reykjanes glasses have 18O/16O indistinguishable from MORB and become progressively 18O-depleted as MgO decreases. Subglacial glasses have lower 18O/16O than submarine glasses at a given MgO, but both sample types project to a common 18O/16O near 10 wt% MgO, suggesting that 18O-depletion in these lavas is generated by fractional crystallization and assimilation of an 18O-depleted crustal component. The oxidation state of Fe increases only slightly as 18O/16O decrease, suggesting that the assimilant is not oxidized enough to change magmatic fO2. Fe and S do not oxidize or reduce with decreasing S or H2O, suggesting that relatively reduced magmas at depth degassed S+H2O without changing magmatic fO2, and that the fO2 of these lavas reflect the fO2of their mantle source.\nThe oxidation states of Fe and S in HSDP glasses are broadly correlated and samples with the highest S concentrations are the most oxidized. Both Fe and S reduce with decreasing S and H2O contents. This suggests that relatively oxidized magmas at depth degassed S+H2O with open-system removal of oxidized species, reducing magmatic fO2 and producing a degassed volatile inventory more oxidized than its parent magma. Degassing may reduce fO2 more in H and S rich magmas that degas at high pressure, creating large differences between the redox states of magmas and volatiles.",

Typically, discrete water samples are collected and transported to a laboratory for isotope analysis. Due to the expense and labor associated with such sampling, isotope studies have generally been limited in scope and time-resolution. Field sampling of water isotopes has been shown in recent years to provide dense data sets with the increased time resolution illuminating substantially greater short term variability than is generally observed during discrete sampling. A truly portable instrument also opens the possibility to utilize the instrument as a tool for identifying which water samples would be particularly interesting for further laboratory investigation.\nTo make possible such field measurements of liquid water isotopes, Los Gatos Research has developed a miniaturized, field-deployable liquid water isotope analyzer. The prototype miniature liquid water isotope analyzer (mini-LWIA) uses LGR’s patented Off-Axis ICOS (Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy) technology in a rugged, Pelican case housing for easy transport and field operations. The analyzer simultaneously measures both δ2H and δ18O from liquid water, with both manual and automatic water introduction options. The laboratory precision for δ2H is 0.6 ‰, and for δ18O is 0.3 ‰.\nThe mini-LWIA was deployed in the high Arctic during the summer of 2015 at Inuvik in the Canadian Northwest Territories. Samples were collected from Sachs Harbor, on the southwest coast of Banks Island, including buried basal ice from the Lurentide Ice Sheet, some ice wedges, and other types of ground ice. Methodology and water analysis results from this extreme field deployment will be presented.",

Using the Amazon Delta (AD) as our focus we reflect on the challenges created by the high degree of functional interdependencies shaping social-ecological dynamics of delta regions. The article introduces the initial design of an \nintegrated \n conceptual framework to analyze delta regions as coupled social-ecological systems (SES). The first component of the framework is used to provide integrated definitions of delta regions according to a problem and/or collective action dilemma. Five different systematic components are suggested: social-economic systems, governance systems, ecosystems-resource systems, topographic-hydrological systems, and oceanic-climate systems. The second component of the framework presents a strategy for nested social ecological analysis to examine collective action situations in delta regions from local to regional and basin levels. The article provides illustrative applications of the framework to the Amazon Delta. First, it is used to define the AD region as a coupled, multi-level SES. We further proposed a definition of what we call the core SES of the AD. We then utilize the framework to diagnose an example collective action problem related to the impacts of urban growth and pollution on small-scale fishing resources. We argue that the functional interdependencies characteristic of delta regions require new approaches to understand, diagnose, and evaluate the current and future impact of social and environmental changes and potential solutions to the sustainability dilemmas characteristic of these regions.

In addition to their effects associated with atmospheric heating by absorption of solar radiation and interactions with clouds, LAP in snow on land and ice can reduce the surface reflectance , which is likely to accelerate the snow aging process and further reduces snow albedo and increases the speed of snowpack melt. LAP in snow and ice (LAPSI) has been identified as one of major forcings affecting climate change, e.g. in the fourth and fifth assessment reports of IPCC. However, the uncertainty level in quantifying this effect remains very high. In this talk, we document various technical methods of measuring LAPSI and review the progress made in measuring the LAPSI in Arctic, Tibetan Plateau and other mid-latitude regions. We also report the progress in modeling the concentrations, albedo reduction, radiative forcing, and climatic and hydrological impact of LAPSI at global and regional scales. Finally we identify some research needs for reducing the uncertainties in the impact of LAPSI on global and regional climate and the hydrological cycle.",

These interacting processes occur over very different spatial and temporal scales and under very different physico-chemical conditions. Therefore, there is a strong motivation in geodynamics for investigating the equations governing MPMCRF, their mathematical structure and properties, and the numerical techniques necessary to obtain reliable and accurate results.\nIn this contribution we present results from a novel numerical framework to solve multiscale MPMCRF problems in geodynamic contexts. The numerical method is based on a particle-based Lagrangian-Eulerian Finite Element algorithm recently developed by the authors, which allows for accurate tracking of phases (even in the present of sharp fronts), and the reactions between them, over a wide range of timescales. Our approach combines rigorous solutions to the conservation equations (mass, energy and momentum) for each dynamic phase (instead of the more common “mixture-type” approach) within the context of classical irreversible thermodynamics. Interfacial processes such as phase changes, chemical diffusion+reaction, and surface tension effects are explicitly incorporated in the context of ensemble averaging. Phase assemblages, mineral and melt compositions, and all other physical parameters of the multi-phase system are obtained through dynamic free energy minimization procedures. We present results for a number of case-studies to discuss the advantages and limitations of our method.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Poster.pdf\nHypertemporal data, or time series acquired at high temporal frequencies, are often used to determine seasonal characteristics of environmental phenomena such as sea ice concentration. However, it is difficult to analyze long-term hypertemporal remote sensing data over extensive areas without prior information. Most pixels of hypertemporal data are highly mixed and contain several distinct temporal signals that represent seasonal characteristics of substances. This study performed temporal mixture analysis, which is algebraically similar to spectral mixture analysis, but occurs in the time domain instead of the spectral domain. Temporal mixture analysis was used to investigate the temporal characteristics of Antarctic sea ice. Two general steps were used to address mixing problems: 1) finding temporally unique signatures of pure components, which are referred to as temporal endmembers, and 2) unmixing each pixel in the time series data as a linear combination of the endmember fractional abundances. Because endmember selection is critical to the success of both spectral and temporal mixture analysis, it is important to select proper endmembers from large quantities of hypertemporal data. A machine learning algorithm was introduced to successfully identify endmembers without prior knowledge. A fully linear mixing model was then implemented in an attempt to produce more robust and physically meaningful abundance estimates. Experiments that quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the proposed approaches were conducted. A temporal mixture analysis of high-temporal-dimensional data provides a unique summary of long-term Antarctic sea ice and noise-whitened reconstruction images via inverse processing. Further, comparisons of regional sea-ice fractions provide a better understanding of the overall Antarctic sea ice changes.",

            "abstract": "Heat waves in the western US have become progressively more severe due to increasing relative humidity and nighttime temperatures, increasing the health risks of vulnerable portions of the population, including Latino farmworkers in California’s Central Valley and other socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Recent research has shown greenhouse gas emissions doubled the risk of the hottest summer days during the 2000’s in the Central Valley, increasing public health risks and costs, and raising the question of which parties are responsible for paying these costs. It has been argued that these costs should not be taken up solely by the general public through taxation, but that additional parties can be considered, including multinational corporations who have extracted and marketed a large proportion of carbon-based fuels. Here, we apply probabilistic event attribution (PEA) to assess the contribution of emissions traced to the world’s 90 largest major industrial carbon producers to the severity and frequency of these extreme heat events. Our research uses very large ensembles of regional climate model simulations to calculate fractional attribution of policy-relevant extreme heat variables. We compare a full forcings world with observed greenhouse gases, sea surface temperatures and sea ice extent to a counter-factual world devoid of carbon pollution from major industrial carbon producers. The results show a discernable fraction of record-setting summer temperatures in the western US during the 2000’s can be attributed to emissions sourced from major carbon producers.",

New results from geologic mapping along an east-west transect in the central Andes are integrated with existing geophysical data to construct a balanced cross section across the Interandean (IAZ) and Subandean (SAZ) zones of southern Bolivia at 21°S, in order to define thrust belt geometry and estimate crustal shortening. The IAZ consists of a doubly vergent zone of 2-4 km-thick thrust sheets of mainly Silurian-Devonian rocks, which are structurally elevated ~10 km relative to equivalent SAZ levels to the east. Notably, our proposed IAZ geometry differs from published geometries that lack significant west-directed backthrusts. The SAZ is defined by regional-scale, fault-bend folds (10-20 km wavelength, 4-6 km amplitude) that exhume rocks as deep as Carboniferous above a 10-12 km-deep regional décollement in Silurian rocks. Previous studies have interpreted IAZ and SAZ shortening to be balanced by slip on two separate basement megathrust sheets at depth. We estimate 151 km (44%) of total east-west shortening in the IAZ (71 km) and SAZ (80 km), which is similar to a previous estimate (144 km, 42%). Importantly, our estimate of SAZ shortening restores the leading edge of the basement thrust sheet feeding displacement into the SAZ back to a corresponding footwall ramp that is constrained by a seismic reflection profile 90 km along strike to the south. Our shortening magnitudes are similar to nearby estimates to the north and south, which range between 60-86 km for the SAZ and 43-96 km for the IAZ. Future work will continue the cross section westward into the Eastern Cordillera hinterland, and explore potential variations in the geometry and style of basement deformation.",

Virtual reality is a medium of visualization that has large audiences originally designed for gaming purposes; Virtual reality can be captured in Cave-like environment but they are unwieldy and expensive to maintain. Recent efforts by major companies such as Facebook have focussed more on a large market , The Oculus is the first of such kind of mobile devices The operating system Unity makes it possible for us to convert the data files into a mesh of isosurfaces and be rendered into 3D. A user is immersed inside of the virtual reality and is able to move within and around the data using arrow keys and other steering devices, similar to those employed in XBox.. With introductions of products like the Oculus Rift and Holo Lens combined with ever increasing mobile computing strength, mobile virtual reality data visualization can be implemented for better analysis of 3D geological and mineralogical data sets. As more new products like the Surface Pro 4 and other high power yet very mobile computers are introduced to the market, the RAM and graphics card capacity necessary to run these models is more available, opening doors to this new reality. The computing requirements needed to run these models are a mere 8 GB of RAM and 2 GHz of CPU speed, which many mobile computers are starting to exceed. Using Unity 3D software to create a virtual environment containing a visual representation of the data, any data set converted into FBX or OBJ format which can be traversed by wearing the Oculus Rift device. This new method for analysis in conjunction with 3D scanning has potential applications in many fields, including the analysis of precious stones or jewelry. Using hologram technology to capture in high-resolution the 3D shape, color, and imperfections of minerals and stones, detailed review and analysis of the stone can be done remotely without ever seeing the real thing. This strategy can be game-changer for shoppers without having to go to the store.",

The factors controlling centennial and millennial variability in regional to global biomass burning dynamics are not well understood because there are few well-dated proxy records only. We are exploring ice core records of organic compounds resulting from incomplete combustion of lignin as tracers for biomass burning. In this study we investigate the distribution of vanillic acid (VA) in Arctic ice cores. VA is a major product of conifer combustion, but may also be produced from angiosperms. VA was measured in ice core samples using ion chromatography with electrospray MS/MS detection. Here we present measurements of vanillic acid in three Arctic ice cores from Siberia (Akademii Nauk; 0-3 kyr bp), northern Greenland (Tunu; 0-1.75 kyr bp), and Svalbard (Lomonosovfonna; 0-0.75 kyr bp). The Siberian record exhibits 3 strong centennial scale maxima (1200-600 BC, AD 300-800, and AD 1450-1700). All three cores exhibit a smaller feature around 1250, with a subsequent decline in Greenland and Svalbard. VA levels in Greenland and Svalbard are generally smaller than those in Siberia. These results suggest strong regional input from Northern Eurasian sources (i.e. boreal forests) to the Siberian core, and lower Arctic-wide “background” levels at the other sites.",

These spikes are characterized as a sudden increase or decrease in the probe current, with many of them appearing as one-point anomalies lasting less than a millisecond. Their occurrence generally correlates with the E ring dust density - the closer to the ring plane and Enceladus, the more frequent the appearance of spikes. These characteristics suggest that the LP spike signals are caused by dust impacts - most likely the collection of plasma produced from high velocity dust-probe impacts. Because of the low detection rate and the flexibility regarding to the spacecraft attitude, LP spikes provide an alternative way to explore the densest part of the E ring. \nHere we will present a preliminary statistical analysis of the LP spike appearance as a function of the spacecraft location, the relative dust speed, the spacecraft and probe potentials, and other relevant parameters. Comparison with measurements carried out by the High Rate Detector, a subsystem of the Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyser, will provide constraints on the dust grain size responsible for these detections. We will also examine their spatial distribution to identify features that may associate with ring dynamical effects, such as the seasonal variation or the noon-to-midnight electric field.",

            "abstract": "Some of the largest aggregations of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) in Alaska occur in tidewater glacier fjords where seals rest upon icebergs that are calved from tidewater glaciers into the marine environment. The distribution, amount, and size of floating ice in fjords are likely important factors influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of harbor seals; however, fine-scale characteristics of ice habitat that are used by seals have not been quantified using automated methods. We quantified the seasonal changes in ice habitat for harbor seals in Johns Hopkins Inlet, a tidewater glacier fjord in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, using aerial photography, object-based image analysis, and spatial models. Aerial photographic surveys (n = 53) were conducted of seals and ice during the whelping (June) and molting (August) seasons from 2007-2014. Surveys were flown along a grid of 12 transects and high-resolution digital photos were taken directly under the plane using a vertically aimed camera. Seal abundance and spatial distribution was consistently higher during June (range: 1,672-4,340) than August (range: 1,075-2,582) and corresponded to the spatial distribution and amount of ice. Preliminary analyses from 2007 suggest that the average percent of icebergs (ice ≥ than 1.6m2) and brash ice (ice < 1.6m2) per scene were greater in June (icebergs: 1.8% ± 1.6%; brash ice: 43.8% ± 38.9%) than August (icebergs: 0.2% ± 0.7%; brash ice; 15.8% ± 26.4%). Iceberg angularity (an index of iceberg shape) was also greater in June (1.7 ± 0.9) than August (0.9 ± 0.9). Potential factors that may influence the spatio-temporal variation in ice habitat for harbor seals in tidewater glacier fjords include frontal ablation rates of glaciers, fjord circulation, and local winds. Harbor seals exhibit high seasonal fidelity to tidewater glacier fjords, thus understanding the relationships between glacier dynamics and harbor seal distribution will be critical for understanding how future changes in tidewater glaciers may impact harbor seals.",

The Northwest Hawaiian Ridge (NWHR) includes 51 volcanoes, spanning ~42 Myr between the bend in the HE chain and the Hawaiian Islands (47% of the HE chain2), that has no high-precision isotopic data aside from two volcanoes near the bend1. Only Kea compositions have been observed on Emperor seamounts (>50 Ma)1,3, whereas the Hawaiian Islands (<6.5 Ma) have both Kea and Loa lavas3,4.\nWe have analyzed 23 samples of shield stage tholeiitic lavas from 13 NWHR volcanoes for Pb isotopes to test if the Loa trend exhibits a persistent presence along the ridge after Diakakuji seamount1. Age corrected 206Pb/204Pb range from 17.870 at Diakakuji to 18.654 at Midway atoll. The most enriched Loa isotopic compositions are erupted at Diakakuji (comparable to Lanai), and Mokumanamana, West Nihoa, and Nihoa have isotopic compositions similar to Mauna Loa. These observations suggest an ephemeral presence of the Loa geochemical trend along the NWHR. When shield-stage lavas of each Hawaiian volcano is averaged, NWHR volcanoes shows the most and least radiogenic Pb of the entire HE dataset: Diakakuji (0.9703) and Midway (0.9247). The NWHR exhibits the most geochemically extreme lava compositions along a region where many geophysical parameters (volcanic propagation rate, magmatic flux, mantle potential temperature) were changing significantly2,5. At a broader scale, correlation between radiogenic Pb and magmatic flux suggests source composition may control some of these changes, and help explain why the Hawaiian mantle plume seems to be strengthening5 rather than waning like classic plumes and LIPs.\n1Regelous et al., 2003, J.

Fire occurrence is based on fuel load levels and vegetation-specific thresholds for three calculated fire weather indices: fine fuel moisture code (FFMC) for the moisture content of fine fuels; build-up index (BUI) for the total amount of fuel available for combustion; and energy release component (ERC) for the total energy available to fire. Ignitions are assumed (i.e. the probability of an ignition source is 1). The model is run with gridded inputs and the fraction of each grid cell burned is limited by a vegetation-specific fire return period (FRP) and the number of years since the last fire occurred in the grid cell. One consequence of assumed ignitions FRP constraint is that similar fire behavior can take place over large areas with identical vegetation type. In regions where thresholds are often exceeded, fires occur frequently (annually in some instances) with a very low fraction of a cell burned. In areas where fire is infrequent, a single hot, dry climate event can result in intense fire over a large region. Both cases can potentially result in large areas with uniform vegetation type and age.\nTo better reflect realistic fire occurrence, we have developed a stochastic fire occurrence model that: a) uses a map of relative ignition probability and a multiplier to alter overall ignition occurrence; b) adjusts the original fixed fire thresholds with ignition success probabilities based on fire weather indices; and c) calculates spread by using a probability based on slope and wind direction. A Monte Carlo method is used with all three algorithms to determine occurrence. The new stochastic ignition approach yields more variety in fire intensity, a smaller annual total of cells burned, and patchier vegetation.",

We attempt to forecast whether an active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We do this by analyzing data from three solar observatories -- SDO, STEREO, and SoHO -- using a machine-learning algorithm. We find that the role of horizontal component of the photospheric magnetic field plays a crucial component in driving a CME, a result corroborated by Sun et al. (2015).

            "abstract": "We draw conclusions on the research output and findings from a 4-year multidisciplinary USDA-CBG collaborative program in sustainable integrated monitoring of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss prediction via erosion. The underlying method uses the state-of-the-art stable isotope science of sediment tracing under uncertain hydrologic influences. The research finds are rooted in the (i) application of Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistical models to assess the relationship between rainfall-runoff and soil erosion in space and time, (ii) capture of the episodic nature of rainfall events and its role in the spatial distribution of SOC loss from water erosion, (iii) stable isotope composition guided fingerprinting (source and quantity) of eroded soil, and (iv) the creation of an integrated watershed scale statistical soil loss monitoring model driven by spatial and temporal correlation of flow and stable isotope composition. The research theme was successfully applied on the urbanized Buffalo Bayou Watershed in Houston, Texas. The application brought to light novel future research conceptual outlines which will also be discussed in this deliverable to the AGU meeting. These include but not limited to: regional rainfall cluster research, physics of muddy river-bank soil and suspended sediment interaction, and friction & mobility that together make up the plasticity of soil aggregates that control erosion processes and landscape changes in a riparian corridor.\n",

            "abstract": "Recently a new tsunami forecast system SIFT (Short-term Inundation and Forecasting of Tsunamis) has been declared operational by the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning Centers. The SIFT system assimilates real-time information from a network of observing systems deployed in the open ocean, to produce on-the-fly estimates of tsunami impact at specific coastal communities. These estimates are computed via the tsunami simulation code MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) and include forecast products such as tsunami arrival time, duration of the event, predicted tsunami currents, maximum sea surface elevation and expected inundation areas. These computations are performed under the assumption that the mean sea level remains constant at Mean High Water (MHW) during the entire tsunami event. This assumption produces conservative tsunami forecasts that tend to err on the side of caution with the possibility of substantial overestimates of the inundation areas. To avoid this problem and produce more accurate, operational tsunami forecasts, we investigate the effects of tsunami interaction with tides. The nonlinear dynamic interaction is simulated by first, simulating tidal elevations and currents with Oregon State University tidal model, to obtain boundary and initial conditions to force the MOST tsunami model. Tsunami boundary and initial conditions can be added to those for the tide to study the combined effect. Our results show that even at locations with strong tidal forcing, the tsunami/tide interaction effect has a weakly non-linear effect on the tsunami elevation waveform. This interaction, however, will have a significant effect on the extent of the inundation area. Based on these findings we propose a simple, linear correction to the standard MHW forecast for tsunami time series and inundation area, that can be performed on-the-fly by the SIFT system without the need for complex tidal models.",

            "abstract": "A statistic study of the electron temperature (Te) response to field-aligned current (FAC) derived with measurements from the Swarm satellite A are presented in this study. Considering the variability in the widths and latitudes of FACs, simply superposing FACs by each orbit significantly reduces the size and smoothes over the FAC features. Therefore, in order to better represent the FACs patterns, a potential FAC region was extracted from every orbit, and normalized by its meridional width and maximum FAC magnitude. FACs were smoothed within a 20-second window, so as to remove any small variability due to Alfven waves. A potential FAC region was identified as a real FAC region by a logistic regression model. The FAC, as well as the corresponding filtered Te, were superposed at a normalized FAC region for each magnetic local time. The filtered Te was obtained by subtracting an 80-second (~5 degree) average from a 20-second (<1 degree) average in order to extract the variation with a comparable scale as the FACs. It was found that Te tended to increase in the upward-FAC region, while it decreased in the downward-FAC region, which was caused by the combination effects of the thermal advection due to the drift of electrons, and the thermoelectric heating by FACs on electrons. The correlation between Te and FAC was MLT dependent, and was influenced by season and geomagnetic disturbances. A linear relationship between Te and FAC was shown in the dusk sector (from noon to midnight), where 1uA/m2 of FAC increased Te by ~100K. The dawn sector (from midnight to noon) showed a weaker correlation between Te and FAC. The correlation between Te and the FAC was higher in winter than it was in summer, and was higher during low geomagnetic conditions (AE<120).",

Proxies of grain-size, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, ostracode analysis and palynology from a depocenter core show new results regarding high amplitude, high frequency changes in lake level, precipitation and temperature which correspond directly with colder/warmer and respectively drier/wetter climates as documented with Northern Atlantic Greenland ice core data.\nThe granulometry, geochemical, and ostracode results consistently demonstrate the correspondence of low lake conditions and colder water temperatures during D-O stadials and warmer/wetter climate during interstadials. These results are contradicted by the pollen results. Existence of cold temperature spores Botrychium and Selaginella coincide with increases in Artemisia, Atriplex, Sarcobatus, Cyperaceae and decreases in Pinus, also suggesting periods of colder/drier climate and shallower lake levels but the timing does not match that of those conditions inferred by the other methods.\nGranulometry, geochemical, and ostracode proxies denote cold periods and low lake levels roughly between 37.5-35.6 ka and 34.6-33.8 ka. Pollen analysis suggests near-opposite time intervals with cold periods roughly 38-37.5 ka, 35.6-35 ka. This pollen inconsistency suggests the possibility of (1) a millennial-scale lag response of vegetation to climate change, (2) runoff from stadial precipitation causing influx in pollen abundances and variety found in the depocenter core, or (3) turbulent mixing from shallow lake level causing resuspension and redeposition of pollen (Bradley 1999).",

It is time to step up and include the results of these studies in management by proportionating a tool for integrating these processes in decision-making to effectively understand the tradeoffs between water and energy from management options and scenarios. A simple but powerful decision support system (DSS) for water management is described that includes water-related energy use and GHG emissions not solely from the water operations, but also from final water end uses, including demands from cities, agriculture, environment and the energy sector. Because one of the main drivers of energy use and GHG emissions is water pumping from aquifers, the DSS combines a surface water management model with a simple groundwater model, accounting for their interrelationships. The model also explicitly includes economic data to optimize water use across sectors during shortages and calculate return flows from different uses. Capabilities of the DSS are demonstrated on a case study over California’s intertied water system. Results show that urban end uses account for most GHG emissions of the entire water cycle, but large water conveyance produces significant peaks over the summer season. Also the development of more efficient water application on the agricultural sector has increased the total energy consumption and the net water use in the basins.",

            "abstract": "Dust deposition is increasing across the western US, likely as a result of land use and climate change. The impacts on snow energy balance are especially significant because dust affects snow albedo, heating snow and causing earlier snow melt. Quantifying the spatial and temporal distribution and amount (i.e., mass and size) of dust deposited within a watershed can elucidate drivers of radiative forcing. Parameterization of drivers that control snowpack energy balance improve predictive capabilities in hydrological models of water yield from snow. We hypothesized that topographic indices, namely aspect and vegetation cover, will have the greatest effects on dust distribution and will be consistent with prevailing wind direction. We used direct snowpack collection to estimate dust inputs at 19 plots within the 120 ha No Name watershed at approximately 3000 m elevation in the Snowy Range Mountains in Wyoming. Samples were collected, thawed gradually, and filtered. Meteorological, geographic, and biological factors were correlated with dust deposition. Across the watershed, mean dust input was 36.5 ± 3.1 mg. Aspect explained the most variance of dust deposition across the watershed and was associated with prevailing wind directions (R2 = 0.70), as predicted. Prevailing northwesterly winds lead to the greatest dust deposition on the southeast slopes. Increased dust deposition rates across southeastern slopes in the Snowy Mountains in Wyoming areas may lead to more rapid snowmelt rates and earlier peak flow. More broadly, understanding the interaction between topography, land use, and dust deposition can help predict snow melt and improve plans for downstream water needs.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Testa Shlemon AGU 2015.pdf\n<span\">Seismic hazards in California are legislatively controlled by three specific Acts: the Field Act of 1933; the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (AP) of 1975; and the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (SHMA) of 1980. The Field Act recognized the need for earthquake resistant construction for California schools and banned unreinforced masonry buildings, and imposed structural design under seismic conditions. The AP requires the California Geological Survey (CGS) to delineate “active fault zones” for general planning and mitigation by various state and local agencies. Under the AP, surface and near-surface faults are presumed active (about 11,000 years before present) unless proven otherwise; and can only be mitigated by avoidance (setback zones). The SHMA requires that earthquake-induced landslides, liquefaction zones, high ground accelerations, tsunamis and seiches similarly be demarcated on CGS-issued maps. \n<span\">Experience over the past ~45 years and related technological advances now show that more than ~95 percent of seismically induced damage and loss of life stems from high ground accelerations, from related ground deformation and from catastrophic structural failure, often far beyond State-mapped AP zones. The SHMA therefore enables the engineering community to mitigate natural hazards from a holistic standpoint that considers protection of public health, safety and welfare. In conformance with the SHMA, structural design and related planning and building codes focus on acceptable risk for natural hazards with a typical recurrence of ~100 yrs to a few thousand years. This contrasts with the current AP “total avoidance” for surface-fault rupture that may have occurred within the last 11,000 years. Accordingly, avoidance may be reasonable for well expressed surface faults in high-density urban areas or where relative fault activity is uncertain. However, in the interest of overall public, health and safety, and for consistency with the SHMA and current professional standards-of-practice, we now propose changes to the AP and related regulations, including consideration for permitting construction near or across surface or near-surface faults that are geologically reasonably well characterized and amenable to structural mitigation.

We analyzed sinter from the Pampa Lirima geothermal field, a high-altitude (4,000 m) Andean site ~190 km east of Iquique in Northern Chile, 20 km from the Bolivian border. There, siliceous sinter is forming in several active thermal pools distributed in a broad, flat plain of sinter and sand debris. Water temperatures ranged from 38-80°C and pH was near neutral (6.0-7.4), when we sampled in November 2014. We focused on the largest pool, one with an artificial trench extending from its SE corner, through which effluent flowed; this trench cut through 1.25m of sinter horizon, allowing us to sample older sinter material along with deposits actively forming in the pool.\nWe used EMP and SEM data to characterize 16 sinter samples. The sinter deposit is comprised of massive sinter layers interbedded with layers rich in fragmented sinter debris cemented by opal-A. The material is dominantly opal-A with a few percent accessory minerals. Accessory phases consist of sulfates – gypsum, sodium- and sodium-calcium sulfates, in decreasing order of occurrence. Fossil frustules and plant remnants replaced by opal-A spheres are abundant; they are comprised of diatom casts (15-80% of the rock), and 10-300 µm diameter filamentous features. In the trench, the fragmental layers are concentrated at the base of the exposed stratigraphy; these layers also show a higher abundance of sodium-sulfates, whereas the uppermost portion of the column presents calcium-sulfates – gypsum – and a lower frequency of fragmental layers.\nThe mineralogy of the deposit is a record of changes in the geochemistry of the thermal pool and/or local environmental conditions over time, with periods of higher sodium and calcium content or higher evaporation rates. The fragmental nature of some sinter layers and the preserved plant remains suggest that hydrodynamic conditions have also changed throughout the deposition of the sinter layers. Based on these constraints, we can interpret a transition from a lacustrine environment synchronous with the geothermal activity towards a geothermal-dominated environment in the Pampa-Lirima area in the Late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a crucial component to gain insight in the worlds ice sheets and glaciers. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar data have proven to be a key resource to monitor the great ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. International efforts undertaken during the last International Polar Year resulted in the collection of vast amounts of data to generate the first continent-wide ice velocity map of Antarctica, a series of full velocity maps of Greenland, and time series data in key regions. The Antarctic grounding line was also mapped at unprecedented accuracy using InSAR. The end of several SAR missions since 2010 has posed a significant challenge in the effort to provide ongoing data acquisitions.\nNew generation missions show potential to not only fill the data gap, but to make the collection of ice sheet data part of the ongoing acquisition scenarios, therefore ensuring data continuity. New modes, like the TOPSAR mode used for Sentinel-1A, provide new opportunities but also pose processing challenges, particularly if the entire area monitored is in motion. Several future missions are in various stages of development, thus further adding to the suite of sensors potentially available to collect data in Polar Regions going forward. The NASA-ISRO L-and S-band mission, planned for launch in 2020, will be a pure science mission with an open data policy, thus again changing the data availability and data access situation for the better.\nIn international collaboration through the Polar Space Task Group, space agencies coordinate their science acquisitions in Polar Regions. With broad input from the larger ice sheet science community, we have worked closely with space agencies to define science requirements and to develop acquisition scenarios that maximize science value for ice sheets.\nHere we highlight the collaboration effort, summarize the input of the ice sheet science community to the Polar Space Task Group, and present the acquisition plans that resulted from these efforts. Based on recent acquisitions, we also demonstrate how the current generation of SAR satellites will be used to provide Earth System Science Data for ice sheets and how they fit into existing data. We will show results based on Sentinel-1A, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, COSMO-SkyMED and TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X and contrast sensor specific data processing.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide, N2O, is the major source of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere, where these oxides playa critical roles in ozone layer depletion by itself and moderating ozone layer depletion by chlorinated chemicals. Thus N2O plays a complex role in the stratosphere. Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas and it contributes to the radiative forcing of climate. Indeed, it is considered the third most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide and methane.\nThis dual role of nitrous oxide makes it an interesting gas for the atmosphere- it bridges the issue of ozone layer depletion and climate change. Nitrous oxide has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Therefore, one needs to consider this important distinction between natural and anthropogenic sources as well as its role in two related but separate environmental issues. Further, the sources of nitrous oxide are varied and diffuse, which makes it difficult to quantify different sources. However, it is clear that a majority of anthropogenic nitrous oxide comes from food production (including agricultural and animal growth practices), an activity that is at the heart of human existence. Thus, limiting N2O emissions is not a simple task!\nI will briefly summarize our understanding of these roles of nitrous oxide in the earth’s atmosphere and touch on the possible ways to limit N2O emissions.",

            "abstract": "We have previously reported hydrogen self-diffusion coefficients for olivine in deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments, but were only able to resolve diffusion profiles reliably in the ‘fast’ [100] orientation due to the limited spatial resolution of the Cameca 6f Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrument. Samples were reanalyzed using the Cameca nanoSIMS, which enabled simultaneous measurements of diffusion coefficients in the ‘fast’ [100] orientation and the additional ‘slow’ [010] and [001] orientations to gain a complete 3D view of hydrogen self-diffusion. Measurement precision of deuterium (16O2H with a Cs+beam) is also improved by higher vacuum, better environmental control, and lower background.\nDeuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments were conducted at 2 GPa between 750-900 °C by first saturating olivine with homogenous distribution of hydrogen (1H) and then exchanging some of this with deuterium (2H) in a subsequent experiment. The diffusion coefficents in the [100] orientation that were measured using the nanoSIMS are in good agreement with the previous measurements on the 6f. Diffusion coefficients in the [010] and [001] orientations are very similar in magnitude to one another, ranging between 10-13 to 10-14 m2/s, which is over an order of magnitude lower than the [100] orientation. Hydrogen self-diffusion is highly anisotropic in this temperature range, although the activation enthalpies for diffusion in the [010] and [001] orientations are significantly higher than that of the [100] orientation, such that there will be less anisotropy at higher temperatures relevant to the upper mantle.\nComparisons between chemical and self-diffusion measurements allow us to evaluate the various stoichiometric relationships that have been proposed for accommodating hydrogen into the nominally anhydrous structure of olivine. Based on these relationships, we estimate diffusivities of other point defects, small polarons and metal vacancies, as a function of orientation. Finally, we use these new high-fidelity measurements to further advance our model on the contribution of hydrogen to the electrical conductivity of olivine and the upper mantle.",

We use the CORE v. 2 interannual forcing data to force the ocean model. Simulations are performed at 0.1o(~5 km) ocean resolution with adaptive ice sheet resolution as fine as 500 m to adequately resolve the grounding line dynamics. We discuss the effect of improved ocean mixing and subshelf bathymetry (vs. the standard Bedmap2 bathymetry) on the behavior of the coupled system, comparing time-averaged melt rates below a number of major ice shelves with those reported in the literature. We also present seasonal variability and decadal melting trends from several Antarctic regions, along with the response of the ice shelves and the consequent dynamic response of the grounded ice sheet.\nPOPSICLES couples the POP2x ocean model, a modified version of the Parallel Ocean Program, and the BISICLES ice-sheet model. POP2x includes sub-ice-shelf circulation using partial top cells and the commonly used three-equation boundary layer physics. Standalone POP2x output compares well with standard ice-ocean test cases (e.g., ISOMIP) and other continental-scale simulations and melt-rate observations. BISICLES makes use of adaptive mesh refinement and a 1st-order accurate momentum balance similar to the L1L2 model of Schoof and Hindmarsh to accurately model regions of dynamic complexity, such as ice streams, outlet glaciers, and grounding lines. Results of BISICLES simulations have compared favorably to comparable simulations with a Stokes momentum balance in both idealized tests (MISMIP-3d) and realistic configurations.\nThe figure shows the BISICLES-computed vertically-integrated grounded ice velocity field 5 years into a 20-year coupled full-continent Antarctic-Southern-Ocean simulation. Submarine melt rates are painted onto the surface of the floating ice shelves. Grounding lines are shown in green.",

Although an iconic area for studying transpressional deformation and the Late Cenozoic sedimentary record, the long-term history of faulting, significance and kinematics of the subsidiary faults, and relationship between these faults and the main trace of the SAF remain unclear. We examine the petrologic, kinematic, and timing relationships between 4 subsidiary faults and related damage zones that parallel the SAF to evaluate relationships with the SAF and the Eastern California Shear Zone.\nAt least 6 major faults cut the Mesozoic to Late Tertiary crystalline and sedimentary rocks in the Mecca Hills, including the SAF. Hematite- and clay-coated fracture and slip surfaces are common in damage zones of the subsidiary faults. Slip surface orientation data of hematite-coated surfaces in the Painted Canyon Fault damage zone cluster at 110°, 65° SW and at 196°, 90° W. Similar surfaces in the Platform Fault damage zone cluster at 049°, 69 SE° and 003°, 83° E. Clay-coated slip surfaces in the Hidden Springs Fault damage zone cluster at 195°, 53° W and 196°, 11° W. Multiple slip vector orientations are observed on a single fault surface, consistent with oblique and dip-slip motion on faults in the Mecca Hills. Iridescent hematite and smooth clay surfaces suggest frictional heating on these surfaces, possibly from seismic slip. Preliminary scanning electron microscopy data reveal thin (10s-100s of μm), brecciated hematite slip surfaces. The specular hematite appears originally syn-tectonic and subsequently reworked with host rock and comminuted in multiple slip events. We apply hematite and apatite (U-Th)/He dating from the fault surface and host rock, respectively, to constrain fault thermal evolution and evaluate hematite (U-Th)/He dates as recording hematite formation, fault slip, or erosional cooling in the Mecca Hills. Collectively, these data will provide insight into the geochemical, structural, and temporal evolution of these structures.",

Along the west and east margin of the basin, active reverse faults stretches respectively. To understand the basin development since middle Quaternary, we discuss shallow subsurface geological structure in the Aizu basin based on drawing many geological sections by using drilled cores and 1,200 borehole log data. This result also can be useful for understanding activities of fault systems and assessing groundwater flow system and potential of ground-source heat energy.\nQuaternary systems in the Aizu basin are consist of gravel layers, mud layers, and volcanic sediments. Gravel layers most widely and thickly distribute, over 200 m thickness in northern part of the basin. A few meter layers of mud sediments pinches between gravel layers, but in the central region, mud layer of 10-20 m thickness widely lies at the depth of 5-10 m and covers gravel layer underlying. Volcanic sediments consist of pyroclastic flow sediments and fall ash sediments. Pyroclastic flow sediments are deposited during early Pleistocene and detected at over 100 m depth in southern part of the basin, but distribution in whole basin has been still uncertain because of lack of deep borehole logs.\nIn the central region, tephra layers (deposited at ca. 220 ka) were detected from a drilling core at ca. 81.5 m depth in the east margin of the basin. An average accumulation rate of sediments since 220 ka in eastern part of basin was ca. 0.37 m/ ky, comparable with a contemporary rate (ca. 0.2-0.5 m/ ky) in western part of basin calculated by previous studies. It is suggested that average vertical slip rates of an eastern active fault is comparable with a western active fault if accumulation rate depends on tectonic activities.",

It is the\nnet result of the interaction of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nwith crustal remnant magnetization and a planetary ionosphere. Internal fields of crustal\norigin have been the subject of extensive studies; the focus of our work is identification\nand characterization of contributions from external magnetic fields using the Mars Global\nSurveyor (MGS) vector magnetic field data. We investigate the magnitude, average\nspatial structure and temporal variability of the external magnetic field at the MGS\nmapping altitude of 400 km by first subtracting expected contributions from crustal\nfields using existing global crustal field models. We identify contributions to the residual\ndayside fields from two sources: the draped IMF and a source that we interpret to be of\nionospheric origin. As observed in previous work, nightside external fields are minimal at\nmapping orbit altitudes. The IMF contribution changes polarity every 13 days due to the\ngeometry of the heliospheric magnetic field and Mars’ orbit. This allows us to calculate\nthe amplitude of the IMF at mapping orbit altitudes. The ionospheric contribution\nresults in a quasi-steady dayside signal in the MGS observations because of the limited\nlocal time sampling of the MGS mapping orbit. The ionospheric contribution can be\nisolated by averaging the external fields over timescales longer than several Carrington\nrotations, to average out the IMF contribution. We present a global average of the\nionopsheric field for the duration of the mapping orbit (2000-2006) and analyze daytime\nand nightime fields separately. We show that some structure in the time-averaged\nionospheric field is organized in the Mars body-fixed frame, due for example, to the\ninfluence of crustal fields. We also show that the ionospheric fields vary in amplitude and\ngeometry with martian season. Broader local time coverage over a restricted latitude\nband of 50-60 provides some insight into the evolution of ionospheric fields over a\nmartian sole.",

The genomes show high metabolic versatility. Sulfur oxidation appears to be predominant but there is the potential of using a variety of e- donors and acceptors to obtain energy. To further assess the ecological importance of the vent auto- and heterotrophs, the global biogeography of the analyzed lineages will be investigated by fragment recruitment of metagenomes produced from the same site as well as other hydrothermal systems. Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data will be integrated to examine the expression of the predominant metabolic pathways and thus the main energy sources driving chemoautotrophic production. The comparative analysis of the key players and associated pathways among various vent sites that differ in physicochemical characteristics is anticipated to decipher the patterns and drivers of the global dispersion and the local diversification of the vent microbiome.",

            "abstract": "Using both PKP differential travel times and normal modes, the inner core (IC) has long been modeled by simple cylindrical anisotropy with fast axis parallel or quasi-parallel to the Earth's rotation axis. Such a model is popular because it can explain, to some extent, both of these data sets. However in recent years it has become clear that this simplistic model cannot explain all observed PKP differential travel times; in particular, the cluster of earthquakes from the South Sandwich Islands (SSI) recorded in Alaska, which show consistent deviation of 2-4 seconds above predicated arrival times in PKPbc-df data. Due to the sparsity of paths sampling the IC in a polar direction, these residuals form the basis of models of IC anisotropy, but their origins are not well understood.\nWe have created a new hand picked South Sandwich Island dataset of 500 PKPbc-df and 216 PKPab-df measurements from 36 events using a cross correlation method. In addition, we adopt two complimentary measurement techniques that have not so far been utilised on PKP waveforms, to add a measurement of uncertainty and statistical significance to existing measurements and to make sure these residual values are not a result of systematic error in picking of the core phases.\nThe new data set and methods suggest that these anomalous residuals are likely not due to the miss picking of core phases. Given that almost all high residual values are recorded on paths with azimuths towards Alaska and, given their scatter, a velocity anomaly due to subduction geometry at the source or receiver side is a possible cause when we consider a non-inner core origin. Here we explore whether the western hemisphere SSI residuals can be modeled using subduction geometry and velocity contrasts at the SSI subduction zone. Such a model could have significant implications for inner core anisotropy.",

The recently launched Leshner Leadership Institute empowers cohorts of mid-career scientists to lead public engagement by supporting their networks of scientists, researchers, and practitioners.\nThe Center works closely with social scientists whose research addresses science communication and public engagement with science to ensure that the Communicating Science training program builds on empirical evidence to inform best practices. Researchers ( Besley, Dudo, & Storkdieck 2015) have helped Center staff and an external evaluator develop pan instrument that measures progress towards goals that are suggested by the researcher, including internal efficacy (increasing scientists’ communication skills and confidence in their ability to engage with the public) and external efficacy (scientists’ confidence in engagement methods).\nEvaluation results from one year of the Communicating Science program suggest that the model of training yields positive results that support scientists in the area that should lead to greater engagement. This talk will explore the model for training, which provides a context for strategic communication, as well as the practical factors, such as time, access to public engagement practitioners, and technical skill, that seems to contribute to increased willingness to engage with public audiences. The evaluation program results suggest willingness by training participants to engage directly or to take preliminary steps towards engagement. In the evaluation results, 38% of trained scientists reported time as a barrier to engagement; 35% reported concern that engagement would distract from their work as a barrier. AAAS works to improve practitioner-researcher-scientist networks to overcome such barriers.",

            "abstract": "Despite the broad applicability of simple fully halogenated hydrocarbons in various industries, the production and use of bromo(chloro)fluorocarbons (Halons) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has been phased out because of the danger they pose to the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer. In addition, all halogen-containing hydrocarbons are infrared active gases because of their strong absorption bands in the region of the atmospheric transparency window between ca. 8 and 12 mm that can affect the Earth’s radiation balance. However, the effort to find replacements continues to return to bromine (chlorine)-containing compounds because of their excellent properties as industrial solvents and cleaning agents and especially because of bromine efficiency as a chemically active flame suppressant. The primary approach to this problem has been to test candidate replacement compounds that have very short atmospheric lifetimes and therefore substantially reduced ozone depleting and radiative impacts.\nReactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and photolysis are the main processes dictating the compound residence time in the atmosphere for a majority of trace gases. In case of very short-lived substances (VSLS) their reaction with OH dictates both the atmospheric lifetime and active halogen release. Therefore, the accuracy of OH kinetic data is of primary importance for the purpose of comprehensive atmospheric modeling of compound’s impact on the atmosphere, such as in ozone depletion and climate change.\nWe demonstrated the ability to determine the OH reaction rate constants over the temperature range of atmospheric interest with the total uncertainty of ~2-3%, thus making laboratory measurements a negligible source of uncertainty in atmospheric modeling. These studies revealed the different reactivity of molecular isomers toward OH and a non-Arrhenius behavior of the temperature dependence to be a rather common kinetic feature of the OH reactivity, which can be accounted for in atmospheric modeling. High accuracy IR and UV absorption spectra were measured to allow the estimation of GWP and ODPs of candidate replacement compounds and their detection in the atmosphere.",

For fluctuations transverse to a strong mean field, this connectivity change be caused by stochastic interchange due to component reconnection. The process may be understood approximately by formulating a diffusion-like Fokker-Planck coefficient [2] that is asymptotically related to standard field line random walk. Quantitative estimates are provided, for transverse magnetic field models and anisotropic models such as reduced magnetohydrodynamics.

            "abstract": "Multiple submarine landslides have been previously documented on the north flank of the Santa Barbara Channel, and such failures are considered capable of generating local tsunamis. 2D seismic-reflection datasets provide a general view of regional framework geology, including faulting and folding associated with north-south compression. However, better understanding of the relationships between faults, folds, stratigraphic architecture, and submarine landslides can be obtained with 3D seismic datasets. In this study we use an industry 3D seismic-reflection volume that encompasses the slope and shelfbreak surrounding the Gaviota submarine landslide (3.8 km2) to investigate structural and stratigraphic controls on slope failure in this region. The depth-migrated seismic volume shows a network of stacked thrust faults, backthrusts, and splays that results in both broad and local zones of compression and folding along the slope and shelf. One localized zone of enhanced folding associated with small-offset thrust faults is located directly beneath the Gaviota landslide headwall, while another zone is located directly below an imaged seafloor fissure. In addition, 3D seismic attribute analysis provides insight into the shallow sedimentary section of the failed and non-failed sedimentary packages. Calculation of RMS amplitude and dominant frequency within a windowed region below the seafloor horizon delineates an apparent zone of gas-charged strata that onlaps onto older folded sediments. The up-dip limit of these gas-charged sediments aligns with the location of a seafloor fissure that extends westward from the Gaviota landslide headwall. We propose that the combination of deformation and fluid charging acted to pre-condition and trigger the failure of the Gaviota landslide, and as a result, the presence of these conditions along the fissure adjacent to the Gaviota landslide suggests this area should be considered landslide prone.",

The upper portions of the watershed are characterized by low-gradient channels and gentle hillslopes and are separated from a steeper, high relief landscape by a series of convex knickzones along channel profiles. Downstream projection of the upper channel profiles implies ~500-600 m of incision, consistent with terrace records of post ~1.7 Ma incision in the Linxia basin. We characterize erosion rates across this transient landscape using both optically-stimulated dating of fluvial terraces and catchment-averaged 10Be concentrations in modern sediment. Both data sets are consistent and suggest erosion/incision rates of ~300 m/Myr below knickpoints and ~50-100 m/Myr above. Field measurements of channel width (n=48) and bankfull discharge (n=9) allow us to determine local scaling relations among channel hydraulic geometry, discharge, and contributing area that we employ to estimate basal shear stress, unit stream power and bedload transport along the main stem of the Daxiahe River. We find a clear downstream increase of incision potential across this transient landscape, consistent with topographic observations and erosion rates. In contrast to recent studies, we find no evidence for adjustment of channel width across the transition from slowly eroding to rapidly eroding portions of the watershed. We hypothesize that this behavior is consistent with detachment-limited models of fluvial incision, despite the presence of significant sediment in channel bed and banks. Our results imply that the controls on hydraulic geometry along actively incising rivers remain incompletely understood.",

These differences will be used to identify expert views on best practice, and improve the teaching of communication skills at the University level. In this pilot study, a perceptions questionnaire was developed and validated. Within this, respondents (geoscientists, engineers, and emergency managers; n=44) were asked to determine their agreement with the use and effectiveness of specific communication strategies (within the first 72 hours after a devastating earthquake) when communicating to the public. In terms of strategies and information to the public, the respondents were mostly in agreement, but there were several statements which elicited large differences between expert responses: 1) the role and purpose of the scientific communication during crises (to persuade people to care, to provide advice, to empower people to take action); 2) the scientist’s delivery (showing the scientists emotions and enthusiasm for scientific concepts they are discussing); and 3) the amount of data that is discussed (being comprehensive versus ‘only the important’ data). The most disagreed upon dimension was related to whether to disclose any political influence on the communication. Additionally, scientists identified that being an effective communicator was an important part of their job, and agreed that it is important to practice these skills. Respondents generally indicated that while scientists should be accountable for the science advice provided, they should not be held liable.",

            "abstract": "The recent increase in the rate of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet is primarily due to the acceleration and thinning of outlet glaciers along the coast. This acceleration is a dynamic response to the retreat of calving fronts, which leads to a loss in resistive stresses. These processes need to be included in ice sheet models in order to be able to accurately reproduce current trends in mass loss, and in the long term reduce the uncertainty in the contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise. Today, the vast majority of ice sheet models that include moving boundaries are one dimensional flow line and vertical flow band models, that are not adapted to the complex geometries of Greenland outlet glaciers, as they do not accurately capture changes in lateral stresses. Here, we use the level set method to track moving boundaries within a 2D plane view model of the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), and investigate the sensitivity of Store Glacier, in western Greenland, to the amount of melting occurring at its calving front. We explore different calving laws and obtain the best results with a new simple calving law adapted from von Mises yield criterion. We show that the ocean circulation near the front and the amount of runoff are able to trigger ice front advance and retreat depending on the amount of melting that they produce at the calving face, but the bed topography controls the stable positions of the ice front. The modeled calving front of Store Glacier, for which we have quality bed topography and sea floor bathymetry data, is particularly stable because of the presence of a large sill at the glacier terminus. If the ice front detaches from this stabilizing sill due to larger amounts of melting at the front or due to large calving events, the glacier front starts to retreat as the bed deepens inland, until it finds another stabilizing feature in the bed topography. The new bed topography maps based on mass conservation make it possible to model more accurately the behavior of Greenland outlet glaciers compared to other mapping techniques.",

Different modes of surface waves have completely different sensitivities to earth structures. If they are not properly separated, the inverted Earth structures using surface waves could be biased. Especially, for Love waves propagating over oceanic paths, the group velocities of fundamental mod and first/second overtoneS are overlapped with each at periods shorter than 100 sec, resulting in strong overtone interferences in seismograms. Most surface wave tomography studies use dispersion curves of fundamental modes in imaging. One challenge in surface wave tomography is to accurately measure the fundamental-mode phase velocities and avoid the contamination by overtones.\nIn this study, we develop an effective way by applying Linear Radon Transform (LRT) to a seismic array to separate fundamental-mode surface waves from higher modes. We apply this method to both synthetic data and real surface waves from USArray. Analysis on synthetic seismograms shows that two-station measurements on reconstructed data obtained after mode separation can completely retrieve the fundamental-mode Love-wave phase velocities. Results on USArray data show that higher mode contamination effects reach up to ∼10-15 percent for two-station and array-based measurements of Love waves, while two-station measurements on mode-separated data obtained by LRT are very close to the predicted values from a global dispersion model of GDM52, demonstrating that the contamination of overtones on fundamental-mode Love wave phase velocity measurements is effectively mitigated by the LRT method and accurate fundamental-mode Love-wave phase velocities can be measured.",

Previous studies have evaluated the coordination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with Hg, but the coordination of POM with Hg has not been thoroughly addressed. Owing to a high density of reactive functional groups, POM will sorb appreciable quantities of Hg, resulting in a large pool of Hg susceptible to organic matter dependent transformations. Particulate organic carbon is also susceptible photolysis, hence chemical changes induced by irradiation by natural sunlight is also important. Further, photo-reduction of Hg(II) to elemental mercury in the presence of DOM has been observed, yet studies examining this process with Hg(II) complexed to POM are less exhaustive. Here, we illustrate that POM derived from fresh plant detritus is a powerful sorbent of Hg(II), and sorbent properties are altered during POM photolysis. Further, we examine redox transformations of Hg(II), and examine functional groups that contribute to mercury association with POM. Batch sorption isotherms of Hg to dark and irradiated POM from ground Phragmites australis (“common reed”) were performed and data was collected using ICP-MS. Coordination of Hg to POM was lower in the irradiated samples, resulting from the decrease in Hg-associated (reduced) sulfur bearing functional groups as measured using X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended x-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS). Further analysis of the dark and irradiated POM was performed using FT-IR microscopy and STXM to determine changes in distribution and alteration of functional groups responsible for Hg sorption to POM.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon storage and decay is regulated by the activity of free-living decomposer microbes, which can be limited by nitrogen availability. Many plants associate with symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi on their roots, which produce nitrogen-degrading enzymes and may be able to compete with free-living decomposers for soil organic nitrogen. By doing so, ectomycorrhizal fungi may able to induce nitrogen limitation and reduce activity of free-living microbial decomposition by mining soil organic nitrogen. The implication is that ectomycorrhizal-dominated systems should have increased soil carbon storage relative to non-ectomycorrhizal systems, which has been confirmed at a global scale. To investigate these effects, we analyzed 364 globally distributed observations of soil fungal communities using 454 sequencing of the ITS region, along with soil C and N concentrations, climate and chemical data. We assigned operational taxonomic units using the QIIME pipeline and UNITE fungal database and assigned fungal reads as ectomycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal based on current taxonomic knowledge. We tested for associations between ectomycorrhizal abundance, climate, and soil carbon and nitrogen. Sites with greater soil carbon had quantitatively more ectomycorrhizal fungi within the soil microbial community based on fungal sequence abundance, after accounting for soil nitrogen availability. This is consistent with our hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal fungi induce nitrogen-limitation of free-living decomposers and thereby increase soil carbon storage. The strength of the mycorrhizal effect increased non-linearly with ectomycorrhizal abundance: the greater the abundance, the greater the effect size. Mean annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture and soil pH were also significant predictors in the final AIC selected model. This analysis suggests that molecular data on soil microbial communities can be used to make quantitative biogeochemical predictions. The signature of ectomycorrhizal competition for nitrogen is present at global scale, and quantitative, which may allow future soil carbon models to incorporate changes in the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in predicting carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "Cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating has become the most widely applied method of developing ages of terminal moraines in the western U.S. Advances in the precision of analytical measurements along with a more accurate understanding of spatial and temporal variations in the production of in situ 10Be have improved the accuracy of cosmogenic exposure dating of moraines. Such improvements afford more accurate assessment of the impact of regional and global-scale climate changes of the Late Pleistocene on glaciation in the western U.S. A great number of new and recalculated cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages of moraines are considered here to identify the most probable drivers of changes in ice extent at the end of the last glacial period.\nThe last Pleistocene glaciation culminated in the western U.S. during marine oxygen isotope stage 2, before or during the onset of the global Last Glacial Maximum at ca. 26.5 ka. Terminal moraine abandonment in several ranges corresponds to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum at ca. 19.0 ka. This observation indicates that most mountain glaciers started retreating in step with the decline of global ice volume, and possibly in response to rising insolation at northern middle latitudes. In some regions, such as the Northern Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, mountain glaciers apparently advanced to or persisted near their maximum terminus positions well after the start of global deglaciation, during the interval of the Oldest Dryas/Heinrich Stadial 1 (ca. 19.0-14.6 ka). Although changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns during this time likely affected mountain glacier extent, rapid ice retreat commenced in nearly all settings by 17.0-16.0 ka. This indication of warming prior to the onset of the Bølling-Allerød interval at ca. 14.6 ka is consistent with records from elsewhere at northern middle latitudes, and supports the hypothesis that warming of the region was in phase with a global rise in atmospheric CO2. This further suggests that any cooling effects of Heinrich Event 1 on glacier mass balance in the western U.S. were overcome by other forcings by 16.0 ka.",

            "abstract": "Realistic geological representation of subsurface heterogeneity remains an important outstanding challenge. While many geostatistical methods exist for representing sedimentary systems, such as multiple-point geostatistics, rule-based methods or Boolean methods, the question of what the prior uncertainty on parameters (or training images) of such algorithms are, remains outstanding. In this initial work, we investigate the use of flume experiments to constrain better such prior uncertainty and to start understanding what information should be provided to geostatistical algorithms. In particular, we study the use of image quilting as a novel multiple-point method for generating fast geostatistical realizations once a training image is provided. Image quilting is a method emanating from computer graphics where patterns are extracted from training images and then stochastically quilted along a raster path to create stochastic variation of the stated training image. In this initial study, we use a flume experiment and extract 10 training images as representative for the variability of the evolving landscape over a period of 136 minutes. The training images consists of wet/dry regions obtained from overhead shots taken over the flume experiment. To investigate whether such image quilting reproduces the same variability of the evolving landscape in terms of wet/dry regions, we generate multiple realizations with all 10 training images and compare that variability with the variability seen in the entire flume experiment. By proper tuning of the quilting parameters we find generally reasonable agreement with the flume experiment.",

            "abstract": "Graphitisation in a convergent plate boundary setting, such as the Alpine Fault, New Zealand, is associated both with fault weakening and orogenic gold mineralisation. Previously, these processes have been investigated in rocks that experienced mineralisation at maximum of greenschist-facies conditions. However, metals are most mobile at upper greenschist- to amphibolite-facies. We examine the microstructural record of mobilisation of graphite at these conditions due to dislocation and diffusion creep in the Alpine Fault zone and as a function of varying shear strain magnitude.\nWe have mapped graphite distribution across a strain gradient in samples, recovered from Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) boreholes, by using reflected light and scanning electron microscopy. Raman spectrometry was used to determine the degree of maturity of the carbonaceous material. In the schists and protomylonites, graphite occurs as very fine (1-5µm), dusty grains, dispersed as inclusions in the main mineral phases (quartz, anorthite, muscovite, biotite). Further into the mylonite zone, the modal proportion of graphite increases and it forms clusters and trains, aligned with the foliation. In the brittlely-deformed rocks (cataclasites and gouges on or near the fault principal slip zone) graphite is most abundant (<50%), occurring as clusters and shear plane parallel trains.\nWe infer shear deformation under both ductile and brittle conditions concentrates the graphite. Independent evidence demonstrates fluid transport and consequent alteration was most important in the brittlely deformed rocks (Sutherland et al., 2012, Geology 40, 1143; Schleicher et al., in press. N.Z.J.Geol&Geophys). We thus infer hydrothermal enrichment caused graphite remobilization, re-deposition, and enrichment in structurally controlled microstructural sites. We will discuss implications of these microstructural and mineralogical changes for strain localisation and deformation-induced permeability.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear monitoring requires a detailed understanding of the physical factors that affect seismic signals. Nuclear tests have frequently been performed in locations with strong topography, and we are performing a series of calculations to determine the effects of topography on seismic signals. We examined the effect of depth beneath a mountainside or other steep slope on seismic waves by performing three 3D nonlinear calculations. The first is placed beneath a mountain; the second is higher and inside the mountain; the third is beneath a flat surface.\nWe find that generation of long period surface waves is strongly dependent on location relative to the slope. Long period surface waves are generated almost entirely by the static horizontal displacement in the upper few hundred meters below the surface. If the explosion is inside the mountain and close enough to the free surface that stress is relieved by the sides of the mountain, then subsurface horizontal displacement is reduced and surface wave amplitudes are reduced dramatically. However, for explosions that are below the mountain, long period surface waves are increased in amplitude.\nIn contrast, regional P and S phases are slightly larger for the explosion in the mountain than beneath it, especially for paths that go across the mountain. Otherwise, there is little difference in regional phases between the flat and topographic calculations.\nFar field P body waves are slightly enhanced by the presence of the mountain due to reduction of the pP interference. Far field SV body waves are reduced in amplitude relative to the flat case because the pS phase which is very strong for a flat surface is reduced in amplitude for the mountain. Far field SH waves which do not exist for the flat surface are comparable in amplitude to SV for the mountain cases.\nNonlinear calculations with topography are difficult because the grid must be brought into gravitational equilibrium before the explosion calculation can be started. We perform an initial calculation without a source to accomplish this. The equilibrium calculation can take quite a long time, so we have developed a new procedure that speeds up the equilibrium run substantially.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing with thermal infrared is widely recognized as good way to estimate surface heat fluxes, map crop water use, and detect water-stressed vegetation. When combined with net radiation and soil heat flux data, observations of sensible heat fluxes derived from surface temperatures (LST) are indicative of instantaneous evapotranspiration (ET). There are, however, substantial reasons LST data may not provide the best way to estimate of ET. For example, it is well known that observations and models of LST, air temperature, or estimates of transport resistances may be so inaccurate that physically based model nevertheless yield non-meaningful results. Furthermore, using visible and near infrared remote sensing observations collected at the same time as LST often yield physically plausible results because they are constrained by less dynamic surface conditions such as green fractional cover. Although sensitivity studies exist that help identify likely sources of error and uncertainty, ET studies typically do not provide a way to assess the relative importance of modeling ET with and without LST inputs. To better quantify model benefits and degradations due to LST observational inaccuracies, a Bayesian uncertainty study was undertaken using data collected in remote sensing experiments at Maricopa, Arizona. Visible, near infrared and thermal infrared data were obtained from an airborne platform. The prior probability distribution of ET estimates were modeled using fractional cover, local weather data and a Penman-Monteith mode, while the likelihood of LST data was modeled from a two-source energy balance model. Thus the posterior probabilities of ET represented the value added by using LST data. Results from an ET study over cotton grown in 2014 and 2015 showed significantly reduced ET confidence intervals when LST data were incorporated.",

            "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin (QB) in the NE Tibetan Plateau provides an exceptional example of an aeolian landscape, comprised of wind-scoured bedrock, yardangs, and sand dunes. Yardangs are elongated ridges, eroded into bedrock, that have a blunt windward end and a leeward end that tapers in the direction of wind flow. A change in wind direction may truncate or overprint older yardangs with new landforms, or a drop-off in wind speed may halt erosion and provide time to develop a soil on the yardang surface. Analysis of 158 yardangs from Google Earth imagery reveals at least three generations of yardangs in the QB, which suggests great shifts in wind paths over time. In addition, 97 dunes were measured to assess present wind direction. The majority of the studied yardangs (n=104) were shaped by NW winds (mean azimuth 140°), consistent with present wind directions based on dune morphology and weather station data. A second generation of yardangs (n=42; mean azimuth 180°) does not align with the present wind regime, and is in places cut by modern landforms, in addition to exhibiting windward erosion from present winds. The oldest evidence for wind erosion is observed from “paleoyardangs” (n=12) that appear to be much older ridges that were buried and then re-exhumed. These paleoyardangs are aligned at roughly 100° and suggest an ancient, westerly wind path. These three populations of yardangs likely record three distinct wind regimes: a recent, Holocene path coming from the NW; an earlier, possibly glacial period, path originating due north and fanning out to the south; and a third, much older, westerly path, resulting from a different climatic or topographic setting. Our data reveal the utility of yardangs as paleoclimate indicators, and thus provides a framework to evaluate Quaternary atmospheric circulation.",

            "abstract": "A key component in understanding the physics of earthquakes is the resolution of the state of stress on the fault before, during and after the earthquake. A large earthquake’s average stress drop is the first order parameter for this task but is still poorly constrained, especially for intermediate and deep events. Classically, the average stress drop is estimated using the corner frequency of observed seismic data. However a simple slip distribution is implicitly assumed; this assumed distribution is often not appropriate for large earthquakes. The average stress drop can be calculated using the inverted finite fault slip model. However, conventional finite fault inversion methods do not directly invert for on-fault stress change; thus it is unclear whether models with significantly different stress drops can match the observations equally well. We developed a new nonlinear inversion to address this concern. The algorithm searches for the solution matching the observed seismic and geodetic data under the condition that the average stress drop is close to a pre-assigned value. We perform inversions with different pre-assigned stress drops to obtain the relationship between the average stress drop of the inverted slip model and the minimum waveform misfit. As an example, we use P and SH displacement waveforms recorded at teleseismic distances from the 2014 Mw 7.9 Rat Island intermediate depth earthquake to determine its average stress drop. Earth responses up to 2 Hz are calculated using an FK algorithm and the PREM velocity structure. Our preliminary analysis illustrates that with this new approach, we are able to define the lower bound of the average stress drop but fail to constrain its upper bound. The waveform misfit associated with the inverted model increases quickly as pre-assigned stress drop decreases from 3 MPa to 0.5 MPa. But the misfit varies negligibly when the pre-assigned stress drop increases from 4.0 MPa to 50 MPa. We notice that the fine-scale roughness of the inverted slip distributions changes dramatically. Future investigations using velocity records, which should be more sensitive to fine scale roughness on the fault surface, will be conducted.",

            "abstract": "Advances in 40Ar/39Ar analytical precision for very young rocks requires collaborative efforts amongst argon geochronology labs to demonstrate age reproducibility commensurate with high precision. NM Tech (NMT), the University of Wisconsin (UW) and Oregon State University (OSU) have each dated Quaternary flux monitor standard AC-2 sanidine (~1.185 Ma), a blind sanidine described as being 50-100 ka (BS) and sanidine from the Qixiangshan (QIX) flow (~10 ka), Changbaishan volcano, China.\nThe samples were irradiated in a single package with FC-2 sanidine (28.201 Ma) as the flux monitor and the irradiated material was distributed amongst the labs. Heizler was present during analysis at both OSU and UW and Jicha attended OSU during analysis. Physical presence was key towards gaining understanding of individual protocols and prompted valuable discussions.\nAnalyses were carried out on single crystals using total fusion and/or step heating approaches. Age agreement was achieved within 2s uncertainty that ranged between (0.03-0.3%, 0.13-0.37% and 1.8-2.6%) for AC-2, BS and QIX, respectively. Each lab found AC-2 to vary somewhat beyond a normal distribution and to yield an age relative to FC-2 of ~1.185 Ma that is ~1.3% (~5-10 sigma) lower than some published estimates. A key cause of the variation between this study and previous results may be variable gas pressure equilibration times between extraction line and mass spectrometer coupled with variable choices to estimate time zero by other laboratories. The majority of our efforts concentrated on the QIX sanidine where prior data obtained by our labs revealed a factor of two spread in age (~11 and 23 ka) based on experiments carried out by total fusion and bulk incremental heating. By conducting single crystal age spectrum analysis we were able to mitigate effects of melt inclusion hosted excess argon and xenocrystic contamination towards obtaining analytical agreement with apparent ages near 10 ka. However, philosophical differences in choosing data subsets leads to variable eruption age estimates between about 7.6±0.2 and 10.5±0.5 ka.\nOur collaborative efforts continue to show that overall the argon community is making very good progress towards achieving the Earthtime goal of high precision interlaboratory calibration.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies using continuous GPS to estimate changes in terrestrial water storage point to a future where the global GPS infrastructure for monitoring crustal deformation can be leveraged for hydrological applications. Seasonal water and snow loading has long been known to generate an elastic earth response that is observable by GPS, but only recently have these signals been modeled to recover the underlying loads at local and regional scales. It has also been shown that GPS can be used to monitor subtle surface deformation due to the response of the hydrological system to drought, and to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of related water loss. In this work, we extend the temporal range of the analysis from drought-focused interannual signals to event-scale loading from individual storms and show the promise and challenges of applying GPS observations to these new higher-frequency hydrometeorological phenomena. We also estimate the magnitude and distribution of surface water fluctuations from recent extreme precipitation events in the continental USA and show how GPS might be used to better characterize the accompanying water storage changes and potential hydrometerological hazards.",

Multi-scale data including lithofacies core samples, X-ray diffraction, digital rock physics scans, scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, well log data including sonic and dipole sonic, and surface 3D seismic reflection data will be integrated to establish and/or validate a new or existing rock physics model that best represents our reservoir rock types and characteristics. We will acquire compressional wave velocity and shear wave velocity data from Mississippian and Arbuckle cores by running ultrasonic tests using an Ult 100 Ultrasonic System and a 12 ton hydraulic jack located in the geophysics lab in Thompson Hall at Kansas State University. The elastic constants Young’s Modulus, Bulk Modulus, Shear (Rigidity) Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio will be extracted from these velocity data. Ultrasonic velocities will also be compared to sonic and dipole sonic log data from the Wellington 1-32 well. These data will be integrated to validate a lithofacies classification statistical model, which will be and partially has been applied to the largely unknown saline Arbuckle formation, with hopes for a connection, perhaps via Poisson’s ratio, allowing a time-lapse seismic feasibility assessment and potentially developing a transformation of compressional wave sonic velocities to shear wave sonic for all wells, where compressional wave sonic is available. We will also be testing our rock physics model by predicting effects of changing effective (brine + CO2 +hydrocarbon) fluid composition on seismic properties and the implications on feasibility of seismic monitoring. Lessons learned from characterizing the Mississippian are essential to understanding the potential of utilizing similar workflows for the much less known saline aquifer of the Arbuckle in south central Kansas.",

One major science goal of the campaign was to observe a Lagrangian transition from thin stratocumulus (Sc) upwind near California to trade cumulus (Cu) nearer to Hawaii. Cloud properties were observed from the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research plane (GV) using the HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) and the HIAPER Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), among other instrumentation. Aircraft observations were complemented by a suite of satellite-derived products. To observe a the evolution of airmasses over the course of two days, upwind regions were sampled on an outbound flight to from Sacramento, CA, to Kona, HI. The sampled airmasses were then tracked using HYSPLIT trajectories based on GFS model forecasts, and the return flight to California was planned to intercept those airmasses, using satellite observation to track cloud evolution in the interim. This approach required that trajectories were reasonably stable up to 3 days prior to final sampling, and also that forecast trajectories were in agreement with post-flight analysis and visual cloud feature tracking. The extent to which this was realised, and hence the validity of this new approach to Lagrangian airmass observation, is assessed here. We also present results showing that a Sc-Cu airmass transition was consistently observed during the CSET study using measurements from research flights and satellite.",

Many farmers on Polder 32 use a crop rotation of rice cultivation in the wet season and shrimp farming in the dry season, and studies have shown that this rotation can increase soil salinity and acidity. Soil samples were collected in May 2013, October 2013 and May 2014 from rice paddies and shrimp ponds on the polder, from adjacent tidal channels, and from the Sunderbans mangrove forest to the SE of the polder, and analyzed for both geochemical and physical parameters and then subjected to statistical tests and mapped using geographic information system software to find correlations. Results support the belief that soil salinity, acidity and arsenic concentration exhibit spatial variation, and soil salinity and acidity show seasonal variation with salinity elevated in the dry season (May) and acidity elevated in the wet season (October). Results suggest that Hydrous Ferric Oxyhydroxides (HFOs) are present in October and sulfides are present in May, so that reducing conditions that lead to reduction of HFOs and precipitation of sulfides must occur between October and May. Rice grown in paddies should be unaffected by salt concentrations in the wet season, while arsenic concentrations in soil may be high enough to cause unsafe As levels in produced rice. No evidence of soil acidification was found, most likely due to the presence of soil carbonate.",

(1986) and Davis (1999), research centered at CSU Bakersfield over the past 15 years has generated a high resolution paleoclimate history with water resource implications for one of the world’s great agricultural centers, the San Joaquin Valley of California. Lake level is based upon aerial mapping of geomorphological features (e.g., sand spits and shorelines), lithologic features exposed in trenches from opposite sides of the lake basin (e.g., marsh deposits), and proxy data from core (e.g., clay %). Age control was provided by radiocarbon dating of charcoal, mussel shells, and bulk organic matter and by paleomagnetic secular variation dating. From oldest to youngest, highlights include: 1. millennial-scale variations at the base of the record, 2. evidence for avulsion of the Kings River into Tulare Lake at or near the time of maximum glaciation in the Sierra Nevada as predicted by Weissman et al. (2005), 3. lake-level changes during the early and middle Holocene that vary in tune with eastern Pacific sea-surface temperatures from marine core records. This includes an unusually wet period starting at 12,500 cal B.P. followed by a dramatic, rapid drop in lake level at 7,500 cal B.P. Evidence for the former feature includes geochemical (leaf wax n-alkane markers for grass) and petrographic (grass phytolith) data. The latter feature represents an abrupt decrease in Sierran Stream discharge equal to several millions of acre-ft/yr. 4. A centuries-long increase in lake level commencing in the 13th or 14th century based on both lake-level reconstructions from the LBDA of Cook et al. (2010) and dated fine-grained sediments exposed in high-elevation trenches (Negrini et al., 2006), 5. A flood deposit identified in the uppermost sediments exposed in the southeastern edge of the lake that has a radiocarbon age consistent with that of an early 17th century flood found in the sediments of the Santa Barbara Channel (Schimmelmann et al., 1998).",

            "abstract": "Understanding the temporal and spatial variability of water sources within a basin is vital to our ability to manage the impacts of climate variability and land cover change. Water stable isotopes can be used as a tool to determine geographic and seasonal sources of water at the basin scale. Previous studies in the Coastal Range of Oregon reported that the variation in the isotopic signatures of surface water does not conform to the commonly observed “rainout effect”, which exhibits a trend of increasing isotopic depletion with rising elevation. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the mechanisms governing seasonal and spatial variations in the isotopic signature of surface waters within the Marys River Basin, located in the Oregon Coastal Range. We hypothesize that catchment orientation, drainage area, geology, and topography act as controlling factors on groundwater flow, storage, and atmospheric moisture cycling, which explain variations in source water contribution.  Surface water and precipitation samples were collected every 2-3 weeks for isotopic analysis of δ18O and δ2H for one year. Preliminary results indicate a significant difference (p<0.001) in isotopic signature between watersheds underlain by basalt and sandstone. The degree of separation is the most distinct during the summer when low flows likely reflect deeper groundwater sources, whereas isotopic signatures during the rainy season (fall & winter) show a greater degree of similarity between the two lithologies. These findings indicate that the more permeable sandstone formations may be hydrologically connected to enriched water sources on the windward side of the Coastal Range that sustain baseflow within catchments on the leeward side, while streams draining basalt catchments are fed by a more depleted source of water (e.g. precipitation originating within the Marys River Basin).",

In this study, the final run post real-time IMERG is evaluated with all-weather manual gauge observations over CONUS from June 2014 through May 2015. Relative Bias (RB), Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Probability Of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), and Critical Success Index (CSI) are used to quantify the performance of IMERG. The performance of IMERG in estimating snowfall precipitation is highlighted in the study. This timely evaluation with all-weather gauge observations is expected to offer insights into performance of IMERG and thus provide useful feedback to the algorithm developers as well as the GPM data users.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the international trade of food and agricultural commodities has undergone a marked increase of exchanged volumes and an expansion of the trade network. This globalization of trade has both positive and negative effects, but the interconnectedness and external dependency of countries generate complex dynamics which are often difficult to understand and model. In this study we consider the volume of water used for the production of agricultural commodities, virtually exchanged among countries through commodity trade, i.e. the virtual water trade. Then, we set up a parsimonious mechanistic model describing the propagation, into the global trade network, of food-production crises generated locally by a social, economic or environmental event (such as war, economic crisis, drought, pest). The model, accounting for the network structure and the virtual water balance of all countries, bases on rules derived from observed virtual water flows and on data-based and statistically verified assumption. It is also tested on real case studies that prove its capability to capture the main features of crises propagation. The model is then employed as the basis for the development of an index of country vulnerability, measuring the exposure of countries to crises propagating in the virtual water trade network. Results of the analysis are discussed within the context of socio-economic and environmental conditions of countries, showing that not only water-scarce, but also wealthy and globalized countries, are among the most vulnerable to external crises. The temporal analysis for the period 1986-2011 reveals that the global average vulnerability has strongly increased over time, confirming the increased exposure of countries to external crises which may occur in the virtual water trade network.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the largest source of Earth’s climate variability on interannual time scales, has massive impacts on extreme weathers, agriculture and ecosystems, particularly during extreme El Niño events, such as the 1982/83 and 1997/98 episodes. However, the associated mechanism is not fully understood, hindering their forecasts, as attested by the false alarm of an extreme El Niño in 2014 predicted by many models. Recent studies have identified additional precursors beyond westerly wind anomalies and oceanic heat content along the equatorial Pacific, including the southwest Pacific southerly jets, which tend to occur strongly and concurrently with equatorial westerly anomalies during extreme El Niño, but NOT during weak El Niño events. Here we show that the concurrences of southwest Pacific southerlies, anomalous equatorial westerlies, and their relationship, are modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)/Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), even on daily timescales. During a positive phase of the PDO/IPO, occurrences of westerly wind events (WWEs), in the region between the Maritime continent and the eastern Pacific Ocean, are reinforced by the southwest Pacific southerly surges (SPSSs) in austral winter. By contrast, during a negative phase of the PDO/IPO, such SPSSs are not reinforcing WWEs; instead stronger SPSSs are associated with weaker WWEs. This interdecadal contrast in the relationship between SPSSs and WWEs contributes to the decadal variations in the frequency of extreme El Niño events. The associated mechanism will be discussed.",

Wettability of fluids within reservoir materials is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of structural and residual trapping, two major mechanisms of geologic sequestration. Individual reservoir minerals are often targeted for wettability studies. Current practice applies these results, recorded under laboratory conditions, to in‐situ reservoir rock; however the wide variety of measured contact angles reported in the literature calls this practice into question.\nTo address these issues and to study the wettability of shale caprock, resedimentation techniques are employed. These techniques allow for the creation of synthetic shales with controlled, homogeneous mineralogies. In addition, the systematic variation of the mineralogy allows for the characterization of shale wettability as a function of mineralogical composition. A novel design has been developed and used to conduct wettability experiments at reservoir conditions using high resolution X-ray computer tomography. Using this technique the wettability of resedimented shales and natural shales are compared at different reservoir conditions. Next, Lattice Boltzmann modelling methods are used to simulate capillary entry pressure into a shale capillary. Adhesion parameters along the wall are tuned to the results of the synthetic shales and heterogeneity is incorporated to estimate the capillary entry pressure into a natural shale. Understanding the mineralogical components of shale wetting allows for the prediction of capillary entry pressure based on shale mineralogy which can be used to help select secure CO2 storage sites.",

The evaluation of the stability of the rock blocks by the hammering test is based on qualitative expert judgment. In this study, the authors analyzed the sound obtained from the hammering test, and proposed a method to evaluate quantitatively the stability of the rock blocks based on the analysis results. The authors used a hammering apparatus which is able to apply constant hammering force to an object in order to evaluate the stability of the rock blocks based on the intensity of the sound. The authors simultaneously obtained the sound pressure waveform and the vibrating acceleration waveform when hammering rock blocks, and verified the Fourier amplitude spectrum form of them were roughly agreed with each other. This result shows that the sound pressure data obtained by the hammering method contains information on vibration of the rock blocks. In addition, the authors found that the amplitudes of the sound pressure Fourier spectrum from the rock block with open cracks were larger than that from the rock block with closed cracks. Similarly, the amplitudes of the sound pressure Fourier spectrum from the rock block were larger than those from the bed rock without crocks. These differences were remarkable in the frequency range between 0 Hz and 1,000 Hz. Based on these results, the authors suggested a procedure to estimate quantitatively the stability of the rock blocks on slopes by focusing attention on the sound pressure Fourier spectrum from the rock block in frequency range between 0 and 1,000 Hz.",

            "abstract": "It is reported in this study that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which has been known to directly affect winter weather conditions in western Europe and the eastern United States, is also linked to surface air temperature and snow melting over the broad southwestern U.S. (SWUS) region in the early warm season. Monthly time-scale correlation and composite analyses using three different multidecadal temperature datasets reveal that NAO-related upstream circulation positively affects not only the means, but also the extremes, of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the SWUS. This NAO effect is primarily linked with the positioning of upper-tropospheric anticyclones over the western United States that are associated with development of the positive NAO phase. This link has been strengthened in the last 30-yr period (1980–2009), compared to the previous 30-yr period (1950–79).\nWe further examine the impact of NAO on snow melting using snow equivalent water (SWE) of automated snow telemetry (SNOTEL) over SWUS. The significant negative correlations widespread in SWUS between the NAO average and zero-SWE date during snow melting periods, indicate that frequent positive (negative) NAO phases enhance (delay) snow melting inter-annually. This linkage is found to be stronger at the low-elevation sites below 3200 m. The underlying mechanism for this linkage is that positive (negative) NAO phases tend to bring not only warmer (colder) but also drier (wetter) weather conditions to the SWUS region in spring. These results emphasize the role of NAO on springtime weather conditions, snowpack characteristics, and related water resource over the SWUS region.",

            "abstract": "Records of past geomagnetic intensity fluctuations provide important constraints on dynamical processes in the outer core. PADM2M is a reconstruction of the 0 to 2 Ma axial dipole moment primarily based on global sediment records, but calibrated by absolute paleointensity data. Ziegler & Constable (2011) showed that for periods longer than 25 kyr the dipole spends more time decaying than growing: thus its average growth rate is greater than its decay rate. The observed asymmetry is not limited to times when the field is reversing, and may reveal a critical dynamic of the outer core. We assess the robustness of the initial result through development of improved analysis methods and explore the possibility of identifying the asymmetry in alternative recording media and at other epochs. Improved low pass filtering is used to identify asymmetry (percent time growing, pg < 50% ) and to quantify its uncertainty via bootstrap methods. The original results are significant and do not depend on the specifics of the filtering process, although the cutoff period corresponding to the peak in asymmetry varies relative to the initial analyses.\nA long-term record of geomagnetic intensity should also be preserved by the thermoremanence of oceanic crust and stacks of marine magnetic anomalies are inverted to provide an independent means of assessing the asymmetry seen in PADM2M. We first examine a 0 to 780 kyr record from the East Pacific Rise near 19ºS finding that pg departures from 50% are not statistically significant. We believe the record is too short and noisy; comparing the power spectra of the datasets supports this. Overall coherence with PADM2M never rises above 0.4 and, despite the presence of obvious long term geomagnetic signals in the record, the primary signals at periods of 25 - 50ky are almost certainly due to variations in crustal accretion.\nA better candidate for analysis is a stack of near-bottom records from chron C5 in the NE Pacific. Multiple nearby records have high coherence, corresponding to global lineations extending over a 2My interval. Here we find pg is significantly less than 50% at periods of 10-30kyr and 60-75kyr, similar to PADM2M. This result indicates that other recording media carry a record of the asymmetric behavior first found in PADM2M and that it was present during other time periods.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive picture of current plate-boundary deformation requires integration of short-term geodetic records with longer-term geologic strain. Comparing rates of deformation across these time intervals highlights potential time-dependencies in both geodetic and geologic records and yields critical insight into the earthquake deformation process. The southern Walker Lane Belt in eastern California represents one location where short-term strain recorded by geodesy apparently outpaces longer-term geologic fault slip measured from displaced rocks and landforms. This discrepancy persists both for individual structures and across the width of the deforming zone, where ~1 cm/yr of current dextral shear exceeds Quaternary slip rates summed across individual faults. The Owens Valley and Little Lake fault systems form the western boundary of the southern Walker Lane and host a range of published slip rate estimates from ~1 – 7 mm/yr over varying time intervals based on both geodetic and geologic measurements. New analysis of offset geomorphic piercing lines from airborne lidar and field measurements along the Owens Valley fault provides a snapshot of deformation during individual earthquakes and over many seismic cycles. Viewed in context of previously reported ages from pluvial and other landforms in Owens Valley, these offsets suggest slip rates of ~0.6 – 1.6 mm/yr over the past 103 – 105 years. Such rates agree with similar estimates immediately to the south on the Little Lake fault, where lidar measurements indicate dextral slip averaging ~0.6 – 1.3 mm/yr over comparable time intervals. Taken together, these results suggest steady, modest slip in the absence of significant variations over the Mid-to-Late Quaternary for a ~200 km span of the southwestern Walker Lane. Our findings argue against the presence of long-range fault interactions and slip-rate variations for this portion of the larger, regional fault network. This result also suggests that faster slip-rate estimates from geodetic measurements reflect transients over much shorter time scales. Additionally, the persistence of relatively faster geodetic shear in comparison with time-averaged fault slip leaves open the possibility of significant off-fault deformation or slip on subsidiary structures across the Owens Valley.",

            "abstract": "With observations showing accelerated mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet due to surface melt, the Greenland Ice Sheet is becoming one of the most significant contributors to sea level rise. The contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet o sea level rise is likely to accelerate in the coming decade and centuries as atmospheric temperatures continue to rise, potentially triggering ever larger surface melt rates. However, at present considerable uncertainty remains in projecting the contribution to sea level of the Greenland Ice Sheet both due to uncertainty in atmospheric forcing and the ice sheet response to climate forcing. Here we seek an upper bound on the contribution of surface melt from the Greenland to sea level rise in the coming century using a surface energy balance model coupled to an englacial model. We use IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5, RCP6, RCP4.5, RCP2.6) climate scenarios from an ensemble of global climate models in our simulations to project the maximum rate of ice volume loss and related sea-level rise associated with surface melting. To estimate the upper bound, we assume the Greenland Ice Sheet is perpetually covered in thick clouds, which maximize longwave radiation to the ice sheet. We further assume that deposition of black carbon darkens the ice substantially turning it nearly black, substantially reducing its albedo. Although assuming that all melt water not stored in the snow/firn is instantaneously transported off the ice sheet increases mass loss in the short term, refreezing of retained water warms the ice and may lead to more melt in the long term. Hence we examine both assumptions and use the scenario that leads to the most surface melt by 2100. Preliminary models results suggest that under the most aggressive climate forcing, surface melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet contributes ~1 m to sea level by the year 2100. This is a significant contribution and ignores dynamic effects. We also examined a lower bound, assuming negligible longwave radiation and albedo near the maximum observed for freshly fallen snow. Even under this scenarios preliminary estimates suggest tens of centimeters of sea level rise by 2100.",

            "abstract": "While the concept of fluid-induced seismic activity has been studied over the last few decades, the increase in felt - and sometimes damaging - events over the last few years has escalated the need to be able to model the ongoing processes and forecast possible seismicity. For a complete estimate of the impact of a proposed fluid injection, it is important to include hazard estimates into the calculations. Here we introduce the combination of the RSQsim earthquake simulator and the RiskCat code.\nThe physics-based earthquake simulator RSQsim is based on rate-state friction and was originally designed to model large-scale scenarios, such as for example those for UCERF3. The creators recently added the possibility to account for pressure increases due to fluid injections within RSQsim. The knowledge about the pore-pressure distribution is added to the increase in stresses due to tectonic loading. We use the output of the RSQsim simulations as input for the RiskCat calculations in order to determine hazard rates.\nHere we present calculations based on a fault set-up with realistic values found in the Southern San Joaquin Valley. The pore-pressure distributions needed for the input into RSQsim are calculated with the TOUGH code framework. Through TOUGH, we obtain complex pore-pressure time histories, based on realistic examples. By having these input values, we create a more realistic scenario of the expected seismic activity and the hazard levels. We propose that methods like this will be used in advance of fluid injections for prospective projects.",

            "abstract": "The Siletzia terrane, located in the Cascadia forearc region of Oregon, Washington and Vancouver Island, consists of a series of accreted basaltic pillow lavas, massive flows and intrusive sheets. It represents a late Paleocene–Eocene oceanic large igneous province (LIP), previously proposed to represent an accreted oceanic plateau, hotspot island chain, backarc basin, island arc, or a sequence of slab window volcanics formed by ridge subduction. A province-wide geochemical reassessment of the terrane, including new high precision Sr-Pb-Nd-Hf isotope data on basaltic samples, has been used to assess the validity of the proposed tectonomagmatic models for Siletzia. The trace element data show REE patterns that are flat to LREE enriched with an absence of any arc signatures. These features are comparable to other oceanic plateaus such as the Ontong Java and the Caribbean and so therefore support a mantle plume origin. Initial isotope ratios range from 206Pb/204Pb = 18.869 – 19.673, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.527 – 15.609, 208Pb/204Pb = 38.551 – 39.220, εHf = +9.0 – 14.8, εNd = +5.0 – 8.0 and 87Sr/86Sr = 0.70304 – 0.70397. The isotope signatures become more varied southward across the terrane and reveal two trends: i) HIMU–DMM and ii) another extending from DMM towards the Imnaha component, thought to represent the mantle plume source of the Columbia River Basalts and Yellowstone 1,2. The data may support the previously proposed idea that the volcanism of the Siletzia terrane represents initial melting of the mantle plume head of the Yellowstone hotspot 3,4,5. Other evidence indicating a LIP origin includes the relatively rapid eruption/intrusion of an estimated magma volume of 2.6 x 106 km3 6 between ~56-49 Ma 5, which, in conjunction with our new elemental and isotopic data, indicates that the Siletzia terrane most likely represents an accreted oceanic plateau.\n1.

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important variable in hydrological systems as its part of the water cycle in the atmosphere, the land surface and subsurface. Microwave remote sensing is a viable tool to monitor global soil moisture conditions at regular time intervals. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is a sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission 1 – Water that was launched in May 2012. Multiple soil moisture products from AMSR2 observations exist; these were compared and combined with special emphasis to the global scale. The first product is retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm, the other uses the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). These two products were compared against each other and evaluated against COSMOS data over the United States, Australia, Europe and Africa. The temporal correlations highlight differences in the representation of the seasonal cycle of soil moisture. It is hypothesized that four factors, physical surface temperatures, surface roughness, vegetation and ground soil wetness conditions, affect the quality of soil moisture retrievals. The complementary between the products led to the opportunity to combine them into a superior one that benefits from the strengths of both algorithms.\nThese soil moisture algorithms share the same background in the radiative transfer model, but each algorithm applies different approaches to reflect various external conditions. As a result, the performance of the products is complementary in many locations in terms of bias, RMSE and, most importantly temporal correlation coefficients. Here, we present a methodology that combines the two AMSR2 based soil moisture products into a single product, which improves the overall performance by leveraging the strengths of the individual products. The new product is combined by applying an optimal weighting factor, calculated based on variance and correlation coefficients against a reference dataset. The complementary behaviour of individual soil moisture retrieval algorithms, in combination with leveraging their strengths in the combination approach, may be of interest for National Aeronautics Space Administration’ (NASA) recently launched Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission dedicated to soil moisture monitoring.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_v2.pdf\nA grand challenge in environmental science is predicting the future trajectory of the terrestrial carbon cycle as simulated in coupled Earth System Models. However, simulations remain highly uncertain despite ever increasing availability of observations. Therefore, finding new ways to use data to evaluate, benchmark and constrain models, and improve forecasts through data assimilation, is critical to making progress in reducing these uncertainties.\nOne of the largest sources of “big data” for use in biogeosciences is becoming available from the NSF-funded National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). This represents enormous potential for enhancing carbon cycle modeling, but also a new challenge in how such large amounts of information can be utilized most effectively. NEON data will be streaming from approximately 15,000 sensors, of roughly 200 distinct types with measurement frequencies up to 40 hertz. Observations will be made at 2000 plots at over 60 sites, and NEON will acquire airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data over 5500 km2 at sub 1-meter resolution annually. In all, NEON will be producing about a petabyte of data per year.\nIn this presentation we first provide a update on the status of NEON. Second, we illustrate how many NEON observations correspond with key pools and fluxes of carbon and water in land surface models at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. We then highlight some of the challenges associated with using site level data such as these with gridded, global land surface models due to mismatches in scales, and how these might be addressed. Finally, we demonstrate how infrastructure we have developed coupling the Community Land Model and the Data Assimilation Testbed allows us to assimilate NEON-type data, and conduct an observing system simulation experiment that investigated the impact of network design on modeled carbon pools and fluxes across North America.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol effects are considered a major source of uncertainty in global climate models and the direct and indirect radiative forcings have strong model dependency. These forcings are routinely evaluated (and calibrated) against observations, among them satellite retrievals are greatly used for their near-global coverage. However, the forcings calculated from model output are not directly comparable with those computed from satellite retrievals since sampling and algorithmic differences (such as cloud screening, noise reduction, and retrieval) between models and observations are not accounted for. It is our hypothesis that the conventional model validation procedures for comparing satellite observations and model simulations can mislead model development and introduce biases. Hence, we have developed an aerosol lidar simulator for global climate models that simulates the CALIOP lidar signal at 532nm. The simulator uses the same algorithms as those used to produce the “GCM-oriented CALIPSO Aerosol Product” to (1) objectively sample lidar signal profiles; and (2) derive aerosol fields (e.g., extinction profile, aerosol type, etc) from lidar signals. This allows us to sample and derive aerosol fields in the model and real atmosphere in identical ways. Using the Department of Energy’s ACME model simulations, we found that the simulator-retrieved aerosol distribution and aerosol-cloud interactions are significantly different from those computed from conventional approaches, and that the model is much closer to satellite estimates than previously believed.",

Its determination is a major goal of the Juno mission (2016-17) and it will be difficult to determine because it is expected to be only a few percent of the total mass. It has long been known that there is no prospect of determining the nature of this core (e.g., its density) from gravity measurements, even though the mass can be estimated. By consideration of simple models that are nonetheless faithful to the essential physics, it is further shown that should the core be contaminated with light elements (hydrogen and helium) then the gravity data can tell us the core mass as defined (with some caveats about the fuzziness of its boundary) but not the total mass within some small radius (which could include any light elements mixed in). This is both good and bad news: Good in that the core is thought to be diagnostic of the conditions under which the planet formed but bad in that the admixture also tells us more about both formation process and core erosion. Further, a linear perturbation theory has been developed that provides an easy approximate way of determining how errors in the equation of state (EOS) propagate into errors in the estimated core mass or envelope enrichment in heavies in models that nonetheless satisfy all observables. This theory does not require detailed models of the planet but provides an integral mapping from changes in the EOS into approximate changes in radius at fixed mass, and low degree gravity (or moment of inertia, MOI). This procedure also shows that there exist perturbations that leave the radius, mass and MOI unchanged but cause a change in J2, though in practice the non-uniqueness of structure by this consideration (~0.2% or less in MOI for example) is less than the non-uniqueness arising from likely EOS uncertainties (~1% in total mass, potentially 30% in core mass). Although the likely independent determination of MOI from precession is expected to help in the modeling procedure, the uncertainty in EOS and in the distribution of heavy elements (and resulting non-adiabaticity) will necessarily introduce ambiguity into the determination of core mass.",

Here we present the results of a global synthesis of eddy fluxes from 29 globally distributed aquatic sites. The objective of this study was to quantify the magnitudes and variation of energy and CO2 fluxes and investigate their responses to environmental controls across half-hourly to monthly time scales. The coupled observations of in-lake physical and biogeochemical parameters with meteorology and eddy covariance fluxes were analyzed using decomposed correlation and wavelength coherence analysis to quantify the critical time scales that are associated with variation of energy and CO2 fluxes, and related drivers. The rates of fluxes were synthesized according to time scale, climate, and water body type. The diurnal cycles of both energy and CO2 fluxes variation were attributed to wind speed, solar radiation cycle, vapor pressure deficit, temperature gradients at water-air interface, and metabolism. Weekly time scales of variations were correlated with synoptic weather patterns. The monthly sums of energy fluxes showed a latitudinal gradient with the maxima observed in mid-latitude waterbodies. We found an inconsistent latitudinal pattern of monthly CO2 fluxes. Instead, we found correlation with proxies of lake productivity suggesting lake-specific characteristics play an important role in controlling flux magnitudes and variation. The results presented here highlight the importance of quantifying short-term variation of energy and trace gases fluxes towards improving the understanding of the water and carbon cycles and linked ecological processes.",

By comparing different layers of cloud types classified in the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product from CloudSat+CALIPSO to those cloud properties observed by MODIS, we evaluate the occurrence frequencies of cloud types and cloud-overlap in CloudSat+CALIPSO for each MODIS cloud regime defined by cloud optical depth (τ) and cloud-top pressure (P) histograms.\nWe find that about 70% of MODIS clear sky agrees with the clear category in CloudSat+CALIPSO; whereas the remainder is either single layer (~25%) cirrus (Ci), low-level cumulus (Cu), stratocumulus (Sc), or multi-layer (<5%) clouds in CloudSat+CALIPSO. Under MODIS cloudy conditions, 60%, 28%, and 8% of the occurrences show single-, double-, and triple-layer clouds, respectively in CloudSat+CALIPSO. When MODIS identifies single-layer clouds, 50–60% of the MODIS low-level clouds are categorized as stratus (Sc) in CloudSat+CALIPSO. Over the tropics, ~70% of MODIS high and optically thin clouds (considered as cirrus in the histogram) is also identified as Ci in CloudSat+CALIPSO, and ~40% of MODIS high and optically thick clouds (considered as convective in the histogram) agrees with CloudSat+CALIPSO deep convections (DC). Over mid-latitudes these numbers drop to 45% and 10%, respectively. The best agreement occurs in tropical single-layer cloud regimes, where 90% of MODIS high-thin clouds are identified as Ci by CloudSat+CALIPSO and 60% of MODIS high-thick clouds are identified as DC. Worst agreement is found for multi-layer clouds, where cirrus on top of low- and mid-level clouds in MODIS are frequently categorized as high-thick clouds by passive imaging – among these only 5–12% are DC in CloudSat+CALIPSO. It is encouraging that both MODIS low-level clouds (regardless of optical thickness) and high-level thin clouds are consistently classified by CloudSat+CALIPSO as Sc and Ci, respectively. MODIS mid-level clouds, on the other hand, are classified as a variety of cloud types by CloudSat+CALIPSO, confirming limitations in passive remote sensing of these types of clouds.",

            "abstract": "Tile drains are widely used in the Midwestern United States to improve the productivity of poorly drained agricultural fields. Since tile drain reduces vadose zone soil moisture by lowering the water table, and its outlets feed directly into streams and ditches, tile flow can affect various hydrologic, biotic and biogeochemical processes in the watershed. However, the effects of tile flow on ecohydrologic and nutrient dynamics at scales dominated by microtopographic variability, such as depression and roadside ditches, remain poorly understood. Here we present an explicit model of tile flow and incorporate into the integrated ecohydrologic-flow model, MLCan-GCSFlow, to investigate the impacts of tile drain on ecohydrologic and nutrient dynamics in intensively managed agricultural fields at lidar-resolution scales. Explicit coupling between subsurface and tile flow is obtained by modifications of variably saturated Richards equation to capture the impacts of tile drain on soil moisture. The coupling between subsurface and overland flow is obtained by prescribing a boundary condition switching approach at the top surface of the computational domain. Model results for study sites in Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes (IMLCZO) show the significance of tile drain flow on the vertical and spatial soil moisture distribution and coupled surface - sub-surface flow dynamics.",

The National Severe Storms Laboratory’s mobile dual-pol X-band radar, NOXP, was deployed in the Pigeon River Basin during this time and employed various scanning strategies, including more than 1000 Range Height Indicator (RHI) scans in coordination with another radar and research aircraft. Rain gauges and disdrometers were also positioned within the basin to verify precipitation estimates and estimation of microphysical parameters. The performance of the SCOP-ME post-processing algorithm on NOXP data is compared with real-time and near real-time precipitation estimates with varying spatial resolutions and quality control measures (Stage IV gauge-corrected radar estimates, Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System Quantitative Precipitation Estimates, and CMORPH satellite estimates) to assess the utility of a gap-filling radar in complex terrain. Additionally, the RHI scans collected in this IOP provide a valuable opportunity to examine the evolution of microphysical characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation as they impinge on terrain. To further the understanding of orographically enhanced precipitation, multiple storms for which RHI data are available are considered.",

Then during the recovery phase electrons are clearly diffusing inwards and forming a pronounced split-structure encompassing a narrow newly formed slot region around L=3. SAMPEX observations are first compared with electron and proton observations on NOAA POES and HEO to validate that the observed unusual dynamics is not caused by contamination by protons. In this study, we perform the time-dependent 3D Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) simulations of 1 MeV electron flux evolution and have compared the results with the SAMPEX HILT observations. The result shows that the overall time evolution of the observed split structure is in a good agreement with our model simulations. We find that this new belt at energy of ~1 MeV is resulted from scattering by plasmaspheric hiss to the Earth’s atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores the existence of significant trends in near-surface temperature and precipitation over the South American continent by using observational data and estimates of natural variability based on simulations with numerical climate models. Trends are computed from three observational datasets in the period 1975-2004 for temperature and 1955-2004 for precipitation. Significance of the trends is tested against the null hypothesis that they arise from natural variability alone, which is estimated from the output of a suite of CMIP5 pre-industrial control experiments. Trends obtained from the observational datasets are compared with those simulated by CMIP5 historical runs, in which observed external transient forcing is imposed, and with those from simulations with natural-only forcing. In the case of temperature, an overall warming trend is found over the entire South American continent (0.23 C per decade). Significant trends (at the 95% level) are found in a region that corresponds roughly to Brazil with maximum warming over the north-central part. The average trends over South America in the observations broadly agree with those in the CMIP5 historical simulations for all seasons. This agreement is less close for the natural-only forcing simulations. The maximum warming over north-central Brazil is generally underestimated by the models. In the case of precipitation, trends vary both in sign and intensity according to region and season. The only significant trends in precipitation are obtained in La Plata Basin. Over the southern part of the basin (south of the Tropic of Capricorn), a significant decrease in precipitation is found during winter (-1.6 mm/month per decade) and an increase in all other seasons (4.2 mm/month per decade during summer). Over the northern part of La Plata Basin, the only significant trend in precipitation is a decrease during winter (-1.2 mm/month per decade).",

In a consensus-seeking session held at the end of the workshop, the international group of over 70 tephra scientists focused on two complementary themes: (A) the need for common best practices in tephra data collection and reporting among different scientific disciplines, and (B) the need to establish common, accessible mechanisms for tephra data archiving and retrieval.\nTephra is the focus of a wide range of research in volcanology, petrology, tephrochronology and tephrostratigraphy (with applications in studies of environmental/climate change, surface processes, paleolimnology, etc.), ash dispersion and fallout modeling, and archaeology, paleoanthropology, and human origins. Researchers in each field have specific objectives that may or may not overlap. The focus on best practices is a first step towards standardized protocols for the collection, analysis and reporting of tephra data across and within disciplines. Such uniformity will facilitate the development and population of useful tephra databases. Current initiatives include the development of best practice checklists as a starting point for ensuring uniformity and completeness. The goals of the checklists are to: 1) ensure consistency among tephra scientists, regardless of research focus, 2) provide basic, comprehensible, metadata requirements, especially those who collect tephra as a peripheral part of their research, 3) help train students, and 4) help journal editors to know which essential metadata should be included in published works. Consistency in tephra sample collection, analysis, and reporting attained by use of these checklists should ultimately aid in improving correlation of tephras across geographically large areas, and facilitate collaborative tephra research.\nCurrent and future versions of the checklists will be made available at: https://vhub.org/groups/tephra2014/resources",

This earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 and caused extensive damage, according to reports caused 164 deaths and numerous houses collapsing.\nTo simulate the event of M = 6.9 we used the empirical Green´s function method proposed by Irikura (1986). Due to the low seismic activity we have not any small earthquake record or an “element earthquake” so that we generated a synthetic seismogram of M = 4.1 to be used as empirical Green´s function. The seismogram was constructed in two parts. For low frequencies we constructed from cross-correlations of seismic noise, while for high frequencies we made a stochastic simulation. Subsequently, we applied a \"matched filter\" to join the two frequency bands of synthetic earthquake.\nFor the construction of seismic scenario the method of Irikura (1986) was used. We consider a square fault of 47.75 km long, a radial rupture propagation, rupture velocity of 3.06 m/s, and with the following focal mechanism: strike of 280°, dip of 66 ° and rake of -138 °.\nWith these parameters we obtained the synthetic seismograms. Since there was not any observed earthquake to validate the model, the 1912 event was simulated and then from relationships of intensity (obtained Wald et al.,2005; Sandoval et al., 2013; and Arias, 1969), we estimated the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) for the refinery. We compare our result with isoseismal map obtained by Suter et al. (1996) for the earthquake of 1912. In agreement with Suter, our results shown a MMI V-VI for the Miguel Hidalgo refinery.\nWith this qualitative validation we search the seismic scenario with the higher accelerations and from this synthetic seismogram, we obtained parameters that are of interest in engineering to estimate the possible affectations to the Miguel Hidalgo refinery, such as: PGA, PGV, response spectra, dominant period of significant duration event, and estimated MMI.",

As part of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Nutrient Scientific Technical Exchange Partnership and Support (N-STEPS) program, we have been developing stressor-response (S-R) models relating nutrients to attached algal (periphyton) communities to help prioritize monitoring for water quality impairments in Oregon (Pacific Northwest, USA) streams and rivers. Existing data from the state and neighboring states were compiled and standardized from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, US Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Geological Survey. To develop S-R models, algal community and biomass metrics were compared with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration data, including total, dissolved, and inorganic forms of these nutrients. In total, 928 paired algal-nutrient samples were compiled from the 8 Level-III Ecoregions occurring in Oregon. Relationships between algal biomass metrics and nutrient concentrations were weak, with only ash-free dry mass and standing stock of chlorophyll a showing slight positive relationships across gradients of total N and soluble reactive P concentrations, respectively. In contrast, metrics describing algal community composition, including percent diatoms and abundance of nutrient-sensitive species, showed very strong nonlinear relationships with total N or P concentrations. This suggests that data describing algal community composition can help identify specific nutrient stressors across environmentally-diverse streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest. Future analyses will examine if nutrient-algal S-R models vary across different hydrological, physiographical, and ecological settings in the region.",

In this study, High Resolution Doppler Lidar (HRDL) data obtained with high temporal and spatial resolution at heights of modern turbine rotors were compared to output from the WRF-chem model in order to help improve the performance of the model in producing accurate wind forecasts for the industry. HRDL data were collected from January 23-March 1, 2012 during the Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) field campaign. A model validation method was based on the qualitative comparison of the wind field images, time-series analysis and statistical analysis of the observed and modeled wind speed and direction, both for case studies and for the whole experiment. To compare the WRF-chem model output to the HRDL observations, the model heights and forecast times were interpolated to match the observed times and heights. Then, time-height cross-sections of the HRDL and WRF-Chem wind speed and directions were plotted to select case studies. Cross-sections of the differences between the observed and forecasted wind speed and directions were also plotted to visually analyze the model performance in different wind flow conditions. A statistical analysis includes the calculation of vertical profiles and time series of bias, correlation coefficient, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination between two datasets. The results from this analysis reveals where and when the model typically struggles in forecasting winds at heights of modern turbine rotors so that in the future the model can be improved for the industry.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of incident precipitation by a forest canopy into throughfall and stemflow varies as a function of meteorological conditions, tree species, leaf morphology and surface roughness, among other factors. Nanko et al (2015) examined the throughfall drop size signature of precipitation events relative to changes in leaf canopy state of deciduous forests. However, little work has been done to quantify the influence of meteorological variables (air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall intensity and duration) on drop size among discrete rain events. To quantify individual throughfall drops, a laser disdrometer gauge was deployed below an observed drip point under a Liriodendron tulipifera L. (yellow poplar) tree, in northeastern Maryland, USA. Based on events > 5mm rainfall, more than 850,000 individual throughfall droplets have been analyzed from precipitation occurring between September 2013 and October 2014. Building on previous work, which has examined the substantial influence of canopy state over the drop size spectra, this work focuses on the impact of inter-event variability in meteorological conditions and their differential effects on maximum drop size and throughfall depth received. Preliminary statistical analyses indicate that wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature are the primary factors governing throughfall drop size distributions. Since these factors do not consistently influence throughfall drop size distributions in the same manner, further in-depth analyses will attempt to uncover the dynamic interplay among these mutually interacting factors. Results from this study are expected to increase our understanding of the rhythms and mechanisms of throughfall hotspot appearance and disappearance.",

FCLS was first tested on computer simulated data with Gaussian noise of various signal-to-noise ratio, and Landsat data of an agricultural scenario and an urban environment using a set of global endmembers of substrate (soils, sediments, rocks, and non-photosynthetic vegetation), vegetation that includes green photosynthetic plants and dark objects which encompasses absorptive substrate materials, clear water, deep shadows, etc. For the agricultural scenario, a spectrally diverse collection of 11 scenes of Level 1 terrain corrected, cloud free Landsat-5 TM data of Fresno, California, USA were unmixed and the results were validated with the corresponding ground data. To study an urbanized landscape, a clear sky Landsat-5 TM data were unmixed and validated with coincident World View-2 abundance maps (of 2 m spatial resolution) for an area of San Francisco, California, USA. The results were evaluated using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient, RMSE, probability of success, boxplot and bivariate distribution function. Finally, FCLS was used for sub-pixel land cover analysis of the monthly WELD (Wen-enabled Landsat data) repository from 2008 to 2011 of North America. The abundance maps in conjunction with DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data were used to extract the urban land cover features and analyze their spatial-temporal growth.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - cggarcia_agu2015poster_final_draft.pdf\nAxial Seamount is a hotspot volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge that has erupted three times over the past two decades. The most recent eruption was recorded by a cabled seismic network in the southern half of the summit caldera that has been operated by the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) since November 2014. After five months of increasing seismicity, a 10-hour seismic crisis involving thousands of earthquakes began at 0500 GMT on April 24, 2015 accompanied by ~2 m of deflation in the central caldera (Nooner et al., this meeting). Local seismicity declined rapidly after the eruption, but thousands of impulsive waterborne events were observed across the network starting immediately after the seismic crisis. Over 1500 events per day were recorded on April 25 and 26, decreasing to less than 500 per day after May 1, and ceasing altogether around May 20. Each event comprises a train of three to five consistently spaced arrivals visible on all 3 seismometer channels with a broad frequency content of 10-100 Hz. The timing of arrivals across the network is consistent with water column multiples from a seafloor source to the north. A subset of events has been manually picked and located by modeling travel times of the first three arrivals assuming flat bathymetry at a range of depths between 1500-1800 m and a sound speed of 1.5 km/s. The preliminary locations are clustered around Axial Seamount’s northern rift at a distance of 10-15 km from the north rim of the caldera. In July, an OOI cruise discovered fresh pillow lavas up to 100 m thick and 670 m wide, and extending for 7 km along the rift in the same region (Kelley et al., this meeting). The source of the impulsive events is uncertain and could involve gas explosions, bubble collapse, and thermal or mechanical cracking, but their colocation with the fresh lava flow suggests that ocean bottom seismic networks can not only track the faulting and fracturing associated with subsurface magma movements but also the effusion of magma onto the seafloor.",

            "abstract": "In in arid and semi-arid environments, short-duration, high-intensity rainfall events—flash floods—are the primary driver of sediment transport in ephemeral streams. The spatial and temporal variability of these rainfall events results in episodic and irregular stream flow and resultant sediment transport. As a result of limited-flow durations, measuring discharge and collecting suspended-sediment samples on ephemeral streams in arid regions is difficult and time-consuming. Because of these limitations, few sediment-monitoring programs on ephemeral streams have been developed; some examples of sediment-monitoring gages and gaging networks constructed on arid ephemeral streams include Walnut Gulch, United States, Nahal Yael, Israel, and the Luni River Basin, India. The difficulty in making measurements of discharge and suspended-sediment concentration on arid ephemeral streams has led many researchers to use methods such as regional sediment-yield equations, sediment-rating curves, and peak discharge to total-sediment load relations. These methods can provide a cost-effective estimation of sediment yield from ungaged tributaries. However, these approaches are limited by, among other factors, time averaging, hysteresis, and differences in local and regional geology, rainfall, and vegetation.\nA monitoring network was established in 2000 on six ephemeral tributaries of the Colorado River in lower Glen and upper Marble canyons. Results from this monitoring network show that annual suspended-sediment loads for individual streams can vary by 5 orders of magnitude while the annual suspended-sediment load for the entire network may vary annually by 2 orders of magnitude, suspended-sediment loads during an individual flood event do not typically correlate with discharge, and local geology has a strong control on the sediment yield of a drainage basin. Comparing our results to previous estimates of sediment load from these drainages found that previous, indirect, methods that used no actual measurements of sediment transport greatly overestimated the annual suspended-sediment loads of the streams.",

            "abstract": "Improving crop yield of the lowest yielding smallholder farmers in developing countries is essential to both food security of the country and the farmers’ livelihood. Although wheat and maize production in most developed countries have reached 80% or greater of yield potential determined by simulated models, yield gap remains high in the developing world. One of these cases is the yield gap of maize in the North China Plain (NCP), where the average farmer’s yield is 41% of his or her potential yield. This large yield gap indicates opportunity to raise yields substantially by improving agronomy, especially in nutrition management, irrigation facility, and mechanization issues such as technical services. Farmers’ agronomic knowledge is essential to yield performance. In order to propagate such knowledge to farmers, agricultural extension programs, especially in-the-field guidance with training programs at targeted demonstration fields, have become prevalent in China. Although traditional analyses of the effects of the extension program are done through surveys, they are limited to only one to two years and to a small area. However, the spatial analysis tool Google Earth Engine (GEE) and its extensive satellite imagery data allow for unprecedented spatial temporal analysis of yield variation. We used GEE to analyze maize yield in Quzhou county in the North China Plain from 2007 to 2013. We based our analysis on the distance from a demonstration farm plot, the source of the farmers’ agronomic knowledge. Our hypothesis was that the farther the farmers’ fields were from the demonstration plot, the less access they would have to the knowledge, and the less increase in yield over time. Testing this hypothesis using GEE helps us determine the effectiveness of the demonstration plot in disseminating optimal agronomic practices in addition to evaluating yield performance of the demonstration field itself. Furthermore, we can easily extend this methodology to analyze the whole NCP and any other parts of the world for any type of crop. ",

            "abstract": "In the coming century, the proportion of total rainfall that falls in heavy storm events is expected to increase in many areas, especially in the US Midwest, a major agricultural region. These changes in rainfall patterns may have consequences for hydrologic flow and nutrient losses, especially in agricultural soils, with potentially negative consequences for receiving ground- and surface waters. We used a tracer experiment to examine how more extreme rainfall patterns may affect the movement of water and solutes through an agricultural soil profile in the upper Midwest, and to what extent tillage may moderate these effects. Two rainfall patterns were created with 5m x 5m rainout shelters at the Kellogg Biological Station LTER site in replicated plots with either conventional tillage or no-till management. Control rainfall treatments received water 3x per week, and extreme rainfall treatments received the same total amount of water but once every two weeks, to simulate less frequent but larger storms. In April 2015, potassium bromide (KBr) was added as a conservative tracer of water flow to all plots, and Br- concentrations in soil water at 1.2m depth were measured weekly from April through July. Soil water Br- concentrations increased and peaked more quickly under the extreme rainfall treatment, suggesting increased infiltration and solute transfer to depth compared to soils exposed to control rainfall patterns. Soil water Br- also increased and peaked more quickly in no-till than in conventional tillage treatments, indicating differences in flow paths between management systems. Soil moisture measured every 15 minutes at 10, 40, and 100cm depths corroborates tracer experiment results: rainfall events simulated in extreme rainfall treatments led to large increases in deep soil moisture, while the smaller rainfall events simulated under control conditions did not. Deep soil moisture in no-till treatments also increased sooner after water application as compared to in conventional soils. Our results suggest that exposure to more extreme rainfall patterns will likely increase infiltration depth and nutrient losses in agricultural soils. In particular, soils under no-till management, which leads to development of preferential flow paths, may be particularly vulnerable to vertical nutrient losses.",

            "abstract": "Solar energy is referred to as variable generation sources because their electricity production varies based on the availability of sun irradiance. To accommodate this variability, electricity grid operators use a variety of tools to maintain a reliable electricity supply, one of them is to forecast solar irradiation, and to adjust other electricity sources as needed. This work reports an approach to forecast solar irradiation in the Brazilian Northeastern region (NEB) by using statistically post-processing data from mesoscale model outputs. The method assimilates the diversity of climate characteristics occurring in the region presenting the largest solar energy potentials in Brazil. Untreated solar irradiance forecasts for 24h in advance were obtained using the WRF model runs. Cluster analysis technique was employed to find out areas presenting similar climate characteristics and to reduce uncertainties. Comparison analysis between WRF model outputs and site-specific measured data were performed to evaluate the model skill in forecasting the surface solar irradiation. After that, post-processing of WRF outputs using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple regression methods refined the short-term solar irradiation forecasts. A set of pre-selected variables of the WRF model outputs representing the forecasted atmospheric conditions were used as predictors by the ANNs. Several predictors were tested in the adjustment and simulation of the ANNs. We found the best ANNs architecture and a group of 10 predictors, with which more in-depth analyzes were carried out, including performance evaluation for fall and spring of 2011 (rainy and dry season in NEB). The site-specific measured solar radiation data came from 110 stations distributed throughout the NEB. Data for the rainy season were acquired from March to May, and for the dry season from September to November. We concluded that the untreated numerical forecasts of solar irradiation provided by WRF exhibited a good correlation with the observed data but presented large systematic errors and large spread of values. The post-processing of data described here proved to consistently improve the WRF model forecasts for surface solar irradiation for most of the measurement sites.\nSupported by Petrobras contract No. 23000.0073552011-96",

            "abstract": "La Primavera caldera, Jalisco Mexico, is a Pleistocenic volcanic structure formed by dome complexes and multiple pyroclastic flows and fall deposits. It is located at the intersection of the Chapala, Colima, and Tepic grabens in western Mexico. The first volcanic activity associated to La Primavera started ~0.1 Ma with the emission of pre-caldera lavas. The caldera collapse occurred 95 ka and is associated to the eruption of ~20 km3of pumice flows known as the Tala tuff (Mahood 1980). The border of the caldera was replaced by a series of domes dated in 75-30 ky, which partially filled the inner depression of the caldera with pyroclastic flows and falls. For more than a decade the Federal Commission of Electricity in Mexico (CFE) has prospected and evaluated the geothermal potential of the Cerritos Colorados project at La Primavera caldera.\nIn order to better understand the plumbing system that tapped the Tala tuff and to investigate its relation with the potential geothermal field at La Primavera we performed a series of hydrothermal experiments and studied melt inclusions hosted in quartz phenocrysts by Fourier Infra red stectroscopy (FTIR). Although some post caldera products at La Primavera contain fayalite and quartz (suggesting QFM conditions) the Tala tuff does not contain fayalite and we ran experiments under NNO conditions. The absence of titanomagnetite does not allowed us to calculate pre-eruptive temperature. However, the stability of quartz and plagioclase, which are natural phases, suggest that temperature should be less than 750 °C at a pressure of 200 MPa.\nThe analyses of H2O and CO2 dissolved in melt inclusions yielded concentrations of 2-5 wt.% and 50-100 ppm respectively. This data confirm that the pre-eruptive pressure of the Tala tuff is ~200 MPa and in addition to major elements compositions suggest that the Tala tuff is either, compositionally zoned or mixed with other magma just prior to eruption.",

Thermal stimulation is an effective dissociation method, along with depressurization.\nTo simulate methane gas production from methane hydrate layer, we investigated electrical heating of methane hydrate sediment. A decrease in core temperature due to the endothermic reaction of methane hydrate dissociation was suppressed and the core temperature increased between 1oC and 4oC above the control temperature with electric heating.

            "abstract": "Drought accompanied by warmer temperatures - “hotter drought” - is an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene. Tree mortality and forest die-off due to hotter drought are the focus of rapidly expanding scientific literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, & modeling studies suggesting increased tree vulnerability to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, no consensus exists regarding future mortality risks. We summarize key findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence of lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; increases in forest growth, canopy greening, & woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, & genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; & potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses & accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates and forest die-off events; projected increases in drought occurrence; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; & wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a critical set of global vulnerability drivers known with high confidence: 1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; 2) warming produces hotter droughts; 3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; 4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; 5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts & can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought; & 6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, along with greater vulnerability evidence, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We provide a synthesis including tree mortality thresholds, & highlight urgent research challenges.",

            "abstract": "Paleozoic Australia is made of a series of orogenic belts that include the Delamerian, Lachlan and New England orogens, as well as the poorly defined Thomson Orogen. The origin of these belts has been attributed to subduction and accretionary processes along the ~N-S-striking (present coordinates) plate boundary of Gondwana. However, recent studies show that orogenic segments are strongly contorted, thus raising questions about the geodynamic origin of eastern Australia and Paleozoic plate tectonics in general. Results from the New England Orogen revealed that oroclinal bending has occurred simultaneously with basin formation and trench retreat. Geochronological provenance studies of detrital zircon show that these basins were situated in a back-arc position, indicating that back-arc extension may have played a crucial role in oroclinal bending. In addition, geochronological data of detrital zircon show that terranes that were once considered to be exotic were actually derived from local sources. The collective geological evidence suggests that deformation and oroclinal bending were driven by subduction-related processes possibly acting on inherited irregularities in the orientation of the plate boundary. The irregular geometries were further accentuated by trench migration (retreat and advance) that led to subduction segmentation, oroclinal bending, and alternating episodes of contraction and (back-arc) extension. In search of inherited plate boundary irregularities in Paleozoic Australia, we have studied the ~E-W boundary between the Lachlan and Thomson orogens. This lithospheric-scale boundary may reflect the original geometry of the plate boundary, which might have accommodated hundreds of km of dextral offset. This boundary may be part a much larger orogenic curvature, hitherto not recognised, and the development of which may have played a fundamental role in the formation of the smaller-scale oroclines in the Lachlan and New England orogens.",

            "abstract": "Kīlauea’s East Rift Zone (ERZ) eruptive activity at Puʻu ʻŌʻō shifted to a new vent in June 2014, sparking a lava flow crisis that threatened critical infrastructure near the town of Pāhoa in east Hawaiʻi. The lava flow proved to be challenging to forecast because of the influence of ground cracks on flow direction, frequent fluctuations in lava supply, and the subtle interplay between ground slope and confining topography that prevented the flow from spreading laterally. After its onset, the “June 27th” flow, named informally for its start date, advanced northeast at up to several hundred m/day. The flow’s path through heavy forest was forecast using steepest-descent paths derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Flow path uncertainties were minimized using a multiple-run technique and built-in random DEM errors (modified from Favalli et al., 2005). In mid-August, the flow encountered and entered one of many deep, discontinuous ground cracks along Kīlauea’s middle ERZ. The flow continued to advance out of sight in the crack, as inferred from a forward-progressing line of steam. A week later, lava spilled from the crack 1.3 km downslope, advancing along a different flow path than was forecast. By early September, the flow had entered and exited three more cracks sequentially, carrying the flow across slope, thus making flow path forecasts unreliable. Moreover, lava-occupied cracks dilated by up to 3 m. The lava accumulating in the ground cracks forced immense, but apparently mobile, blocks to shift. Thus, while an open crack was required to capture the lava, the lava was able to force its way beyond where the crack closed. In this way, the lava flow acted as an intruding dike. The flow eventually advanced beyond the area of cracks and onto a steepest-descent path that guided the flow toward the town of Pāhoa, where it destroyed one house, reached to within ~155 m of the main street in Pāhoa, and threatened the main highway and shopping center serving the east side of the Island of Hawaiʻi. The flow front stalled on March 13, 2015, owing to reservoir depressurization occurring at Kīlauea’s summit. When the summit system recovered, activity withdrew to within ~9 km of the vent, ending the immediate threat to the Pāhoa area.",

            "abstract": "The radiation belts are zones of relativistic electrons encircling the Earth. Their radial structure is controlled by the competition between source and loss processes. Most commonly, a two-belt structure prevails, though a more complicated three-belt structure - an inner belt plus two outer electron belts - have repeatedly been observed.\nThe plasma conditions that enable and enhance loss-facilitating wave activity in the inner magnetosphere are still under discussion. Relativistic electrons have been thought to more easily resonate with electromagnetic ion-cyclotron waves (EMIC) when the total plasma density is large (i.e., in the plasmasphere and plume). However, there is evidence that this interaction may be not as strong as thought, and that instead the field-aligned motion of lower energy ring current ions (up to a few 10's keV) may play a key role. Similarly, the exact influence of large heavy ion (O+) concentrations remains unsettled.\nWe use 2.5+ years of Van Allen Probes observations to study the region of plasmasphere-outer belt overlap (and its vicinity). By now, the Van Allen Probes provide a complete and very dense coverage of the complete magnetosphere inside geosynchronous orbit We focus our interest on understanding the plasma conditions that can favor EMIC wave growth. We investigate the temperature anisotropy A (modified by plasma β) of the warm/hot plasma, and contrast it with the location specifics of the plasmasphere (i.e., very high total density) and the occurrence of high O+ concentrations in the overlap regions with the radiation belt(s). We present both average conditions for all parameters during a variety of geomagnetic conditions, and highlight specific loss and overlap events in an effort to establish favorable plasma conditions for relativistic electron loss during those times.",

Measurements at 3 tall tower sites in Indianapolis, IN, USA have been ongoing since July 2013 as part of the INdianapolis FLUX (INFLUX) project. These three towers consist of an upwind, or background site, a site in the urban center, and a site on the downwind edge of the city. The tower collections are discrete, one hour integrated samples taken using NOAA’s Portable Flask Package system. These sites have been measured for CO mole fraction, 13CO, and C18O approximately 6 times per month.\nWe present a time series of data from these three sites, as well as a source analysis of the CO produced during the winter months (the winter data allow the use of several simplifying assumptions). We have identified mobile (vehicular) fossil fuel emissions as the only clearly significant wintertime source of CO, and quantified the stable isotopic signature of that source. We also present data from a traffic study done in March of 2015. A vehicle-based collection system was used for this study, and both continuous CO mole fraction and discrete CO mole fraction, 13CO, and C18O measurements were made. The results for CO stable isotopes are consistent with the vehicular emission CO isotopic signatures inferred from the tower samples.",

An important feedback pathway is the manner by which magnetospheric energy deposited in the ionosphere is transformed into ion outflows that will affect the future deposition of magnetospheric energy. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the way that ion outflows are regulated by magnetospheric inputs has a profound effect on the emergent behavior of the coupled system. The simulations presented use the multi-fluid Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (MFLFM) MHD model two-way coupled to the ionosphere/polar wind model (IPWM). IPWM includes the H+ and O+ polar wind as well as a phenomenological treatment of energetic O+ accelerated by wave-particle interactions (WPI). The coupled simulations are highly sensitive to the way that the WPI in IPWM is regulated by inputs from MFLFM. The average hemispheric outflow rate alone is not an adequate predictor of the coupled dynamics that will emerge. Simulations with steady ion outflow tend to settle into a steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) state, whereas simulations with highly impulsive bursts of ion outflow exhibit much more active magnetotail dynamics. Some of the simulations exhibit magnetospheric sawtooth oscillations where quasi-periodic substorms appear in response to the causally driven ion outflow",

            "abstract": "The Curiosity rover has encountered a variety of sedimentary rocks with significant variations in both texture and composition. Most of the sandstones and mudstones are interpreted as having been deposited in a fluvio-lacustrine environment, as analyzed in details in the waypoints named Yellowknife Bay, Kimberley and Pahrump. All of these sediments have been crossed by diagenetic features of different composition. Light-toned Ca-sulfate veins observed initially at Yellowknife Bay were observed along the traverse, and in high density at the Pahrump location. As they appear in all sediments and show straight fractures, they correspond to late-stage diagenetic features, due to fluid circulation, with fractures probably due to hydraulic stress at depth. In contrast to light-toned veins, earlier-stage diagenetic features have shown variable composition in the three areas. At Yellowknife Bay, raised ridges display enriched Mg proportion, probably linked to Mg-clay whereas outcrops at Kimberley display fracture fills enriched in Mn and Zn. Pahrump displays a large variety of diagenetic features distinct from these previous examples. Mg-enriched concretions contain S and abundant Ni. Mg enrichments have also been observed in resistant zones along fractures and in resistant layers. Locally concretions also display high Fe, S-bearing material interpreted as Fe-sulfate, probably jarosite. A special location named Garden City at the top of the Parhump sequence displays a complex area with light-toned veins surrounded by darker veins. The latter display strong Ca signatures correlated with F, interpreted as fluorite. No C or S emissions were observed that could alternatively explain the high Ca abundance by carbonates or sulfates. The dark tone of the F-bearing minerals may be due to the presence of Fe. These specific dark veins could derive from the leaching of F-apatite, a mineral that has been observed both in the sandstones and in some of the igneous clasts analyzed by ChemCam during the traverse. Altogether, these diagenetic features show that aqueous sediments were modified by a series of distinct diagenetic episodes, with strong local variability.",

This monster shift is likely an unrecognized true polar wander occurrence. Although subject to inclination error, results from sedimentary rocks from North America, if corrected for these effects, can be used to supplement the available data for this time period.\n Steiner (2003) reported results from 48 stratigraphic horizons sampled from the Callovian Summerville Fm, from NE New Mexico. A recalculated mean of these results yields a mean direction of D = 332, I = 39, n=48, k = 15, α95 = 5.4°. These data were analyzed for possible inclination error-although the dataset is small, the E-I results yielded a corrected I = 53. This yields a corrected paleopole for NA at ~165 Ma located at 67° N and 168° E.\nPaleomagnetic results from the Black Hills- Kilanowski (2002) for the Callovian Hulett Mbr of the Sundance Fm, and Gregiore (2001) the Oxfordian-Tithonian Morrison Fm (Gregiore, 2001) have previously been interpreted to represent Eocene-aged remagnetizations- due to the nearly exact coincidence between the in-situ pole positions of these Jurassic units with the Eocene pole for NA. Both of the tilt-corrected results for these units have high latitude poles (Sundance Fm: 79° N, 146° E; Morrison Fm: 89° N, 165° E). An E-I analysis of these data will be presented- using a provisional inclination error of 10°, corrected paleopoles are: (Sundance Fm: 76° N, 220° E; Morrison Fm: 77° N, 266° E).\nThe Black Hills 165 Ma (Sundance Fm) and 145 Ma (Morrison Fm) poles, provisionally corrected for 10° inclination error- occur fairly close to the NA APWP proposed by Kent et al, 2015- using an updated set of results from kimberlites- the agreement between the Sundance Fm and the Triple-B (158 Ma) pole would be nearly exact with a slightly lesser inclination error. The Summerville Fm- which is thought to be ~ coeval with the Sundance Fm- is significantly offset from this newer NA path, but a larger inclination error for this unit would produce a better agreement. Thus, pending more precise estimates of inclination error from these units, middle-late Jurassic sedimentary rocks from NA do support the existence of a MUTO (Monster Unknown True polar wander Occurrence) during Jurassic time.",

Knowledge about their distribution, volume, and residence time is crucial in understanding their properties and interactions within the Earth system, yet global information is scarce with minimal consistency across regions. The aim of this study was to develop a geo-statistical model to estimate the volume of all global lakes over 10 hectares (0.1 km2) based on surrounding terrain information and trained with existing lake volume data. The residence time of each lake was then estimated by using global discharge estimates at high spatial resolution from the HydroSHEDS database. Our total global lake volume estimate of 187,381 km3 for 1,491,753 lakes is largely driven by a few large lakes and mirrors previous estimates. However, this figure differs by nearly 50% from previous estimates when removing the water storage of the 10 largest lakes. The resulting database—termed HydroLAKES— is the first spatially resolved object-oriented baseline dataset, where each lake is treated as an individual polygon and comes with a suite of morphometric attributes.",

            "abstract": "The last interglaciation (LIG; ~130-116 ka) was the most recent period in Earth history with higher-than-present global sea level (≥6 m) under similar-to-preindustrial concentrations of atmospheric CO2, suggesting additional feedbacks related to albedo, insolation, and ocean circulation in generating the apparent climatic differences between the LIG and present Holocene. However, our understanding of how much warmer the LIG sea surface was relative to the present interglaciation remains uncertain, with current estimates suggesting from 0°C to 2°C warmer than late-20thcentury average global temperatures. Moreover, the timing, spatial expression, and amplitude of regional and global sea surface temperature variability related to other climate forcing during the LIG are poorly constrained, largely due to uncertainties in age control and proxy temperature reconstructions. An accurate characterization of global and regional temperature change during the LIG can serve as a benchmark for paleoclimate modeling intercomparison projects and help improve understanding of sea-level sensitivity to temperature change. We will present a global compilation (~100 published records) of sea surface temperature (SST) and other climate reconstructions spanning the LIG. Using a Monte Carlo-enabled cross-correlation maximization algorithm to climatostratigraphically align proxy records and then account for both the resulting chronologic and proxy calibration uncertainties with Bayesian statistical inference, our results quantify the spatial timing, amplitude, and uncertainty in estimates of global and regional sea surface temperature change during the LIG and its relation to potential forcings.",

LPW in-situ observations of the electron temperature (Te) at Mars indicate a dramatic rise in Te (from < 600 oK to ~3000 oK) with altitude in the critical exobase region ~200 km in altitude. This dramatic temperature increase implies a strong ambipolar electric field (~1 V), which should strongly draw ions from the exobase region to higher altitudes. A substantial source of electron heating is required for this process. Numerical simulations demonstrate that observations of dramatically enhances O2+ at higher altitudes is consistent with a strong ambipolar electric field and plasma heating. With this new understanding, we demonstrate that ion loss, particularly the loss of O+ and O2+, could have significantly contributed to the loss of Mars atmosphere. The refilling time scales for the dayside O+ and O2+ will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Understanding chamber-based soil flux model fitting and measurement error is key to scaling soils GHG emissions and resolving the primary uncertainties in climate and management feedbacks at regional scales. One key challenge is the selection of the correct empirical model applied to soil flux rate analysis in chamber-based experiments. Another challenge is the characterization of error in the chamber measurement.\nTraditionally, most chamber-based N2O and CH4 measurements and model derivations have used discrete sampling for GC analysis, and have been conducted using extended chamber deployment periods (DP) which are expected to result in substantial alteration of the pre-deployment flux. The development of high-precision, high-frequency CRDS analyzers has advanced the science of soil flux analysis by facilitating much shorter DP and, in theory, less chamber-induced suppression of the soil-atmosphere diffusion gradient.\nAs well, a new software tool developed by Picarro (the “Soil Flux Processor” or “SFP”) links the power of Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) technology with an easy-to-use interface that features flexible sample-ID and run-schemes, and provides real-time monitoring of chamber accumulations and environmental conditions. The SFP also includes a sophisticated flux analysis interface which offers a user-defined model selection, including three predominant fit algorithms as default, and an open-code interface for user-composed algorithms. The SFP is designed to couple with the Picarro G2508 system, an analyzer which simplifies soils flux studies by simultaneously measuring primary GHG species -- N2O, CH4, CO2 and H2O.\nIn this study, Picarro partners with the ARS USDA Soil & Water Management Research Unit (R. Venterea, St. Paul), to examine the degree to which the high-precision, high-frequency Picarro analyzer allows for much shorter DPs periods in chamber-based flux analysis, and, in theory, less chamber-induced suppression of the soil-atmosphere diffusion gradient. This study presents an initial review of the most accurate and precise flux-calculation scheme that are suitable for shorter deployment periods. This study also presents the unique derivation of whole-system chamber measurement error available in the SFP.",

Twenty of these fragments passed our weakest selection criteria. Seven additional specimens were made from each passing fragment for further paleointensity experiments. The results of these second experiments indicate that the samples are mildly anisotropic, so anisotropy experiments were conducted to correct for this behavior. Experiments to determine the cooling rate correction will be completed to ensure the robustness of the dataset.\nStylistic evidence, historical documentation, dendrochronology, and 14C analyses provide age constraints with up to decade resolution for the VADM results. The twenty pottery fragments analyzed span five distinct time periods between 1300 and 1900 AD. Our new results for each fragment differ slightly from those predicted by the cals3k.4b and arch3k models, suggesting the models require refinement. This is expected because there are few archaeomagnetic constraints on the models from this region.\nFuture pottery fragments and burned adobe fragments from the New Mexico area will be analyzed for paleointensity and combined with our pottery fragment data set to create a high-resolution paleointensity curve for the recent archaeological time in the American Southwest.",

Hence, point measurements of storage from wells are insufficient to characterize the storage across a catchment, especially in mountainous environments with complex geology. Here, we present a novel approach to quantify the storage-flow relationship for catchments in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. For 23 gages in the Hydro-Climatic Data Network, the 7-day average annual minimum flow (drought flow) was computed for years 2003 to 2015. We then aggregated, for each gage, the associated storage time-series dataset from 1o gridded measurements of monthly Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Despite the significant mismatch between the spatial scales and temporal resolution, we found a strong empirical correlation between TWS and drought flow. From these relationships, we examined how physical characteristics of each catchment (such as size and geology) impact the observed nonlinear relationship between TWS and drought flow. Furthermore, we show how physical characteristics, such as geology/storage capacity, of catchments affect the sensitivity of decreasing flows to multi-year droughts. This research has the potential to help better quantify the streamflow-storage relationship in small mountainous catchments, as well as, classify catchments that may be more vulnerable to decreasing flows with multi-year droughts.",

The interaction of halogens with organic-rich sediments can lead to the formation of organohalogens. In this study, we report field and laboratory emission rates of volatile halocarbons (methyl halides and chloroform) along a salinity gradient in coastal South Carolina, including freshwater forest, degraded oligohaline forest, and salt marsh. For chloroform, the oligohaline (intermediate) forest showed the largest mean emissions, compared to the freshwater forest and mesohaline saltmarsh. Soil cores were measured intact live, spread out live, intact dead, and spread out dead. Interestingly, the dead soil and live soil incubations showed no statistical difference in chloroform emissions, suggesting that their formation is predominately abiotic. For methyl chloride and methyl bromide, saltmarsh soils were sources while freshwater forest and degraded oligohaline forest soils were sinks. Sterilization of soils caused emissions rates to be higher, even converting sinks to sources, suggesting that live microorganisms and enzymes in the soils were sinks for the methyl halides, thereby masking the abiotic production rates. The simultaneous production and consumption of methyl halides in these soils is consistent with prior studies investigating the bidirectional fluxes of these compounds. Our study indicates that long-term sea level rise that turns freshwater forest wetlands to degraded forest wetlands or saltmarsh can significantly change the halocarbon biogeochemistry in southeastern United States.",

We identified seven distinct modes of vibration for Rainbow Bridge between 1 and 6 Hz. Data for each resonant frequency was then analyzed to determine the frequency-dependent polarization vector in an attempt to clarify mode shapes; e.g. the fundamental mode represents out-of-plane horizontal flexure. We compared experimental data to results of 3D numerical modal analysis, using a new photogrammetric model of Rainbow Bridge generated in this study imported into COMSOL Multiphysics. Results compare well with measured data for seven of the first eight modeled modes, matching vibrational frequencies and polarization orientations generally within 10%. Only predicted mode 6 was not explicitly apparent in our experimental data. Large site-to-reference spectral ratios resolved from experimental data indicate high amplification on the bridge as compared to nearby bedrock.",

The SSW events affect tropopause, stratopause and mesopause height. The altitude of the tropopause decreased by ~1 km during SSW events in NH high latitudes. Significant increase in the stratopause altitude occurs, which reaches to almost ~75 km when compared to non-warming years. The stratopause lifting effect was observed up to 50oN. SSW effects on the tropopause and stratopause observed at polar latitudes may not be felt directly at the tropical latitudes. Interestingly, large reductions in the mesopause altitudes are observed during SSW events (by 3-4 km). The mesopause sinking propagates to the tropical altitudes in some of the SSW winters. Gravity wave activity is also examined during these SSW events. We find a delayed effect of warming on the tropopause and stratopause, and a premature effect on the mesopause and gravity wave potential energy (Ep).",

Here, we present a novel matrix operator framework that permits systematic, rather than ad hoc, analysis of WT results. We use this framework to study moisture transport, from evaporation (or sublimation) to precipitation, in a state-of-the-art global climate model (GCM) which incorporates WTs. This framework separates moisture divergence over a given tagged region into local divergence (the export of locally-evaporated moisture) and remote convergence (the import of remotely-evaporated moisture). The remote convergence term may be further subdivided into zonal, meridional, intrabasin, and interbasin parts, and can be used to predict precipitation given a particular spatial pattern of evaporation (demonstrated in Figure 1a).\nFindings from analysis of the preindustrial mean state concur with findings from earlier moisture transport studies: water evaporated at the equator and high latitudes tends to precipitate locally, whereas water evaporated in the subtropics and midlatitudes tends to precipitate remotely; water evaporated in the subtropics diverges both equatorward and poleward of its source region, while water evaporated in the midlatitudes mostly diverges poleward. New insights from the method reveal fundamental differences between the major ocean basins, with the Atlantic basin having the largest local divergence, smallest remote convergence, and greatest interbasin moisture export.\nWith quasi-equilibrium CO2-doubling, we find that a greater fraction of locally-evaporated moisture is exported, moisture exchange between ocean basins increases (shown in Figure 2c), and moisture convergence within a given basin shifts towards greater distances between moisture source and sink regions. These changes can be understood in terms of a greater moisture residence time with warming, or, equivalently, a robust increase in the advective length scale of moisture transport. We conclude by discussing the effect of the increasing atmospheric moisture transport length scale on ocean state, and implications for the interpretation of water isotope records.",

            "abstract": "The 650 km3 Bishop Tuff (BT) is among the most studied volcanic deposits because it is an extensive marker bed deposited just after the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary. Reconstructions of the vast BT magma reservoir from which high-silica rhyolite erupted have long influenced thinking about how large silicic magma systems are assembled, crystallized, and mixed. Yet, the longevity of the high silica rhyolitic melt and exact timing of the eruption remain controversial due to recent conflicting 40Ar/39Ar sanidine vs. SIMS and ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon dates.\nWe have undertaken 21 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating ages on 2 mm BT sanidine crystals from pumice in 3 widely separated outcrops of early-erupted fall and flow units. Plateau ages yield a bimodal distribution: a younger group has a mean of 766 ka and an older group gives a range between 772 and 782 ka. The younger population is concordant with the youngest ID-TIMS and SIMS U-Pb zircon ages recently published, as well as the astronomical age of BT in marine sediment. Of 21 crystals, 17 yield older, non-plateau, steps likely affected by excess Ar that would bias traditional 40Ar/39Ar total crystal fusion ages.\nThe small spread in older sanidine ages, together with 25+ kyr of pre-eruptive zircon growth, suggest that the older sanidines are not partially outgassed xenocrysts. A bimodal 40Ar/39Ar age distribution implies that some fraction of rhyolitic melt cooled below the Ar closure temperature at least 10 ky prior to eruption. We propose that rapid \"thawing\" of a crystalline mush layer released older crystals into rhyolitic melt from which sanidine also nucleated and grew immediately prior to the eruption. High precision 40Ar/39Ar dating can thus provide essential information on thermo-physical processes at the millenial time scale that are critical to interpreting U-Pb zircon age distributions that are complicated by large uncertainties associated with zircon-melt U-Th systematics.",

We have been operating an operational real-time adjusted the Radar-Automatic Weather Station (AWS) Rainrate (RAR) system developed by KMA in 2006 for providing radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) to meteorologists. This system has several uncertainty in estimating precipitation by radar reflectivity (Z) and rainfall intensity (R) relationship. To overcome uncertainty of the RAR system and improve the accuracy of QPE, we are applied the Local Gauge Correction (LGC) method which uses geo-statistical effective radius of errors of the QPE to RAR system in 2012. According to the results of previous study in 2014 (Lee et al., 2014), the accuracy of the RAR system with LGC method improved about 7.69% than before in the summer season of 2012 (from June to August). It has also improved the accuracy of hydrograph when we examined the accuracy of flood simulation using hydrologic model and data derived by the RAR system with LGC method. We confirmed to have its effectiveness through these results after the application of LGC method. It is required for high quality data of long term to utilize in hydrology field. To provide QPE data more precisely and collect past-time data, we produce that calculated by the RAR system with LGC method in the summer season from 2006 to 2009 and investigate whether the accuracy of past-time radar rainfall estimation enhance or not.\nKeywords : Radar-AWS Rainrate system, Local gauge correction, past-time Radar rainfall estimation\nAcknowledgements : This research is supported by \"Development and application of Cross governmental dual-pol radar harmonization (WRC-2013-A-1)\" project of the Weather Radar Center, Korea Meteorological Administration in 2015.",

            "abstract": "In shallow passive seismology it is generally thought that the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method is more robust than the horizontal over vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method at resolving the depth to surface-wave velocity (Vs) interfaces. Here we present results of a field test of these two methods over ten drill sites in Victoria, Australia. The target interface is the base of Cenozoic unconsolidated to semi-consolidated clastic and/or carbonate sediments of the Murray Basin, which overlie Paleozoic crystalline rocks. Drilled depths of this interface are between 27 and 300 m. A three-arm spiral array, with a radius of 250 m, consisting of 13 Trillium compact broadband seismometers was deployed at each site for 7–21 hours. The Vs architecture beneath each site was determined through nonlinear inversion of HVSR and SPAC data using the neighborhood algorithm of Sambridge (1999) implemented in geopsy by Wathelet et al (2005). The HVSR technique yielded depth estimates, of the target interface (Vs > 1000 m/s), generally within 20% error. Successful estimates were even obtained at a site with an inverted velocity profile, where Quaternary basalts overlie Neogene sediments. Half of the SPAC estimates showed significantly higher errors than obtained using HVSR. Joint inversion provided the most reliable estimates but was unstable at three sites. We attribute the surprising success of HVSR over SPAC to a low content of transient signals within the seismic record caused by low degrees of anthropogenic noise at the benchmark sites. At a few sites SPAC curves showed clear overtones suggesting that more reliable SPAC estimates maybe obtained utilizing a multi modal inversion. Nevertheless, our study seems to indicate that reliable basin thickness estimates in remote Australia can be obtained utilizing HVSR data from a single seismometer, without a priori knowledge of the surface-wave velocity of the basin material, thereby negating the need to deploy cumbersome arrays.",

            "abstract": "Erebus, an active intraplate volcano on Ross Island, commonly produces bubble burst Strombolian explosions from a long-lived, convecting phonolitic lava lake. Persistent lava lakes are rare, and provide direct insights into their underlying magmatic system. Erebus phonolite is H2O-poor and contains ~30% anorthoclase megacrysts. At shallow depths lab measurements suggest the magma has viscosities of ~107 Pa s. This has implications for magma and bubble ascent rates through the conduit and into the lava lake. The bulk composition and matrix glass of Erebus ejecta has remained uniform for many thousands of years, but eruptive activity varies on decadal and shorter time scales. Over the last 15 years, increased activity took place in 2005-2007, and more recently in the 2013 austral summer. In the 2014 austral summer, new infrasound sensors were installed ~700 m from the summit crater hosting the lava lake. These sensors, supplemented by the Erebus network seismic stations, recorded >1000 eruptions between 1 January and 7 April 2015, with an average infrasound daily uptime of 9.6 hours. Over the same time period, the CTBT infrasound station IS55, ~25 km from Erebus, detected ~115 of the >1000 locally observed eruptions with amplitude decreases of >100x. An additional ~200 eruptions were recorded during local infrasound downtime. This represents an unusually high level of activity from the Erebus lava lake, and while instrument noise influences the minimum observable amplitude each day, the eruption infrasound amplitudes may vary by ~3 orders of magnitude over the scale of minutes to hours. We use this heightened period of variable activity and associated seismic and acoustic waveforms to examine mechanisms for bubble formation and ascent, such as rise speed dependence and collapsing foam; repose times for the larger eruptions; and possible eruption connections to lava lake cyclicity.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon basin stores 150-200 PgC, exchanges 18 PgC with the atmosphere every year and has taken up 0.42-0.65 PgC/y over the past two decades. Despite its global significance, the response of the tropical carbon cycle to climate variability and change is ill constrained. The complex interplay of radiation, water and ecosystem phenology remains unresolved in tropical ecosystem models. We use high frequency regional scale TCCON observations of column CO2, CO and CH4 near Manaus, Brazil that began in October 2014 to understand the aforementioned interplay of processes. We observe a robust mean daily column CO2 uptake of about 1.8 ppm (5 ppm to 0.5 ppm) over 8 hours and evaluate how it changes as we transition to the dry season. Back-trajectory calculations show that the daily CO2 uptake footprint is terrestrial and influenced by the heterogeneity of the Amazon rain forests. The column CO falls from above 120 ppb to below 80 ppb as we transition from the biomass burning to wet seasons. The daily mean column CO2 rises by 3 ppm from October through June. Removal of biomass burning and secular CO2 increase during this period implies an increase of 3.5 ppm that is attributed to tropical biospheric processes (respiration and photosynthesis). This is consistent with ground-based and eddy flux observations that indicate that tree phenology (e.g. leaf flushing) plays an important role in the tropical carbon cycle in regions that are not water limited and is not considered in current models. We compare our observations with output from carbon cycle models with assimilated meteorology (e.g. NASA’s CASA/GFED) and find they under predict the daily drawdown of CO2 by a factor of 2.5. We plan to perform comparisons with other models (e.g. CLM) and also determine the net carbon flux from the Amazon basin by combining back-trajectory analysis and observations of column CO2 made at Ascension Island that is upwind of our site.",

Nonetheless, conditioning simulations merely with lithological information does not utilize all of the available information and so some workers additionally condition simulations with flow data.\nIn this study, we introduce an approach to condition geostatistical simulations of the Paskapoo Formation, which is a paleo-fluvial system consisting of sandstone channels embedded in mudstone. The conditioning data consist of two-hour single well pumping tests extracted from the public water well database in Alberta, Canada.\nIn this approach, lithologic models of an entire watershed are simulated and conditioned with hard lithological data using transition probability geostatistics (TPROGS). Then, a segment of the simulation around a pumping well was used to populate a flow model (FEFLOW) with either sand or mudstone. The values of the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of sand and mudstone were then adjusted to minimize the difference between simulated and actual pumping test data using the parameter estimation program PEST. If the simulated data do not adequately match the measured data, the lithologic model is updated by locally deforming the lithology distribution using the probability perturbation method (PPM) and the model parameters are again updated with PEST. This procedure is repeated until the simulated and measured data agree within a pre-determined tolerance. The procedure is repeated for each pumping well that has pumping test data.\nThe method constrains the lithological simulations and provides estimates of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage that are consistent with the pumping test data. Eventually, the simulations will be combined in watershed scale groundwater models.",

This study constrains meadow evapotranspiration (ET) and places meadow ET in the context of the greater watershed ET. Meadows in the Sierra Nevada range from pristine to restored to degraded—decades of stock grazing, road building, and logging, have left incised stream channels and lowered water tables in many meadow s. The State of California has prioritized meadow restoration; these efforts are motivated, at least in part, as a means to increase groundwater storage (California Water Action Plan; 2014). Information on how restoration affects meadow and catchment hydrology and ET is lacking. We combined eddy covariance measurements (2013 and 2014) and meteorological records (2008 to 2014) with an Artificial Neural Network to quantify meadow ET over a 7 year period. We focused on Long Meadow, which is a pristine meadow located at 2210 m in Sequoia National Park, CA. ET was highest in drought years 2012-2014 (532 mm in 2013) and lowest in a particularly wet year (470 mm), 2011. This trend is opposite that observed for nearby upland Sierra Nevada forest by the SSCZO eddy flux stations, where annual ET declined from wet to dry years. Meadow ET was generally lower and less variable than forest ET. Long Meadow ET is 25-50% greater than ET rates reported in systems similar to degraded meadows such as bitterbrush/sagebrush dominated areas (Mauer et al.; 2006); this ET discrepancy is consistent with previous studies that suggest healthy meadow ET can be 25-50% more than ET in a degraded meadow s (Hammersmark et al.; 2008). Because meadows are a small fraction of the land area, however, restoring meadows to healthy conditions results in only a small increase in ET in the greater watershed. Restoring a meadow similar in size (~4.6 hectares) and associated catchment size (~140 hectares) to Long Meadow from a degraded to a healthy system, for example, would increase the associated catchment ET by only 0.03-0.05%. We conclude that when evaluating the ET effect of a meadow restoration, it needs to be done in context of the whole catchment.",

Depending on the physics of the problem we ought to incorporate all relevant scales. Often the behavior of the system is controlled by the phenomena at the pore-scale. Therefore accurate and efficient modeling of any large domain requires simulating parts of it at the pore-scale (i.e., wherein continuum models become invalid) and the rest at the continuum scale. Hybrid models combine pore-scale and continuum-scale representations. Desirable features of hybrid models are: 1) their ability to track where and when to use pore-scale models, i.e. their adaptability to time- and space-dependent phenomena, 2) their flexibility in implementing coupling boundary conditions, and 3) significant computational speed-up when the sub-domain wherein pore-scale simulations are required is much smaller than the total computational domain. Moreover, coupling conditions should be physics-based in order reduce the overall number of assumptions. We propose a general, robust and non-overlapping hybrid scheme based on IBM to model flow and reactive transport in porous media. The suggested algorithm has been numerically tested for several transport and flow scenarios.",

Recent experiments have provided evidence for two changes to the kinetics of NOx in the UT. First, CH3O2NO2 has been shown to be an important temporary sink for NOx, suppressing NOx in the UT. Second, the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with NO2 at the temperatures and pressures of the UT is slower than in current recommendations. We investigate the impact of updated kinetics that are consistent with in situ observations on model predictions of NO2, O3, and HNO3 concentrations and columns and on the inferred constraints on lightning NOx emissions. Changes to NO2, O3, and HNO3 concentrations resulting from the new kinetics are above the level of uncertainty in daily satellite observations.

            "abstract": "Relationships between seasonal climate, land cover and surface energy exchange in tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) environments are poorly understood. Yet, understanding these linkages is essential to evaluating the impacts of land use and climate change on the functioning of these unique ecosystems. In central Veracruz, Mexico, TMCF occurs between 1100 and 2500 m asl. The canopy of this forest consists of a mix of deciduous and broadleaved-evergreen tree species, the former of which shed their leaves for a short period during the dry season. The aim of this study was to quantify the surface energy balance, and seasonal variations therein, for TMCF, as well as for shaded coffee (CO) and sugarcane (SU), two important land uses that have replaced TMCF at lower elevations. Sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) fluxes were measured using eddy covariance and sap flow methods. Other measurements included: micrometeorological variables, soil heat flux, soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. Partitioning of available energy (A) into H and LE showed important seasonal changes as well as differences among land covers. During the wet-season month of July, average midday Bowen ratios for sunny days were lowest and least variable among land covers: 0.5 in TMCF and SU versus 0.7 in CO. However, because of higher A, along with lower Bowen ratio with respect to CO, LE over TMCF was ca. 20% higher compared to CO and SU. During the late dry-season months of March and April, average midday Bowen ratios for sunny days were generally much higher and more variable among land covers. The higher Bowen ratios indicated a reduction of LE under the drier conditions prevailing (low soil moisture and high VPD), something rarely observed in TMCFs. Moreover, because some trees were still partially leafless in March, LE over TMCF was about half that over CO and SU, suggesting an important effect of phenology on energy exchange of this TMCF. Observed differences between seasons and land covers, as well as possible implications of these findings will be further discussed.",

Resolution can be a major barrier to obtaining high-quality FORC diagrams and timeconsuming measurements that employ small field steps are necessary to resolve the finest features of a FORC distribution. We present a new experimental protocol with irregularly spaced field steps that allow different parts of a FORC diagram to be measured at different resolutions. Larger numbers of measurements can, therefore, be made in key regions of a FORC distribution to resolve diagnostic features at higher resolution. Specification of the field steps in the irregular measurement grid is based on major hysteresis properties; no a priori knowledge concerning the underlying FORC distribution is required. FORC diagrams obtained with conventional measurements and with our new measurement protocol give consistent results. Because of its variable resolution, the irregular protocol provides a clear representation of finescale features produced by quasi-reversible superparamagnetic and non-interacting singledomain particles. Although the proposed irregular measurement protocol is not as efficient at suppressing noise as recently developed post-processing techniques (e.g., VARIFORC, Egli [2013]), it enables efficient high-resolution analysis for relatively strongly magnetized samples where measurement noise is not detrimental to FORC distribution estimation.",

            "abstract": "Discrete fracture network (DFN) models often predict highly variable hydraulic connections between injection and pumping wells used for enhanced oil recovery, geothermal energy extraction, and groundwater remediation. Such connections can be difficult to verify in fractured rock systems because standard pumping or pulse interference tests interrogate too large a volume to pinpoint specific connections. Three field examples are presented in which periodic hydraulic tests were used to obtain information about hydraulic connectivity in fractured bedrock. The first site, a sandstone in New York State, involves only a single fracture at a scale of about 10 m. The second site, a granite in Brittany, France, involves a fracture network at about the same scale. The third site, a granite/schist in the U.S. State of New Hampshire, involves a complex network at scale of 30-60 m. In each case periodic testing provided an enhanced view of hydraulic connectivity over previous constant rate tests. Periodic testing is particularly adept at measuring hydraulic diffusivity, which is a more effective parameter than permeability for identify the complexity of flow pathways between measurement locations. Periodic tests were also conducted at multiple frequencies which provides a range in the radius of hydraulic penetration away from the oscillating well. By varying the radius of penetration, we attempt to interrogate the structure of the fracture network. Periodic tests, therefore, may be uniquely suited for verifying and/or calibrating DFN models.",

Agricultural soils contribute ~65% of anthropogenic N2O emissions. Understanding temporal and spatial variability of N2O emissions from agricultural soils is vital for closure of the global N2O budget and the development of mitigation opportunities. Recent studies have observed higher N2O fluxes during the day and lower at night. Understanding the mechanisms of such diurnality may have important consequences for our understanding of the N cycle. We tested the hypothesis that diurnal cycles are driven by root carbon exudes that stimulate denitrification and therefore N2O production. Alternatively, we considered that the cycle could result from higher afternoon temperatures that accelerate soil microbial activity. We removed all plants from a corn field plot and left another plot untouched. We measured soil N2O emissions in each plot using a standard static chamber technique throughout the corn growing season. And also compared static chamber results to ecosystem level N2O emissions as measured by eddy covariance tower equipped with an open-path N2O sensor. We also measured soil and air temperatures and soil water and inorganic N contents. Soil N2O emissions followed soil inorganic N concentrations and in control plot chambers ranged from 10 µg N m-2 hr-1 before fertilization to 13×103 after fertilization. We found strong diurnal cycles measured by both techniques with emissions low during night and morning hours and high during the afternoon. Corn removal had no effect on diurnality, but had a strong effect on the magnitude of soil N2O emissions. Soil temperature exhibited a weak correlation with soil N2O emissions and could not explain diurnal patterns. Further studies are underway to explore additional mechanisms that might contribute to this potentially important phenomena.",

We assessed the magnitude, spatial patterns, and trends of WUE of China’s terrestrial ecosystems and its responses to drought using a process-based ecosystem model. During the period from 2000 to 2011, the national average annual WUE (net primary productivity (NPP)/evapotranspiration (ET)) of China was 0.79 g C kg-1 H2O. Annual WUE decreased in the southern regions because of the decrease in NPP and increase in ET and increased in most northern regions mainly because of the increase in NPP. Droughts usually increased annual WUE in Northeast China and central Inner Mongolia but decreased annual WUE in central China. “Turning-points” were observed for southern China where moderate and extreme drought reduced annual WUE and severe drought slightly increased annual WUE. The cumulative lagged effect of drought on monthly WUE varied by region. Our findings have implications for ecosystem management and climate policy making. WUE is expected to continue to change under future climate change particularly as drought is projected to increase in both frequency and severity.  \nKeywords: water use efficiency (WUE), drought, carbon sink, ecosystem model, China ",

However, in-situ observations are limited to a few latitudes where observational arrays are deployed. Also, the physical relationship between ocean bottom pressure (OBP) and the AMOC has been characterized in recent literature.\nHere, we employ GRACE-derived OBP (from the JPL-RL05M mascons solution) to derive AMOC anomalies through physical relations. Viability of the approach to infer AMOC variability from GRACE-OBP observations has been demonstrated by comparing the GRACE-derived AMOC signal to in-situ observations by the RAPID array at 26.5N.

We also show that, though the system as a whole (in aggregate) behaves quite randomly, (simulated) earthquake sequences limited to specific fault sections exhibit measurable predictability in the form of increasing seismicity precursory to large m > 7 earthquakes. In order to quantify this, we develop an alert based forecasting metric similar to those presented in Keilis-Borok (2002); Molchan (1997), and show that it exhibits significant information gain compared to random forecasts. We also discuss the long standing question of activation vs quiescent type earthquake triggering. We show that VQ exhibits both behaviors separately for independent fault sections; some fault sections exhibit activation type triggering, while others are better characterized by quiescent type triggering. We discuss these aspects of VQ specifically with respect to faults in the Salton Basin and near the El Mayor-Cucapah region in southern California USA and northern Baja California Norte, Mexico.",

            "abstract": "The Calaveras fault in central California is part of the San Andreas fault system. Coyote Dam, an earthen dam that straddles the fault ~13km northeast of Gilroy, experiences creep style deformation that ranges from 10 to 15 mm/yr. Uncertainty in the location of the fault, coupled with the historic rate of deformation, affect the dam’s safety factor. Assessing the impact of fault creep on the dam’s stability is paramount to its safety evaluation, but is difficult to resolve due to limited spatial and temporal sampling of conventional methods. Terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI), like satellite-based observations, produces high spatial resolution maps of ground deformation. Unlike space-based sensors, TRI can be readily deployed and the observation geometry selected to get the maximum line of sight (LOS) signal. TRI also benefits from high temporal sampling which can be used to reduce errors related to atmospheric phase delays and high temporal sampling also facilitates tracking rapidly moving features such as landslides and glaciers. GAMMA Portable Radar Interferometer (GPRI) measurements of Coyote Dam rock faces were made from concrete piers built upstream and downstream of the dam. The GPRI operates at a radar frequency of 17.2 GHz with a spatial resolution at the dam of approximately 0.9 m x 2.0 m. Changes in LOS path length smaller than 0.1mm can be measured. Data were acquired approximately every 2 to 3 weeks over a 7-month period to map the fault trace through the dam faces. Our study exploits the dense record of observations obtained, and the relatively short distance of the radar to the dam to minimize atmospheric affects. We investigate how the deformation evolves in time and the orientation of fault through the dam, including the strike and dip as measured along the dam surface. Our results show rates consistent with GPS data and regional satellite observations, but produce a much more detailed map of the fault on the dam than possible with GPS or satellite data. This study represents the first known TRI observations of surface deformation due to fault creep.",

            "abstract": "The IDC collects waveforms from a global network of infrasound sensors maintained by the IMS, and automatically detects signal onsets and associates them to form event hypotheses. However, a large number of signal onsets are due to local clutter sources such as microbaroms (from standing waves in the oceans), waterfalls, dams, gas flares, surf (ocean breaking waves) etc. These sources are either too diffuse or too local to form events. Worse still, the repetitive nature of this clutter leads to a large number of false event hypotheses due to the random matching of clutter at multiple stations.\nPrevious studies, for example [1], have worked on categorization of clutter using long term trends on detection azimuth, frequency, and amplitude at each station. In this work we continue the same line of reasoning to build a probabilistic model of clutter that is used as part of NET-VISA [2], a Bayesian approach to network processing. The resulting model is a fusion of seismic, hydro-acoustic and infrasound processing built on a unified probabilistic framework.\nNotes:\nThe attached figure shows all the unassociated arrivals detected at IMS station I09BR for 2012 distributed by azimuth and center frequency. (The title displays the bandwidth of the kernel density estimate along the azimuth and frequency dimensions).This plot shows multiple micro-barom sources as well as other sources of infrasound clutter. A diverse clutter-field such as this one is quite common for most IMS infrasound stations, and it highlights the dangers of forming events without due consideration of this source of noise.\n",

To continue the development of the method, we present an application of LADD to detrital zircon, titanite, and rutile from a sample collected on the lower Naryani River of central Nepal. Preliminary analyses of the sample have yielded zircon U/Pb dates ranging from 31.4 to 2405 Ma; zircon (U-Th)/He from 1.8 to 15.4 Ma; titanite U/Pb between 18 and 110 Ma; titanite (U-Th)/He between 1 and 16 Ma; rutile U/Pb from 6 to 45 Ma; and rutile (U-Th)/He from 2 to 25 Ma. In addition to the initial data, we can use Ti-in-zircon, Zr-in-titanite, and Zr-in-rutile thermometers to determine the range of possible long-term cooling rates from grains with U/Pb ages younger than collision. Thus far our results from zircon analyses imply a cooling rate of approximately 15°C/Myr; titanite analyses imply between 10 and 67°C/Myr; and rutile between 9 and 267°C/Myr. This spread in potential cooling rates, especially in the order of magnitude differences of cooling rates calculated from the rutile grains, suggests that the hinterland source regions of the Naryani river experienced dramatically different exhumation histories during Himalayan orogenisis. Ongoing analyses will expand the dataset such that we can more adequately characterize the range of possibilities represented in the sample.",

            "abstract": "The Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) is a ~200 km diameter, ~10 km thick elliptical zone of low seismic shear velocity interpreted as partial melt within the mid crust of the Central Andes (Ward et al., 2014). It is thought to be the crustal magmatic source for a flare-up of large-volume ignimbrites since 10 Ma (e.g. de Silva et al., 1989), and recent rapid uplift events such as those at Uturuncu volcano appear to be associated with magmatism from the APMB at depth (e.g., Fialko and Pearse, 2011). Hence, the APMB is a first-order geologic feature on par with the Sierra Nevada batholith in CA. Here we use the topographic signature of the low-density APMB in order to quantitatively constrain the melt production necessary to generate a magmatic zone of this size. A long-wavelength, ~1 km high topographic dome spatially coincides with the seismically measured extent of the APMB. The peak of the long wavelength dome acts as a regional drainage divide, and exposed basement rock elevations show that doming is a structural feature and does not reflect solely the accumulation of volcanic deposits on the plateau. Additionally, the minimal free-air gravity anomaly above the APMB and the dome’s length scale suggest that the uplift is isostatically compensated. Based on a buried load isostatic model (e.g., Forsyth, 1985), the dome above the APMB implies that 5.6-5.8 km of crustal thickening occurred during the emplacement of the magma body. Our estimate compares well with calculations of crustal addition using magma chamber volume and a standard melt mixing model (Ward et al., 2014), and suggests that the magma production rate for the APMB may be within the range of 70-117 km3/km/yr, similar to rates of the Late Cretaceous magmatic episode in the Sierra Nevada Batholith (e.g., Ducea, 2001). Surface topography may therefore be able to provide quantitative constraints on the magnitude of pluton-scale melt fluxes.",

Absorption by an individual particle depends on both its constituent aerosol species and the arrangement of those species within the particle, but this particle-scale complexity cannot be tracked in global-scale simulations. Instead, large-scale aerosol models assume simple representations of particle composition, referred to here as inter-particle mixing, and simple representations of particle’s internal morphology, referred to here as intra-particle mixing. This study quantifies the sensitivity of absorption by black carbon to these model approximations of particle mixing. A particle-resolved model was used to simulate the evolution of diverse aerosol populations and, as the simulations proceeded, absorption by black carbon was modeled using different representations of inter-particle mixing and intra-particle mixing. Although absorption by black carbon at the particle level is sensitive to the treatment of particles’ internal morphology, at the population level absorption is only weakly sensitive to the treatment of intra-particle but depends strongly on model representations of inter-particle mixing.",

Capable of accessing a broad range of parameters (e.g., Ekman numbers between E ≃ 10−2 to 10−8 and Rayleigh numbers between Ra ≃ 104 to 1013), this device is ideal for identifying new regimes of core-style convection and for determining scaling trends that can be extrapolated to planetary conditions. In particular, this device provides the opportunity to characterize the heat transfer and velocity field behaviors needed to build and test next-generation, asymptotically accurate models of rotating convection.\nTwo experimental measurement systems, a Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, have been implemented on the UCLA rotating convection device. LDV allows for the acquisition of high resolution point velocity profiles while PIV allows for the measurement of planar velocity fields using a light sheet through the fluid layer. We present results showing the strong agreement between LDV and PIV measurements. In addition, we present results of the spin up process of a homogeneous fluid that show agreement between experimental measurements, obtained through LDV, with established theory. Our present results validate the use of the LDV and PIV systems on the UCLA rotating convection device. Thus, these two systems are now calibrated to measure the velocity and vorticity fields that characterize the turbulent, rotating core-style convection that underlies dynamo generation in planetary bodies.",

To examine small scale variability in the previous year’s accumulation, samples were taken at regular intervals from snow pits and a one square-kilometer surficial grid. Surface snow samples were collected across the icefield to evaluate large scale variability, ranging approximately 1,000 meters in elevation and 100 kilometers in distance. Individual precipitation events were also sampled to track percolation throughout the snowpack and temperature correlations. A survey of this extent has never been undertaken on the JI. Samples were analyzed in the field using a Los Gatos laser isotope analyzer. This survey helps us better understand isotope fractionation on temperate glaciers in coastal environments and provides preliminary information on the suitability of the JI for a future ice core drilling project.",

MESSENGER, the first spacecraft since the 1980s to make in-situ measurements at distances < 0.5 AU, presents a unique opportunity for observing the innermost heliosphere. It also allows studies of ICME evolution as they expand and propagate outward, interacting with the solar wind. In order to catalog ICME events observed by MESSENGER, we design a strict set of selection criteria to identify them based on magnetic field observations only, since reliable solar wind plasma observations are not available from MESSENGER. We identify 61 ICME events observed by the MESSENGER Magnetometer between 2011 and 2014, and present statistical analyses of ICME properties at Mercury. In addition, using existing datasets of ICMEs at 1 AU we investigate key ICME property changes from Mercury to 1 AU. We find good agreement with previous studies for the magnetic field strength dependence on heliospheric distance, r. We have also established three different lines of evidence that ICME deceleration continues beyond the orbit of Mercury: 1) we find a shallow decrease with distance of ∼r−0.45 for the ICME shock speed from Mercury to 1 AU, 2) the average transit speed from the Sun to Mercury for ICMEs in our catalog is ∼20% faster than the average speed from the Sun to 1 AU, 3) the ICME transit time to 1 AU has a weaker dependence on the CME initial coronagraphic speed, as compared to what we predict based on our MESSENGER ICME catalog. Based on our results, future ICME propagation studies should account for ICME speed changes beyond Mercury’s heliocentric distances to improve ICME arrival time forecasting. Our ICME database will also prove particularly useful for multipoint spacecraft studies of recent ICMEs, as well as for model validation of ICME properties.",

We\nexamined SDO/AIA EUV images of each of the jets over multiple AIA channels,\nincluding 304 Ang, which detects chromospheric emissions, and 171, 193, and 211 Ang,\nwhich detect cooler-coronal emissions.

In the cool-coronal channels, often the filament appears in absorption and\nthe hotter EUV component of the jet appears in emission. The jet bright point forms\nat the location from which the miniature filament erupts, analogous to the\nformation of a standard solar flare arcade via flare (``internal'') reconnection\nin the wake of the eruption of a typical larger-scale chromospheric filament.

Inverse analysis method may be improved by using numerical simulation (e.g. finite element (FE) method) of viscoelastic deformation, the model of which is of high-fidelity to the available high-resolution crustal data. The authors had been developing a large-scale simulation method using such FE high-fidelity models (HFM), assuming use of K computer, the current fastest supercomputer in Japan. In this study, we developed an inverse analysis method incorporating HFM, in which the asthenosphere viscosity and fault slip are estimated simultaneously, since the value of viscosity in the simulation is not trivial.\nWe carried out numerical experiments using synthetic crustal deformation data. Based on Ichimura et al. (2013), we constructed an HFM in the domain of 2048x1536x850 km, which includes the Tohoku region in northeast Japan. We used the data set of JTOPO30 (2003), Koketsu et al. (2008) and CAMP standard model (Hashimoto et al. 2004) for the model geometry. The HFM is currently in 2km resolution, resulting in 0.5 billion degrees-of-freedom. The figure shows the overview of HFM. Synthetic crustal deformation data of three years after an earthquake in the location of GEONET, GPS/A observation points, and S-net were used. Inverse analysis was formulated as minimization of L2 norm of the difference between the FE simulation results and the observation data with respect to viscosity and fault slip, combining quasi-Newton algorithm with adjoint method. Coseismic slip was expressed by superposition of 53 subfaults, with four viscoelastic layers. We carried out 90 forward simulations, and the 57 parameters converged to the true values. Due to the fast computation method, it took only five hours using 2048 nodes (1/40 of entire resource) of K computer. In the future, we would like to also consider estimation of after slip and apply the method to the actual data.",

            "abstract": "A new 2 μm triple-pulse Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar for measuring weighted-average column dry-air volume-mixing ratios of water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is under development at NASA Langley Research Center. This instrument is a technological update to the already demonstrated 2 μm CO2 double-pulse airborne IPDA lidar system at NASA Langley Research Center. The lidar consists of a direct detection system and a 2 μm triple-pulse laser transmitter. The transmitter generates three consecutive pulses at three different locked wavelength, separated by approximately 200 microseconds, for each pump pulse at 50 Hz pulse repetition rate. Optimized wavelengths tuning and locking for each of the pulses are selected such that H2O interference is minimized from CO2 measurement, and CO2 interference is minimized from the H2O measurement. This innovative technique allows simultaneous and independent measurement of H2O and CO2 optical depths from an airborne platform. Focusing on optical depth measurements, total errors in H2O and CO2 retrievals result from both random and systematic sources. Random error is associated with the IPDA lidar detection system. Systematic errors includes both atmospheric and IPDA lidar transmitter uncertainties. Atmospheric systematic error results from a combination of sensitivities to meteorological data and molecular interference. Transmitter systematic errors result from laser spectral quality and wavelength locking control. IPDA sensitivity analysis results in CO2 differential optical depth total error of 0.45% for single shot measurement dominated by the receiver. This will reduce to 0.21% for 500 shot average dominated by atmospheric pressure uncertainty. For H2O differential single-shot optical depth measurement, the 0.58% error is dominated by atmospheric effects governed by temperature and molecular interference at lower and higher ground elevations, respectively. The error will reduce to 0.48% by averaging. This presentation will illustrates the feasibility of implementing the 2 μm pulsed lidar technology for obtaining accurate H2O and CO2 airborne column measurements from an airborne platform. The technologies and techniques being developed are critical and enabling for a potential space based column measurement of CO2 and H2O.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Peltzer-2015-AGU-12-11-small.pdf\nSediments near methane vents and seeps are often anoxic in nature due to the microbial oxidation of organic matter. When the pore-water oxygen is consumed, the microbial population resorts to using sulfate as the terminal electron receptor. For the anaerobic oxidation of methane, the net reaction is:\nCH4 + SO42- = HCO3- + HS- + H2O.\nHydrogen sulfide produced by this reaction dissociates into bisulfide in proportion to the pore-water pH. Since the first pK of H2S is about 7 and close to the in situ pore-water pH, it satisfies the criteria for a useful pH indicating dye. Although the two forms of hydrogen sulfide are not visually discernable by the human eye, these two forms have distinct Raman spectra and thus can be easily quantified using an in situ spectrometer. The relative Raman cross-sections of the hydrogen sulfide species were determined in the laboratory across a range of relevant pH values and at the approximate salinity (ionic strength) and temperature of deep-sea pore waters. With this calibration, it is simple to compute the pore-water pH from the relative abundance of the two sulfide species:\npH = pK1 + log10([HS-]/[H2S]).\nPore-water profiles were investigated at several sites in the Santa Monica basin around methane mounds, gas vents and cold seeps. A titanium pore-water probe with a stainless steel frit was used to filter and collect pore-water samples at 5-10 cm intervals in the top 50-60 cm of sediment. Filtration and collection of the pore-water samples was usually accomplished in 5-10 minutes, with acquisition of the laser Raman spectra requiring only 2-4 minutes additional time. Vertical profiles of sulfate, total sulfide (H2S + HS-), methane and pH were collected simultaneously using the laser Raman spectrometer and pore-water profile sampler. Sulfate was observed to decrease from seawater concentrations to below detection limits while both methane and total sulfide increased proportionally to the sulfate loss. Once total sulfide concentrations exceeded about 10mM, the H2S and HS- peaks were of sufficient size that their ratio could be determined with sufficient precision to allow determination of the in situ pH. For the several profiles observed, pH ranged from 7.5 to 7.9 near the sediment water interface and with generally decreasing profiles down-core to pH values as low as 7.0.",

            "abstract": "Scaling properties of the stochastic component of EUV intensity fluctuations from AIA/SDO observations show long-term correlations and can carry information about the energetics of coronal loops. Power spectra indicate that the stochastic time series are nonstationary. Thus we apply the method of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which was designed to determine the true scaling properties of a signal. It can identify the long-term correlations in noisy and nonstationary time series after accounting for external influences. The scaling exponents encountered in the solar fluctuation functions indicate long-time correlations of the series. We study to what degree the properties may correspond to those of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) or fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) processes. Analysis of a non-flaring active region (AR) indicates that the EUV emission in the hot 131 Å (Fe XXI), hot 94 Å (Fe XVIII) and 335 Å intensity bands has different properties from the warm emission in the 211, 193 and 171 Å bands. Further differences are found in the quiet vs AR core regions. The intensity values satisfy probability distribution functions (pdf)s corresponding to superposed lognormal and Gaussian functions. The pdfs of the increments are Gaussian. The properties of the data can be reproduced by a physically motivated phenomenological model for impulsive heating with added noise. We propose that DFA, complemented with the identification of the pdfs, can be a useful tool to constrain more realistic models of coronal heating.",

Traditionally, there has been a large divide between real-time and re-analysis data products. What if these completely separate processing systems could be merged? Through advanced modeling and physically based algorithms, Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) has narrowed the gap between real-time and research-quality. Satellite microwave ocean products have proven useful for a wide array of timely Earth science applications. Through cloud SST capabilities have enormously benefited tropical cyclone forecasting and day to day fisheries management, to name a few. Oceanic wind vectors enhance operational safety of shipping and recreational boating. Atmospheric rivers are of import to many human endeavors, as are cloud cover and knowledge of precipitation events. Some activities benefit from both climate and real-time operational data used in conjunction. RSS has been consistently improving microwave Earth Science Data Records (ESDRs) for several decades, while making near real-time data publicly available for semi-operational use. These data streams have often been produced in 2 stages: near real-time, followed by research quality final files. Over the years, we have seen this time delay shrink from months or weeks to mere hours. As well, we have seen the quality of near real-time data improve to the point where the distinction starts to blur. We continue to work towards better and faster RFI filtering, adaptive algorithms and improved real-time validation statistics for earlier detection of problems. Can it be possible to produce climate quality data in real-time, and what would the advantages be? We will try to answer these questions…",

The SCB has been a focus site of efforts to evaluate the ability of top-down methods to diagnose emissions from the world’s megacities using measurements of CO2 from both in situ and remote sensing. The topography within the SCB is, however, rather unique. Debris flow from the rapidly ascending San Gabriel Mountains that bound the north of the basin has produced sharp topographic relief with mean surface elevation sloping from the ocean at the southwest to nearly 500 m at the foothills of the mountains only 50 km to the northeast. Several valleys cut through the basin producing even more complex circulation. Using remote sensing observations of the total column mean CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) made from ground-based spectrometers and from space (OCO-2) together with high-resolution WRF simulations coupled to the building-level Hestia-LA CO2 emission product, we examine how gradients in XCO2 are driven by both emissions and transport though the complex topographic tapestry of the SCB.",

To address this, we have implemented and tested with stakeholders a parsimonious multi-stage mixed integer programming (MIP) model that identifies the optimal time period(s) for implementing publicly and privately financed adaptation measures. Publicly funded measures include reach-scale flood barriers, flood insurance, and buyout programs to encourage property owners in flood-prone areas to retreat from the floodplain. Measures privately funded by property owners consist of property-scale floodproofing options, such as raising building foundations, as well as investments in flood insurance or retreat from flood-prone areas.\nThe objective function to minimize the sum of flood control and damage costs in all planning stages for different property types during floods of different severities. There are constraints over time for flow mass balances, construction of flood management alternatives and their cumulative implementation, budget allocations, and binary decisions. Damages are adjusted for flood control investments.\nIn recognition of the deep uncertainty of GCM-derived climate change scenarios, we employ the minimax regret criterion to identify adaptation portfolios robust to different climate change trajectories. As an example, we identify publicly and privately funded adaptation measures for a stylized community based on the estuarine community of Exeter, New Hampshire, USA. We explore the sensitivity of recommended portfolios to different ranges of climate changes, and costs associated with economies of scale and flexible infrastructure design as well as different municipal budget constraints.",

Greenland Sea is a section of the southern Arctic Ocean off the eastern coast of Greenland, and just a small part of global ocean. However, a recent study revealed that Greenland Sea has warmed 10 times faster than global ocean on average and can be a leading indicator of climate change. Interannual and seasonal variability of chlorophyll a concentration in the Greenland Sea can be identified spatially by ocean color remote sensing. For extrapolation of bloom of past years, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) and CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Sensor) 8-day chlorophyll a data were fitted to Gussian function of time (Yamada et al., 2006). Parameters obtained from the Gaussian fit are start timing, end timing of the bloom, peak concentration, peak timing and bloom duration. The bloom timing and its magnitude were spatially varying. Satellite data indicate that the blooms of northward of Jan Mayen were the largest and most intense, with chlorophyll a concentration often exceeding 10 mg m-3. The bloom started at the west coast of Spitsbergen in May, northward of Jan Mayen in June and continued through June and July, respectively. The bloom in the Greenland Sea in 2004 appeard one month earlier than others and was the largest in 2007. We also investigated sea ice concentration percent observed by SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) and SSMIS (Special Sensor Microwave Image Sounder) satellite sensors for the same period. The results show that bloom timing seemed to be related with the anomalous variations of sea ice extent in northern Greenland Sea, ocean currents and variability of global climate index.",

We have obtained global distribution of occurrence of the identified waves with distinction between H- and He-bands. We compare it with previous observations such as THEMIS and CRRES. For the identified events we have drawn all the basic wave properties including wave frequency, polarization, wave normal angle. In addition, we have distinguished the EMIC events that occur inside the plasmasphere and at the plasmapause from those outside the plasmasphere. Finally, we have tested solar wind and geomagnetic dependence of the wave events. We give discussions about implications of these observations on wave generation mechanism and interaction with radiation belt electrons.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial meltwater erosion (SME) is thought to contribute to the excavation of tunnel valleys and inner gorges, yet the underpinnings of the formation of these landforms remain obscure. Tunnel valleys are large channel-like features (100s of metres to few kilometres wide and up to 10s of kilometres in length) commonly found in the vicinity of former continental ice-sheet margins. The main question concerning their formation is: does SME excavate them gradually or by large subglacial floods? Inner gorges are V-shaped incisions in an otherwise glacially overprinted landscape. The initial assertion of their fluvial origin has recently been disputed, as they have been shown to persist through multiple glaciations and SME has been invoked to explain some inner gorges in Scandinavia and the Alps. The question is therefore: can SME explain the excavation of an inner gorge?\nIn order to test these hypotheses related to the genesis of tunnel valleys and inner gorges, we use a 1-D model of subglacial hydrology to drive a model of bedrock erosion by total sediment load based on the tools and cover effect. Calculated values of subglacial transport stage in response to ordinary seasonal processes are comparable to those during large floods in rivers. Subglacial floods therefore limit bedrock erosion by transporting sediment farther from the bed, thus inhibiting impacts. Consequently, we find that gradual SME is likely to produce more incision over a glacial cycle. When we simulate the total SME that occurs through a glacial cycle under a synthetic ice-sheet margin, we are able to produce tunnel valleys or inner gorges over the timespan of a glaciation. Based on these results, we propose that (1) tunnel valleys and inner gorges can both be the result of SME, (2) tunnel valleys in bedrock can be formed through gradual processes rather than floods, and (3) SME enhances inner gorge relief.",

            "abstract": "Post-normal science requires public engagement and adaptive corrections in addressing issues with high complexity and uncertainty. An adaptive management framework is presented for the improved management of natural resources and environments through a public participation process. The framework solicits the gathering and transformation and/or modeling of scientific information but also explicitly solicits the expression of participant beliefs. Beliefs and information are compared, explicitly discussed for alignments or misalignments, and ultimately melded back together as a \"knowledge\" basis for making decisions. An effort is made to recognize the human or participant biases that may affect the information base and the potential decisions. In a separate step, an attempt is made to recognize and predict the potential \"winners\" and \"losers\" (perceived or real) of any decision or action. These \"winners\" and \"losers\" include present human communities with different spatial, demographic or socio-economic characteristics as well as more dispersed or more diffusely characterized regional or global communities. \"Winners\" and \"losers\" may also include future human communities as well as communities of other biotic species. As in any adaptive management framework, assessment of predictions, iterative follow-through and adaptation of policies or actions is essential, and commonly very difficult or impossible to achieve. Recognizing beforehand the limits of adaptive management is essential. More generally, knowledge of the behavioral and economic sciences and of ethics and sociology will be key to a successful implementation of this adaptive management framework. Knowledge of biogeophysical processes will also be essential, but by definition of the issues being addressed, will always be incomplete and highly uncertain. The human dimensions of the issues addressed and the participatory processes used carry their own complexities and uncertainties. Some ideas and principles are provided that may help guide and implement the proposed adaptive management framework and its public and stakeholder engagement processes. Examples and characteristics of issues that could be beneficially addressed through the proposed framework will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_2015_eposter.pdf\nThe use of seismic waves to discriminate between earthquakes and underground explosions is complicated by the observation that explosions routinely radiate strong S waves. Whether these S waves are primarily generated by non-linear processes at the source, or by mode conversions and scattering along the path remains an open question. It has been demonstrated that S waves are generated at the source by any mechanism that breaks the spherical symmetry of the explosion. Examples of such mechanisms include tectonic shear stress, spall, and anisotropy in the emplacement medium. Many crystalline rock massifs are transversely isotropic because they contain aligned fractures over a range of scales from microfractures at the grain scale (called the rift) to regional sets of joints. In this study we use a micromechanical damage mechanics to model the fracture damage patterns and seismic radiation generated by explosions in a material in which the initial distribution of fractures has a preferred direction. Our simulations are compared with a set of field experiments in a granite quarry in Barre, VT conducted by New England Research and Weston Geophysical. Barre granite has a strong rift plane of aligned microfractures. Our model captures two important results of these field studies: 1) the spatial extent of rock fracture and generation of S waves depends on the burn-rate of the explosion and 2) the resultant damage is anisotropic with most damage occurring in the preferred direction of the microfractures (the rift plane in the granite). The physical reason damage is enhanced in the rift direction is that the mode I stress intensity factor is large for each fracture in the array of parallel fractures in the rift plane. Tensile opening on the rift plane plus sliding on the preexisting fractures make strong non-spherical contributions to the moment tensor in the far-field.",

            "abstract": "For computationally expensive climate models, Monte-Carlo approaches of exploring the input parameter space are often prohibitive due to slow convergence with respect to ensemble size. To alleviate this, we build inexpensive surrogates using uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods employing Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions that approximate the input-output relationships using as few model evaluations as possible. However, when many uncertain input parameters are present, such UQ studies suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, for 50-100 input parameters non-adaptive PC representations have infeasible numbers of basis terms. To this end, we develop and employ Weighted Iterative Bayesian Compressive Sensing to learn the most important input parameter relationships for efficient, sparse PC surrogate construction with posterior uncertainty quantified due to insufficient data. Besides drastic dimensionality reduction, the uncertain surrogate can efficiently replace the model in computationally intensive studies such as forward uncertainty propagation and variance-based sensitivity analysis, as well as design optimization and parameter estimation using observational data. We applied the surrogate construction and variance-based uncertainty decomposition to Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME) Land Model for several output QoIs at nearly 100 FLUXNET sites covering multiple plant functional types and climates, varying 65 input parameters over broad ranges of possible values.\nThis work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research, Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME) project.

            "abstract": "The southern terminus of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) of the Pacific Northwest terminates at the Mendocino Triple Junction, a region of elevated seismicity. Here, episodic, tectonically driven uplift is likely responsible for the formation of a suite of Holocene-aged marine terraces. In 1992, a M 7.1 thrust mainshock and two ~M 6.5 aftershocks occurred ~ 4 km offshore of Cape Mendocino resulting in ~1.4 m of uplift, measured from intertidal species stranded upon uplifted wave-cut platforms (Carver et al., 1994; Merritts, 1996). Using high resolution LiDAR data (NOAA, 2012), we constructed a detailed map of the uplifted 1992 wavecut platform and 9 adjacent higher terrace surfaces between Cape Mendocino and the mouth of the Mattole River. The risers associated with these surfaces are between 1 and 3 m high, similar to that of the 1992 event. This work offers insight into the upper plate crustal response to seismic events and inter-seismic periods in the tectonically complex southern end of the CSZ. By relating the elevations of the shoreline angles of these terraces to an established sea level curve (Gibbs, 1986) and a single absolute age on one terrace (Merritts, 1996) we estimate their ages of formation as all less than 6 ka. Eustatic sea level in the last 6 ka has been fairly stable indicating that these terraces formed during co-seismic uplift events. Marine terrace formation requires relative sea level stability thus there is no indication of vertical interseismic deformation along this portion of the subduction zone. This late Holocene behavior differs from other portions of the CSZ to the north where interseismic recovery has been documented. The presence of multiple, relatively small terrace risers in the last 6 ka suggests this portion of the subduction zone may rupture in smaller events on the megathrust or subsidiary faults.",

Where sampled, these lavas are aphyric, glassy dacites and are not associated with andesite extrusives (commonly observed elsewhere). Several flow fields occur on the flank of the large silicic Niuatahi seamount. Two of the largest lava fields and several smaller ones (~220 km2) erupted as far as 60 km north of Niuatahi. Their occurrence is likely controlled by crustal fractures from the long-term extension in this rear-arc region. Determining thickness of these flows is problematic, but relief of 30-100 m on flow fronts and in collapsed areas yields volume estimates as high as ~7-18 km3 for the northern group. The mean silica content of the largest and best sampled dacite flow field (LL-B) is 65.6 ±0.2%, a remarkably consistent composition for such an extensive flow (~140 km2). Camera tows show lower viscosity flow forms, including many anastomatosing pillow tubes and ropey surfaces, as well as endogenous domes, ridges and lobes (some with “crease-like” extrusion ridges, and inflated lobes with extrusion structures). An enigmatic 2 x 1.5 km, 30-m deep collapse depression could mark an eruption center for the LL-B flow field. Low viscosity flow morphologies on portions of LL-B and a nearby smaller flow field implies high effusion rates during some phases of the eruption(s), which in turn implies some combination of higher than normal liquidus temperature and high water content. Submarine dacite flows have been described in ancient sequences from the Archaean through the Miocene but this is the first modern occurrence of large volume submarine dacite flows. The volume of these young dacite flows implies the presence of large differentiated melt batches in the NE Lau lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Cooperative Autonomous Observing System Project (CAOS) at the MIT Earth Signals and Systems Group has developed methodology and systems for dynamically mapping coherent fluids such as plumes using small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). In the CAOS approach, two classes of sUAS, one remote the other in-situ, implement a dynamic data-driven mapping system by closing the loop between Modeling, Estimation, Sampling, Planning and Control (MESPAC). The continually gathered measurements are assimilated to produce maps/analyses which also guide the sUAS network to adaptively resample the environment. Rather than scan the volume in fixed Eulerian or Lagrangian flight plans, the adaptive nature of the sampling process enables objectives for efficiency and resilience to be incorporated.\nModeling includes realtime prediction using two types of reduced models, one based on nowcasting remote observations of plume tracer using scale-cascaded alignment, and another based on dynamically-deformable EOF/POD developed for coherent structures. Ensemble-based Information-theoretic machine learning approaches are used for the highly non-linear/non-Gaussian state/parameter estimation, and for planning. Control of the sUAS is based on model reference control coupled with hierarchical PID.\nMESPAC is implemented in part on a SkyCandy platform, and implements an airborne mesh that provides instantaneous situational awareness and redundant communication to an operating fleet. SkyCandy is deployed on Itzamna Aero's I9X/W UAS with low-cost sensors, and is currently being used to study the Popocatepetl volcano. Results suggest that operational communities can deploy low-cost sUAS to systematically monitor whilst optimizing for efficiency/maximizing resilience. The CAOS methodology is applicable to many other environments where coherent structures are present in the background. More information can be found at caos.mit.edu.",

            "abstract": "Physical breakdown of rock across a broad scale spectrum involves fracturing. In many areas large fractures develop near the topographic surface, with sheeting joints being among the most impressive. Sheeting joints share many geometric, textural, and kinematic features with other joints (opening-mode fractures) but differ in that they are (a) discernibly curved, (b) open near the topographic surface, and (c) form subparallel to the topographic surface. Where sheeting joints are geologically young, the surface-parallel compressive stresses are typically several MPa or greater. Sheeting joints are best developed beneath domes, ridges, and saddles; they also are reported, albeit rarely, beneath valleys or bowls. A mechanism that accounts for all these associations has been sought for more than a century: neither erosion of overburden nor high lateral compressive stresses alone suffices. Sheeting joints are not accounted for by Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criteria. Principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, together with the mechanical effect of a curved topographic surface, do provide a basis for understanding sheeting joint growth and the pattern sheeting joints form. Compressive stresses parallel to a singly or doubly convex topographic surface induce a tensile stress perpendicular to the surface at shallow depths; in some cases this alone could overcome the weight of overburden to open sheeting joints. If regional horizontal compressive stresses, augmented by thermal stresses, are an order of magnitude or so greater than a characteristic vertical stress that scales with topographic amplitude, then topographic stress perturbations can cause sheeting joints to open near the top of a ridge. This topographic effect can be augmented by pressure within sheeting joints arising from water, ice, or salt. Water pressure could be particularly important in helping drive sheeting joints downslope beneath valleys. Once sheeting joints have formed, the rock sheets between the joints can slide downslope; they can also buckle, resulting in a further breakdown of the rock. Understanding how sheeting joints evolve in three dimensions through time remains an outstanding challenge and would illuminate their affect on landscapes, slope stability, and fluid flow.",

            "abstract": "High elevation meadows in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA represent mixing zones between surface water and groundwater. Quantifying the exchange between stream water and groundwater, and the residence time of water stored in meadow sediments will allow examination of the possible buffer effect that groundwater has on meadows and streams. This in turn has implications for the resilience of the ecosystem as well as the downstream communities that are dependent upon runoff for water supply. Stream flow was measured and water samples were collected along a 5 km reach of the Tuolumne River and adjacent wells during both spring runoff and baseflow. Water samples were analyzed for concentrations of dissolved noble gases and anions, sulfur-35, tritium and radon to study surface water-groundwater interactions and residence times. Although lower than average because of the ongoing drought in California, discharge in early July 2015 was about 35 times that measured during the previous fall. During baseflow, a small component of fracture flow (2%) is identified using dissolved helium. Radon, anions and stream discharge identify reaches of groundwater discharge. Anions show a steady increase in the groundwater component over the western portion of the meadow during baseflow, and over 50% of stream water is exchanged with meadow groundwater, without a net gain or loss of stream flow. Sulfur-35 and tritium results indicated that groundwater contributing to stream flow has recharged within the previous two years. With the current drought, estimated as the most severe in 1200 years, accurate estimations of water availability are becoming increasingly important to water resource managers.",

            "abstract": "In ensemble prediction, Gilmour et al. (2001) proposed measures of relative nonlinearity to quantify the duration of the linear regime from “twin” pairs of ensemble members. The duration of the “linear regime” is useful in forming and interpreting ensembles in numerical weather prediction. Here this method is applied to the state-of-the-art climate model CESM, focusing on how its linear durations will change as the perturbations imposed on one location differ spatially and temporally. The spatial and temporal propagations of point perturbations provide insights into model physics and facilitate interpretation of model projections in future climate scenarios. They provide insight into chaos-like behavior on short time scales, and an indication of the sensitivity and saturation (mixing) times of CESM. Starting from the same initial state, we add relatively small “twin” perturbations (that is, positive and negative perturbations of the same magnitudes) to surface variables, with the locations of the perturbations spanning from the tropics to the poles. As the location changes, the model evolves differently in terms of how the point perturbation extends out of its origin and spreads globally, indicating that different physical mechanisms have played roles in different cases. Repeating the same set of experiments by changing only the perturbation magnitudes insures the linear regime is sampled without constructing an adjoint. Further, how uncertainty growth varies with location in the model state space can be explored by repeating the experiment for different initial states. We compare the responses of the linear regime durations in terms of locations, initial states and magnitudes of the perturbations systematically, and the implications for ensemble experiments and sensitivity studies are discussed. This work is a first step towards treating state-of-the-art climate models with the tools of nonlinear dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Since 2014, several cities of southeastern Brazil have grappled with their worst drought in nearly 80 years. To improve water availability in this region, the Brazilian government has studied the possibility of increasing groundwater use, mainly in the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), the largest (~1.2 million km2) transnational boundary groundwater reservoir in South America. Approximately one half of the outcrop areas of the GAS are located in the Cerrado biome, the main agricultural expansion region in Brazil. Large areas of Cerrado vegetation have been converted into farmland in recent years; however, little attention has been paid to the consequences of this land cover and land use change on groundwater recharge. In this study we assessed groundwater recharge in different physiognomies of the Cerrado located in an outcrop area of the GAS. Water table fluctuations were measured from October 2011 through August 2013, by 64 monitoring wells distributed on five physiognomies of the undisturbed Cerrado. We used 20 (2.2±0.3 m), 20 (4.3±1.4 m), 14 (4.7±1.9 m), 9 (6.2±0.7 m), and 1 (42 m) monitoring wells (and average depth of wells) for \"campo limpo\" (cerrado grassland), \"campo sujo\" (shrub cerrado), \"campo cerrado\" (shrub cerrado), \"cerrado sensu stricto\" (wooded cerrado), and \"cerrado sensu stricto denso\" (cerrado woodland), respectively. Recharge was computed for each well using the Water Table Fluctuation method. The measured precipitation for hydrological years 2011-12 and 2012-13 were 1247 mm and 1194 mm, respectively. We found values of average annual recharge of 363 mm, 354 mm, 324 mm, and 315 mm for \"campo limpo\", \"campo sujo\",\"campo cerrado\", and \"cerrado sensu stricto\", respectively. We did not find changes in the water table level in the one well located in the \"cerrado sensu stricto denso\". The water table in this well was 35 m deep; therefore, the amount of water that eventually reached the saturated zone was not enough to cause a rapid change in the water table level. We also found the same characteristic in five wells deeper than 7 m located in \"campo cerrado\" and \"cerrado sensu stricto\". Our results suggest that recharge tends to decrease with the increase in thickness of the vadose zone and with the rise density of vegetation (grassland to woodland).",

Tasmania (SE Australia) has not been considered in previous Nuna reconstructions. Prior to late Neoproterozoic rifting, this crustal fragment was likely part of the eastern margin of East Antarctica. The significance of Tasmania’s position within Nuna has recently been highlighted with the discovery that the majority of a >10-km-thick marine shelfal package exposed in northwest Tasmania (Rocky Cape Group) was deposited between 1.45 and 1.30 Ga. The detrital zircon signatures of these strata are distinct from other Mesoproterozoic basins in Australia, and instead closely resemble time-equivalent upper parts of the Belt-Purcell Basin of Laurentia, suggesting correlations within Nuna.\nWe investigate the provenance of the Rocky Cape Group quartzites by comparing new detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data to an extensive compilation of zircon data from Australia, East Antarctica, and Laurentia. Our analysis demonstrates that the Rocky Cape Group is unlikely to have been sourced from any geological terrane exposed in present-day Australia. Instead, zircon isotopic signatures from basement terranes in Laurentia and East Antarctica show striking similarities to the Rocky Cape Group detrital signature. Paleocurrent data indicate a northwest-southeast–trending paleoshoreline and suggest that the majority of sediment was sourced from Paleoproterozoic crust in SW Laurentia, which was to the southeast (present-day coordinates) of Tasmania. These new data support a SWEAT-like (southwest United States–East Antarctica) configuration for Nuna. We suggest that rifting propagated southward from ca. 1.4 Ga, leaving a thinned continental connection between East Antarctica and southwest Laurentia onto which the lower-middle RCG was deposited prior to 1.3 Ga.",

            "abstract": "The huge coseismic slip during the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake concentrated beneath the lower inner slope of the middle Japan Trench (Miyagi region) and its amount sharply diminished along the trench within a hundred kilometers (e.g., Iinuma et al., 2012). The previous 2-D seismic study in the corresponding area found a notable Vp change in the hanging wall side of the megathrust (Azuma et al., in prep.). High-Vp body, corresponding to the rigid backstop block (Tsuru et al., 2002) was identified in the Miyagi, but was absent in the northern area. The spatial extent of the high-Vp anomaly almost coincides with the large slip zone and the correlation suggests that the heterogeneous structure in the overriding plate controlled the rupture process of the M-9 mainshock. To confirm the correlation between the seismic structure and coseismic slip distribution, we conducted a wide-angle survey in 2014 around the previous survey.\nIn analysis, we operated a traveltime inversion for the first arrivals (Fujie et al., 2000) to obtain a rough model. Then, we made a trial-and-error adjustment of the structure model based on the travel time modeling with a 2D ray tracing (Zelt and Ellis, 1988). In the modeling, we tried to identify the location of the boundary between the backstop block and the low-Vp prism, because we assume the boundary (B/P boundary) to be correlated to the border of the high-slip zone during the 2011 event.\nThe results showed sharp Vp transition from >3.7 km/s (backstop) to <3.4 km/s (prism) representing the B/P boundary. This feature agrees with the Vp variation or the along-trench distribution of the prism clarified by the previous studies. In the several observed record sections, there are clear shadow zone of the refracted arrivals from the backstop layer. The presence of the shadow indicates that a low Vp layer underlies the backstop, which is consistent with the previous reflection profiling made across the trench system. The low Vp prism is located between the backstop and subducting oceanic crust. Further analysis of the appearance of the shadow zone would constrain the along-fault distribution of the low-Vp material, which we expect to correlate with the spatial pattern of the seismic slip.",

            "abstract": "We measure normal fault characteristics at the intermediate-spreading Chile Ridge to investigate how tectonomagmatic processes vary along and between spreading segments of different lengths and offsets. Multibeam bathymetry and bathymetry gradients are used to locate fault scarps along spreading flowlines and to measure fault displacement and spacing. We estimate the fraction of plate separation taken up by prominent, lithosphere-scale normal faults by summing the horizontal offsets of individual faults along selected across-axis transects and dividing by the total extension. We attribute the remaining fraction of extension, M, primarily to magmatic accretion. We find that M ranges from 0.80 to 0.95, and systematically increases from first- and second-order segment offsets towards segment centers. This is accompanied by a strong anti-correlation of M with depth of the ridge axial valley relative to the axial flanks. No significant correlation between M and segment length or offset distances is found. Further, we find that fault spacing does not correlate with ridge morphology, geometry or M. Thus, the observed increase in tectonic strain toward segment ends is primarily achieved through increasing slip on approximately equally spaced faults, rather than uniform slip on more numerous and closely-spaced faults. Analyses of the seafloor fabric suggest an evolutionary cycle whereby small faults form in the axial valley during periods of diffuse tectonic extension. This phase ends when a few larger faults accumulate enough strain to rapidly link along-axis and transition into axially continuous abyssal hills. Finally, we assess potential correlations between M and previously published geochemical proxies for magma supply. We focus on estimates of the extent of partial melting F, which is expected to increase with mantle melt supply, and the MgO content of seafloor basalts, which is expected to decrease in melt-rich crustal storage zones due to fractional crystallization. Estimates of M, MgO, and F exhibit similar wavelengths of variability (30-50 km) shorter than the length scale of first-order segmentation. This may indicate that the extension not accounted for by faulting, M, is more closely related to the magmatic segmentation of Chile Ridge spreading centers than to first-order tectonic segmentation.",

            "abstract": "After the great 1960 Chile earthquake, Press et al. (1961) created a unilateral source rupture model with a length of 1000 km at a speed of 3- 4km/s. Kanamori and Cipar (1974), looked at long-period motion before the main shock in the strain-meter record at ISA and hinted the existence of a slow precursor. Kanamori and Anderson (1975) interpreted that the anomalous decrease of the Fourier spectral amplitude near 1.8 and 3.0mHz of the UCLA gravimeter record and the Press-Ewing seismometer record at PAS are caused by the interference between the main-shock and an un-modeled precursor. Cifuentes and Silver (1989) collected IGY seismographic data and confirmed the existence of the spectral holes at 4 stations all situated in the continental U.S. and modeled the holes with a large precursor or a post-cursor with magnitude comparable to the main shock. CS89 reported no such normal mode spectral holes outside North America. If the spectrum holes are due to destructive interference of a large pre- or post-cursor, the spectrum pattern will be a global feature. Seismograms outside North America are well explained by the unilateral rupture model. KA75 and CS89 synthetic spectra did not consider the spheroidal-toroidal modal coupling effect.\nWe compared the amplitude spectra computed for earthquake models of a line source and a point source, and for the PREM and a rotating elliptic Earth model with laterally heterogeneity inside. The spectra are computed for the same time series presented in CS89 and directly compared with their amplitude pattern. The observed amplitude spectrum patterns are re-produced at 8 globally distributed stations including the amplitude holes at 4 stations in the U.S by a 920km-long line source (same to the CS89 source) for a rotating elliptic earth model with lateral heterogeneity inside. The synthetic spectrum tests indicate that the long-period precursor or post-cursor proposed by Cifuentes and Silver (1989) and Kanamori and Anderson (1975) is likely unnecessary. This is consistent with absence of the report of a long-period precursor in the strain-meter records at Nana (Peru) and Ogdensburg (New Jersey). Even a possible post or precursor is excluded, magnitude Mw9.6 estimate by seismological methods is still larger than geodetic (Mw9.3) and tsunami (Mw9.2) estimates.",

During the snow season, we can use two measurements: (1) passive microwave estimates of SWE, which generally underestimate in the mountains; (2) fractional snow-covered area from MODIS. Once the snow has melted, we can reconstruct the accumulated SWE back to the last significant snowfall by calculating the energy used in melt. The reconstructed SWE values provide a training set for predictions from the passive microwave SWE and snow-covered area. We examine several machine learning methods—regression-boosted decision trees, bagged trees, neural networks, and genetic programming—to estimate SWE. All methods work reasonably well, with R2 values greater than 0.8. Predictors built with multiple years of data reduce the bias that usually appears if we predict one year from just one other year’s training set. Genetic programming tends to produce results that additionally provide physical insight. Adding precipitation estimates from the Global Precipitation Measurements mission is in progress.",

At their best, scenarios can effectively represent deep uncertainty; integrate over multiple domains; and enable parties with different expectation and values to expand the range of futures they consider, to see the world from different points of view, and to grapple seriously with the potential implications of surprising or inconvenient futures. These attributes of scenario processes can prove crucial in helping craft effective responses to climate change. But traditional scenario methods can also fail to overcome difficulties related to choosing, communicating, and using scenarios to identify, evaluate, and reach consensus on appropriate policies. Such challenges can limit scenario’s impact in broad public discourse. This talk will demonstrate how new decision support approaches can employ new quantitative tools that allow scenarios to emerge from a process of deliberation with analysis among stakeholders, rather than serve as inputs to it, thereby increasing the impacts of scenarios on decision making. This talk will demonstrate these methods in the design of a decision support tool to help residents of low lying coastal cities grapple with the long-term risks of sea level rise. In particular, this talk will show how information from the IPCC SSP’s can be combined with local information to provide a rich set of locally decision-relevant information.",

            "abstract": "Carbonatitic and carbonate-silicate magmas are representative of mantle-derived liquids that form by partial melting of carbonated peridotite and eclogite rocks at depths greater than 60 km in the Earth’s interior. Carbonatitic melts are expected to contain 1-5 wt% SiO2, but at shallower conditions (about 100 km in depth), as a result of large melt fraction during decompression, SiO2 content increases up to 10-20 wt%. This variation in composition is expected to cause significant changes in the physical properties (e.g. viscosity and melt structure) of these magmas.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the viscosity and structure of CO2-rich melts with variable SiO2 content representative of carbonatitic to carbonate-silicate natural melts. A mixture of CaCO3, MgCO3, SiO2, FeO, and NaCl was used as starting material. Synthetic glasses with 5 wt% and 18wt% SiO2 were quenched at high pressure using multi anvil presses. Viscosity measurements on CO2-bearing liquids were conducted with the falling-sphere method using the Paris-Edinburg type large volume apparatus at pressures between 1.5-6 GPa and temperatures of 1100-1500 °C. Determinations of viscosity of these liquids were determined from radiographic images recorded with a high-speed camera installed at Sector 16-BM-B (APS, Argonne). Falling velocity of the platinum probing spheres was measured by ultrafast X-ray radiography using a high-speed camera with a 500 fps recording rate (exposure time of 2 ms). The viscosity was, then, calculated from the Stokes equation including the correction factors for the effect of the wall and the end effect (Kono et al. 2014). Structural measurements of the liquid at high temperature were also performed using multi-angle energy dispersive X-ray diffraction technique.\nPreliminary results from this study will contribute to understand the variation of viscosity as function of pressure, temperature and degree of polymerization of CO2- melts during up welling within the asthenospheric mantle.",

First, oldest strata in the Antofagasta de la Sierra region (SW Puna) and the Pasto Ventura region (SE Puna) both contain little volcanic material, suggesting they predate the most recent arc activity at ~28 Ma. Second, detrital zircons from the Antofagasta de la Sierra region yield youngest U-Pb ages of ~39 Ma and detrital apatites from the Pasto Ventura region yield youngest fission-track ages of ~38 Ma, giving a maximum depositional age. Third, provenance analysis reveals a single, western source for the Antofagasta de la Sierra region (SW Puna) and dual, eastern and western sources for the Pasto Ventura region (SE Puna), supporting the presence of a regional basin.\nThis regional basin was disrupted and compartmentalized by uplift of ~N-S trending bedrock ranges starting as early as in late Oligocene time. Bedrock samples from the eastern foot of the Sierra de Calalaste (SW Puna) yield an apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He age of 19.9±2.0 Ma, consistent with modeled apatite fission-track data that show onset of exhumation at ~25-20 Ma. Modeling of apatite fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He data shows that the Sierra Laguna Blanca (SE Puna) experienced exhumation at ~15-10 Ma, the youngest bedrock exhumation documented in the plateau region, implying that deformation and erosion of basement-bounding structures continued into the middle Miocene.\nWe suggest that the post-late Eocene regional deformation history of the southern Puna Plateau documents an important dynamic shift from flexure-controlled foreland dynamics to flexure-limited broken foreland dynamics during the Oligocene.",

The WIPP is located in the Permian Delaware Basin near Carlsbad, New Mexico, U.S.A. The TRU waste includes, but is not limited to, iron-based alloys and the complexing agent, citric acid. Iron is also present from the steel used in the waste containers.\nThe objective of this analysis is to derive the Pitzer activity coefficients for the pair of Na+ and FeCit- complex to expand current WIPP thermodynamic database. An aqueous model for the dissolution of Fe(OH)2(s) in a Na3Cit solution was fitted to the experimentally measured solubility data. The aqueous model consists of several chemical reactions and related Pitzer interaction parameters. Specifically, Pitzer interaction parameters for the Na+ and FeCit- pair (β(0), β(1), and Cφ) plus the stability constant for species of FeCit- were fitted to the experimental data. Anoxic gloveboxes were used to keep the oxygen level low (<1 ppm) throughout the experiments due to redox sensitivity.\nEQ3NR, a computer program for geochemical aqueous speciation-solubility calculations, packaged in EQ3/6 v.8.0a, calculates the aqueous speciation and saturation index using an aqueous model addressed in EQ3/6’s database. The saturation index indicates how far the system is from equilibrium with respect to the solid of interest. Thus, the smaller the sum of squared saturation indices that the aqueous model calculates for the given number of experiments, the more closely the model attributes equilibrium to each individual experiment with respect to the solid of interest.\nThe calculation of aqueous speciation and saturation indices was repeated by adjusting stability constant of FeCit-, β(0), β(1), and Cφ in the database until the values are found that make the sum of squared saturation indices the smallest for the given number of experiments.

            "abstract": "Clay-rich geologic repositories serve as hosts for fossil methane reserves and as traps for contaminant radionuclides and sequestered CO2. Despite the abundance of non-swelling clay minerals in sedimentary formations, the mechanisms of ion exchange and mass transport mediated by these minerals are not well understood. Ion exchange kinetics in collapsed clays are characterized by a long tail of slow exchange, which suggests that interlayer ions can exchange with the bulk solution. Recent High-Resolution TEM evidence suggests that Cs+ ion exchange K+ in collapsed interlayers leads to interstratified structures, where entire interlayers are completely exchanged while others remain pristine [Okamura T et al., (2005) Microscopy 6365-72]. This phenomenon could be explained by kinetic feedbacks arising when a larger ion substitutes for a smaller one, although the details of this exchange mechanism are currently unknown.\nWe investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of interlayer cation migration in illite (K0.7Al2[Al0.7Si3.3O10](OH)2) using molecular simulations. A Monte Carlo scheme was used to distribute interlayer K ions, and these ions were found to prefer sites neighboring two or more Al3+ substitutions in the tetrahedral sheets. Interlayer K+ ion migration between stable ditrigonal cavity sites was observed directly in molecular dynamics simulations performed at temperatures ranging from 500 K to 900 K and at constant volume. The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method was used to determine the activation energy barrier on 660 K+ ion migration paths. Interlayer ions were observed to migrate between stable lattice sites with migration barriers of 2.35 ± 1.06 eV. Only about 20% of this variation is statistically explained by the distribution of charge deficit sites in the layer caused by Al3+ substitution for Si4+. Remarkably, we find that migration barriers decrease as we increase interlayer spacing. These results suggest that frayed edge sites – local regions with larger interlayer spacing commonly caused by weathering – can help accelerate ion mobility by lowering the migration barrier in their vicinity, possibly facilitating ion interstratification in collapsed clays. We discuss the limitations of our molecular simulations and how we may overcome them using electronic structure methods.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - postermelt.pdf\nMelt generation and migration have been the subject of numerous investigations. However, their typical time and length scales are vastly different from mantle convection, and the material properties are highly spatially variable and make the problem strongly non-linear. These challenges make it difficult to study these processes in a unified framework and in three dimensions.\nWe present our extension of the mantle convection code ASPECT that allows for solving additional equations describing the behavior of melt percolating through and interacting with a viscously deforming host rock. One particular advantage is ASPECT's adaptive mesh refinement, as the resolution can be increased in areas where melt is present and viscosity gradients are steep, whereas a lower resolution is sufficient in regions without melt. Our approach includes both melt migration and melt generation, allowing for different melting parametrizations. In contrast to previous formulations, we consider the individual compressibilities of the solid and fluid phases in addition to compaction flow. This ensures self-consistency when linking melt generation to processes in the deeper mantle, where the compressibility of the solid phase becomes more important.\nWe evaluate the functionality and potential of this method using a series of benchmarks and applications, including solitary waves, magmatic shear bands and melt generation and transport in a rising mantle plume. We compare results of the compressible and incompressible formulation and find melt volume differences of up to 15%. Moreover, we demonstrate that adaptive mesh refinement has the potential to reduce the runtime of a computation by more than one order of magnitude.\nOur model of magma dynamics provides a framework for investigating links between the deep mantle and melt generation and migration. This approach could prove particularly useful applied to modeling the generation of komatiites or other melts originating in greater depths.",

            "abstract": "For the last century, the island of Maui in Hawai‘i has been the center of environmental, agricultural, and legal conflict with respect to both surface and groundwater allocation. Planning for sustainable future freshwater supply in Hawai‘i requires adaptive policies and decision-making that emphasizes private and public partnerships and knowledge transfer between scientists and non-scientists. We have downscaled dynamical climate models to 1 km resolution in Maui and coupled them with a USGS Water Budget model and a participatory scenario building process to quantify future changes in island-scale climate and groundwater recharge under different land uses. Although these projections are uncertain, the integrated nature of the Pacific RISA research program has allowed us to take a multi-pronged approach to facilitate the uptake of climate information into policy and management. This presentation details the ongoing work to support the development of Hawai‘i’s first island-wide water use plan under the new climate adaptation directive. Participatory scenario planning began in 2012 to bring together a diverse group of ~100 decision-makers in state and local government, watershed restoration, agriculture, and conservation to 1) determine the type of information (climate variables, land use and development, agricultural practices) they would find helpful in planning for climate change, and 2) develop a set of nested scenarios that represent alternative climate and management futures. This integration of knowledge is an iterative process, resulting in flexible and transparent narratives of complex futures comprised of information at multiple scales. We will present an overview of the downscaling, scenario building, hydrological modeling processes, and stakeholder response.",

            "abstract": "Rapid climate change is affecting climate-sensitive disturbance regimes throughout the world. In particular, the impacts of climate change on Arctic disturbance regimes are poorly understood because landscape-scale disturbances are infrequent or occur in remote localities. Wildfire in Arctic Alaska is presently limited by ignition source and favorable burn weather. With rapid climate change, a lengthening growing season, and subsequent increase in plant biomass and productivity, wildfire frequency and annual area burned in tundra ecosystems is expected to increase over the next century. Yet, post-fire tundra vegetation succession is inadequately characterized except at a few point locations. We identify succession stages of tussock tundra communities following wildfire using a chronosequence of 65 relevés in 10 tundra fire scars (1971-2011) and nearby unburned tundra from sites on the Seward Peninsula and northern foothills of the Brooks Range. We used the Braun-Blanquét approach to classify plant communities, and applied nonmetric multidimentional scaling (NMDS) to identify ecological gradients underlying community differentiation. The ordination revealed a clear differentiation between unburned and burned tundra communities. Ecological gradients, reflected by ordination axes, correspond to fire history (e.g., time since last fire, number of times burned, burn severity) and a complex productivity gradient. Post-fire species richness is less than unburned tundra; primarily reflected as a decrease in lichen species and turnover of bryophyte species immediately post-fire. Species richness of grasses increases post-fire and is greatest in communities that burned more than once in the past 30 years. Shrub cover and total aboveground biomass are greatest in repeat burn sites. We review and discuss our results focusing on the implications of a changing tundra fire regime, its effect on vegetation succession trajectories, and subsequent rates of carbon sequestration and loss in tundra ecosystems.",

However, due to the inertial device costs less than a introduction, commonly used low precision inertial navigation equipment with tightly coupled GPS / INS integrated to get high precision navigation results. Many studies have improved the accuracy of error by using the UKF and CKF filtering algorithm, but it is still using the traditional pseudo code directly, the improvement effect is not obvious, and the disturbance is large. In this study, the PPP /INSmodel is improved by using the carrier phase smoothing pseudo range algorithm. Experimental results show that based on phase smoothing pseudo range PPP/INS tight coupled method, the position precision and the velocity precision for of the measured data of higher accuracy of MEMS and GPS receiver can get to a decimeter level and centimeter level. This coupling method has higher accuracy, stronger anti disturbance and Have a better convergence than the traditional C/A code. Based on different phase smoothing epoch number combination ，the accuracy and smoothing effect is also different, the larger smooth epoch number is, the better treatment effect it has and The higher precision it has. For high precision measurement, the equipment cost is saved. It has a practical significance meaning in the measurement of outdoor ground.",

The deformation can be divided three types with four types of vein. Based on the differences, the process can be divided four stage by their cutting relationship as follow. Stage 1; the deformation (D1) in this stage is characterized by the aspect ratio of the deformed clasts with range from 0.1 to 0.4, and pinch-and-swell structure and budinaged structures of the sandstone are developed. The veins (V1) are recognized only within the sandstone, and the veins are cut by muddy matrix. Stage 2; the deformation (D2) is characterized by the aspect ratio is more than 0.4, and is distributed along the unit boundary. The clasts such as sandstone and chert are strongly sheared, and random fabric is often recognized. The vein (V2) in this stage cut the D1, and the V2 and D2 are cut by each other. Stage 3; outcrop-scale faults (D3) cutting D1 and D2 has been progressed in this stage. The vein (V3) is recognized along D3. Stage 4; the vein (V4) cutting D1 to D3 is developed in this stage. From the above-mentioned occurrence and data shown by previous studies of the Miyama Formation, process of each Stage interpreted as follows; Stage 1 developed underthrusting, Stages 2 and 3 correspond to underplating of subducted sediments. In addition, it is considered that Stage 4 is in later stage of underplating.\nThe main components of the V1 to V3 veins are calcite and/or quartz. On the other hand, the V4 vein consists mainly of siderite and ankerite, and contain an abundance of Fe than the other veins. Morphological feature of V1 and V3 veins also show blocky texture suggesting higher rate growth than fracture opening, and V2 vein indicate syn-taxial growth. V4 vein of siderite and ankerite euhedral shape indicate the vein growth under relatively tension stress field. The structural and intra-relationship of these veins suggests the different PT condition as well as the fluids characteistics.",

            "abstract": "Many global climate models currently assume that longwave photons are non-scattering in clouds, and also have overly simplistic treatments of surface emissivity. Multiple scattering of longwave radiation and non-unit emissivity could lead to substantial discrepancies between the actual Earth’s radiation budget and its parameterized representation in the infrared, especially at wavelengths longer than 15 µm.\nThe evaluation of the parameterization of longwave spectral multiple scattering in radiative transfer codes for global climate models is critical and will require benchmarking across a wide range atmospheric conditions with more accurate, though computationally more expensive, multiple scattering models. We therefore present a line-by-line radiative transfer solver that includes scattering, run on a supercomputer from the National Energy Research Scientific Computing that exploits the embarrassingly parallel nature of 1-D radiative transfer solutions with high effective throughput. When paired with an advanced ice-particle optical property database with spectral values ranging from the 0.2 to 100 µm, a particle size and habit distribution derived from MODIS Collection 6, and a database for surface emissivity which extends to 100 µm, this benchmarking result can densely sample the thermodynamic and condensate parameter-space, and therefore accelerate the development of an advanced infrared radiative parameterization for climate models, which could help disentangle forcings and feedbacks in CMIP6.",

            "abstract": "The role of environmental drivers in regulating carbon exchanges, such as the combined effects of different meteorological and hydrological factors, are still poorly understood in many tropical forests. For example, Central American tropical forests are characterized by a distinct dry season with large atmospheric evaporative demand, driven by solar radiations and sustained winds. In contrast, during the wet seasons, cloudiness results in lower radiation inputs but higher diffuse fraction, and higher water availability.\nOur site, Barro Colorado Island, located in Gatun Lake, Central Panama, averages 2800 mm of annual precipitation, with a pronounced dry season in Jan-Apr. Forest age varies between 100 and >400 yr. In July 2012, an eddy covariance system was installed on a 41 m tower on the top plateau of the island. In the current year (2015) the island is experiencing the most severe El Niño driven drought on record (precipitation is measured since 1921).\nThe eddy covariance measurements show that carbon and water fluxes are strongly influenced by hydrological conditions. Prolonged dry spells during the dry season limit both above ground fluxes (ET and GPP) and below ground processes (root and microbial activities). Light use efficiency is about 30% lower during the dry season and evapotranspiration can be as 40% below potential. These decreases in ecosystem functions are driven primarily by a combination of structural (reduction in leaf area) and physiological (stomata regulation) adaptation.\nSimilarly, soil effluxes respond strongly to hydrological conditions. In the dry season, lower soil respiration rates are spaced out by rare rain events generating large pulses. In contrast, during the wet season, frequent rain events suppress soil CO2effluxes, because of reduced diffusivity and oxygen depletion. Diurnal variation of soil respiration also suggested a potential translocation of photosynthates from leaf to roots to increase nutrient uptake during the dry months.\nIn 2015, preliminary results are showing an intensification of the seasonal patterns. The protraction of the dry season into the months of June and July are causing a rapid depletion of the soil water resources with detrimental effects on carbon sequestration, also considering that respiration rates from stems did not show a similar decline.",

            "abstract": "Human activities in cities contribute large quantities of nitrogen (N) to adjacent ecosystems, but it is unclear how various sources of anthropogenic N contribute to and move through local watersheds. We analyzed myriad soil and water samples from across the Jordan River Valley, Salt Lake City, UT in order to assess N dynamics in terrestrial systems, at the riparian-stream interface, and in streams in this coupled human-natural system. We used data from two terrestrial headwater sites to demonstrate that forests tend to be more N-rich in topographic lows compared to hillslopes. Regardless of landscape position, soils beneath herbaceous vegetation had high nitrate concentrations and enriched δ15N values, suggesting overall N richness compared to forests. Isotope data showed that nitrate from all soils and headwater streams was of microbial, rather than direct anthropogenic, origin. In addition, nitrate from nearby streams was isotopically distinct from upland soils, suggesting low hydrologic connectivity between the two. Using data from the headwaters as well as eight additional downstream sites, we found that riparian soil N pools were increasingly decoupled from stream N dynamics lower in the watershed. This was related to where the stream transitioned from gaining to losing water from the groundwater system. Stream N contents were low in undisturbed mountain waters, but increased ten-fold at sites contaminated with urban groundwater. Across five watersheds spanning the Jordan Valley, we found anthropogenic N increasingly impacted streams as watershed size and land use intensity increased. Wastewater treatment plants imparted a further order-of-magnitude increase in stream nitrate concentrations and isotope values. Our work demonstrates that controls on N dynamics shift from topography and vegetation in upper watersheds to groundwater-surface water interactions and human activities in lower, more developed reaches. While the adjacent wildland ecosystem appears to have relatviely high capacity to buffer anthropogenic N inputs, it is important to consider the fate of N in lower, urbanized zones.",

            "abstract": "A dominant source of uncertainty within climate system modeling lies in the representation of cloud processes. This is not only because of the great complexity in cloud microphysics, but also because of the large variations of cloud amount and macroscopic properties in time and space. In this study, the cloud properties simulated by the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.4 (CAM5.4) are evaluated using the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO, 2009-2011). CAM5.4 is driven by the meteorology (U, V, and T) from GEOS5 analysis, while water vapor, hydrometeors and aerosols are calculated by the model itself. For direct comparison of CAM5.4 and HIPPO observations, model output is collocated with HIPPO flights.\nGenerally, the model has an ability to capture specific cloud systems of meso- to large-scales. In total, the model can reproduce 80% of observed cloud occurrences inside model grid boxes, and even higher (93%) for ice clouds (T≤-40°C). However, the model produces plenty of clouds that are not presented in the observation. The model also simulates significantly larger cloud fraction including for ice clouds compared to the observation. Further analysis shows that the overestimation is a result of bias in relative humidity (RH) in the model. The bias of RH can be mostly attributed to the discrepancies of water vapor, and to a lesser extent to those of temperature. Down to the micro-scale level of ice clouds, the model can simulate reasonably well the magnitude of ice and snow number concentration (Ni, with diameter larger than 75 μm). However, the model simulates fewer occurrences of Ni>50 L-1. This can be partially ascribed to the low bias of aerosol number concentration (Naer, with diameter between 0.1-1 μm) simulated by the model. Moreover, the model significantly underestimates both the number mean diameter (Di,n) and the volume mean diameter (Di,v) of ice/snow. The result shows that the underestimation may be related to a weaker positive relationship between Di,n and Naer and/or the underestimation of Naer. Finally, it is suggested that better representation of sub-grid variability of meteorology (e.g., water vapor) is needed to improve the formation and evolution of ice clouds in the model.",

Following the Las Conchas Fire, spatial ET is compared with two ground-based meteorological stations and two nearby unburned stations. In the Old Fire, a simple water balance approach is used to approximate and compare watershed-scale ET pre- and post-fire. Preliminary analysis with SSEBop in Las Conchas shows relatively similar precipitation patterns while post-fire ET appears altered within high, moderate, and low burn severity areas. We will continue to evaluate the relation between post-fire ET and characteristics such as land cover, land surface temperature, and precipitation.

Often, air quality data are posted on obscure websites showing only current values, are programmatically inaccessible, and/or are in inconsistent data formats across sites. Yet, historical and programmatic access to such a global dataset would be transformative to several scientific fields, from epidemiology to low-cost sensor technologies to estimates of ground-level aerosol by satellite retrievals.\nTo increase accessibility and standardize this disparate dataset, we have built OpenAQ, an innovative, open platform created by a group of scientists and open data programmers. The source code for the platform is viewable at github.com/openaq. Currently, we are aggregating, storing, and making publicly available real-time air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3) via an Application Program Interface (API). We will present the OpenAQ platform, which currently has the following specific capabilities:\nA continuous ingest mechanism for some of the most polluted cities, generalizable to more sources\nAn API providing data-querying, including ability to filter by location, measurement type and value and date, as well as custom sort options\nA generalized, chart-based visualization tool to explore data accessible via the API\nAt this stage, we are seeking wider participation and input from multiple research communities in expanding our data retrieval sites, standardizing our protocols, receiving feedback on quality issues, and creating tools that can be built on top of this open platform.",

These processes are controlled on the molecular scale by mineral dissolution and precipitation dynamics which are in turn controlled by both changing solution chemistry and redox regime. The presentation will highlight recent work by our group and others on elucidating some of these mechanisms with particular emphasis on the impacts of redox cycling and Fe mineral transformation. We are particular interested in how the form of organic matter impacts the formation and transformation of iron minerals and vis-a-versa under fluctuating redox conditions, and how that in turn impacts the transport of other elements controlled by Fe surfaces, e.g. uranium. In two different field conditions, in a ground water well and at a ground water-surface water interface, Fe(II) was oxidized in an organic rich environment leading to different types of Fe-organic matter co-precipitates. We followed the evolution of those participates under a return to reduced conditions in order to understand the transformations, or lack thereof, of the Fe minerals and the fate of the associated organic matter.",

            "abstract": "The failure of the 2015 Gurkha earthquake to completely rupture the Himalayan décollement from the southern edge of Tibet to the faults fronting the Himalayan foothills (MFT), raises several issues concerning the future evolution of stresses now imposed in the lesser Himalaya at the latitude of Kathmandu. InSAR imagery and coseismic GPS measurements indicate that slip in the main rupture has imposed a tapered slip distribution near the rupture’s southern edge at approximately 10 km depth, 30 km north of the MFT. Shortly after the earthquake new GPS instruments were installed, bringing to 15 the number of instruments monitoring the western and southern edge of the Gurkha rupture. In the first two months following the earthquake we observed slow continued southward displacements above the southern edge of the rupture at rates of 10-20 mm/yr, an order of magnitude larger than interseismic rates at these latitudes, which would dissipate the current slip deficit in ≈50 years. High uncertainties due to the monsoon onset and short duration of the time series prevent resolution of whether these rates are changing with time, and the budget of afterslip on the main rupture and creep outside of the coseismic rupture area. However, current rates are significantly slower than immediate afterslip rates observed on shallow California faults responding to similar coseismic slip. The similarity of the 2015 earthquake to Himalayan 7.5<Mw<7.8 earthquakes in 1803, 1833 and 1905 suggests that incomplete rupture of the Main Himalayan Thrust may be common. Occasional great earthquakes have ruptured the MFT with inferred slip approaching or exceeding 20 m and requiring renewal times of more than 1000 years at current GPS convergence rates. It appears possible that surface slip of the MFT in these great earthquakes may be supplemented by relict slip deficits from previous incomplete ruptures. One possibility, for example, is that a relatively modest rupture nucleating from the Himalayan locking line could exploit the stress associated with this slip deficit resulting in unexpectedly large slip on the southern décollement. This would add considerable complexity to the reliable estimation of moment magnitude from paleoseismic trench investigations.",

            "abstract": "Parallel and evenly spaced strike-slip faults occur widely in continental settings. The fault spacing varies from 10s of km along transform fault systems (e.g., southern California and New Zealand) to 200-400 km in continental interiors (e.g., central Tibet, central Asia, and North China plains). In order to understand the role of the brittle crust rheology and thickness in controlling the fault spacing in continental settings, we performed a series of sandbox experiments using medium-grained dry sand under strike-slip simple-shear conditions. With a self-built sliding device, we determined the yield strength of the dry sand to follow a Coulomb fracture relationship: Tn = 0.5173Sn + 15.475(Pa), with R2 = 0.936, where Tn is the shear stress, Sn is the normal stress, R is the coefficient of linear correlation, and 15.475 Pa is the cohesive strength. In our experiments, we created parallel Riedel shears in a simple shear zone with sand layer thickness varying from 1 cm to 6 cm. The relationship between the fault spacing (S) and the sand layer thickness (T) fits a linear equation of S = 0.5528T + 4.765, with R2 = 0.975. Assuming that the cohesive strength of the continental crust is 1-5 MPa and neglecting the density difference between rock and sand, the scaling relationship between sand and crustal thickness can be approximated as 1:1 X 105 to 1:5 X 105, which means that our experiments simulate a range of crustal thicknesses from 1 km to 30 km. The relevance of the S-T relationship obtained from this study will be tested in areas of active strike-slip tectonics, where the thickness of the brittle crust can be determined by the thickness of the seismogenic zones.",

            "abstract": "Understanding subduction rheology in both space and time has been a challenge since the advent of plate tectonics. We herein focus on \"subduction infancy\", that is the first ~1-5 My immediately following subduction nucleation, when a newly born slab penetrates into the upper plate mantle and heats up. The only remnants of this critical yet elusive geodynamic step are thin metamorphic soles, commonly found beneath pristine, 100-1000 km long portions of oceanic lithosphere emplaced on continents (i.e., ophiolites).\nThrough the (i) worldwide compilation of pressure-temperature conditions of metamorphic sole formation augmented by pseudosection thermodynamic modeling, (ii) calculations of the viscosity of materials along the plate interface and (iii) generic numerical thermal models, we provide a conceptual model of dynamic plate interface processes during subduction infancy (and initiation s.l.).\nWe show in particular how major rheological switches across the subduction interface control slab penetration, and the formation of metamorphic soles. Due to the downward progression of hydration and weakening of the mantle wedge with cooling, the lower plate (basalt, sediment) and the upper plate (mantle wedge) rheologies equalize and switch over a restricted temperature-time-depth interval (e.g., at ~800°C and ~1 GPa, during 0.1-2 My, for high-temperature metamorphic sole formation). These switches result in episodes of maximum interplate mechanical coupling, thereby slicing the top of the slab and welding pieces (basalt, sediment) to the base of the mantle wedge. Similar mechanical processes likely apply for the later, deeper accretion and exhumation of high-temperature oceanic eclogites in serpentinite mélanges, or for the accretion of larger tectonic slices.\nThis model provides constraints on the effective rheologies of the crust and mantle and general understanding, at both rock and plate scale, for accretion processes and early slab dynamics.",

To monitor changes in canopy structure, functions, and spectral properties during the litterfall period, we combined automatic observations of NDVI derived from LED-spectral sensors and LAI derived from digital cover photography installed at multiple canopy layer depths. Furthermore, we collected hyperspectral optical properties of leaves across multiple canopy layers and hyperspectral reflectance of forest background using ASD-FieldSpec. We found that NDVI in forest floor became greater than the NDVI measured from the top of canopy during the litterfall period. We discuss what satellite-derived NDVI exactly sees during the litterfall period, which will be useful to better understand forest autumn phenology at large scales.",

It aims, among other things, to put together and disseminate, in collaboration with the Bank’s operational staff as well as external partners, a clear picture of the potential role of Earth Observations (EO) in solution approaches to address particular water-related issues.\nThe initiative focuses on the accuracy, reliability, and validity of the EO products to be used by decision makers in water related management and planning contexts. To make informed decisions, the client needs to know about the potential and the limitations of practical application of remote sensing technology and products, through informed recommendations and the development of practical, result-oriented tools. Thus, the objective of the Water RS initiative is to address this issue by taking a two-phase approach focusing respectively on: (i) identifying demand and priorities of the users while raising awareness on the potential and limitation of RS tools and (ii) bridging the gap between science and development of operational projects.\nWhile the first phase has come to completion, the second phase is being designed to tackle some of the reasons why there have been rather limited applications in the developing world (World Bank clients), such as: incentive issues, implementation capacity, costs and financing, and the overall issue of “How to do it?. An overview of the initiative and the lessons learned to date will be presented, setting the stage for muti-partner discussions.\n\n[1] The Water Partnership Program (WPP) is a longstanding alliance between the World Bank and the governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Austria.",

            "abstract": "Urban regions are often impacted more by heat than adjacent rural areas, which is a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Urban areas are also highly heterogeneous and notoriously difficult to monitor using standard meteorological protocols—the hottest microclimates within a city often occur in locations that lack open, representative installation sites that are an adequate distance from buildings and direct heat sources. To investigate the challenges of monitoring urban heat, this study examines the sensitivity of temperature and humidity sensors currently used in a Baltimore UHI monitoring network to differences in sun exposure, material on which the data collecting instrument is attached, and land cover class of the vicinity. Sensitivity to sun exposure and attachment site can be interpreted as sources of uncertainty for urban heat monitoring, while sensitivity to land cover may reflect a true source of local temperature and humidity variability. In this study, we present results from a test deployment designed to assess the sensitivity of heat measurements to each of these three factors. We then apply these results to interpret measurements taken across the entire Baltimore UHI monitoring network. These results can then be used to improve heat measurements and more accurately represent and quantify the UHI effect on a broader scale, such as in neighborhoods or urban centers.",

Most of the benchmarks were occupied within days after the\nearthquake, allowing us to capture the very early postseismic transient motions. The GPS data show\npostseismic displacements in the same direction as the coseismic displacements; time series indicate a\ngradual decay in postseismic velocities with characteristic time scales of 66 ± 9 days and 20 ± 3 days,\nassuming exponential and logarithmic decay, respectively. We also analyzed interferometric synthetic\naperture radar (InSAR) data from the Envisat and ALOS satellites. The main deformation features seen in\nthe line-of-sight displacement maps indicate subsidence concentrated in the southern and northern parts\nof the main rupture, in particular at the Indiviso fault, at the Laguna Salada basin, and at the Paso Superior\nfault. We show that the near-field GPS and InSAR observations over a time period of 5 months after the\nearthquake can be explained by a combination of afterslip, fault zone contraction, and a possible\nminor contribution of poroelastic rebound.

            "abstract": "Lake sediment records provide opportunities for high-resolution observations of paleoclimate that help to place modern climate change in geologic context. Here we present a terrestrial record of July air temperature for northwest Greenland (Nunatarssuaq, ~25 km east of the Thule Air Base) through the Holocene and a prior warm period, inferred from subfossil insect remains (Chironomidae) preserved in lacustrine sediments. In addition, we discuss ongoing work in characterizing the sources and isotopic composition of leaf waxes preserved in the same sediments.\nMultiple parallel sediment cores were collected in the summers of 2012 and 2014 from Wax Lips Lake (informal name), a non-glacial lake situated <2 km from the current margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Radiocarbon ages were obtained on aquatic mosses from intact laminae, and indicate that the record spans the Holocene, beginning at ~10.4 ka, as well as an interval beyond the range of 14C (>44 ka) and thus predates the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our results demonstrate temperatures warmer than present through the early and mid Holocene followed by cooling in the late Holocene.\nMaterial that pre-dates the LGM contains insect assemblages indicating temperatures warmer than the warmest millennia of the Holocene. We interpret this material as most likely dating to the Last Interglacial Period (MIS 5). Along with assemblages of Chironomidae, we find subfossil Chaoboridae in one section of the pre-LGM sediments, suggesting exceptionally warm conditions based upon the distribution of modern-day Chaoborus. We find abundant n-alkanes and n-acids are preserved in the Holocene and pre-LGM sediments, allowing for complementary compound-specific δD analyses and identification of organic matter source in addition to chironomid derived temperature records.",

            "abstract": "California is a leader in comprehensive planning for devastating earthquakes, landslides, floods, and tsunamis. Far less attention, however, has focused on the potentially devastating impact of volcanic eruptions, despite the fact that they occur in the State about as frequently as the largest earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault Zone. At least 10 eruptions have occurred in the past 1,000 years—most recently in northern California (Lassen Peak 1914 to 1917)—and future volcanic eruptions are inevitable.\nThe likelihood of renewed volcanism in California is about one in a few hundred to one in a few thousand annually. Eight young volcanoes, ranked as Moderate to Very High Threat [1] are dispersed throughout the State. Partially molten rock (magma) resides beneath at least seven of these—Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, Lassen Volcanic Center, Clear Lake Volcanic Field, Long Valley Volcanic Region, Coso Volcanic Field, and Salton Buttes— causing earthquakes, toxic gas emissions, hydrothermal activity, and (or) ground deformation.\nUnderstanding the hazards and identifying what is at risk are the first steps in building community resilience to volcanic disasters. This study, prepared in collaboration with the State of California Governor’s Office of Emergency Management and the California Geological Survey, provides a broad perspective on the State’s exposure to volcano hazards by integrating mapped volcano hazard zones with geospatial data on at-risk populations, infrastructure, and resources.\nThe study reveals that ~ 16 million acres fall within California’s volcano hazard zones, along with ~ 190 thousand permanent and 22 million transitory populations. Additionally, far-field disruption to key water delivery systems, agriculture, utilities, and air traffic is likely. Further site- and sector-specific analyses will lead to improved hazard mitigation efforts and more effective disaster response and recovery.\n[1] “Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States,” http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1164/",

Despite our improved understanding of the sources of particulate matter (PM) in the valley, air-quality models are unable to predict PM concentrations accurately. We aim to characterize periods of high particulate matter concentrations in the San Joaquin Valley based on ground and airborne measurements of aerosols and gaseous pollutants, during the DISCOVER-AQ campaign, 2013. A highly instrumented aircraft flew across the SJV making three transects in a repeatable pattern, with vertical spirals over select locations. The aircraft measurements were complemented by ground measurements at these locations, with extensive chemically-speciated measurements at a ground “supersite” at Fresno. Hence, the campaign provided a comprehensive three-dimensional view of the particulate and gaseous pollutants around the valley. The vertical profiles over the different sites indicate significant variability in the concentrations and vertical distribution of PM around the valley, which are most likely driven by differences in the combined effects of emissions, chemistry and boundary layer dynamics at each site. The observations suggest that nighttime PM is dominated by surface emissions of PM from residential fuel combustion, while early morning PM is strongly influenced by mixing of low-level, above-surface, nitrate-rich layers formed from dark chemistry overnight to the surface.",

            "abstract": "The Gorkha, Nepal earthquake (Mw7.8) of April 25, 2015 is the first event in the Himalaya region that occurred after the development of modern space geodetic technology. Since the epicenter of this earthquake is located in a mountainous and rural area where few continuous GNSS observation is made, satellite remote sensing is required to reveal crustal deformation and damage. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency conducted emergent observations of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 that has been in operation since summer in 2014.\nWe analyzed acquired images including ScanSAR images whose swath width is about 350 km using Gamma software with a digital ellipsoidal height model based on SRTM DEM. Coherence of all interferograms is very high. However, we found two spots of low coherence in Kathmandu, including the Durbar Square. These spots indicate structural damages or liquefaction.\nScanSAR-ScanSAR interferograms contain large phase ramp, possibly due to ionospheric disturbance or inaccurate orbit. We corrected phase ramp using quadratic function of latitude, longitude and altitude. Corrected interferograms show an elliptic zone of LOS decrease extending from the epicenter ESE-ward with a peak of > 1 m. North of the uplift zone, we found LOS increase of ~0.8 m. This result is consistent with thrust motion on a low-angled fault plane. We inverted corrected interferogram to estimate slip distribution and dip angle of fault. Preliminary results imply that the thrust motion is concentrated at depth between 10 and 20 km and the maximum slip is ~ 4.4 m. Geodetic moment is estimated to be 1.47 x 10^21 Nm (Mw8.0).\nWe also processed a postseismic pair and detected coseismic deformation of the May 12 aftershock (Mw7.3). Area of uplift with a diameter of 30 km is found and that of subsidence on its north. It also is consistent with low-angled thrust. It is hard to recognize postseismic deformation of the mainshock possibly due to the correction of phase ramp.\nALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images were provided by JAXA through EQWG and ALOS-2 CVST.

            "abstract": "The urbanization process transforms a natural landscape into a built environment with many engineered surfaces, leading to significant impacts on surface energy and water fluxes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the effects of different urban land covers on energy and water fluxes has been rarely quantified across the large varieties of construction materials, landscaping and vegetation types, and industrial, commercial and residential areas in cities. In this study, we deployed a mobile eddy covariance tower at three different locations in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area to capture a variety of urban land covers. The three locations each represent a common urban class in Phoenix: 1) a dense, xeric landscape (gravel cover and native plants with drip-irrigation systems near tall buildings); 2) a high-density urban site (asphalt-paved parking lot near a high-traffic intersection); and 3) a suburban mesic landscape (sprinkler-irrigated turf grass in a suburban neighborhood). At each site, we measured meteorological variables, including air temperature and relative humidity at three heights, precipitation and pressure, surface temperature, and soil moisture and temperature (where applicable), to complement the eddy covariance measurements of radiation, energy, carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes. We evaluated the tower footprint at each site to characterize the contributing surface area to the flux measurements, including engineered and landscaping elements, as a function of time for each deployment. The different sites allowed us to compare how turbulent fluxes of water vapor and carbon dioxide vary for these representative urban land covers, in particular with respect to the role of precipitation events and irrigation. While the deployments covered different seasons, from winter to summer in 2015, the variety of daily conditions allowed quantification of the differential response to precipitation events during the winter, pre-monsoon, and monsoon seasons in relation to irrigation input or lack thereof. As desert urban areas continue to grow worldwide, it is essential to gain an improved understanding of how the energy and water balances vary across the built environment and their implications on urban climate, energy, hydrologic conditions, and air quality.",

            "abstract": "In situ precipitation of iron (Fe) minerals can be an effective means of remediating groundwater arsenic (As) contamination. Among different Fe minerals, magnetite is promising as a host-mineral for As in situ immobilization in that it is stable under a wide range of geochemical conditions, including Fe(III) reducing conditions under which As are often mobilized. Our previous laboratory studies suggest that the formation of nanoparticulate magnetite can be achieved by the oxidation of ferrous Fe with nitrate. Magnetite can incorporate As into its structure during formation, in which case desorption and As(V) reduction are less likely. Nanoparticulate magnetite, once formed, can also immobilize As by surface adsorption, and thus serve as a reactive filter when contaminated groundwater migrates through the treatment zone. In this study, a reactive transport model is develop for the magnetite based As immobilization strategy. The initial numerical model development was guided by experimental data and hypothesized processes from the laboratory one-dimensional column studies. Our modeling results suggest that the ratio between Fe(II) and nitrate in the injectant regulates the extent and distribution of magnetite and ferrihydrite formation, and thus regulates the long-term potential of As immobilization. Based on these results, two-dimensional field-scale model scenarios were developed to predict and compare the impact of chemical and operational parameters on the efficiency of the remediation technology. The modeling results, which suggest that long-term groundwater As removal is feasible, favor scenarios that rely on the chromatographic mixing of Fe(II) and nitrate after injection. This study highlights the importance of combining laboratory studies and reactive transport modeling for elucidating the complex hydro-biogeochemical processes that control the fate of As and for up-scaling of the technology.",

The dust storm season of the current Mars year (MY 33) will begin on 1 June 2016 (Ls=160°) and will end on 28 March 2017 (Ls=340°). Mars will reach perihelion in late October 2016, about a month after the planned landing of the Mars InSight Lander.\nSpectacular global-scale dust storms (GDS) occur during the dust storm season in some Mars years but not in others. In a prior study (Shirley, 2015; Icarus 251, 128-144), systematic relationships were found linking the occurrence of historic global-scale dust storms on Mars with the variability of the orbital angular momentum of the planet with respect to the solar system barycenter. Conditions favorable to the occurrence of a future GDS in the current Mars year were noted in that study. A physical model that may account for the observed relationships has subsequently emerged. In this model, a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational motions of extended bodies is effected through a modulation of circulatory flows of atmospheres. The formal derivation yields a coupling term, which in turn prescribes an acceleration field that may constructively or destructively interfere with large-scale atmospheric motions driven by other means. This coupling term has been incorporated within the MarsWRF Global Circulation Model, and the GCM thus modified has undergone extensive validation and testing. The GCM “retrodicts” accelerations and circulation patterns favorable for the occurrence of southern summer solstice season global-scale dust storms in all of the prior years (n=7) in which such storms are known to have occurred (Mischna and Shirley, this meeting). The forcing function for the upcoming dust storm season exhibits amplitude and phasing that largely replicates the dynamical conditions prevailing prior to and during the MY 9 GDS of 1971. We conclude that a global-scale dust storm is likely to occur during the dust storm season of Mars year 33.",

Nevertheless most of them are shallow and have low magnitude. In 2013, an earthquake of 5.0 Mw ocurred in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, it was followed by five aftershocks in the two months after the mainshock. Distances between epicenters of the aftershocks and the mainshock are up to 34 km, which is greater than expected for an earthquake of this magnitude. Additionaly the uncertainty of the epicenters is around 20 km; this scenario is not suitable for studies looking to determine the seismogenic fault orientation. Using data from South American stations of the international network of the Incorporated Research Institutions dor Seismology (IRIS) and the relative location technique, that uses the surface waves (usually the clearest wave in noisy sismograms), the epicenters of five aftershocks of the Santa Cruz series were determinated in relation the mainshock. This method enabled to achieve epicentral locations with uncertainties smaller than 2 km, distances between the aftershocks and the mainshock are up to 7 km, in accordance with the magnitude of the earthquake. The result of the relative location showed a N - S trend of the epicenters in agreement with the location and orientation of the Mandeyapecua fault, the largest reverse fault in Bolivia.\nKey words: Relative location, Surface waves",

Therefore, the ocean wave observation was performed under the low atmospheric pressure. The observation area is the sea surface at 10 km off the coast of Kushiro, south-east to Hokaido, JAPAN on the 4th of March 2015. The wind speed was 8〜10m/s during the observation, and the significant wave height and period were 1.5m and 6.0s. The observation was performed in 2 directions and the accuracy of the estimation results were checked. The significant wave height and period measured by the AT-InSAR agreed with it measured by the wave gage located close to this observation area. In addition, it was confirmed that there were no irregular wave heights in the distribution of the estimated wave height.

The KIM-SH is a KIAPS integrated model-spectral element based in the HOMME. In KIM-SH, the explicit schemes are employed. We introduce the three- and two-time-level semi-implicit scheme in KIM-SH as the time integration. Explicit schemes however have a tendancy to be unstable and require very small timesteps while semi-implicit schemes are very stable and can have much larger timesteps.\nWe define the linear and reference values, then by definition of semi-implicit scheme, we apply the linear solver as GMRES.\nThe numerical results from experiments will be introduced with the current development status of the time integration in KIM-SH. Several numerical examples are shown to confirm the efficiency and reliability of the proposed schemes.\n ",

            "abstract": "The surface storm tracks have local maxima in the region of the oceanic western boundary currents (WBC) and play an important role in air-sea heat exchange. Additionally, the surface storm tracks offer a unique test for global climate models (GCMs), because their location and amplitude are determined by a combination of forcing from above, via the free tropospheric storm track, and below, via the sea surface temperature (SST), which is particularly difficult for coupled models to capture in the WBC regions. Therefore the current work is designed to analyze the biases in the surface storm tracks and their relationship with the other biases in the coupled models.\nUsing CMIP5 model output from the GFDL CM3, the NASA GISS ModelE2-R and the NCAR CESM1, the GCMs are compared with the storm tracks in the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The surface storm tracks are calculated as the standard deviation of the 10-meter meridional winds, after time-filtering the winds to retain only the synoptic variability. The analysis is carried out again for the 850-hPa meridional winds, to capture the free tropospheric storm tracks. At the global scale, the models do well at capturing the spatial structure and amplitude of the surface storm tracks. However, at the ocean basin scale, the modeled storm tracks differ with each other and with the reanalysis, in amplitude and spatial extent. The storm tracks in the CESM1 are stronger than those in the reanalysis, while the GFDL and GISS exhibit weaker storm tracks. It is also shown that the spatial distributions of the surface storm tracks in the models can be determined using only the free tropospheric storm tracks and the near surface stability. Biases in the positions of the modeled surface storm tracks correspond to biases in the modeled SST. However, a lag correlation analysis suggests that the short-term temporal variability of the surface storm track is driven by the variability in the free troposphere. On this result, the models and reanalysis strongly agree.",

We present the state of the HOPE plasma data and statistics of the plasma distribution inside of geostationary orbit. Over the course of the mission a better understanding of the instrument has been gained and the needed corrections added to the data to enable long-term statistics to be collected and compared with confidence. The major correction to the data is the expected degradation of the channel electron multiplier (CEM) efficiency as a function of time and count rate. HOPE provides background data sufficient to monitor the absolute detection efficiency throughout the mission. We have incorporated a time dependent gain correction factor to the data that normalizes the gain and thus the derived plasma properties. In addition the CEM bias voltage was adjusted bringing the gain back toward launch values. With a standard set of data electron and ion composition statistics are computed and presented. These statistics serve as a L-MLT dependent distribution to begin inner magnetosphere plasma modeling, instrument comparison, and climatology studies.

            "abstract": "The White–Inyo Range (WIR) of eastern California lies to the east of Owen’s Valley and the Sierra Nevada batholith (SNB). Over twenty recognized Mesozoic, granitic to gabbroic plutons intruded into Precambrian and Cambrian sedimentary units that were previously metamorphosed to the greenschist facies. These plutons represent intrusive equivalents of volcanics erupted during two magmatic events at ca. 180–167 Ma and 102–86 Ma (Coleman et al, 2003). The motivation of this study is to understand changes in magma sources over this time period.\nWe propose there is a time-transgressive change in source material in the WIR. Preliminary trace element data suggest that Jurassic plutons were sourced from deep crustal material, whereas later Cretaceous plutons may have had a shallower origin. This is supported by high Sr/Y ratios in the Jurassic plutons (up to 300) and relatively lower ratios in Cretaceous plutons (down to 14). Chiaradia (2015) suggests elevated Sr/Y ratios are directly linked to increasing crustal thickness, therefore the WIR plutons may record the period of crustal thinning in this region or maturation of the crust that allowed shallower melting in the Cretaceous. The highest values also suggest possible adakitic source material. REE patterns suggest that the youngest plutons (e.g. Sage Hen Flat) are more similar to samples collected from the eastern Sierra Nevada batholith than older plutons with higher La/Yb ratios. Relatively flat patterns REE patterns of Tertiary basalts and a late diabase dike in the WIR are also similar to SNB samples.\nAnother goal of this study is to determine the degree of mixing as a function of time during the emplacement of plutons in the range. Field and petrographic analyses suggest that older plutons represent more mafic materials and younger plutons are more granitic with mafic enclaves. We propose either (1) older plutons represent initial lower lithosphere melting, and with time, there is an increase of incorporation of shallower lithospheric material, or (2) two source materials are present at all times with varying degrees of mixing; older plutons represent a greater degree of mixing whereas younger plutons are primarily unmixed. Whole rock isotopic data and amphibole, pyroxene, feldspar compositional data will be used to explore these hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere, and play a key role in feedback cycles to climate change. In recognition of this, many researchers are developing process-based models of wetland methane emissions at various scales. In these models, the three key biogeochemical reactions are methane production, methane oxidation, and heterotrophic respiration, and they are modeled using Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The majority of Michaelis-Menten rate constants used in models are based on experiments involving slurries of peat incubated in vials. While these slurries provide a highly controlled setting, they are different from in situ conditions in multiple ways; notably they lack live plants and the centimeter-scale heterogeneities that exist in the field.\nTo determine rate constants in a system more representative of in situ conditions, we extracted peat cores intact from a bog and fen located in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest near Fairbanks, Alaska and part of the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) research program. Into those cores we injected water with varying concentrations of methane and oxygen at multiple depths. We used planar oxygen sensors installed on the peat cores to collect high resolution, two dimensional oxygen concentration data during the injections and used oxygen consumption rates under various conditions to calculate rate constants. Results were compared to a similar but smaller set of injection experiments conducted against planar oxygen sensors installed in the bog. Results will inform parametrization of microbial processes in wetland models, improving estimates of methane emissions both under current climate conditions and in the future.",

In this band, scattering of elastic energy by small-scale heterogeneity (less than a wavelength) can equilibrate energy on components of motion and stabilize the behavior of the Lg wave trapped in Earth's crust. Larger-scale deterministic structure (greater than a wavelength) still assumes major control over the efficiency or blockage of the Lg and the efficiency of other regional phases. We model high frequency regional seismic wave codas (2-4 Hz) for the combined effects of the large-scale 3-D (deterministic) and the small scale (statistical) structure with a radiative transport algorithm. The algorithm propagates packets of body wave energy with ray theory a through a large-scale deterministic 3-D structure, and includes the effects of multiple scattering by small-scale statistical structure. Coda envelopes are synthesized to illustrate sensitivities to variations in the parameters describing small-scale statistical heterogeneity, intrinsic attenuation, Lg blockage due to large-scale variations in crustal thickness, and the effects of tectonic release estimated from the seismograms of nuclear tests. We predict that event discriminants based on P/Lg amplitude ratios will best separate earthquake and explosion populations at frequencies 2 Hz and higher.",

The first community development of global surface emissions started in 1990, when GEIA was established as a component of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) project. At that time, GEIA meant \"Global Emissions Inventory Activity\". Since its inception, GEIA has brought together people to understand emissions from anthropogenic, biomass burning and natural sources. The first goal of GEIA was to establish a \"best\" inventory for the base year 1985 at 1x1 degree resolution. Since then many inventories have been developed by various groups at the global and regional scale at different temporal and spatial resolutions. GEIA, which now means the \"Global Emissions Initiative\", has evolved into assessing, harmonizing and distributing emissions datasets.\nWe will review the main achievements of GEIA, and show how the development and evaluation of surface emissions has evolved during the last 25 years. We will discuss the use of surface, in-situ and remote sensing observations to evaluate and improve the quantification of emissions. We will highlight the main uncertainties currently limiting emissions datasets, such as the spatial and temporal evolution of emissions at different resolutions, the quantification of emerging emission sources (such as oil/gas extraction and distribution, biofuels, etc.), the speciation of the emissions of volatile organic compounds and of particulate matter, the capacity building necessary for organizing the development of regional emissions across the world, emissions from shipping, etc. We will present the ECCAD (Emissions of Atmospheric Compounds and Compilation of Ancillary Data) database, developed as part of GEIA to facilitate the access and evaluation of emission inventories.",

            "abstract": "Convection-permitting regional climate models (CPCMs) have proven to be useful for down scaling large-scale climate information to regional and local scales. They add value to the representation of impact relevant parameters such as near surface temperature, precipitation, and the representation of extremes by improving local scale processes such as soil atmosphere interactions, snowpack dynamics, or the representation of deep convection. Due to their high computational costs most CPCM simulations have been restricted to small domains on the order of a few 100 km. On such small domains CPCMs might not reach their full potential because they are restricted by the lateral boundary forcing and may not be able to spin up properly.\nIn this study we investigate the ability of a continental scale CPCM to simulate climate conditions in the Contiguous United States within the period October 2000 to December 2010. We downscale ERA-Interim reanalysis data to a horizontal grid spacing of 4 km with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that allows an explicit treatment of deep convection. The model performance is analyzed in different synoptic-scale weather regimes, which enables a process-oriented evaluation. The significance of model biases in simulated precipitation and temperature is investigated by including observational uncertainties in the analysis. Significant biases are further investigated and possible error sources are discussed. The goal of this study is to provide a benchmark on the state-of-the-art convection-permitting regional climate modeling and to give guidance for future model development.",

We obtained new near-infrared (2-5 μm) observations of Loki Patera on 37 nights during and after two such brightening events using adaptive optics at the Keck and Gemini North telescopes in 2013-2015. We modify the Matson et al. (2006) model for Loki Patera as an overturning basaltic magma sea to model our observations, and find an overturn front propagation velocity of 0.85-0.95 km/day. The 445±45 day interval between the two events is 100 days shorter than the 540-day period calculated by Rathbun et al. (2002) for events prior to 2001. The overturn front appears to propagate around the patera in the clockwise direction, opposite to what has been inferred for these past brightening events, and may include irregular propagation patterns and multiple simultaneous fronts. Based on the anomalously-low intensities when Loki Patera is viewed at high emission angle, we find evidence for a topographic barrier to the west of the patera, which may be a raised region or the edge of a depression in which the magma sea resides.",

            "abstract": "A prominent control on the flow over dunes in sedimentary environments is the slope of the downstream lee-side. While previous work has focused on steep (~30°), asymmetric dunes with permanent flow separation (‘high-angle dunes’), little is known about dunes with lower lee-slope angles for which flow separation is absent or intermittent (‘low-angle dunes’). Here, we use laboratory experiments to systematically vary and isolate the effect of the dune lee-slope on the turbulent flow field over dunes.\nThree sets of fixed dunes with lee-slope angles of 10°, 20° and 30° were separately installed in a 15 m long and 1 m wide flume and subjected to flow 0.20 m deep. At present, no clear hydraulic scaling has been demonstrated for low- and high-angle dunes as both dune configurations occur at the same Froude and Reynolds numbers. However, observations indicate that low-angle dunes are more frequent in environments dominated by suspension of bed material. Therefore, we focus on matching the transport stage between field conditions and our experiments using field observations of bedform morphology and flow stage. Measurements consisted of high-frequency, vertical profiles collected with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) along one dune-length and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) of the flow field.\nWe show that the temporal and spatial occurrence of flow separation decreases with dune lee-slope and may be fully absent for lee-slopes <<10°, only. Velocity gradients in the dune leeside depict a free shear layer downstream of the 30° dunes and a weaker shear layer closer to the bed for the 20° and 10° dunes. The decrease in velocity gradients leads to lower turbulence production for gentle lee-slopes. Consequently, flow resistance of dunes decreases with lee-slope; the transition being non-linear. Over the 10°, 20° and 30° dunes, shear stress is 8%, 33% and 90 % greater than a flat bed, respectively. Our results demonstrate that dune shape plays an important, but often ignored role in flow resistance.",

Distribution functions, together with electromagnetic field structures, plasma densities, and bulk velocities, are organized and compared with particle-in-cell simulation results to indicate the proximities to the reconnection X-line. Anisotropic features in the distributions of magnetospheric- and magnetosheath- origin electrons at different locations in the reconnection inflow and exhaust are identified.

This study precisely measured geochemical and microbial communities in a scaled-up biofiltration system using synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) analyses coupled with next-generation sequencing (Illumina Miseq). Two pilot-scale biofiltration columns for Fe (Filter 1) and Mn (Filter 2) were connected in series and installed at the Langham Water Treatment Plant in Saskatoon, Canada. The groundwater temperature ranged from 4 to 8 °C. The pilot-scale study showed that successful treatment (99% removal) of both Fe and Mn was achieved in the biofilters. However, the Mn removal was significantly retarded for four months, likely due to the slow growth of Mn-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) in Filter 2. The removal of Mn was accelerated once the redox potential in Filter 2 exceeded +300 mV. At that point, the XANES analyses showed that the oxidization states of Mn in Filter 2 were mainly +3 and +4, confirming that Mn oxidization had occurred. Geochemical analyses (PHREEQCi) also indicated changed geochemical conditions that favoured the formation of Mn-oxides during biofiltration. Next-generation sequencing analyses indicated the enrichment of iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), including Gallionella sp. and Sideroxydans sp., in Filter 1. There were high read numbers for MnOB relatives, including Pseudomonas sp., Hydrogenophaga sp., Bdellovibrio sp., and Leptothrix sp., in Filter 2. Furthermore, the addition of anthracite (coal-based filter media) positively affected the growth MnOB and enhanced Mn oxidization. The evidence obtained in this study provides insight into how Mn oxidization can be accelerated in cold groundwater treatment systems.",

The resulting apparent polar wander path (APWP) reveals rapid motion of the continent towards the equator throughout the rift's lifetime. Constraints on the age of the youngest volcanics within the rift and on the paleolatitude of Laurentia at that time are important for quantifying the rate of this motion and its apparent deceleration in the late stage of rift development. Furthermore, precise calibration of the APWP enhances the robustness of paleogeographic reconstructions. The three rift successions with ca. 1090 to 1085 Ma late stage volcanics are the Lake Shore Traps of Michigan, the Michipicoten Island Formation of Ontario and the Schroeder-Lutsen basalts of Minnesota. In past studies, paleomagnetic data from the Schroeder-Lutsen basalts have been grouped with results from the North Shore Volcanic Group, which it unconformably overlies. In this study, we separate these data and add newly developed results from 40 additional flows. New data from the Michipicoten Island Formation allow for a well constrained pole that now includes data from more than 25 flows. High quality paleomagnetic data are published for the Lake Shore Traps, and we complement these with a newly developed high precision U-Pb zircon date as an update to current constraints. Taken altogether, these data strengthen our understanding of the rift's demise and the rate of Laurentia's motion as rift volcanism gave way to post-rift sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Shortening of the upper crust should be accompanied by thickening of the deeper lithosphere. However, for many orogens, including the central Andes, geophysical and geological observations indicate that mantle lithosphere is spatially heterogeneous, being anomalously thin or absent. Seismic studies of the central Andes suggest that mantle lithosphere is locally removed. Also, present day elevations of the central Andean Plateau have been explained by rapid removal of mantle lithosphere over the last 10 Ma. Yet, the geological record is innately incomplete, and seismic tomography and receiver functions can offer only a present day snapshot of the subsurface. None of these techniques provides concrete insight into the physical processes responsible for current Andean elevations (3-5 km). A 2D plane-strain thermo-mechanical code, SOPALE, is used to examine the deep lithospheric dynamics connected to mantle lithosphere removal within a subduction zone setting, such as the Andes. Three models have been tested: removal by viscous dripping, by delamination, and a model with no removal. The removal models contain a high density eclogite root, creating a contrast between mantle lithosphere and mantle material. For the viscous drip models, mantle lithosphere is removed within 2.5-5 Myrs, descending subvertically through the mantle, causing subsequent surface rebound. Prior to this rebound, surface topography subsides locally over the dense root. This subsidence is influenced by crustal rheology, where weaker crustal rheologies produce deep, narrower basins (25-75 km wide, ~1 km deep), and stronger crustal rheologies produce shallow, broader basins (300-400 km wide, ~0.5 km deep). Delamination, which involves the coherent removal of mantle lithosphere along the Moho, affects a larger region, and is reflected in broader basins that extend into the back-arc. In all models, the deep lithosphere dynamics have an appreciable effect on surface topography, therefore, removal events should be recorded in the elevation history of an orogen. Past studies that have examined mantle lithosphere removal have assumed simple and idealized systems. We are currently working on more complex model configurations in order to reflect the detailed geometry and compositional and rheological heterogeneities within the central Andes.",

Thallium has a residence time of ~20 thousand years, which is long enough to render modern oxic seawater conservative with respect to concentration and isotopes. The isotopic signature of Tl in the global ocean is driven mainly by two outputs (1) adsorption onto manganese oxides and (2) low temperature oceanic crust alteration. Importantly, the isotopic inputs of Tl are all nearly the same value; thus, the isotopic composition and flux of the outputs almost exclusively set the seawater signature. For relatively short term redox events it is reasonable to assume that the dominant isotope fractionation process is associated with manganese oxide precipitation because low temperature alteration is controlled by long-term average ocean crust production rates.\nWe present a broad range of modern samples that span several open ocean profiles combined with water column and sediment profiles from the permanently anoxic basins of the Black Sea and Cariaco Basins. The open ocean shows no variation in depth profiles that encompass most of the major water masses in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The anoxic basins, however, reveal Tl isotope signatures closer to their inputs, which is likely due to basinal restriction. The authigenic fraction of organic-rich sediments from the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin capture the Tl isotope value of the overlying water column, which shows that Tl isotopes could be applied as a faithful deep time redox proxy. For the first time, we will present new data showing that Tl isotopes is tracking bottom water ocean oxygenation. We are applying this isotope system to ancient samples, testing the spatial and temporal variability of ocean oxygenation coinciding with major biogeochemical events.",

This presentation examines the performance of proposed soil water seasonal outlooks in the context of wheat cropping in south-eastern Australia (autumn planting, late spring harvest).\nWe used weather ensembles simulated by the Predictive Ocean-Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA), as input to the Agricultural Production Simulator (APSIM) to construct ensemble soil water “outlooks” at twenty sites. Hindcasts were made over a 33 year period using the 33 POAMA ensemble members. The overall modelling flow involved:\n1. Downscaling of the daily weather series (rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, humidity, radiation) from the ~250km POAMA grid scale to a local weather station using quantile-quantile correction. This was based on a 33 year observation record extracted from the SILO data drill product.\n2. Using APSIM to produce soil water ensembles from the downscaled weather ensembles. A warm up period of 5 years of observed weather was followed by a 9 month hindcast period based on each ensemble member.\n3. The soil water ensembles were summarized by estimating the proportion of outlook ensembles in each climatological tercile, where the climatology was constructed using APSIM and observed weather from the 33 years of hindcasts at the relevant site.\n4. The soil water outlooks were evaluated for different lead times and months using a “truth” run of APSIM based on observed weather.\nOutlooks generally have useful some forecast skill for lead times of up to two-three months, except late spring; in line with current useful lead times for rainfall outlooks. Better performance was found in summer and autumn when vegetation cover and water use is low.",

An interannual comparison with the global European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERAI) and atmospheric observations show the troposphere to be well assimilated in the ASRv2, as monthly and annual near-surface (upper-level) temperature, dew-point (relative humidity), pressure (geopotential height), and wind-speed biases and root-mean-squared errors compared with surface stations and radiosondes are very small. These results are similar to the ERAI, although wind-speed biases are significantly smaller in the ASRv2. The high-resolution land representation in ASRv2 leads to more accurate depictions of topographically forced wind events and atmospheric circulation throughout the Arctic, particularly with respect to tip jets and barrier winds along the southeast coast of Greenland. Overall, these results suggest that despite the ASRv2’s use of a 3D-variational (Var) assimilation compared with the ERAI’s 4D-Var, a regional assimilation laterally forced by a global reanalysis can improve the assimilation of observations and help offset temporal information lost by the 3D-Var compared with the 4D-Var. In addition, forecast fields of clouds, downward surface radiation, and precipitation are validated against ERAI and surface observations.",

The dissected terrain is comprised of early Hesperian lava flows. Drainage systems consist of deep, narrow valleys that we interpret as bedrock reaches and small outflow-like, flat-floored channels, that are approximately 1-2 km wide and contain depositional bedforms. In these systems, approximately 130 m deep narrow reaches alternate with wide, shallow sediment-dominated reaches. This morphologic pattern is probably the result downcutting and erosion of bedrock by stream flow and subsequent deposition of the eroded material in the wider reaches downstream in response to local topographic and lithologic changes. The floors of the wider channel reaches contain several stream-lined smooth-surfaced islands, which we interpret as possible bar deposits. In some of these non-terminal depositional reaches, the channels are completely filled by deposits but further downstream the boundaries of the channel walls become apparent again. We interpret these locations as possible sites where stream flow spreads out and infiltrates into the subsurface and then subsequently outflows again to surface where channel walls become more defined. Some channels seem to be associated with the pitted latitude dependent mantle, whereas elevated islands remain smooth and free of pits. In the upper reaches of one channel system, an assemblage of intra-channel features is repeated: knobs, sinuous ridges and elongate, channel-jamming deposits similar to the morphology resulting from glaciers or rock glaciers. One channel system begins with several theater-shaped heads, suggesting a possible formation by sapping. Channel heads are cut into a high-thermal-inertia unit, possibly basaltic bedrock. We propose that this setting is suggestive of terrestrial discontinuous ephemeral stream channel systems.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical studies of high energy density matter are a key component to improving our knowledge related to interiors of giant planets and stars, astrophysical processes, and new plasma energy technologies, such as inertial confined fusion. Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) are simulation methods that provide consistent, first-principles descriptions of warm, dense matter and plasmas over a wide range of density and temperature conditions. Here, we report simulation results using these two methods for a number of first- and second-row elements. DFT-MD algorithms are well-suited for low temperatures, while PIMC has been restricted to relatively high temperatures due to the free-particle approximation of the nodal surface. For first-row elements, we find that the free-particle approximation is sufficient as long as the temperature is high enough to sufficiently ionize the second electronic shell of the atoms. For heavier, second-row elements, we have developed a new, localized nodal surface, which allows us to treat bound states within the PIMC formalism. By combining PIMC and DFT-MD pressures and internal energies, we produce a coherent, first-principles equation of state, bridging the entire warm dense matter regime. Pair-correlation functions and the density of electronic states reveal an evolving plasma structure. The degree of ionization is affected by both temperature and density. Finally, shock Hugoniot curves show an increase in compression as the first and second shells are ionized.",

The observational component of this study centered on 7 round-trips made by the NSF NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) between Sacramento, CA and Kona, Hawaii between 1 July and 15 August 2015. The CSET observing strategy used a Lagrangian approach to sample aerosol, cloud, and boundary layer properties upwind from the transition zone over the North Pacific and to resample these areas two days later. GFS forecast trajectories were used to plan the outbound flight to Hawaii and then updated forecast trajectories helped set the return flight plan two days later. Two key elements of the CSET observing system were the newly developed HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) and the HIAPER Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). Together they provided unprecedented characterizations of aerosol, cloud and precipitation structures. A full suite of probes on the aircraft were used for in situ measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and turbulence properties during the low-level aircraft profiling portions of the flights. A wide range of boundary layer structures and aerosol, cloud, and precipitation conditions were observed during CSET. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus infused with smoke from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale (100-200 km) cloud-precipitation complexes, and patches of shallow cumuli in environments with accumulation mode aerosol concentrations of less than 50 cm-3. Ultra clean layers (UCLs with accumulation mode concentrations of less than 10 cm-3) were observed frequently near the top of the boundary layer and were often associated with shallow, gray (optically thin) layered clouds—features that are the subject of focused investigations by the CSET science team. The extent of aerosol, cloud, drizzle and boundary layer sampling that was made over open areas of the North Pacific along 2-day trajectories during CSET is unprecedented and will enable focused modeling studies of cloud system evolution and the role of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in that evolution.",

            "abstract": "The development of low-cost optical sensors (i.e., transmissometers and optical backscattering sensors, OBS) produced the last significant advance in in-situ monitoring of suspended sediment concentration. However, it was well-known from fundamental physics of light scattering and laboratory work, that their response suffered from a severe non-uniformity to grain-size (varying as 1/diameter), susceptibility to biofouling, and limited dynamic range. Here we present the development of a new, low cost, single-point, 8 MHz acoustic backscatter sensor, LISST-ABS that improves on all these shortcomings. For example, the response is nearly flat over 30-400 micron diameters varying within ±30% of the mean (compared with roughly ±400% for OBS over the same size range), fouling is less serious, and the dynamic range spans 5 decades without change of electronic gain. A key innovation of the LISST-ABS is the use of backscatter signal from two range cells in order to measure and compensate for sediment attenuation, allowing a working concentration range exceeding 1 mg/L to 70 g/L (for 7 micron particles).",

For probabilistic approach to tephra fall hazard, TEPHRA2 is useful that it is a simplified advection-diffusion model to calculate tephra accumulation at localities.\nWe subjected Kuju volcano (Kuju, located in central-eastern Kyushu Island) that had three big eruptions (VEI=5) after the beginning of the volcanic activity at about 200 ka. If Kuju erupts in the future, the tephra will fall onto eastern Kyushu and the western Shikoku area. Then, we assessed a locality at about 100 km ENE from Kuju and studied probabilistically the biggest plinian eruption in Kuju occurred at 50 ka using TEPHRA2.\nThe eruption mass is estimated to be 2.03 km3 or 6.2 km3. The input parameters such as wind, eruption mass and plume heights were concerned. We used a long year record of the wind profiles measuring each height from the ground to 30 km during 22 years (from 1989 to 2010) by the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nBased on the calculated result using the average wind of each month, the seasonal wind variation exerts a first-order influence on mass distribution. During the winter, winds are strong but blow to east-south-east, so the ash didn’t reach the assessed locality. On the other hand, the winds are so weak during the summer that the area buried by thick ash is limited only close to the eruptive vent. The month that has the thickest ash deposit is September and its thickness is 2.2 cm concerning that the eruption mass is 2.03 km3. As the thickness is 6.9 cm in the case of 6.2 km3, the eruption mass affects the mass distribution.\nThe hazard curve shows 27% and 1.8% probability of reaching a tephra fall accumulation of 1cm and 5 cm for the assessed locality if Kuju has a VEI5 eruption, which is characterized by low tephra fall accumulation for the eruptive conditions considered in this assessment.",

Programs offered by the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) address these needs through summer internships and field training programs.\nFrom 2008-2012, LPI hosted the Lunar Exploration Summer Intern Program. This special summer intern program evaluated possible landing sites for robotic and human exploration missions to the lunar surface. By the end of the 2012 program, a series of scientifically-rich landing sites emerged, some of which had never been considered before. Beginning in 2015 and building on the success of the lunar exploration program, a new Exploration Science Summer Intern Program is being implemented with a broader scope that includes both the Moon and near-Earth asteroids. Like its predecessor, the Exploration Science Summer Intern Program offers graduate students a unique opportunity to integrate scientific input with exploration activities in a way that mission architects and spacecraft engineers can use. The program’s activities may involve assessments and traverse plans for a particular destination or a more general assessment of a class of possible exploration targets. Details of the results of these programs will be discussed.\nSince 2010 graduate students have participated in field training and research programs at Barringer (Meteor) Crater and the Sudbury Impact Structure. Skills developed during these programs prepare students for their own thesis studies in impact-cratered terrains, whether they are on the Earth, the Moon, Mars, or other solar system planetary surface. Future field excursions will take place at these sites as well as the Zuni-Bandera Volcanic Field. Skills developed during the Zuni-Bandera training will prepare students for their own thesis studies of volcanic provinces on any solar system planetary surface where basaltic volcanism has occurred. Further details of these field trainings will also be discussed.",

They had a packet-like structure and lasted more than 3 hours. The FFT spectra show that the main spectral power corresponds to frequencies of ~ 20-22 mHz, which argues against a source for the pulsations in the solar wind. The frequencies of the central power peak in the radial component decrease with radial distance from the Earth. The most striking feature of the Pc 4 pulsations was their occurrence at similar locations on three of four successive orbits of Van Allen Probes nine hours apart. We determined that the pulsations were second harmonic mode waves. We test various possible mechanisms for their generation.",

            "abstract": "Detailed observations of a variety of ion species at a sufficiently high temporal resolution are essential to understanding the loss and acceleration processes of ring current ions. For example, CRESS/MICS observations indicated that the energy density of suprathermal O+ exceeds that of H+ in large magnetic storms (Daglis et al., 1997), while the H+ energy density dominates under quiet conditions. However, the primary ion loss processes during the storm recovery phase are still incompletely understood. The mechanisms to accelerate upflowing ions, regularly observed with energies of a few keV at ~1000 km altitude, up to the 100s-keV range in the geospace are also not fully understood. Our novel electrostatic analyzer (ESA) employs a toroidal double-shell structure to cover the entire ring current ion range of ~3–250 keV/Q with high temporal resolution (<1 minute with a necessary counting statistics for the quiet time), while saving significant resources in mass and size. In this presentation, we discuss the operation principle and the proof of concept study of the ESA in terms of numerical calculations and ion beam calibration activities. This presentation comprehensively covers the expected sensor performance important for the in-flight capabilities, such as sensor parameters (G-factor, K-factor, and energy resolution), cross-shell contaminations, and UV background counts.",

            "abstract": "A thrust earthquake of MW 6.3 occurred along the northern part of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) in the northern Nagano prefecture, central Japan, on November 22, 2014. This event was reported to be related to an active fault, the Kamishiro fault belonging to the ISTL (e.g., HERP, 2014). The surface rupture is observed along the Kamishiro fault (e.g., Lin et al., 2015; Okada et al., 2015). We estimated the kinematic source rupture process of this earthquake through the multiple time-window linear waveform inversion method (Hartzell and Heaton, 1983). We used velocity waveforms in 0.05-1 Hz from 12 strong motion stations of K-NET, KiK-net (NIED), JMA, and Nagano prefecture (SK-net, ERI). In order to enhance the reliability in Green’s functions, we assumed one-dimensional velocity structure models different for the different stations, which were extracted from the nation-wide three-dimensional velocity structure model, Japan Integrated Velocity Structure Model (JIVSM, Koketsu et al., 2012).\nConsidering the spatial distribution of aftershocks (Sakai et al., 2015) and surface ruptures, the assumed fault model consisted of two dip-bending fault segments with different dip angles between the northern and southern segments. The total length and width of the fault plane is 20 km and 13 km, relatively, and the fault model is divided into 260 subfaults of 1 km × 1 km in space and six smoothed ramp functions in time.\nAn asperity or large slip area with a peak slip of 1.9 m was estimated in the lower plane of the northern segment in the approximate depth range of 4 to 8 km. The depth extent of this asperity is consistent with the seismogenic zone revealed by past studies (e.g., Panayotopoulos et al., 2014). In contrast, the slip in the southern segment is relatively concentrated in the shallow portion of the segment where the surface ruptures were found along the Kamishiro fault. The overall spatial rupture pattern of the source fault, in which the deep asperity was located on the northern segment and surface rupture was found on the southern segment, seems to be spatially consistent with the mapped active faults. These findings suggest characteristic and repeating features of fault ruptures along active faults where static offsets have accumulated over past events, and it would be a good constraint on earthquake scenarios along it.",

            "abstract": "Ensuring access to clean, safe sanitation for the world’s population remains a challenging, yet critical, global sustainability goal. Ecological-based sanitation (EcoSan) technology is a promising strategy for improving sanitation, particularly in areas where financial resources and infrastructure are limiting. The composting of human waste and its use as an agricultural soil amendment can tackle three important challenges in developing countries – providing improved sanitation for vulnerable communities, reducing the spread of intestinal-born pathogens, and returning nutrients and organic matter to degraded agricultural soils. The extent of these benefits and potential tradeoffs are not well known, but have important implications for the widespread adoption of this strategy to promote healthy communities and enhance food security.\nWe quantified the effects of EcoSan on the climate and human health in partnership with Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods (SOIL) in Haiti. We measured greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide) from compost piles that ranged in age from 0 to 14 months (i.e. finished) from two compost facilities managed with or without cement lining. We also measured emissions from a government-operated waste treatment pond and a grass field where waste has been illegally dumped. The highest methane emissions were observed from the anaerobic waste pond, whereas the dump site and compost piles had higher nitrous oxide emissions. Net greenhouse gases (CO2-equivalents) from unlined compost piles were 8x lower than lined compost piles and 20 and 30x lower than the dump and waste pond, respectively. We screened finished compost for fecal pathogens using bacterial 16S sequencing. Bacterial pathogens were eliminated regardless of the type of composting process. Pilot trials indicate that the application of compost to crops has a large potential for increasing food production. This research suggests that EcoSan systems are effective at achieving multiple sustainability goals including the provision of sanitation, mitigating climate change, and increasing food security.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest drivers of historical nutrient and sediment transport into the Gulf of Mexico is the unprecedented scale and intensity of land use change in the Mississippi River Basin. These landscape changes are linked to enhanced fluxes of carbon and nitrogen pollution from the Mississippi River, and persistent eutrophication and hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Increased terrestrial runoff is one hypothesis for recent enrichment in bulk nitrogen isotope (δ15N) values, a tracer for nutrient source, observed in a Gulf of Mexico deep-sea coral record. However, unambiguously linking anthropogenic land use change to whole scale shifts in downstream Gulf of Mexico biogeochemical cycles is difficult. Here we present a novel approach, coupling a new tracer of agro-industrialization to a multiproxy record of nutrient loading in long-lived deep-sea corals collected in the Gulf of Mexico. We found that coral bulk δ15N values are enriched over the last 150–200 years relative to the last millennia, and compound-specific amino acid δ15N data indicate a strong increase in baseline δ15N of nitrate as the primary cause. Coral rhenium (Re) values are also strongly elevated during this period, suggesting that 34% of Re is of anthropogenic origin, consistent with Re enrichment in major world rivers. However, there are no pre-anthropogenic measurements of Re to confirm this observation. For the first time, an unprecedented record of natural and anthropogenic Re variability is documented through coral Re records. Taken together, these novel proxies link upstream changes in water quality to impacts on the deep-sea coral ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Primary mineral dissolution (i.e. weathering) is a critical process in forested catchments as an important consumer of acidity and CO2, the principle source of nutrients such as Ca, K, and P, as well as the source of toxic cations such as Al. Two common limitations of weathering studies are inadequate determination of mineralogic composition and insufficient sampling depth to determine location and advancement of weathering reactions. We determined mineral stocks through EPMA mapping of Al, Ca, Fe, P, and Si content of soil samples and development of an image analysis routine that assigned mineral composition based on the content of these five elements. Portions of the classified maps were confirmed by optical petrography and full elemental analysis by SEM-EDS. Samples were analyzed for soil profiles >2m depth (~1.5m past the upper boundary of the “unweathered” C horizon). Study sites spanned a range of weatherability found in catchments in glaciated northeastern USA including Winnisook, NY (sandstone parent material, 100 ppm Ca), Hubbard Brook, NH (granite, 0.9% Ca), and Sleepers River, VT (calcareous granulite, 3.5% Ca). All profiles exhibited a weathering front, or threshold above which the most reactive minerals (calcite, apatite) have been depleted. However, in all cases this threshold was below the rooting zone, and in many profiles, it was well below the C horizon interface. Catchment scale Ca exports reflect this deeper weathering source while rooting zone exchangeable Ca was highly variable, probably reflecting spatial patterns of hydrologic flowpaths which bring deeper weathering products to the surface only in certain landscape positions. These results suggest that nutrient cycling and critical loads models, which assume that ecologically relevant weathering is confined to the rooting zone, need to be refined to account for deeper weathering and spatial patterns of lateral and upward hydrologic fluxes. Similarly, recovery from cultural acidification may be limited in portions of catchments where hydrologic connections do not provide a vehicle for weathering products to recharge the biologically active portion of the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Changes to the geomorphology of meandering rivers as they approach the coast are now recognized as being connected to a transition from quasi-normal flow upstream to a zone of gradually varying flow near the shoreline. In spite of this recognition, there remains a great deal to learn regarding the morphodynamics of coastal rivers. Here we present data from repeat bathymetric and topographic surveys, aerial photo analyses, and bed-material sampling that are aimed at defining the morphodynamics of the coastal Trinity River. Initial change in the geomorphology of the river channel is coincident with the average elevation of the river bottom dropping below mean sea level. Over the next 50 river km downstream of this point, the vegetated channel width systematically decreases by 44 percent and channel depth systematically increases 1.95 times. The net result is a 66 percent reduction in the width-to-depth ratio, which is not evenly distributed in the downstream direction. All of the change occurs in the first 28 river km, with the channel maintaining a statistically constant value of 17 for the next 22 river km. The size of point bars also begins to systemically decrease at the point where the river bottom drops below sea level. Over the next 50 river km the surface area of these bars decreases by an order of magnitude. This substantial reduction is not only a function of the decrease in channel width, but also a decrease in point-bar length. At about 23 km downstream the bars undergo a change in their cross-sectional shape. Upstream they occupy roughly 80 percent of the channel, while downstream they occupy only 70 percent of the channel width. This coincides with the point where lateral migration rates for channel bends drop by roughly 75 percent. We show how these changes in channel geometry and kinematics are connected to time and space changes in hydrology and sediment transport in the backwater zone.",

Therefore, it is important for ecologists to understand how ecosystems adapt and recover from climate change. The fossil record provides excellent case studies of similar events, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Although Paleocene and Eocene shallow water carbonates have not received the same degree of attention as the deep-water record, the PETM provides an opportunity to study the role of alternative stable states in maintaining the health and diversity of shallow water carbonate environments. It is generally accepted that during the PETM there is a transition from reef systems to foraminiferal shoals as the dominant shallow water carbonate producers. In fact, previous work has documented this interval as one of the major metazoan reef collapses of the Phanerozoic. This study fills an important gap in the shallow-water PETM record by quantitatively measuring the changes in carbonate production and ecology of 15 localities as they shift from coral reefs to foraminiferal shoal. The quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis is accomplished by using data from the PaleoReefs database and a simple carbonate production calculation to estimate the productivity of the shallow water system. Ecological data are gathered through a literature review of the localities. The results of this study will enable a better understanding of how modern reefs may react to global climate and environmental change.",

Carbonaceous gases stored in ice cores are known to correlate with temperature change and provide evidence of such events. However, more complex forms of carbon preserved in ice cores such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) can provide additional information relating to changes in environmental conditions over time. The examination of ice core samples presents unique challenges including detection of ultra-low concentrations of organic material and extremely limited sample amounts.\nIn this study, solid phase extraction techniques combined with ultra-high resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FTICR-MS) were utilized to successfully extract, concentrate and analyze the low concentrations of DOM in only 100 mL of ice core samples originating from various regions of Antarctica and Greenland. We characterize the DOM composition in each sample by evaluating elemental ratios, molecular formula distribution (CHO, CHON, CHOS and CHNOS) and compound class composition (lignin, tannin, lipid, condensed aromatic, protein and unsaturated hydrocarbon content). Upon characterization, we identified molecular trends in ice core DOM chemistry that correlated with past climatic events in addition to observing possible photochemical and microbial influences affecting DOM chemistry. Considering these samples range in age from 350-1175 years old, thus being formed during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, we observed that DOM properties reflected anticipated changes in composition as influenced by warming and cooling events occurring during that time period.",

We can adjust the construction parameters in time and guide the on-site acquisition work based on the results of the analysis.\nMass data have been acquired by high-density seismic acquisition. Work-load of on-site data analysis and process is increasing because of mass data. We need to analyze the quality of the data quickly and improve the accuracy of the result. In normal seismic data on-site acquisition, on-site quality control personnel usually use qualitative method to analyze seismic data so the analyzing result is affected by the experience of quality control personnel. On-site seismic data analysis method gradually develops from qualitative to quantitative. Now we estimate the quality of seismic data by statistical characters instead of experience. The result of estimate is more reliable.\nOn-site processing software has some analysis method like amplitude analysis, frequency analysis, autocorrelation analysis, F-K analysis and so on. We can estimate the quality of seismic data based on the quantitative process. We can also use a simple method to get the three instantaneous attributes if we transform seismic data to complex domain. On-site seismic data can be analyzed and estimated by applicable attributes (e.g. instantaneous amplitude can be used to find out abnormal trace; quality control personnel can analyze the propagation of the wave field by instantaneous phase because both strong and weak signal can be displayed on the instantaneous phase diagram; Instantaneous frequency could reflect the frequency values of every moment, it can estimate the distribution of on-site seismic data's frequency characteristics quantitative). Transforming seismic data to complex domain and analyzing the instantaneous attribute of on-site seismic data can help us recognize the feature of on-site seismic data quickly.\nFrom the above, rapid extraction of three instantaneous attributes can improve the efficiency of monitoring the field construction.",

            "abstract": "One of the most visible manifestations of Pluto’s atmosphere observed from the New Horizons spacecraft during the flyby in July 2015 was a global haze layer extending to an altitude ~150 km above Pluto’s surface. The haze layer exhibits a significant hemispheric asymmetry and what appears to be layered and/or wave like features. Stellar observations since 1989 have suggested the existence of a haze layer in Pluto’s lower atmosphere to explain features in occultation light curves. A haze layer is also expected from photochemical models of Pluto’s methane atmosphere wherein hydrocarbons and are produced at altitudes above 100 km altitude, mix downwards, and condense at the low atmospheric temperatures near the surface. However, the observed haze layer(s) extends much higher where the atmospheric temperature is too high for condensation. In this paper we will discuss the production and condensation of photochemical products, and evaluate the possibility that nucleation begins in the ionosphere by a mechanism similar to that proposed for the atmosphere of Titan, where electron attachments initiates a sequence of ion-molecular reactions that ultimately produce aerosol “tholins” that settle downward and coat the surface.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Sas_AGU2015_v4.pdf\nA fundamental question in geology is whether subducting plates get hot enough to generate melt that contributes to magmatic output in volcanic arcs. Because the subducting plate beneath the Cascade arc is relatively young and hot, slab melt generation is considered possible. To better understand the role of slab melt in north Cascades magmas, this study focused on petrogenesis of high-Mg andesites (HMA) and basaltic andesites (HMBA) from Mt. Baker and Glacier Peak, Washington. HMA have unusually high Mg# relative to their SiO2 contents, as well as elevated La/Yb and Dy/Yb ratios that are interpreted to result from separation of melt from a garnet-bearing residuum. Debate centers on the garnet’s origin as it could be present in mineral assemblages from the subducting slab, deep mantle, thick lower crust, or basalt fractionated at high pressure. Whole rock analyses were combined with major, minor, and trace element analyses to understand the origin of these HMA. In the Tarn Plateau (Mt. Baker) flow unit (51.8–54.0 wt.% SiO2, Mg# 68–70) Mg#s correlate positively with high La/Yb in clinopyroxene equilibrium liquids, suggesting an origin similar to that of Aleutian adakites, where slab-derived melts interact with the overlying mantle to become Mg-rich and subsequently mix with mantle-derived basalts. The source for high La/Yb in the Glacier Creek (Mt. Baker) flow unit (58.3–58.7 wt.% SiO2, Mg# 63–64) is more ambiguous. High whole rock Sr/P imply origin from a mantle that was hydrated by an enriched slab component (fluid ± melt). In the Lightning Creek (Glacier Peak) flow unit (54.8–57.9 SiO2, Mg# 69–72) Cr and Mg contents in Cr-spinel and olivine pairs suggest a depleted mantle source, and high whole rock Sr/P indicate hydration-induced mantle melting. Hence Lightning Creek is interpreted have originated from a refractory mantle source that interacted with a hydrous slab component (fluid ± melt). Our results indicate that in addition to slab-derived fluids, slab-derived melts also have an important role in the production of HMA in the north Cascade arc.",

            "abstract": "Due to remarkable economic growth over the last two decades, East Asia has become a region experiencing some of the poorest air quality in the world. In addition to local sources of pollution, the Korea peninsula is downwind of the largest emission sources in East Asia, complicating the understanding of air quality over Korea. Thus, knowing the factors controlling changes in air pollution across urban-rural and marine-continental interfaces, in addition to the contributions from local emissions and transboundary transport, is important for building effective management strategies and improving air quality in East Asia.\nGEMS (Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer) is a satellite instrument planned for launch in 2019 by the Republic of Korea. The instrument will observe East Asia and the western Pacific region, providing real-time monitoring of air quality (e.g. O3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, AOD, etc.) and enabling better scientific understanding of the transboundary transport of air pollutants. The KORUS–AQ (the Korea and U.S. Air Quality) field campaign will take place in May – June 2016 and will employ an integrated observing strategy including multiplatform observations (i.e. ground stations, aircraft, ships, and satellites) and chemical transport models. This mission aims to not only strengthen our knowledge of atmospheric chemistry but also provide important data sets for validating GEMS retrieval algorithms. In preparation for KORUS–AQ, a pre-campaign has been successfully conducted in Korea during early summer 2015 with observations from multiple ground sites and a small aircraft. A brief summary of pre-field campaign results will be presented.\nMoving forward, the GEMS mission and KORUS–AQ study will lead to a new era of air quality monitoring in East Asia. GEMS will also make critical contributions to the global air quality perspective working in concert with geostationary missions launched by the U.S. (TEMPO: Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) and Europe (Sentinel-4) and low-Earth orbit missions including the European Sentinel-5 Precursor.",

Introduction of dual-polarization radar, however, has shed some light on the problem to underestimate radar rainfall in single-polarization radar. Dual-polarization radar provides various variables such like the differential reflectivity, differential phase, specific differential phase, and correlation coefficient, etc. as well as the reflectivity. Due to the advantage of dual-polarization radar providing various information available on the precipitation, the quality of the radar rainfall becomes much higher. Total five dual-polarization radars (Baengnyeongdo, Yongin-Testbed, Bislsan, Sobaeksan and Mohusan Radar) were introduced in Korea until now and the project, \"Development and application of Cross governmental dual-pol radar harmonization\", is on the way. Weather Radar Center (WRC), Korea Meteorological Adminstration (KMA) has played a leading role in the dual-polarization radar technology in Korea. WRC has been researching the quality control (QC) for the polarimetric variables, the classification of the precipitation, the radar rainfall estimation algorithm, and the composite dual-polarimetric varaiables field, etc. WRC (2014) suggested Korean polarimetric radar variables relation (Z-ZDR relation and Z-KDP relation) and Korean radar rainfall estimation algorithm (R(Z, ZDR) WRC algorithm). This study examined on the six radar rainfall estimation algorithms including R(Z, ZDR) WRC algorithm and corrected the bias of polarimetric variables using Korean polarimetric variables relation. Plus, this study quantified the uncertainty of the radar rainfall estimated from six algorithms before and after the correction. As a result, the quality of the radar rainfall after the correction improved and Korean radar rainfall estimation algorithm had the best quality among the algorithms using the Z and ZDR,",

However, there has been relatively little study of the models’ ability to make optimal use of 3D imagery by considering the minimum number of grid points that are needed to represent geometric features such as pore throats. This is of critical importance since 3D images of geological samples are a compromise between resolution and field of view. In this work we explore the discretisation limits of LB models, their behavior near these limits, and the consequences of this behavior for simulations of drainage and imbibition.\nWe quantify the performance of two commonly used multiphase LB models: Shan-Chen (SC) and Rothman-Keller (RK) models in a set of tests, including simulations of bubbles in bulk fluid, on flat surfaces, confined in flat/tilted tubes, and fluid invasion into single tubes. Simple geometries like these allow better quantification of model behavior and better understanding of breakdown mechanisms.\nIn bulk fluid, bubble radii less than 2.5 grid units (image voxels) cause numerical instability in SC model; the RK model is stable to a radius of 2.5 units and below, but with poor agreement with the Laplace's law. When confined to a flat duct, the SC model can simulate similar radii to RK model, but with higher interface spurious currents than the RK model and some risk of instability. In tilted ducts with 'staircase' voxel-level roughness, the SC model seems to average the roughness, whereas for RK model only the 'peaks' of the surface are relevant. Overall, our results suggest that LB models can simulate fluid capillary pressure corresponding to interfacial radii of just 1.5 grid units, with the RK model exhibiting significantly better stability.",

At this latitude, prior analyses of tide-gauge, leveling, and GPS data place the landward limit of the locked seismogenic zone 30 km or more offshore, with partial locking extending as far as 50 km inland. Aseismic slip events accompanied by tectonic tremor have recurred here 16 to 24 months apart, based on seismic and GPS data since 1990 and 1998, respectively. Each of the four vigorous tremor episodes since the BSMs were installed in February, 2006 has been recorded by coastal strainmeters. For coastal BSM B024, gauge extensions up to 300 ppm during tremor events in June, 2011 and February, 2013, are the largest signals since 2010 after corrections for borehole trends, seasonal variations, and atmospheric pressure. Forward models matching coastal GPS offsets and strain time series for B024 can be constructed by superimposing rectangular dislocations surrounding each day’s tremor epicenters (assumed to be on the plate interface). The up-dip limit of tremor varies along strike, but slip up-dip of the tremor is not needed to match the strain data. Net east-west contraction at B024 for both these episodes requires most, if not all, slip to take place landward of the up-dip limit of tremor, about 30 km inland. Coastal BSMs could help characterize aseismic slip in the offshore part of the transition zone. Strain excursions of equal size, but opposite sign, would result from a hypothetical event with a downdip limit of slip 20 km offshore that is otherwise similar to the 2011 event. Yet since 2010, no such strain signal has been observed. Any slip since 2010 in the offshore transition zone may have been continuous, or composed of smaller, more frequent, episodes less discernible in BSM data.",

Aso caldera is one of the active volcano in Japan which have produced four stages (Aso-1, -2, -3, -4) of large-scale pyroclastic flow deposits 270 to 90 ky. ago.\nA suite of samples were collected from the bottom of Aso-1 pyroclastic flow deposit and from the underlying tephra layer (Ono et al., 1979). The tephra comprises more than 10 pumice fall units inter-layered by dark gray volcanic ash. For whole rock chemistry, coarser pumice fragments were separated. For mineral and glass chemistry, phenocrysts and glass particles were handpicked from the sieved 500-1000 um fractions under a binocular microscope. This fraction consist of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, variably vesiculated volcanic glass fragments, and clinopyroxene phenocrysts. They were analyzed using an electron micro-probe.\nThe suite of samples are similar and major temporal change is the chemical composition of orthopyroxenes; those from upper horizon are relatively Mg rich. Anorthite content of plagioclase phenocryst is bimodal 49-53 mol. % (major) and 57-70 mol. % (minor). Silica content of matrix glass fall in a narrow range 68-70 wt. %. Temperature and oxygen fugacity were estimated to be 865-905 deg-C and FMQ+2 log unit, respectively, using ILMAT (Lepage, 2003). Pressure and water content of the magma are estimated to be 5-7 kbar and 0.5-1 wt. % H2O, respectively, using rhyolite-MELTS (Gualda et al., 2012) on the most undifferentiated tholeiitic basalt of Aso 4KC-03 (Hunter, 1998) to reproduce the observed composition of matrix glass (68-70 wt. % SiO2) and plagioclase (An 49-53 mol. %). The calcic plagioclase (An 57-70 mol. %), however, suggest that the basalt was initially hydrous and require magma degassing before the differentiation. If we assume degassing by magma convection in a conduit (Kazahaya et al., 1994), the amount of rhyolite magma potentially produced via crystallization of the degassed magma equivalent to 500-1000 ton/day SO2 emission is estimated to be 18 km^3 / ky.\nThis research project has been conducted as the regulatory supporting research funded by the Secretariat of Nuclear Regulation Authority (Secretariat of NRA), Japan",

            "abstract": "Little is known about the operational, rather than potential, impacts of droughts on the electric system. Vulnerability assessments are usually performed for a baseline water year or a specific drought, which do not provide insights into the full grid stress distribution across the diversity of climate events. In this presentation we estimate the impacts of the water availability on the electricity generation and transmission in the Western US grid for a range of historical water availability combinations. We softly couple an integrated water model, which includes climate, hydrology, routing, water resources management and socio-economic water demand models, into a power flow model and simulate 30 years of historical hourly power flow conditions in the Western US grid. The experiment allows estimating the grid stress distribution as a function of inter-annual variability in regional water availability. Results indicate a clear correlation between grid vulnerability (as quantified in unmet energy demand and increased production cost) for the summer month of August and annual water availability. There is a 3% chance that at least 6% of the electricity demand cannot be met in August, and 21% chance of not meeting 0.1% or more of the load in the Western US grid. The regional variability in water availability contributes significantly to the reliability of the grid and could provide trade off opportunities in times of stress. We discuss joint water-energy management opportunities under historical conditions and address equivalent assessments under future climate and socio-economic changes.",

We will discuss two particular experiment campaigns; one set of experiments exploring the nature of H and He mixtures in the deep interiors of Jupiter and Saturn, and a second set of experiments exploring the nature of matter at multi-gigabar pressures. Whether or not H-He mixtures phase separate in Jovian planets is important to our understanding of the structure and evolution of Jupiter and Saturn.  Also integral to such planet models, as well as mechanisms for H-He phase separation, are the insulating-to-conducting and the molecular-to-atomic-hydrogen transitions in the H-He mixture. Coupling static and dynamic compression techniques has allowed us to make the first thermodynamic and transport measurements of H-He mixtures at deep Jovian planet conditions. These data provide evidence that the H-He fluid demixes at the high pressures and temperatures expected to exist deep inside Saturn and Jupiter. The second set of experiments explored how matter behaves at 10’s of billions of atmospheres pressure, well beyond the atomic unit of pressure required to distort core electron orbitals of mid-Z atoms. To achieve these conditions in the laboratory a new series of convergent shock techniques was developed. We present the first temperature-density and pressure data for this regime.",

            "abstract": "The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) in South Africa, erupted 2.05 billion years ago, is the world’s largest layered intrusion in the range of 710-1060 x 103 km3 conservatively. However, the total volume of the magmatic event that produced the BIC remains poorly known. Several other intrusions occurred approximately contemporaneously with the BIC, but a clear relationship between these multiple intrusions is yet to be determined. The Molopo Farms Complex (MFC) is a layered igneous complex of similar age 2.044 Ga ­± 24 Ma located in Botswana, 200km west of the far western limb of the BIC, with a total volume of 1300 km2. Using trace element analysis, this study makes an attempt to find a correlation between the magma that emplaced the Molopo Farms Complex with the Bushveld Igneous Complex. The MFC is related to the BIC and is located under approximately 200m of Kalahari sands, which prevents any direct sampling or observation. Unlike the BIC, the MFC is poorly studied creating a lack of information for the complex. Drill core samples from the MFC were analyzed to determine the trace element composition using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Using previously reported values for the BIC; a comparison can be made on both complexes to find possible correlations. The comparison of trace element schematics in the MFC and the BIC suggest that both complexes are derived from the same parental magma, often referred to as the “B1” magma. These comparisons allow for an assumption that the initial parental magma of the BIC may have also emplaced the MFC.",

            "abstract": "Experiments have been performed to constrain the solubility of He, Ne, and Ar in natural samples of antigorite from three locations. Geochemical analyses of exhumed subduction zone material [1] and well gases [2] indicate that noble gases are recycled from the surface of the earth into the mantle. The mechanism by which uncharged atoms can be bound to a mineral and subsequently recycled remains unclear, but recent experimental work suggests that ring structures in silicate minerals are ideal sites for noble gases [3]. Serpentine contains such ring structures and is abundant in subducting slabs, providing significant potential for control of the recycling of noble gases. Experiments were performed in a cold seal pressure vessel at 350°C using a mix of equal parts He, Ne, and Ar as the pressure media (Brown University, USA). Pressures varied from 0.15 to 1.13 kbar total pressure and durations varied from 20 to 188 hours. Samples were analyzed by UV laser ablation, noble gas mass spectrometry (Open University, UK). He and Ne reached equilibrium during the experiments and both exhibit Henrian behavior. Data from the cleanest sample reduces the error by approximately an order of magnitude over previous work [3] and confirms that He is significantly more soluble (HCHe=6.05x10-10 mol/g/bar) than Ne (HCNe=5.12x10-12 mol/g/bar) in antigorite. Preliminary data from the cleanest sample suggests that Ar is more soluble than both He and Ne (HCAr=1.94x10-10 mol/g/bar). This provides a mechanism for fractionation of noble gases during recycling.\n1. Kendrick, M.A., Scambelluri, M., Honda, M., Phillips, D., Nature Geoscience, 4, 807-812, 2011\n2.

            "abstract": "In light of recent research that suggests some high-rate wastewater injection wells from commercial oil and gas operations are casually linked to recent earthquakes in North Texas and Oklahoma, we apply a waveform cross-correlation technique to continuous waveform data from 38 seismic stations across Texas and Oklahoma using templates from 96 cataloged events from 2010-2015. We focus on an area near Venus TX, 40 km south of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in Johnson County where a M4.0 earthquake was reported by the USGS on 7 May 2015. The epicenter was within several km of 4 high rate wells with max injection rates ranging between 684,000-833,000 barrels/month. Templates were chosen from the USGS and locally derived Venus aftershock sequence, events in the ANSS catalog with a minimum magnitude of 2 between 2009-2015, and previously located earthquakes recorded by USArray stations between 2009-2011. In Johnson County, there are 27 wastewater injection wells, each with a reported maximum injection rate of 104,000 barrels/month and greater. We detected 494 events within Johnson and adjacent counties, with approximately 36% of the detections occurring within 10 km of the Venus earthquake, spanning March 2010 to June 2015. Most of the seismicity occurs adjacent to higher rate injection wells, suggesting a link between monthly injection rate and earthquake occurrence. Template matching allows us to detect earthquakes otherwise too small to be picked up by routine earthquake identification methods and informs our research concerning the presence and spatial distribution of possibly induced, small magnitude earthquakes. We plan to apply this technique to detect seismicity that may have occurred prior to the start of wastewater injection or felt earthquakes.",

We reprocessed the GPS data both from campaign sites surveyed before and from the newly surveyed near-field triangulation sites, and provided an updated set of observed GPS displacements associated with this event.\nDue to the large amount of interseismic and postseismic displacement accumulated in the 13 years elapsed between the event and the post-earthquake survey, we first modeled the displacements due to the pre-earthquake velocity and the effects of afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation separately, and removed them from the observed displacements to output a reasonable coseismic displacement field with the near-field observations. Constrained by the GPS coseismic displacements, we used a variable slip model to further invert for the coseismic slip distribution of this event.\nThe GPS-derived result shows good agreement with previous studies from field measurements, high-resolution satellite images and InSAR. The largest slip occurred on the Kusai Lake segment, with the maximum slip of 8.0 m at 93.6° E. Furthermore, due to the existence of near-field observations in the Kusai Lake segment, we estimated a more detailed slip pattern of two subsegments, one with smaller slip of 4~6 m extending to a deeper depth of ~20 km and the other with larger slips of 5~8 m to ~10 km depth. At the eastern end of the 426-km-long rupture, the GPS data show evidence for small (<2 m) but non-zero slip, in a section of the fault where the earlier InSAR data did not show any slip.",

            "abstract": "Eastern Anatolia is characterized by the continent-continent collision of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates and the westward extrusion of the Anatolian Plate away from the collision zone. We investigate the effects of this deformation on the lithospheric structure of the collision zone using a new approach to the joint inversion of surface wave dispersion data and P-wave receiver functions. As opposed to traditional joint inversion methodologies that rely heavily on mathematical interpolation to constrain shear wave velocities between stations, our approach utilizes receiver functions derived from CCP stacking analysis. By spatially binning the receiver functions, we work to alleviate the dependence of shear wave velocity profiles on station distribution, leading to a data-driven shear wave velocity model at the resolution of the CCP stacking analysis.\nWe observe slow seismic velocities near the Karliova Triple Junction that correlate well with regions of high heat flow and moderate strain rates calculated from the inversion of GPS data. We propose that these are characteristics of a crust that has been rheologically weakened by continued deformation from the Arabia-Eurasia collision, which has allowed for the upward propagation of magma and the deposition of Miocene to recent volcanics on the surface. Seismically fast lithosphere is observed in east-central Anatolia and in the Arabian Plate and correlates with regions of low strain rates, implying the presence of rigid blocks. These rigid blocks are separated by a band of slow seismic velocities associated with the East Anatolian Fault Zone and consistent with the presence of fluids in the fault zone inferred from magnetotelluric studies. West of Lake Van, we find an anomalously shallow fast shear wave velocity anomaly that reaches 4.2 km/s, consistent with the seismic velocities in the uppermost mantle beneath Anatolia. We propose that this anomaly may represent a localized wedge of Eurasian mantle that was underthrust by Arabian continental lithosphere and uplifted during the break-off of the Arabian oceanic lithosphere around 11 Ma, coinciding with the highest exhumation rates in the Bitlis Massif.",

This raises the question of what the relationship is between drought and vegetation, and how might vegetation-water dynamics change as global warming progresses. Of particular interest is the role that CO2 fertilisation has in changing landscape-scale vegetation water use. We will present both observation- and model-based analyses of the possible CO2-driven changes in vegetation cover, productivity and water use.",

In the region of São Marcos, in RGS, conduits are exposed along a 0.5 up to 1 km wide of fracture/fissure sytem. The combination of detailed field work and determination of fractal dimension from outcrops, suggest at least five main features: a) flow structures with the development of shearzones evolving into funnel-like structures of aphiric/vitrophiric ballooning of melt accumulation, b) filaments of partially devitrified material (melt) in chaotic flow patterns and c) regular regions with the predominance of bubble-rich aphiric /vitrophiric material, which is mostly deformed and fragmented along the flow; d) breccia-like regions with angular and rounded fragmented blocks of partially bubble-rich magma and; e) huge bubbles (> 40 cm!), which complexly refold previous flow lines. Observed patterns suggest two different fragmentation episodes preceding or coeval with melt extrusion: 1) a high temperature event (above glass-transition) and, 2) a lower temperature event (below glass-transition). Additionally, different intrusive moments may be recognized through deformational signs such as: pseudotachylitic veins, progressive development of a strong stretching foliation and stair-stepping-like objects along the flow. Successive melting and remelting products from different effusive and/or fragmentation moments point towards different episodes of crossing glass transition back and forward. Frozen chaotic structures in the exposed conduits depict ancient melt paths.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a pervasive natural hazard and is a billion-dollar disaster in the United States, which is comparable to hurricanes and tropical storms with greater economic impacts than extratropical storms, wildfires, blizzards, and ice storms combined. Drought early warning is of critical importance for drought preparedness planning and mitigation efforts to reduce potential impacts of drought, for which drought monitoring and prediction are the essential components. The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) has been widely used to track droughts and their impacts. USDM is a composite product that blends quantitative drought indicators and qualitative drought information from multiple sources and classifies drought conditions into different drought categories. Due to the wide application of USDM products, drought monitoring and prediction in the categorical form would be of great importance to aid decision makers to take appropriate measures for drought managements. Based on drought indices from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2), this study proposes a statistical method for the categorical drought monitoring and prediction in the United States. The probabilities of drought conditions falling into different USDM drought categories can be estimated from the proposed method. The method is found to satisfactorily reconstruct historical USDM drought categories and predict future USDM drought categories, and has considerable potential to aid early drought warning in the United States.",

            "abstract": "The observation of Earth’s atmosphere with passive remote sensing instruments is ongoing for decades and resulting in a long-term global dataset. Two prominent examples are operational satellite platforms from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or research platforms like NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS). The observed spectral ranges of these observations are often similar among the different platforms, but have large differences when it comes to resolution, accuracy and quality control.\nOur approach is to combine different kinds of instruments at the pixel-scale to improve the characterization of infrared radiances. We focus on data from the High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) and compare the observations to radiances from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on Aqua. The high spectral resolution of AIRS is used to characterize and possibly recalibrate the observed radiances from HIRS. Our approach is unique in that we use additional information from other passive instruments on the same platforms including the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).\nWe will present comparisons of radiances from HIRS and AIRS within different types of clouds that are determined from the imagers. In this way, we can analyze and select the most homogeneous conditions for radiance comparisons and a possible re-calibration of HIRS. We hope to achieve a cloud-type-dependent calibration and quality control for HIRS, which can be extrapolated into the past via inter-calibration of the different HIRS instruments beyond the time of AIRS.",

Although the use of LiDAR data is widespread in vegetation science, it has only recently (< 14 years) been applied to animal ecology. Despite such recent application, LiDAR has enabled new insights in the field and revealed the fundamental importance of 3D ecosystem structure for animals. We reviewed the studies to date that have used LiDAR in animal ecology, synthesising the insights gained. Structural heterogeneity is most conducive to increased animal richness and abundance, and increased complexity of vertical vegetation structure is more positively influential than traditionally measured canopy cover, which produces mixed results. However, different taxonomic groups interact with a variety of 3D canopy traits and some groups with 3D topography. LiDAR technology can be applied to animal ecology studies in a wide variety of environments to answer an impressive array of questions. Drawing on case studies from vastly different groups, termites and lions, we further demonstrate the applicability of LiDAR and highlight new understanding, ranging from habitat preference to predator-prey interactions, that would not have been possible from studies restricted to field based methods. We conclude with discussion of how future studies will benefit by using LiDAR to consider 3D habitat effects in a wider variety of ecosystems and with more taxa to develop a better understanding of animal dynamics.",

In this study, we focus our attention on both the O2 A and B bands to investigate the effects of various aerosols on the behavior of the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) of light in the O2 A and B bands under different surface conditions. The Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM) is used to simulate the Stokes 4-vector elements and their Jacobians with respect to the aerosol optical and physical parameters. In order to select the most sensitive wavelengths, the concepts of ‘Degree of Freedom for Signal (DFS)’ are used to examine the sensitivities of individual wavelength in both O2 A and B bands. Our results indicate that polarization of light contains more aerosol vertical distribution information than that of intensity. And combining both O2 A and B bands, less number of channels are required used to retrieve the vertical distribution information.",

In the arctic, important perturbations that may result in departure from the current state of watersheds include gradual or catastrophic loss of permafrost, increasing temperature, and increased intensity of storms. However, these long-term changes are occurring against the backdrop of variation introduced by seasonality and storms. Thus, establishing baselines that capture temporal patterns is an essential step in predicting vulnerability of arctic watersheds to climate-induced change. We have documented temporal patterns in solute concentrations of six water tracks, zero-order channels that drain arctic hillslopes. Temporal patterns were typically site-specific, underscoring the value of watershed monitoring for predicting responses to perturbations. In some catchments, peak export of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus occurred during snowmelt, whereas in others, flushing during storms yielded greater export. Concentrations of non-limiting inorganic solutes (e.g., sulfate, calcium) increased through the thaw period in some catchments, suggesting that these solutes may serve as indicators of degrading permafrost. We observed a decrease in the magnitude of flushing of biolabile solutes (e.g., ammonium, organic carbon) during storms through the thaw season, reflecting hydrologic disconnection of upper, organic soils as thaw depth increases and flowpaths deepen. The observed patterns establish a template of temporal variation against which future observations may be assessed to evaluate departures from a stable state.",

            "abstract": "Recent core formation models based on the metal–silicate partitioning of siderophile elements suggest that the Earth's core was formed by metal segregation at high pressure and high temperature in a deep magma ocean. It is also thought that the simultaneous solubility of silicon and oxygen in liquid iron are strongly enhanced at high pressure and high temperature, such that at the end of accretion the core was rich in both silicon and oxygen. Here we performed crystallization experiments on the Fe–Si binary and Fe–Si–O ternary systems up to core pressure in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. The starting material for the latter was a homogeneous mixture of fine-grain Fe-Si and SiO2 (<1 µm). We prepared cross sections of samples recovered from the DAC using a focused ion beam (FIB) and subsequently performed textural and chemical characterization with field-emission-type electron microprobe (FE-EPMA). Quenched liquid alloy was found at the hottest part coexisting with a solid phase (liquidus phase) at the periphery. These results combined with literature data on the melting phase relations in the Fe–FeO binary system demonstrate that the liquidus field of SiO2 is very wide at the Fe-rich portion of the Fe–Si–O ternary system at the core pressure range. It indicates that the original Fe–Si–O core liquid should have crystallized a large amount SiO2 until it lost either silicon or oxygen. The recent finding of high thermal conductivity of the core suggests that core thermal convection is difficult to sustain without extreme degrees of secular cooling. However, even for modest degrees of joint Si-O incorporation into the early core, the buoyancy released by crystallization of SiO2 is sufficient to overcome thermal stratification and sustain the geodynamo.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) nucleated at 24 km depth along the plate boundary. Before the earthquake, episodic tremor and slip occurred on a shallow portion (less than 20 km depth) in the Tohoku subduction zone (Kato et al., 2012; Ito et al., 2013, 2015). Although slow earthquakes often occur outside the conventional seismogenic zone in subduction settings (e.g., Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007), recent slow slip events within the seismogenic zone seem to precede some large subduction earthquakes. To understand such behaviour within the Tohoku subduction zone, it is important to determine the frictional properties of the corresponding fault rocks. With this aim, we conducted friction experiments on powdered samples of blueschist rocks, which are expected to be present at depth within the Tohoku subduction zone, employing (near) in-situ pressure and temperature conditions. Simulated gouges were sheared at temperatures of 22-400oC, effective normal stresses of 25-200 MPa and pore fluid pressures of 25-200 MPa. We conducted velocity-stepping sequences (0.1 to 100 μm/s) to determine the rate and state friction parameter (a-b), focusing on the effect of effective normal stress on (a-b) to elucidate how this may affects the fault motion.\nOur results show that at most conditions studied, (a-b) tends to decreases from positive to negative values with decreasing effective normal stress. However, neutral to negative (a-b) values were observed at a temperature of 200oC over the entire effective normal stress range tested. Observed (a-b) values decrease with decreasing effective normal stress because of an increase in b with decreasing effective normal stress. Thus, the rate parameter (a-b) is significantly dependent on effective normal stress at all temperatures investigated, except 200oC. Our experimental findings imply that low effective normal stresses, therefore high pore fluid pressures, promote negative values of (a-b) and hence the potential to nucleate a frictional instability, leading to both slow slip events and earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Storage-discharge relation is a fundamental characteristic of a watershed. Several methods have been presented in literature to derive the storage-discharge relation based on recession period streamflow data. However, the relative performance of these methods for capturing the storage-discharge relation, which can be used to reconstruct the streamflow time series is not known. Basso et al., [2015] made headway in this direction by comparing three methods for reconstructing streamflow probability distribution. In this study, we inter-compare the performance of four methods for deriving storage-discharge relation. All four methods were applied in more than 40 rain-dominated watersheds in the U.S., and their performances were evaluated by assessing the accuracy of reconstructed streamflow time series. Results indicate that two of the four methods generally outperform the others in the studied watersheds. In addition, the derived storage-discharge relationship is found to be very sensitive to the parameters used in each method, hence one needs to adjust parameters to optimize the performance of each method. Results also indicate that simulated streamflow time series using the derived storage-discharge relation generally captures the overall probability distribution of streamflow, even when the temporal distribution of streamflow magnitudes are not well captured. This suggests that derived storage-discharge relations based on recession periods can not always be used to reconstruct streamflow time series.",

            "abstract": "The ability to predict surface water temperature is essential toward understanding how future climate scenarios will impact inland water bodies such as lakes. Numerous predictive models have been developed to perform this task although many require inputs whose future model prediction is usually associated with large uncertainties, such as e.g., precipitation, cloudiness, wind and radiative fluxes. Conversely, air temperature is one of the most widely available variables in projections from Global Climate Models (GCMs). The predictive model air2water relies solely on air temperature data to predict lake surface temperature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that air2water can be used as a predictive tool for climate change scenarios through a case study focused on Lake Tahoe, CA/NV, USA. Lake Tahoe has been selected due to extensive historical in-situ measurements that have been collected at that location since 1967 which we utilize to calibrate and validate air2water, and evaluate its performance. For model runs, we utilize different sources of air temperature data (buoys, land-based weather stations, GCMs) to establish how robustly air2water performs. We employ air temperature data from a combination of global gridded datasets including Climate Research Unit (CRU) TS3.21 (historical), and GCM output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) model (future) with representative concentration pathways of 4.5 and 8.5. Here, we present results from air2water predictions of the relationship between air and water temperature that demonstrate how this model is able to replicate trends on seasonal and interannual timescales. This finding shows promise toward understanding the impacts of future climate change on lakes and to expanding our study to lake surface temperatures globally.",

Mineral physics studies suggest that wavespeed and density jumps across the discontinuities are associated with olivine phase transformations and the depths at which the phase transformations occur are strongly dependent on temperature. Imaging lateral variations of the discontinuity depths is important for constraining thermal structure in the mid mantle. SS precursors (SdS) are waves reflected at the underside of the discontinuities and arrive beforethe SS phase. Their traveltime measurements at teleseismic distances can be used to map the discontinuities at a global scale. In this study, we measure frequency-dependent SS precursors traveltimes using seismograms recorded at GSN stations for earthquakes occurred between 2000 and 2015. The measurements were made using cosine tapers and multitapers and the traveltimes show significant dispersion. We calculate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels for SdS-SS differential measurements based on traveling-wave mode summation, which account for complete wave interactions within the measurement window. We will discuss preliminary results from finite-frequency imaging using SdS-SS dispersion measurements and the effects of 3-D crustal structure and mantle wavespeed structure.",

Knowing slip rates and earthquake recurrence intervals of these faults is key to better quantification of that hazard. However, estimates of slip rates along the fault system remain poorly constrained.\nHere we report a preliminary estimate of the slip rate across the fault system from available campaign GPS velocities. We projected the horizontal GPS velocity vectors relative to the Sunda block reference frame perpendicular to the general strike (~ 240°) of the sinistral faults. The velocity profile shows a gradient of ~ 9 mm/yr over a distance of ~ 550 km that crosses 8 faults, from the Dayingjiang fault in the northwest to the Mengxing fault in the southeast. This suggests the average slip rate across each fault in the system is ~ 1 mm/yr. The 9 mm/yr of GPS velocity gradient across the fault system, however, is only half of the long-term rates determined from offsets of major rivers, ridges and plutons. These geological determinations suffer, however, from poor dating constraints. The discrepancy between the geodetic and geological analyses highlights the need of reliable constraints on slip rates along each of the faults. We have begun field work aimed at determining the slip rate of one of these, the Jinghong fault.",

Precipitation and wet deposition measurements at 151 sites of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network and the NINO3.4 SST climate index from the NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center are analyzed to determine the impacts of the ENSO on N wet deposition and precipitation rates in the continental U.S. Precipitation and N wet deposition time series are dominated by high frequency components; however, they contain a wide range of inter-annual frequency components depending on the location. At the 2-to 6-year timescale, variability of precipitation and N wet deposition rates in the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the Gulf States, the Northeast, and the Great Lakes regions are correlated with that of the NINO3.4 index (r2= 0.09-0.59 for precipitation and r2= 0.09-0.52 for N wet deposition, p<0.05).\nThe spatial patterns and strength of the correlations vary by region and season. The correlations are the strongest and most spatially extensive during winter; 46-62% and 46-53% of the 2- to 6-year variability of precipitation and N wet deposition rates in the Rocky Mountains, the Gulf of Mexico, and near the Great Lakes can be explained by ENSO activity. The wintertime relationships tend to hold through springtime in the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Valley, and the Northeast. During the El Niño winters and springs, N wet deposition rates are higher than normal (greater than the 70thpercentile) in the southern Great Plains and the Gulf Coast. Winter and spring La Niña episodes bring precipitation and N wet deposition rates above normal over the Cascades, the Ohio River Valley, the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions.\nThe ensemble mean of eleven coupled General Circulation Models (Yeh et al., 2009) shows that the weak ENSO cycles, having small to moderate amplitudes and reoccurring in shorter time intervals, are projected to dominate in the 21th century, implying that total N (dry and wet) deposition rates in some regions of the U.S. may increase due to increased N wet deposition from more frequent ENSO events. Continuing work includes analysis of total N deposition with climate variability at the intra-annual time scale to help explain total N deposition variability.",

In this study, we investigate the use of ambient seismic noise recorded at selected broadband USArray EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) stations to obtain effective reflection seismograms for frequencies up to 1 Hz. The goal is to determine the most suitable parameters used for the processing of ambient seismic noise for the identification of crustal and upper mantle reflections and to minimize unwanted artifacts in the noise correlations. In order to best retrieve the body-wave components of the Green’s function beneath a station, a number of processing steps are required. We first remove the instrument response and apply a temporal normalization to remove the effects of the most energetic sources. Next we implement spectral whitening. We test several operators for the spectral whitening where the undulations of the power spectrum are related to the strengths of later arrivals in the auto-correlation. Different filters are then applied to the auto-correlation functions, including Gaussian and zero phase Butterworth filters, in order to reduce the effect of side lobes. Hourly auto-correlations are then stacked for up to one year. On the final stack, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is applied to equalize the correlation amplitudes in the time domain. The robustness of the resulting ambient noise auto-correlation is first tested on selected TA stations in Nevada, where we are able to identify PmP and SmS arrivals similar to those found by Tibuleac and von Seggern (2012). We then investigate noise auto-correlations applied to selected USArray TA stations in the central US.",

We examine the coupling and feedbacks between very high SSTs, which we refer to as SST hot spots above 30˚C, and deep convection, precipitation, large-scale dynamics, and the surface energy budget. Using extensive time series and hovmoller analyses in areas most favorable for hot spot formation - just south of the equator in the central Pacific, where SSTs > 30˚C for up to two months/year in one 20˚ longitude by 10˚ latitude box, we show that maximum large-scale ascent, deep convective cloud fraction, rain rates, and upward latent heat fluxes are observed during the decay stage of hot spots, during maximum -∂SST/∂t. Considered as part of a predator-prey system, convection preys on the hot spots until depleted, after which convection draws down and SSTs eventually rise again, illustrating the strongly coupled nature of the ocean-atmosphere system.\nThe nature of the relationship of SST and deep convection varies both as a function of time scale and SST window. Climatologically, deep convection, rain rate, and upward ω500 maximize at an SST of 30˚C over the tropics, approximately 1.5˚C above the SST peak. In contrast, (∂convection/∂SST)max corresponds to the climatological SST peak. Interannually, both the SST peak and the convection peak SST are highest during the 2009/2010 El Nino. At the synoptic scale, deep convection positively correlates most strongly with SST when SST leads by 5-20 days, but mostly during 70-day time windows that contain SSTs>30˚C, suggesting the importance of hot spots on convection and large-scale dynamics at synoptic to submonthly timescales. Synoptic ∂SST/∂t and convection are most strongly negatively correlated at zero-day lag, but only weakly correlated at longer time scales, unlike SSTmax and (deep convection)max, which are more strongly correlated. Vertically, both ω and anvil CF tilt with time at the synoptic scale, with mid-level convection transitioning to deep convection with tops as cold as ~200 K in days. Our analysis demonstrates the coupling of SSTs and deep convection, large-scale dynamics, and the surface energy budget from the synoptic to annual scale continuum.",

To compare and correlate spatial variation of vegetation with satellite data, we collected leaf area index (LAI) and hyperspectral reflectance data in Council, Alaska. To better understand canopy structure and functional variables, we further examined arctic leaf traits by measuring C:N ratio, leaf mass area (LMA), chlorophyll content, and hyperspectral leaf optical properties. We obtained WorldView-2 Satellite data, which has 8 multispectral bands with 0.5 m resolution, centered on our study site. Preliminary results showed remarkable variation in spectral reflectance and LAI across three 100-m transects.

            "abstract": "Microseismicity provides a direct means of measuring the physical characteristics of active tectonic features such as fault zones. Thousands of microquakes are often associated with an active site. This cloud of microseismicity helps define the tectonically active region. When processed using novel geophysical techniques, we can isolate the energy sensitive to the faulting region, itself.\nThe virtual seismometer method (VSM) is a technique of seismic interferometry that provides precise estimates of the GF between earthquakes. In many ways the converse of ambient noise correlation, it is very sensitive to the source parameters (location, mechanism and magnitude) and to the Earth structure in the source region. In a region with 1000 microseisms, we can calculate roughly 500,000 waveforms sampling the active zone. At the same time, VSM collapses the computation domain down to the size of the cloud of microseismicity, often by 2-3 orders of magnitude.\nIn simple terms VSM involves correlating the waveforms from a pair of events recorded at an individual station and then stacking the results over all stations to obtain the final result. In the far-field, when most of the stations in a network fall along a line between the two events, the result is an estimate of the GF between the two, modified by the source terms. In this geometry each earthquake is effectively a virtual seismometer recording all the others. When applied to microquakes, this alignment is often not met, and we also need to address the effects of the geometry between the two microquakes relative to each seismometer. Nonetheless, the technique is quite robust, and highly sensitive to the microseismic cloud.\nUsing data from the Salton Sea geothermal region, we demonstrate the power of the technique, illustrating our ability to scale the technique from the far-field, where sources are well separated, to the near field where their locations fall within each other's uncertainty ellipse. VSM provides better illumination of the complex subsurface by generating precise, high frequency estimates of the GF and resolution of seismic properties between every pair of events.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344",

Geothermal power generation, hot springs heat power generation, and steam power generation, are developing in hot spring areas in Ring of Fire countries including Japan, as renewable and sustainable energy. Impacts of the wasted hot water after using hot springs heat and steam power generation on ecosystem in the rivers have been observed in Beppu, Oita prefecture, Japan. The number of the fish species with wasted hot water in the Hirata river is much less than that without wasted hot water in Hiyakawa river although the dominant species of tilapia was found in the Hirata river with wasted hot water. The water temperature in Hirata rive is increased by wasted hot water by 10 degree C. The impacts of the developments of steam power generations on hot spring water and groundwater in downstream are also evaluated in Beppu. The decreases in temperature and volume of the hot spring water and groundwater after the development are concerning. Stakeholder analysis related to hot spa and power generation business and others in Beppu showed common interests in community development among stakeholders and gaps in prerequisite knowledge and recognition of the geothermal resource in terms of economic/non-economic value and utilization as power generation/hot-spring. We screened stakeholders of four categories (hot spring resorts inhabitants, industries, supporters, environmentalists), and set up three communities consisting of 50 persons of the above categories. One remarkable result regarding the pros and cons of geothermal power in general terms was that the supporter count increased greatly while the neutralities count decreased greatly after deliberation, suggesting a response from providing scientific evidence on the issue.",

            "abstract": "For flood prediction, weather radar has been commonly employed to measure the amount of precipitation and its spatial distribution. However, estimated rainfall from the radar contains uncertainty caused by its errors such as beam blockage and ground clutter. Even though, previous studies have been focused on removing error of radar data, it is crucial to evaluate runoff volumes which are influenced primarily by the radar errors. Furthermore, resolution of rainfall modeled by previous studies for rainfall uncertainty analysis or distributed hydrological simulation are quite coarse to apply to real application. Therefore, in the current study, we tested the effects of radar rainfall errors on rainfall runoff with a high resolution approach, called spatial error model (SEM). In the current study, the synthetic generation of random and cross-correlated radar errors were employed as SEM. A number of events for the Nam River dam region were tested to investigate the peak discharge from a basin according to error variance. The results indicate that the dependent error brings much higher variations in peak discharge than the independent random error. To further investigate the effect of the magnitude of cross-correlation between radar errors, the different magnitudes of spatial cross-correlations were employed for the rainfall-runoff simulation. The results demonstrate that the stronger correlation leads to higher variation of peak discharge and vice versa. We conclude that the error structure in radar rainfall estimates significantly affects on predicting the runoff peak. Therefore, the efforts must take into consideration on not only removing radar rainfall error itself but also weakening the cross-correlation structure of radar errors in order to forecast flood events more accurately.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant from a Strategic Research Project (Development of Flood Warning and Snowfall Estimation Platform Using Hydrological Radars), which was funded by the Korea Institute of Construction Technology.

            "abstract": "The Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ), located along the St. Lawrence River (SLR) ~100 km downstream from Quebec City, is the most active seismic zone in eastern Canada with five historic earthquakes of M 6-7 and ~ 200 events/year reported by the Canadian National Seismograph Network. Cataloged earthquake epicenters outline two broad linear zones along the SLR with little shallow seismicity in between. Earthquakes form diffuse clusters between major dipping faults rather than concentrating on fault planes. Detailed fault geometry in the CSZ is uncertain and the effect on local seismicity of a meteorite impact structure that overprints the paleorift faults remains ambiguous.\nHere we relocate 1639 earthquakes occurring in the CSZ between 01/1988 – 10/2010 using the double-difference relocation method HypoDD and waveforms primarily from 7 local permanent stations. We use the layered SLR north shore velocity model from Lamontagne (1999), and travel time differences based on both catalog and cross-correlated P and S-phase picks. Of the 1639 relocated earthquakes, 1236 (75.4%) satisfied selection criteria of horizontal and vertical errors less than 2 km and 1 km respectively. Cross-sections of relocated seismicity show hypocenters along distinct active fault segments. Earthquakes located beneath the north shore of the SLR are likely correlated with the NW Gouffre fault, forming a ~10 km wide seismic zone parallel to the river, with dip angle changing to near vertical at the northern edge of the impact zone. In contrast, seismicity beneath the SLR forms a diffuse cloud within the impact structure, likely representing a highly fractured volume. It further implies that faults could be locally weak and subject to high pore-fluid pressures. Seismicity outside the impact structure defines linear structures aligning with the Charlevoix fault. Relocated events of M > 4 all locate outside the impact structure, indicating they nucleated on the NE-SW-oriented paleorift faults.",

Intermodel spread in projected rainfall change reaches maximum in the tropics where the rainfall response to global warming is large. Moisture budget analyses reveal that much of the model uncertainty in tropical rainfall change originates from intermodel discrepancies in the dynamical contribution due to the atmospheric circulation change. Intermodel Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analyses further show a tight coupling between the intermodel variations in tropical SST warming pattern and circulation change. Organized into two robust modes: one is a interhemispheric asymmetric mode and the other is an equatorial peak mode. It is also found that these two uncertainty modes exert a strong control on the spread of changes in tropical cloud cover and cloud radiative effect among models, implying the importance of studying underlying mechanisms for the intermodel variability in tropical circulation change. Indeed, the intermodel differences in interhemispheric asymmetry of extratropical cloud radiative flux change at the top of the atmosphere are suggested to contribute to the tropical interhemispheric asymmetric mode. The Hadley circulation change and wind-evaporation-SST feedback may aid the tropical adjustments to extratropical radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Since the density of the outer core deduced from seismic data is about 10% lower than that of pure iron at core pressures and temperatures (P-T), it is widely believed that the outer core includes one or more light elements. Although intensive experimental and theoretical studies have been performed so far, the light element in the core has not yet been identified. Comparison of the density and sound velocity of liquid iron alloys with observations, such as the PREM, is a promising way to determine the species and quantity of light alloying component(s) in the outer core. Here we report the results of a first-principles molecular dynamics study on liquid iron alloyed with hydrogen, one of candidates of the light elements. Hydrogen had been much less studied than other candidates. However, hydrogen has been known to reduce the melting temperature of Fe-H solid [1]. Furthermore, very recently, Nomura et al. argued that the outer core may include 24 at.% H in order to be molten under relatively low temperature (< 3600 K) [2]. Since then hydrogen has attracted strong interests. We clarify the effects of hydrogen on density and sound velocity of liquid iron alloys under outer core P-T conditions. It is shown that ~1 wt% hydrogen can reproduce PREM density and sound velocity simultaneously very well. In addition, we show the presence of hydrogen rather reduces Gruneisen parameters. It indicates that, if hydrogen exists in the outer core, temperature profile of the outer core could be changed considerably from one estimated so far.\n[1] Sakamaki, K., E. Takahashi, Y.

            "abstract": "Kinematic GNSS analysis is useful for extraction of the crustal deformation phenomena between seconds to one day such as coseismic and postseismic deformation after a large earthquake. The kinematic GNSS analysis, however, have fundamental difficulties for the separation between unknown parameters such as the site coordinate and tropospheric parameters, caused by a strong correlation between each other. Thus, we focused on the improvement of the separation precision between coordinate time series of kinematic PPP and wet zenith tropospheric delay (WZTD) based on the comprehensive search of the parameter space.\nWe used GIPSY-OASIS II Ver. 6.3 software for kinematic PPP processing of whole GEONET sites in 10 March 2011. We applied the every 6 hours nominal WZTD value as a priori information based on the ECMWF global numerical climate model. For the coordinate time series and tropospheric parameters, we assumed white noise and random walk stochastic process, respectively. These unknown parameters are very sensitive to assumed process noise for each stochastic process. Thus, we searched for the optimum two variable parameters; wet zenith tropospheric parameter (named as TROP) and its gradient (named as GRAD). We defined the optimum parameters, which minimized the standard deviation of coordinate time series.\nWe firstly checked the spatial distribution of optimum pair of TROP and GRAD. Even though the optimum parameters showed the certain range (TROP: 2×10-8 ~ 6×10-7 (horizontal), 5.5×10-9 ~ 2×10-8 (vertical); GRAD: 2×10-10 ~ 6×10-9 (horizontal), 2×10-10 ~ 1×10-8 (vertical) (unit: km·s-½)), we found they showed the large diversity. It suggests there are strong heterogeneity of atmospheric state. We also estimated temporal variations of optimum TROP and GRAD in specific site. We analyzed the data through 2010 at GEONET 940098 station located in the most southern part of Kyusyu, Japan. Obtained time series of optimum GRAD showed clear annual variation, and the time series of optimum TROP especially estimated from vertical component showed a constant value (~2×10-8). The annual variation of optimum GRAD may represent that there is a strong variability of vapor distribution through the year. Taking these results into account, we can get the optimum parameters in advance at each station for routine GNSS analysis.",

This simulation showed remarkable decreases in the ultra-relativistic (6 – 9 MeV) electron flux during the storm event, compared to those without EMIC waves. Furthermore, the ultra-relativistic (3 – 9 MeV) electron flux with EMIC waves corresponds very well with those observed from SAMPEX spacecraft. EMIC waves increased pitch angle anisotropy of the ultra-relativistic electron flux on the electron drift path. Thus, EMIC waves mainly lead to non-adiabatic dropout of relativistic electron flux.",

In particular, extreme drought events are likely to have the most pronounced and negative impact on biodiversity (Tilman and El haddi 1992), carbon storage (Ciais et al. 2005) and cycling (Reichstein et al. 2013). As a consequence, an expressed need has been for a next generation of experiments designed to elucidate the causes and consequences of ecosystem sensitivity to drought (Smith 2011, Reichstein et al. 2013). A recent analysis of the 2012 U.S. Southwest drought revealed different sensitivities in primary production across five grassland ecosystems positioned along a precipitation gradient, with the most mesic (wet) grassland less sensitive than the most xeric (dry) grassland (Knapp et al. 2015). While this analysis suggests increasing sensitivity to drought with decreasing mean annual precipitation (MAP), an understanding of the relative roles of the abiotic (e.g., resource availability) and biotic (e.g., species identity) ecosystem components in driving this sensitivity trend is unclear. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a soil moisture manipulation study using the dominant grass species from the tallgrass prairie (892mm MAP), the shortgrass steppe (372mm MAP), and desert grassland (246mm MAP). The study imposed a “dry-down” to four target levels of volumetric soil water content at 25%, 20%, 15% and 10% to simulate different drought intensities. Each plant species experienced identical levels of water availability, with environmental conditions such as soil resource supply and temperature also held constant. Thus, this study allowed us to isolate each species sensitivity to water availability without confounding environmental differences. Measurements included growth rates of stem outputs and photosynthetically active leaves, maximum carbon assimilation, above and belowground net primary production. In total, the proposed application of this study is to contribute towards an understanding of the determinants of grassland ecosystem sensitivity to drought, with the underlying assumption that the responses of dominant plant species will largely determine ecosystem responses to contemporary and future climate change.",

Takahe) and Northern Victoria Land (Mt. Melbourne and the Pleiades). Although many tephra from these volcanoes are likely to be widely distributed, a number are only identified in a single core or blue ice site. For instance, the distinctive 8.2ka tephra layer, correlated to Mt. Takahe, can be found as a visible layer in the WAIS and Siple Dome ice cores and in a blue ice area at Mt. Waesche, but, surprisingly, is absent from the RICE core. In some cases, two ice cores only 100m apart may have slightly different tephra records, suggesting non-uniform preservation of tephra. Some of these tephra layers are found in multiple cores and blue ice sites, providing insight into the tephra distribution pattern and precise chronological links between multiple climate records. One prominent regional tephra layer, with a WAIS age of 1252C.E., is found in East (Taylor Dome (Dunbar, 2003) and Talos Dome (Narcisi et al., 2012)) and West (WAIS, Siple Dome (Dunbar and Kurbatov, 2011) and RICE) Antarctic ice cores. This layer, linked to the Pleiades, provides a widespread and unambiguous tie point and exhibits a complex range of trace element composition that may provide information about travel direction of the ash cloud through the duration of the eruption. Many important marker layers are extra-continental tephra from South America and New Zealand and have more distinctive chemistry than the local alkaline volcanoes. One layer is the recently identified Oruanui tephra in the WAIS Divide ice core. This layer is well dated in New Zealand by 14C (25,360 ±160 cal. yrs B.P) (Vandergoes et al., 2013) and is statistically the same as the modeled ice core age (25,318±380 yrs). Correlations like the Oruanui tephra can now provide links between the terrestrial, marine and ice sheet climate records from Antarctica to New Zealand.",

Two quantitative models based on the stress-shadow concept, which is widely used for explaining extensional-joint spacing, are proposed in this study: (1) an empirically based stress-rise-function model that simulates the brittle-deformation process during the formation of evenly spaced parallel strike-slip faults, and (2) an elastic plate model that relates fault spacing to the thickness of the fault-hosting elastic plate. When applying the models for the initiation and development of the tiger-stripe fractures (TSF) in the South Polar Terrain (SPT) of Enceladus, the mutually consistent solutions of the two models, as constrained by the mean spacing of the TSF at ~35 km, requires that the brittle ice-shell thickness be < 30 km and most likely in the range of 6-7 km, and the elastic ice-shell thickness be 0.7-3.5 km in the SPT. Modeling the TSF spacing also requires that the cohesive strength of the SPT ice shell be 30 kPa, much lower than the experimentally determined cohesive strength of 1.7-5.7 MPa under the laboratory conditions.",

            "abstract": "This work explores a new approach to quantify cool-season mid-latitude circulation dynamics as they relate western US streamflow variability and drought. This information is used to probabilistically associate patterns of synoptic atmospheric circulation with spatial patterns of drought in western US streamflow. Cool-season storms transport moisture from the Pacific Ocean and are a primary source for western US streamflow. Studies overthe past several decades have emphasized that the western US hydroclimate is influenced by the intensity and phasing of ocean and atmosphere dynamics and teleconnections, such as ENSO and North Pacific variability. These complex interactions are realized in atmospheric circulation along the west coast of North America. The region’s atmospheric circulation can encourage a preferential flow in winter storm tracks from the Pacific, and thus influence the moisture conditions of a given river basin over the course of the cool season. These dynamics have traditionally been measured with atmospheric indices based on values from fixed points in space or principal component loadings. This study uses collective search agents to quantify the position and intensity of potentially non-stationary atmosphere features in climate reanalysis datasets, relative to regional hydrology. Results underline the spatio-temporal relationship between semi-permanent atmosphere characteristics and naturalized streamflow from major river basins of the western US. A probabilistic graphical model quantifies this relationship while accounting for uncertainty from noisy climate processes, and eventually, limitations from dataset length. This creates probabilities for semi-permanent atmosphere features which we hope to associate with extreme droughts of the paleo record, based on our understanding of atmosphere-streamflow relations observed in the instrumental record.",

We compare GRACE-DSI with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and other ancillary data to characterize drought timing, evolution and magnitude in the continental US since 2002. Overall GRACE-DSI and PDSI show an excellent correspondence in the US. However PDSI is very sensitive to atmospheric moisture stress, while GRACE-DSI only responds to changes in terrestrial water storage. We use the complementary nature of these two indices together with temperature and precipitation observations to characterize drought evolution and its nature. For instance, during the 2012 flash drought in the Great Plains, the PDSI decreases several months earlier than the GRACE-DSI in response to the enhanced atmosphere moisture demand caused by unusual early season warming. When the drought peaks later in the summer, the PDSI indicates exceptional drought, while the GRACE-DSI observes moderate drought conditions in the underlying total water supply, implying a meteorological drought in nature.\nGRACE-DSI is based solely on satellite observations; hence it has the advantage of not being affected by uncertainty associated with variable that are not well known at the global scale (e.g. precipitation estimates) and by biases associated to global climate model outputs. We find that GRACE-DSI captures major drought events in the globe occurring during 2002-2015, including those in sub-Sahara Africa, Australia, Amazon, Asia, North America and the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The Weddell Sea receives sediment from both East and West Antarctica and records cryospheric changes in both ice sheets. Examination of Pliocene sediment from two ODP Sites (693 and 697) provides a history of ice rafted detritus (IRD), biosilica production and orbital pacing. Age dating at both sites is limited to shipboard biostratigraphy and paleomagnetics, yielding low age resolution. Using this age data we have attempted to correlate sedimentary changes with the LR04 benthic stack to provide a context with global oceanographic changes.\nSite 693 is adjacent to Dronning Maud Land on a shelf bench in 2480 m water and receives sediment exclusively from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Detailed analysis of Core 8R, (approximately 1 sample/2-3 kyr) within Chron 2Ar (3.58-4.18 my) shows little variation in wt% biosilica and wt% IRD (fraction >63um). The exception is around 4 Ma when IRD is relatively constant at 2 wt%, while biosilica ranges 6 to 14%. These changes do not parallel the LR04 stack, suggesting limited interaction at this site with the global ocean. 40Ar/39Ar dating of hornblendes and biotites give a consistent age between 400-650 Ma (Pan African orogeny). The limited age range and composition, as well as small variation in % of IRD and biosilica suggest a single source and support the interpretation that this portion of the EAIS was relatively stable at this time.\nSite 697, in 3480 m water, lies in the Jane Basin, adjacent to the South Orkney Islands. The interval between 3.0 and 3.8 Ma has higher variation in both IRD (1-13%) and biosilica (2-12%) than Site 693, an expected outcome because its terrigeneous sediment source is dominated by the less stable West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Clear obliquity pacing, correlateable with part of the LR04 stack, is observed. However after 3.3 Ma, near the beginning of the Pliocene warm period, wt% IRD is less than 2% and biosilica increases to it’s highest values. This suggests that few icebergs are reaching this far north and that conditions are amenable to high productivity. At both sites the highest biosilica content is where the wt% IRD is the lowest, suggesting no or limited ice and high productivity.",

            "abstract": "The geoelectrical behavior of blind fault zones has been studied by different authors at decametric-to-kilometric scales, and inferred to reveal the dimensions of the main structural domains of a fault zone (core vs. damage zone). However, there is still a lack in the application of electrical methods in exposed fault zones, despite the importance of validating the inferences based on electrical measurements with direct geologic observation. In this study we correlate the results of structural mapping and geoelectrical measurements in two metric-scale, very well exposed segments of the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS) and the Arc-oblique Long-lived Fault System (ALFS), Southern Andes. The LOFS is an active dextral and dextral-normal ca. 1200-km-long Cenozoic intra-arc structure that strikes NNE to NE. Although the LOFS and the ALFS cross-cut each other, the ALFS is an apparently older basement NW-striking fault system where mainly sinistral movement is recorded. Two 22-m-long transects were mapped revealing in both examples a simple core and an assymetric damage zone with more frequency of fractures in the hanging wall than in the footwall. The LOFS outcrop showed a WNW-striking, 65°S-dipping core; the ALFS, a NW-striking, 60°SW-dipping core. A 2D direct-current electrical survey was made at each locality, orthogonal to the respective strike of the core. The field installation of the electrical survey used two electrode configurations for each outcrop: (1) electrodes were put in a vertical wall of rock, which gives a resistivity profile in plan view; and (2) electrodes were put in the ground, which gives a cross-section resistivity profile. The combined structural and electrical results suggest that: (1) it is possible to discriminate the geoelectrical response of the main metric-scale structural domains: the core and the fractured damage zones are relative conductors (20-200 ohm-m), whereas the less fractured damage zones are relative resistive volumes (500-1400 ohm-m); (2) geometrical and spatial information can be obtained from the geoelectrical response, specially in the case of the survey made in the vertical wall of rock. Our results provide direct proof that the electrical resisitivity methods can be used to characterize blind or exposed fault zones at least at a metric-to-decametric scale.",

The pre-logging forests of mid Appalachia were mainly comprised of large Quercus spp. and Liriodendron tulipiferia with Pinus rubens and Tsuga canadensis at higher elevations. These species have been supplanted by more mesic species such as Betula alleghaniensis and Acer rubrum. Within these forests, Rhododendron maximum is an abundant evergreen shrub that grows in dense thickets that can alter forest community structure, affect species diversity, lower decomposition rates, and affect forest carbon and nitrogen cycling through altering soil chemistry and physics. The spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of R. maximum within these forests, especially in the mid Appalachians, is not fully conceptualized. An increase in R. maximumspatial coverage could significantly affect basic forest ecosystem processes and be of interest to researchers and forest managers.\nUsing Landsat derived vegetation indices--including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Tasseled Cap Transformations--we quantified the expansion of R. maximum within a topographically complex watershed in West Virginia from 1986-2011. Our array of models show an initial shrub coverage (1986) in our target watershed of between 27.7 - 36.6% and a present-day shrub coverage (2011) of between 41.2 - 42.8%--with a range from 10.2 - 15.1% increase in shrub coverage over the 25 year study window. Averaged model output suggests an increase of 38.4 ha from 1986 to 2011 and a mean NDVI increase of 0.076 for the entire watershed.

Basins that developed during the time contain a record of the diversification of eukaryotic life as well as large-scale changes to the carbon cycle and paleogeography during the period leading up to Cryogenian glaciation. Understanding global change leading up to Cryogenian glaciation is key for interpreting the boundary conditions that resulted in the beginning of dramatic climate and geochemical oscillations during this critical interval. Existing age models for Neoproterozoic nonglacial intervals, such as the time leading up to Cryogenian glaciation, largely have been based on correlation of carbonate\nδ\n13\nC values, but there are few tests of the assumed synchroneity of these records between basins. In contrast to the ash-poor successions typically targeted for Neoproterozoic chemostratigraphy, the Tonian to Cryogenian Tambien Group (Tigray region, Ethiopia) was deposited in an arc-proximal basin where volcanic tuffs suitable for U-Pb geochronology are preserved within the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary succession. We use physical and isotopic stratigraphic data sets from Tambien Group sedimentary rocks in concert with high-precision U-Pb dates from intercalated tuffs to establish global synchroneity of large scale carbon isotopic change. These new temporal constraints strengthen the case for interpreting Neoproterozoic carbon isotope variation as a record of large-scale changes to the carbon cycle. Furthermore, these dates strengthen the temporal framework for interpreting paleogeographic change, geochemical cycling, and environmental evolution during the radiation of early eukaryotes.",

It has long been recognized that this process is scale dependent, which may have fundamental impact on water resources distribution and ecosystem sustainability in these regions. Recent studies have disclosed complex feedbacks between rainfall, vegetation patches, microtopography and layered soil characteristics in semi-arid ecosystems. The interactions, however, may also affect the scaling of the process. To quantitatively study the impact of vegetation and rainfall properties on the scaling of the rainfall-runoff process, a modeling approach coupling a two-dimensional surface runoff model and a two-layer conceptual inﬁltration model was employed. Having been validated in a semi-arid field plot in the Lehavim LTER in Southern Israel, the model was applied to a series of plots of varying scales with statistically identical distributions of land surface properties to examine the vegetation and rainfall impact. The approach provides a basis of comparison for the hydrological responses at various scales. Influences of regular and random vegetation patterns were compared with the Monte Carlo simulation approach. Also examined are the influences of rainfall intensity and rainfall temporal variability. Results show that these impacting factors affect the spatial distribution of infiltration, local as well as global runoff generation at all scales.

The frequency band of ambient noise provides complimentary data and added resolution to the deeper volcanic structures when compared to traditional tomography based on local earthquakes. The Llaima Volcano (38° 41.9' S and 71° 43.8' W) is a stratovolcano of basaltic-andesitic composition. Llaima is located in the South Volcanic Zone (ZVS) of the Andes and is listed as one of the most active volcanoes in South America, with a long documented historical record dating back to 1640. Llaima experienced violent eruptions in 1927 and 1957 (Naranjo and Moreno, 1991), and its last eruptive cycle (2008-2010) is considered the most important after the 1957 eruption.\nLacking seismic constraints on the deep structure under Llaima, petrologic data have suggested the presence of magmatic bodies (dikes). These bodies likely play an important role in the eruptive dynamics of Llaima (Bouvet de Maisonneuve, C., et al 2012). Analysis of the 2008-2010 seismicity shows a southern zone (approx. 15 km from the Llaima summit) where there were many Very Long Period events occurring prior to the eruptions. This is in agreement with a deformation zone determined by InSAR analysis (Fournier et al, 2010 and Bathke, 2011), but no geologic model based on geophysical imaging has been created yet.\nBeginning in 2009, staff from the Chilean Geological Survey (SERNAGEOMIN) started to install a permanent seismic network consisting of nine stations. These nine stations have allowed Chilean seismologists to closely monitor the activity at Llaima, but prevented a high-resolution tomographic imaging study. During the summer of 2015, a temporary seismic network consisting of 26 stations was installed around Llaima. In the work presented here, we analyze continuous waveforms recorded between January and April 2015 from a total of 35 broadband stations (permanent and temporary). This network covers the total area of Llaima and provides the first study aimed at revealing the volcanic structure of Llaima. Moreover this is one of the first attempts to perform high resolution ANT at a Chilean volcano. We will present our tomography results and our first geologic interpretations of Llaima volcanic structure.",

This contribution is likely to increase in countries with intensive agricultural systems such as China (Zhou et al., 2014). yet the patterns, trends, and the associated causes of Chinese emissions remains subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China’s total agricultural soils N2O emissions at present varied by ~150% (Zhou et al., 2015). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of emission factors, nitrogen inputs, and the associated environmental conditions, yet none of previous estimates are based upon large-scale measurements and high-resolution activity data. Here, we re-quantify China’s N2O emissions from croplands from 1990 to 2012, including direct and indirect pathways, using updated and harmonized N input data, high-resolution environmental factors data, and a comprehensive dataset of global N2O observation networks. The spatially-variable emission factor, and leaching and runoff rates are derived by empirical upscaling of ground-based observations, but validated by ecosystem models and atmospheric inversions of N2O concentration data. N inputs, such as synthetic fertilizer, manure, crop residues, human excretion applied to croplands, are compiled at county-scale, and atmospheric N depositions are simulated by using LMDZ-OR-INCA atmospheric transport chemistry model that has been calibrated by Asian observation networks. We also develop the high-resolution datasets including landuse dynamics (1-km), SOC changes (0.1-deg), climates (0.1-deg), and irrigation rates (city-scale). Three main tasks have been performed in this study: i) the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of N2O emissions over China croplands from 1990 to 2012; ii) the attributions of anthropogenic causes of the spatial variations, interannual variability, temporal trends, and growth rates of China’s N2O emissions from croplands. Overall this study may broaden our knowledge of the nitrogen cycle model for agro-ecosystem, which is important for refining IPCC default values of emission factors and designing China’s N2O mitigation protocols.",

            "abstract": "It is sometimes not possible to find a single isotropic structure whose computed phase velocities fit both the experimental, fundamental-mode Love and Rayleigh wave data, for earth models that are perfectly elastic and are composed of thick, low contrast layers. Usually, velocity anisotropy of the body waves is applied to the earth models to fit the data. A few early studies used thin, high contrast layers in perfectly-elastic isotropic models to obtain approximate fit to the experimental data; here, we improve and expand this successful isotropic modelling by generalizing to realistic, anelastic layers, and by also requiring a fit to the fundamental-mode Love and Rayleigh wave amplitude-attenuation data.\nWe treat the Love and Rayleigh wave data from the central United States, where this Love-Rayleigh \"discrepancy\" was discovered by McEvilly. Using only the experimental phase-velocity data, with the insertion of a thin, high contrast LVZ in each of the granitic, basaltic-grabbroic, and olivine regions, we find a continuum of isotropic models that give successful fits to the experimental data. Then by adding experimental amplitude-attenuation to the data, we attempt to reduce this huge volume of isotropic solutions: with the three thin LVZs, we successfully restricted the solutions by simultaneously fitting the experimental data for both Love and Rayleigh wave, phase-velocity and amplitude-attenuation dispersions.\nHowever, in the solution the body-wave velocities and Q values of these thin layers are improbably low, and these single-layer LVZs can only be considered effective representations; the true, physical situation requires the replacement of any one of these single-layer LVZs by a vertical distribution of N layers, each having the same thickness as the original thin layer. A simple scaling of the single-layer, seismic velocities and Qs then provides completely reasonable values for these parameters in the N-layer representation (which yields the same successful fit to the experimental data).",

            "abstract": "The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is a multi-agency partnership supported by a multi-billion dollar investment by the US Environmental Protection Agency. One major focus outlined in the GLRI Action Plan is “reducing nutrient runoff that contributes to harmful/nuisance algal blooms.” For the past several years, the USDA Forest Service has engaged in a comprehensive assessment of the character and trends of landscapes in watersheds draining into the Great Lakes as a means of prioritizing agency investments targeting nutrient and sediment reductions. Assessments in the Lake Superior and Lake Michigan basins utilized existing inventory collected by the Forest Service, and landscape trends were extracted by processing Landsat Time Series Stacks (LTSS) using the methods outlined by Stueve et al. (2011) and validated according to the process described by Zimmerman et al. (2013). These data were combined with ancillary datasets and documented the link between land use and water quality in the Lake Superior and Lake Michigan basins (see Seilheimer et al. 2013). While the resulting models were useful at prioritizing investments in basins with water quality observations, the greater benefit was prioritizing investments in landscapes lacking water quality measurements. Having demonstrated the linkage between land and water quality in the western basins, we are now completing similar prioritizations of the eastern Great Lakes (Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario). The process is largely similar, but we are implementing the Forest Service’s novel Landscape Change Monitoring System to process the LTSS. This new approach offers improved estimates of land use and land cover change, noticeably reducing errors of both commission and omission. Taken together with existing ancillary data, we expect the linkages between land use and water quality to be even stronger, and the prioritizations of ungaged basins to be even more robust.",

A third ASI in Jicamarca, Peru (11.95° S, 76.87° W, 0.1° mag lat) provides context for the structures generated near the magnetic equator on the west coast of South America. The region sampled by these instruments covers from ~40° S to ~15° N and from ~ 80° W to ~65° W . The Jicamarca Radio Observatory has radar systems and other instruments that measure the upper atmosphere which, combined with the ASIs, allow us to uniquely study equatorial and low latitude processes. The ASIs are able to detect airglow depletions at 630 nm associated with equatorial spread F (ESF) that can also observed with coherent radar scatter measurements at Jicamarca. Simultaneous conjugate observations of ESF are compared to see how the large-scale structures behave at these locations. The ASIs are also used to look for a signature of the midnight temperature maximum (MTM) that is seen as an increase in brightness propagating poleward. Radar and Fabry-Perot interferometer data is used to measure this increase in temperature and combining them with the ASI data we will be able to probe the extent of MTM effects and investigate how they vary with latitude in both hemispheres.",

Such decisions are inherently associated with uncertainty, such as subjective judgement from decision makers and their implicit knowledge on selection of whether to supply water or reduce the amount of supplied water under the scenario of the contamination. A socio-dynamic model based on the theories of information-gap and fuzzy sets is being developed to address the social behaviors facing the groundwater contamination and applied to a synthetic problem designed based on typical groundwater remediation sites where the effects of social behaviors on decisions are investigated and analyzed.

It can require that volcano scientists facilitate learning opportunities for partners in emergency management who have little or no familiarity with eruption response. \nScientists and officials from Colombia and the Cascades region of the United States recognized that although separated by geographic and cultural distance, their communities faced similar hazards from lahars. For the purpose of sharing best practices, the 2013 Colombia-USA Bi-national Exchange was organized by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Washington Emergency Management Division, with support from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Nine Colombian emergency officials and scientists visited the U.S. to observe emergency response planning and protocols and to view the scale of a potential lahar disaster at Mount Rainier. Ten U.S. delegates visited Colombia to absorb best practices developed after the catastrophic 1985 eruption and lahars at Nevado del Ruiz. They observed the devastation and spoke with survivors, first responders, and emergency managers responsible for post-disaster recovery efforts.\nDelegates returned to their nations energized and with improved knowledge about volcanic crises and effective mitigation and response.

            "abstract": "We evaluate the accuracy of high-resolution tsunami inundation simulations in detail using the actual observational data of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw9.0) and investigate the methodologies to improve the simulation accuracy.\nDue to the recent development of parallel computing technologies, high-resolution tsunami inundation simulations are conducted more commonly than before. To evaluate how accurately these simulations can reproduce inundation processes, we test several types of simulation configurations on a parallel computer, where we can utilize the observational data (e.g., offshore and coastal waveforms and inundation properties) that are recorded during the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.\nBefore discussing the accuracy of inundation processes on land, the incident waves at coastal sites must be accurately estimated. However, for megathrust earthquakes, it is difficult to find the tsunami source that can provide accurate estimations of tsunami waveforms at every coastal site because of the complex spatiotemporal distribution of the source and the limitation of observation. To overcome this issue, we employ a site-specific source inversion approach that increases the estimation accuracy within a specific coastal site by applying appropriate weighting to the observational data in the inversion process.\nWe applied our source inversion technique to the Tohoku tsunami and conducted inundation simulations using 5-m resolution digital elevation model data (DEM) for the coastal area around Miyako Bay and Sendai Bay. The estimated waveforms at the coastal wave gauges of these bays successfully agree with the observed waveforms. However, the simulations overestimate the inundation extent indicating the necessity to improve the inundation model. We find that the value of Manning's roughness coefficient should be modified from the often-used value of n = 0.025 to n = 0.033 to obtain proper results at both cities.\nIn this presentation, the simulation results with several different model configurations will be introduced including the results from the models that incorporate building shape data. This will be followed by a discussion on how to improve the accuracy of the high-resolution inundation simulations.",

            "abstract": "Contrasting leaf types (needle vs. broadleaf) with different lifespans (annual vs. perennial) represent different adaptive strategies of plants under different environmental conditions. Previous studies explained adaptive advantages of different strategies using empirical models but cannot adequately explain the co-dominance of multiple plant functional types (PFTs) as observed in many parts of the world. Here we used a process-based model to explore whether observed inter- and intra-PFT variation in key plant traits can explain global biogeographic variation in co-dominance of major forest functional types.\nUsing a parameter screening method, we identified the four most important plant traits for simulating annual net primary production (NPP) using the Australian Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land Exchange model (CABLE). Using ensemble CABLE simulations, we estimated the fraction of global land cover attributed to each PFT by comparing the simulated NPP for all three PFTs at each land point, globally.\nOur results were consistent with land area cover fractions of major forest types estimated from remote sensing data products; i.e., evergreen needle-leaf forests dominate in boreal regions, evergreen broadleaf forests dominate in tropical regions, and deciduous broadleaf forests are distributed widely across a broad range of environmental conditions. More importantly our approach successfully explained a paradox that has puzzled ecologists for over a century: why evergreen leaf types dominate in both boreal and tropical regions.\nWe conclude that variation in and co-variation between key plant traits can explain significant fractions of global biogeographic variation of three major forest types, and should be taken into account when simulating global vegetation dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Warming of the Arctic has the potential for immense climatic feedbacks due to impacts on microbial respiration affecting soil carbon storage and consumption. The chemical composition of soil carries the signature of the source material and the subsequent processes that it underwent to their point of analysis. Therefore, by reading the molecular messages of the soil, we can glean more information about the fate of Arctic soils. In August 2013, we collected a series of active layer soil cores along a north-south transect from Deadhorse to just south of the Brooks Range to study the carbon accumulation and composition during the Holocene. Previously, this transect was shown to have different accumulation rates during the Holocene (Marion and Oechel, 1993). We applied geochemical parameters (total organic carbon and nitrogen, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, radiocarbon of bulk soil organic matter) as well as analyzed the lipid biomarkers (alkanes and other markers of degradation). For most cores along the north-south transect, there was a distinct and expected decrease in carbon, nitrogen and alkane concentration with depth. However, with depth there were systematic trends of a series of compounds typically used as biomarkers of organic matter maturity in the ancient rocks. While it is unlikely that these organic matter maturity compounds reflect ancient organic carbon in Arctic soils, we will discuss the compounds that reflect organic matter maturity further as they may be diagnostic of microbial degradation and/or other soil processes.",

            "abstract": "The fluxes-measuring sites that are part of AmeriFlux are operated and maintained in a fairly independent fashion, both in terms of scientific goals and operational practices. This is also the case for most sites from other networks in FLUXNET. This independence leads to a degree of heterogeneity in the data sets collected at the sites, which is also reflected in data quality levels. The generation of derived data products and data synthesis efforts, two of the main goals of these networks, are directly affected by the heterogeneity in data quality. In a collaborative effort between AmeriFlux and ICOS, a series of quality checks are being conducted for the data sets before any network-level data processing and product generation take place. From these checks, a set of common data issues were identified, and are being cataloged and classified into data quality patterns. These patterns are now being used as a basis for implementing automation for certain data quality checks, speeding up the process of applying the checks and evaluating the data. Currently, most data checks are performed individually in each data set, requiring visual inspection and inputs from a data curator. This manual process makes it difficult to scale the quality checks, creating a bottleneck for the data processing. One goal of the automated checks is to free up time of data curators so they can focus on new or less common issues. As new issues are identified, they can also be cataloged and classified, extending the coverage of existing patterns or potentially generating new patterns, helping both improve existing automated checks and create new ones. This approach is helping make data quality evaluation faster, more systematic, and reproducible. Furthermore, these patterns are also helping with documenting common causes and solutions for data problems. This can help tower teams with diagnosing problems in data collection and processing, and also in correcting historical data sets. In this presentation, using AmeriFlux fluxes and micrometeorological data, we discuss our approach to creating observational data patterns, and how we are using them to implement new automated checks. We also detail examples of these observational data patterns, illustrating how they are being used.",

            "abstract": "This study evaluates the sensitivity of black carbon (BC) concentration in snow in the Arctic to BC emissions, dry deposition and wet scavenging efficiency using a 3D global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem driven by meteorological field GEOS-5. With all improvements, simulated median BC concentration in snow agrees with observation (19.2 ng g-1) within 10%, down from -40% in the default GEOS-Chem. When the previously missed gas flaring emissions (mainly located in Russia) are included, the total BC emission in the Arctic increases by 70%. The simulated BC in snow increases by 1−7 ng g-1, with the largest improvement in Russia. The discrepancy of median BC in snow in the whole Arctic reduces from -40% to -20%. In addition, recent measurements of BC dry deposition velocity suggest that the constant deposition velocity of 0.03 cm s-1 over snow and ice used in the GEOS-Chem is too low. So we apply resistance-in-series method to calculate the dry deposition velocity over snow and ice and the resulted dry deposition velocity ranges from 0.03 to 0.24 cm s-1. However, the simulated total BC deposition flux in the Arctic and BC in snow does not change, because the increased dry deposition flux has been compensated by decreased wet deposition flux. However, the fraction of dry deposition to total deposition increases from 16% to 25%. This may affect the mixing of BC and snow particles and further affect the radative forcing of BC deposited in snow. Finally, we reduced the scavenging efficiency of BC in mixed-phase clouds to account for the effect of Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process based on recent observations. The simulated BC concentration in snow increases by 10−100%, with the largest increase in Greenland (100%), Tromsø (50%), Alaska (40%), and Canadian Arctic (30%). Annual BC loading in the Arctic increases from 0.25 to 0.43 mg m-2 and the lifetime of BC increases from 9.2 to 16.3 days. This indicates that BC simulation in the Arctic is really sensitive to the representation of BC scavenging efficiency. More measurements are needed to better understand the BC-cloud interaction and to constrain the model.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the environmental controls on Gross Ecosystem Exchange (GEE) at an aspen forest and a sagebrush shrubland in southwest Idaho. The two sites were situated within a mosaic of vegetation that included temperate deciduous trees, shrublands, and evergreen conifer trees. The distribution of vegetation was presumably linked to water availability; aspen were located in wetter high-elevations sites, topographic drainages, or near snow drifts. Local temperatures have increased by ~2-3 °C over the past 50 years and less precipitation has arrived as snow. These ongoing changes in weather may impact snow water redistribution, plant-water availability, and plant-thermal stress, with associated impacts on vegetation health and production. We used eddy covariance to measure the exchange of water and carbon dioxide above the two sites and partitioned the net carbon flux to determine GEE. The sagebrush record was from 2003-2007 and the aspen record was from 2007-12. The region experienced a modest-to-severe drought in 2007, with ~73% of typical precipitation. We found that aspen were local “hotspots” for carbon exchange; peak rates of aspen GEE were ~ 60% greater than the peak rates of sagebrush GEE. Light, temperature, and water availability were dominant controls on the seasonality of GEE at both sites. Sagebrush and aspen were dormant during winter, limited by cold temperatures during winter and early spring, and water availability during mid-late summer. The onset of summer drought was typically later in the aspen than in the sagebrush. Drifting snow, lateral water redistribution, or increased rooting depths may have increased water availability in the aspen stand. Seasonal patterns of observed soil moisture and evaporation indicated aspen were rooted to >= 1 m. The sagebrush and aspen both responded strongly to the 2007 drought; peak GEE decreased by ~75%, peak GEE shifted to earlier parts of the year, and mid-summer GEE was decreased. We consider potential climate change impacts.",

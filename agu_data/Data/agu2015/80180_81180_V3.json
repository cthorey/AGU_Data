A series of cut and fill PC are mapped in 3D multi-channel seismic (MCS) data and compared with multi-beam (MB) sonar bathymetry/backscatter data collected during the Galicia 3D survey with the R/V Marcus G. Langseth (2013). The MCS data were collected using four 6 km streamers spaced at 200 m resulting in 25 m x 25 m common mid-point bins within the ~67 km x 20 km 3D volume. The MB data were collected at an average depth of ~4900 m with a constrained swath width of 4.5 km resulting in 11.25x overlap while enabling 25-m bathymetry and 10-m backscatter grids. The PC lie below the mouth of a submarine canyon at the edge of the Galicia abyssal plain and cut pre/syn-rift sediments; they are bound by a rift block to the north and paleo-levees to the south (maximum height of ~180m). From drilling results, the most recent PC is late Miocene in age. In this study, four PC are traced into the basin as unconformities. Several of the PC/unconformities are tentatively correlated with previously interpreted Pyrenean orogeny/compressional Miocene/Oligocene tectonic events. However, one PC/unconformity within this interval has not been previously interpreted. In order test the hypothesis that the unconformities are the result of a significant change in base level indicated by a low shale/sand (SS) ratio, we use seismic surface attributes to calculate the SS ratio and trace the horizontal extent of the unconformities. Additionally, the MB/MCS seafloor morphology reveals sedimentary waves outboard of the canyon mouth. We use backscatter data to compare the extent of recent processes (e.g., Pleistocene glaciation/de-glaciation) with the unconformities by mapping the surface/shallow subsurface SS ratio (volume scattering).",

            "abstract": "Mountain regions are natural water towers, storing water seasonally as snowpack and for much longer as glaciers. Understanding the response of these systems to climate change is necessary in order to make informed decisions about prevention or mitigation measures. Yet, mountain regions are often data sparse, leading many researchers to implement simple or enhanced temperature index (ETI) models to simulate cryosphere processes. These model structures do not account for the thermal inertia of snowpack and glaciers and do not robustly capture differences in system response to climate regimes that differ from those the model was calibrated for. For instance, a temperature index calibration parameter will differ substantially in cold-dry conditions versus warm-wet ones. To overcome these issues, we have developed a cryosphere hydrology model, called the Significantly Enhanced Temperature Index (SETI), which uses an energy balance structure but parameterizes energy balance components in terms of minimum, maximum and mean temperature, precipitation, and geometric inputs using established relationships. Additionally, the SETI model includes a glacier sliding model and can therefore be used to estimate long-term glacier response to climate change. Sensitivity of the SETI model to changing climate is compared with an ETI and a simple temperature index model for several partially-glaciated watersheds within Alaska, including Wolverine glacier where multi-decadal glacier stake measurements are available, to highlight the additional fidelity attributed to the increased complexity of the SETI structure. The SETI model is then applied to the entire Alaska Range region for an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs), using representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Comparing model runs based on ensembles of GCM projections to historic conditions, total annual snowfall within the Alaska region is not expected to change appreciably, but the spatial distribution of snow shifts towards higher elevations and for a large portion of the region the duration of snow cover decreases. The changes in temperature and snow distribution also lead to spatially heterogeneous responses by glaciers within the region. The SETI model is designed to be easy to apply for any mountain region where cryospheric processes dominate.",

Furthermore we made geomorphological observations through digital maps (old topographical maps and aerial photos) and field observations.\nWe measured stream discharge (quasi-) simultaneously at several positions along the stream using both an Ott-C31 propeller instrument and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler instrument. The measurements were made during dry summer periods when baseflow is expected to be the dominating contribution to streamflow.\nPreliminary findings show that the GCM system reveals small-scale structures not seen with other data types. Furthermore, based on the GCM results and stream discharge results we have identified gaining, losing and zero exchange sections of the stream.\nDuring late summer 2015 we will collect additional hydrological data in order to support or modify our preliminary findings. To further investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the groundwater-surface water interactions along the stream we will measure groundwater seepage to the stream using:\nseepage meter (point-scale)\nDTS (reach-scale)\ntemperature stick measurements (point-in-space-and-time-scale)\ntemperature loggers installed in the streambed (month-scale)\nThe measurement sites are chosen based on our geophysical, geological, and geomorphological mapping as well as our stream discharge measurements.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic aerosols have emerged as an important player affecting global and regional climate with significant impacts on both the energy and water cycles. The early instrumental period (1850-1950), characterized by the increase of North American and especially European aerosol emissions concurrently with negligible Asian emissions and relatively low carbon dioxide concentrations, is an interesting case study to isolate the aerosol impact.\nObservations and historical experiments with state-of-the-art CMIP5 models are used to identify regions affected by aerosols. We compare the spatial and temporal patterns of climate variables such as surface temperature and precipitation with those of aerosol emissions and aerosol optical depth (AOD). In addition to regions showing the expected relationship between increasing sulfate emissions and decreasing surface temperatures, we see regions and decades with a more complex temperature response, and the first third of the twentieth century stands out as an especially interesting period. The contribution of atmospheric circulation changes is also pointed out.",

The deposited contaminants may resuspend and the biofilm where pathogens live may detach from the bed to water body. The deposition and resuspension substantially increase the complexity of the transport process, and make it more difficult and uncertain to accurately simulate and predict the fate and transport of contaminants in surface waters. In this research, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-water quality model coupled with flume experiments are planned to be utilized to quantify the influence of flow conditions on nitrogen, phosphorous and E. coli deposition and resuspension, and to investigate the impact of shear stress caused by flow on the biostability of biofilm. This research will facilitate to better understand the fate and transport of pathogens in surface waters and provide a theoretical base for pathogen prediction and forecasting.",

The web-based, freely available curriculum modules include a rich set of resources for teachers, and are tied together by a common set of climate related themes that include: 1) the Earth system with the complexities of its positive and negative feedback loops; 2) the range of temporal and spatial scales at which climate, weather, and other Earth system processes occur; and 3) the recurring question, “How do we know what we know about Earth’s past and present climate?” which addresses proxy data and scientific instrumentation. The four modules (Climate and the Cryosphere; Climate and the Biosphere; Climate and the Carbon Cycle; and Climate Detectives) approach climate literacy from different contexts, and have provided teachers of biology, chemistry, marine science, environmental science, and earth science with opportunities to address climate science by selecting a module that best supplements the content of their particular course.\nThis presentation will highlight the four curriculum modules in the Climate Series, the multiple pathways they offer teachers for introducing climate science into their existing courses, and the two newest elements of the series: the Climate Series Intro, which holds an extensive set of climate related resources for teachers; and the Climate Detectives module, which is based on the 2013 expedition of the Joides Resolution to collect cores from the seafloor below the Gulf of Alaska.",

Model ensembles project that extratropical land temperature variance will detectably decrease by 2070. We use quantile regression of station observations to show that decreasing variability is already robustly detectable for North American winter during 1979--2014. Pointwise trends from GHCND stations are mapped into a continuous spatial field using thin-plate spline regression, resolving small-scales while providing uncertainties accounting for spatial covariance and varying station density. We find that variability of daily temperatures, as measured by the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles, has decreased markedly in winter for both daily minima and maxima. Composites indicate that the reduced spread of winter temperatures primarily results from Arctic amplification decreasing the meridional temperature gradient. Greater observed warming in the 5th relative to the 95th percentile stems from asymmetric effects of advection during cold versus warm days; cold air advection is generally from northerly regions that have experienced greater warming than western or southwestern regions that are generally sourced during warm days.",

In this paper we will present the functional description and capabilities of the S-NPP Land SIPS, including system development phases and production schedules, timeline for processing, and delivery of land science products based on coordination with the S-NPP Land science team members. The Land SIPS processing stream is expected to be operational by December 2016, generating land products either using the NASA science team delivered algorithms, or the “best-of” science algorithms currently in operation at NASA’s Land Product Evaluation and Algorithm Testing Element (PEATE). In addition to generating the standard land science products through processing of the NASA’s VIIRS Level 0 data record, the Land SIPS processing system is also used to produce a suite of near-real time products for NASA’s application community. Land SIPS will also deliver the standard products, ancillary data sets, software and supporting documentation (ATBDs) to the assigned Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) for archival and distribution. Quality assessment and validation will be an integral part of the Land SIPS processing system; the former being performed at Land Data Operational Product Evaluation (LDOPE) facility, while the latter under the auspices of the CEOS Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV) Land Product Validation (LPV) Subgroup; adopting the best-practices and tools used to assess the quality of heritage EOS-MODIS products generated at the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS).",

            "abstract": "To improve our understanding of how and when carbon is delivered to deeper depths and what processes are responsible for mineralization of carbon at depth, this study monitored the CO2 and O2 variability in the soil atmosphere from land surface down to the regolith-bedrock boundary on two different rock types (i.e., to 7.2m on granite and 1.4m on diabase) in Virginia at a bi-weekly interval for two years. In both sites, at the shallow depth (<0.7-1m) CO2 and O2 concentrations sharply increased (to values as high as 2-5% v/v) and decreased (to ~15%) with increasing depth, displaying a CO2:O2 = 1:-1 mole ratio. At deeper depths on granite, the CO2 varied between 6% (summer) and 10% (winter), maintaining CO2:O2 =1:-1 year round. However, strong seasonality was observed in the diabase’s deeper depths: during the spring and summer, the CO2 concentrations increased up to ~4% as its O2 decreased in a 1:-2.7 ratio. During the fall and winter on diabase, the CO2 and O2 concentrations varied by 2-3 % and 17-18%, respectively, but always displayed the 1:-1 ratio. We attribute these observations to the important role of fractures in regolith in delivering oxygen and labile organic matter in regolith down to 7 m. These substrates sustain a highly productive aerobic microbial community. In the diabase, the exchange between the surface and the subsurface may be seasonally limited due to the swelling of the smectite-rich layer at 0.5 m depth. Consequently, oxygen and organic matter are poorly replenished at depth and the CO2 production decreases below that of granite. The 1:-2.7 stoichiometric ratio in this mafic rock is attributed to the coupling of Fe-reductive carbon dissimilation and Fe-oxidation. Our study highlights i) a newly designed sensor system for soil gas at depth; ii) the use of soil gas ratios to infer metabolic pathways; and, surprisingly, iii) evidence for measurable diurnal gas cycles as deep as 7 meters beneath the temperate forest land surface.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of pre- and post-failure movement of translational landslides remain surprisingly poorly investigated. Previous approaches have focussed on field monitoring, for example through high resolution automated surveying and/or GPS measurements, or from modelling using dedicated codes. There has been some experimental work too, most notably using ring shear devices, although there are limitations as to the type of analyses that can be completed in these devices. In recent years the author has been involved in a series of studies that have sought to understand pre- and post-failure behaviour in translational landslides using both high precision monitoring and experimental investigation using novel apparatus. The latter approach has involved the use of the back pressured shear box, a direct shear machine that allows near-infinite variation of the normal and shear stress state, and measurement and control of the pore water pressure. More recently, a more advanced version of this machine has been developed that allows dynamic loading of both direct and normal shear stresses. This paper presents key lessons learnt about the behaviour of translational landslides from these approaches. The data highlight a number of key elements:\nThe important differences in pre-failure behaviour for materials that show a brittle response compared with those that are ductile. In particular, some aspects of behaviour (e.g. the hyperbolic acceleration to failure) can only be replicated in materials that show brittle cracking processes;\nIn the post-failure domain, all materials show a high level of sensitivity to small changes in pore water pressure when the Factor of Safety is close to unity;\nRates of strain are not simply related to pore water pressure / stress state. In particular, some materials show a different deformation response during phases of increasing pore water pressure to that during periods of pore water pressure reduction. The reasons for this require further study;\nDynamic behaviour is complex, with variations in behaviour between different materials types being greater than expected.\nThese results show that the behaviour of materials in the post-failure domain is more complex than had been appreciated previously, suggesting that more work is needed to explain landslide behaviour in this regime.",

Utility-scale solar energy systems require substantial quantities of land or space, often prompting an evaluation of environmental impacts and trade-offs when selecting their placement. Utilizing salt-contaminated agricultural land (as the sodium absorption and electrical conductivity values are unsuitably high), unsuitable for food production, and lands within the built environment (developed), can serve as a co-benefit opportunity when reclamation of these lands for USSE development is prioritized. In this study, we quantify the theoretical and generation-based solar energy potential for the Central Valley according to land-cover type, crop type, and for salt-contaminated lands. Further, we utilize the Carnegie Energy and Environmental Compatibility (CEEC) model to identify and prioritize solar energy, integrating environmental resource opportunities and constraints most relevant to the Central Valley. We use the CEEC model to generate a value-based environmental compatibility output for the Central Valley. The Central Valley extends across nearly 60,000 km2 of California with the potential of generating 21,800 - 30,300 TWh y-1 and 41,600 TWh y-1 of solar energy for photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP), respectively. Pasture, hay, and cultivated crops comprise over half of the Central Valley, much of which is considered prime agriculture or of statewide or local importance for farming (28,200 km2). Together, approximately one-third of this region is salt-contaminated (16%) or developed (11%). This confers a generation-based potential of 5713 - 7891 TWh y-1 and 2770 TWh y-1 for PV and CSP, respectively. As energy, food, and land are inextricably linked, our study shows how land favorable for renewable energy systems can be used more effectively in places where land is premium.",

This anisotropy might be a comprehensive result of fractures' properties, such as the direction, spacing, apertures, intensity, microstructure, fluid infill, and so on. Among these properties, the preferential orientation of fracture networks makes the medium azimuthally anisotropic with respect to seismic wave propagation. To the medium containing a set of vertical fractures, the tangential weakness does not vary with the fluid content, however on which the normal weakness shows great dependence. Based on the theory of linear slip model and the sensitivity to fracture weakness of PP- and PS-reflection coefficients which can be derived by a Born formula, we did both the PP-AVOA and PS-AVOA numerical experiment and also the joint inversion of fluid indicator. Results show that when the fractures have low saturation of gas, the fluid indicator estimated from PP-AVOA data is precise enough; when gas saturation goes up to 70%, joint inversion can help to improve the poor quality of PP-AVOA data inversion. Under high gas-saturated case, both PP inversion and joint inversion are sensitive to the errors in g, where g is the square of the ratio of S- and P- wave velocity in the unfractured medium. This dependency can be reduced by adding a different weight to PP and PS data during the inversion.Based on the result of numerical experiment, we processed field data in Sichuan Basin in China. The inversion result is consistent with the well interpretation.\nThe first column in figure represents the PP- and PS-reflectivity computed by matrix method(Fryer and Frazer,1984). The second column is the result of Born linearized method. In the last column, upper one shows the estimated fluid indicator in different gas saturation case and the below one consider the effect of error in g on the inversion results.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of the numerical error in a specific physical quantity of interest (goal) is of key importance in geophysical modelling. Towards this aim, we have formulated an algorithm that combines elements of the classical dual-weighted error estimation with stochastic methods. Our algorithm is based on the Dual-weighted Residual method in which the residual of the model solution is weighed by the adjoint solution, i.e. by the sensitivities of the goal towards the residual. We extend this method by modelling the residual as a stochastic process. Parameterizing the residual by a stochastic process was motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig formalism from statistical mechanics.\nHere, we apply our approach to two-dimensional shallow-water flows with lateral boundaries and an eddy viscosity parameterization. We employ different parameters of the stochastic process for different dynamical regimes in different regions. We find that for each region the temporal fluctuations of local truncation errors (discrete residuals) can be interpreted stochastically by a Laplace-distributed random variable. Assuming that these random variables are fully correlated in time leads to a stochastic process that parameterizes a problem-dependent temporal evolution of local truncation errors. The parameters of this stochastic process are estimated from short, near-initial, high-resolution simulations. Under the assumption that the estimated parameters can be extrapolated to the full time window of the error estimation, the estimated stochastic process is proven to be a valid surrogate for the local truncation errors.\nReplacing the local truncation errors by a stochastic process puts our method within the class of ensemble methods and makes the resulting error estimator a random variable. The result of our error estimator is thus a confidence interval on the error in the respective goal. We will show error estimates for two 2D ocean-type experiments and provide an outlook for the 3D case.",

The continuum-scale models (CM) obtained by this approach involve constitutive laws which require effective material properties, such as the diffusivity, permeability, and thermal conductivity which are often determined by experiments. The second approach considers the material at the pore scale, where the void space is represented by a network of pores (PN). Micro- or nanofluidics models used in each pore give rise to a large system of ordinary differential equations with degrees of freedom at each node of the pore network.\nIn this work, the moisture transport coefficient (D), the pseudo desorption isotherm inside the network and at the evaporative surface are estimated from the post-processing of the three-dimensional pore network drying simulations for fifteen realizations of the pore space geometry from a given probability distribution. A slice sampling method is used in order to extract these parameters from PN simulations. The moisture transport coefficient obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 1a. The minimum of average D values demonstrates the transition between liquid dominated moisture transport region and vapor dominated moisture transport region; a similar behavior has been observed in previous experimental findings. A function is fitted to the average D values and then is fed into the non-linear moisture diffusion equation. The saturation profiles obtained from PN and CM simulations are shown in Fig. 1b.\nFigure 1: (a) extracted moisture transport coefficient during drying for fifteen realizations of the pore network, (b) average moisture profiles during drying obtained from PN and CM simulations.",

To map the thickness and structure of the Ethiopian lithosphere throughout the region of deformation, a temporary broadband seismic network was deployed to expand the aperture of previous geophysical investigations around the Main Ethiopian rift. The Ethiopian Seismic Highland Investigation (ESHI) includes 26 stations on the Ethiopian Highlands as far west as the Sudanese border, and 4 stations on the Somali Plateau.\nHere we report on the initial results of the analyses of teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the ESHI network between April 2014-2015. First-order crustal structure beneath the Ethiopian Highlands is inferred from radial receiver functions across the network. By examining stations located radially outward from the rift axis we observed a reduction in arrival time of the P-SV converted phase associated with the base of the crust. These P-SV arrivals are observed between 3.5 – 5.5 s following the direct P onset. The smaller values correspond to stations closer to the Sudanese border, with larger values corresponding to stations closer to the rift axis on the Ethiopian Plateau. The observations agree with previous receiver function studies that sampled similar regions of the Ethiopian Highlands.\nThese results suggest differences in the thickness or composition of the crust away from the rift axis across the plateau. We are modeling thickness and Vp/Vs ratios to provide initial constraints on crustal thickness and composition of the lithosphere, in which the Main Ethiopian Rift has formed.",

However, chamber measurements frequently have their own issues. Here we describe the results of a study using large (≈2 m radius), transparent chambers over intact ground vegetation to describe the net efflux of CO2 and its environmental controls during the growing season at Rosinedal, a research site in northern Sweden. Measurements were made at thirty-minute intervals over the course of three growing seasons in a heavily fertilized and an unfertilized Scots pine stand. Ammonium nitrate was added at rates of 100 kg N ha-1 for the first five years, after which the rate was halved but the additions continued. The CO2 efflux results were simultaneously fitted to a nonlinear model describing the exponential increase in dark efflux with temperature, the Michaelis-Menten saturation of light-driven CO2 uptake in photosynthesis, the reduction in efflux due to soil drying, and a residual term that we ascribe to weekly shifts in the photosynthate partitioning of canopy trees to belowground processes. We found the expected exponential increase in dark efflux with temperature, however the net efflux in daytime was often negative, reflecting the high GPP of the ground vegetation, especially in dense canopies of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.). There was a clear reduction in dark efflux under dry conditions. The empirical phenology parameters increased sharply in early July, around the time that leaf expansion and rapid cambial growth were completed. This increase was more pronounced on the control plot than on the fertilized plot, consistent with expectations based on the notion that N fertilization should favor aboveground partitioning. The empirical “partitioning coefficient” shifted net efflux by nearly as much as the seasonal temperature range. Dark efflux of CO2 was nearly halved as a result of the nitrogen additions.",

            "abstract": "In hydrological forecasting, data assimilation techniques are employed to improve estimates of initial conditions to update incorrect model states with observational data. However, the limited availability of continuous and up-to-date ground observational data is one of the main challenges for real-time applications such as global flood forecasting models. Remote sensing has been recognised as a valuable alternative source of observations of land surface hydrological fluxes and state variables due to its global coverage, open data policy and the advantage of being available at frequent temporal intervals and shortly after the satellite image retrieval.\nIn this study, we present the impact of assimilating remotely sensed surface water extent into the global hydrological LISFLOOD model using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnFK) and its potential to improve the timing of the flood peak. We use the merged product from Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) that employs both AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) to derive water extent as used in the GFDS. This satellite-derived water extent signal is assimilated into LISFLOOD for selected catchments and results are compared to baseline initial conditions (without data assimilation). Validation is done based on ground-based discharge observations. Furthermore, we discuss the post-processing and data assimilation strategies of satellite data within a global hydrological model.",

In this study, we examined the relationship between the observed stray light and the signals in VIIRS’s calibrators to investigate the potential stray light source and sneak paths. The stray light contamination is found to be highly correlated with calibrator signal characteristics and the stray light origin and paths could vary at satellite’s orbital location and time. For the observed high latitude stray light regions, the calibration view data showed signal profiles that are similar to the estimated earth scene stray light profiles. In the twilight region, calibration view signal profiles can be used to extend stray light estimates to improve upon the current extrapolation method. The calibration view data can also be used to identify the additional stray light occurred during southern hemisphere spring time and the occasional low latitude stray light contamination. Based on the calibration view data, the expected earth scene dark signals can be approximated by extending signals from un-contaminated regions to estimate the additional stray light. Applying this updated stray light correction method, the DNB images showed expected earth scene features over the additional southern hemisphere stray light region, although some residual effects remained. Our analysis indicates that the DNB calibration view data can be used to improve DNB stray light characterization and correction. As stray light affects significant portion of nighttime scenes, further refinement in characterization and correction is important to ensure VIIRS DNB imagery quality in NPP and future missions.",

The present study aims to carry out water balance study and development of appropriate methodologies to compute environmental flow in the middle Ganga river basin between Patna-Farraka, India. The methodology adopted here are set-up a hydrological model to estimate monthly discharge at the tributaries under natural condition, hydrological alternation analysis of both observed and simulated discharge series, flow health analysis to obtain status of the stream health in the last 4 decades and estimating the e-flow using flow health indicators.\nArcSWAT, was used to simulate 8 tributaries namely Kosi, Gandak and others. This modelling is quite encouraging and helps to provide the monthly water balance analysis for all tributaries for this study. The water balance analysis indicates significant change in surface and ground water interaction pattern within the study time period\nIndicators of hydrological alternation has been used for both observed and simulated data series to quantify hydrological alternation occurred in the tributaries and the main river in the last 4 decades,. For temporal variation of stream health, flow health tool has been used for observed and simulated discharge data. A detailed stream health analysis has been performed by considering 3 approaches based on i) observed flow time series, ii) observed and simulated flow time series and iii) simulated flow time series at small upland basin, major tributary and main Ganga river basin levels. At upland basin level, these approaches show that stream health and its temporal variations are good with non-significant temporal variation. At major tributary level, the stream health and its temporal variations are found to be deteriorating from 1970s. At the main Ganga reach level river health and its temporal variations does not show any declining trend. Finally, E- flows were computed in 2 ways computing monthly a) 10 % Mean Annual Flow b) E- flow values using Flow Health and found about 223 cumec and 238 cumec at Baltara (Kosi) gauging station respectively. It can be concluded that for large rivers like the Ganga, a combination of flow Health tool and hydrological modelling can be used for effective management of water resources.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing recognition that eddies modulate open ocean productivity, and that this influence depends on both eddy source and their evolution. Eddies in the southeast Indian Ocean have been recognised, from satellite remote sensing of sea surface height and ocean colour, as important pathways for the westward transport of elevated biomass from the eastern boundary Leeuwin Current into the oligotrophic South Indian Ocean. Further it has been hypothesized that, in some eddies, processes at the base of the mixed layer stimulate productivity and sustain phytoplankton biomass for much longer than would be expected from westward advection alone.\nHere we present high-frequency profiles of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, backscatter and oxygen from autonomous floats in anti-cyclonic and cyclonic eddies in the South Indian Ocean. Satellite sea surface height data confirmed that the floats remained trapped in their respective eddies from winter to early summer, sampling the upper 300 m of the water column 6-8 times per day. The eddies were larger than average for this region, with mean amplitude and radius of 18.1 (19.3) cm and 143 (97) km for the anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies.\nThe total concentration of chlorophyll in the mixed layer remained relatively constant, although its vertical distribution changed over time. From September to October, it was evenly distributed throughout the mixed layer of both eddies. With the onset of spring warming, the chlorophyll became concentrated at greater depth with less chlorophyll at the surface. Satellite measurements of surface chlorophyll were 3-5 times lower than the float surface measurement throughout the record, partly because of the vertical structure in chlorophyll. There was no significant change in oxygen saturation state coincident with high phytoplankton concentrations at depth, indicating no net community production. The eddies appear to self-sustain their biomass.",

            "abstract": "Semiarid shrublands and other dryland ecosystems are highly responsive to precipitation pulses that, depending on their size, differentially influence moisture distribution in the soil profile. Recent dryland ecosystem field studies have shown that transpiration dynamics are largely a function of deep soil moisture available after large precipitation events, regardless of where the majority of plant roots occur. This is contrary to some ecological frameworks, such as Walter’s two-layer hypothesis, which suggest the physical location of plant roots result in plant-specific niches of water availability. We suggest that adopting a hydrologically defined two-layer conceptual framework of the soil profile is more appropriate for understanding dryland plant water use than a rooting-depth-based framework. We make the assumption that shallow and deep soil layers have different isotopic signatures and use this framework to show how dryland transpiration dynamics vary with deep soil moisture availability and how the source of that moisture varies over time. We present continuous eddy covariance, sap flow transpiration and soil moisture data with discrete isotopic samples of precipitation, soil, and stems taken over 18 months at a creosotebush-dominated shrubland ecosystem in southern Arizona. We found that the shallow and deep soils were isotopically distinct; in particular, on each sampling day, shallow soil δ2H values tended to be more positive than deep soil δ2H values, except on days where a large, isotopically depleted storm wetted the whole soil profile. Our data indicate that transpiration was generally more strongly correlated with deep moisture, and that stem samples were isotopically similar to deep soil samples. Using a combined approach to understanding plant water use in semiarid areas offers more insights than using sap flow or isotopic techniques alone; this is in part because of the complexity in rainfall isotopic patterns and the conditions for fractionation. Using our combined approach, we contend that semiarid shrubs depend on deep moisture for growth and functioning and are therefore vulnerable to shifts in precipitation, such as a decrease in the number of large storms, which would limit available soil moisture to the shallow surface layer.",

Nanjing hosts the Youth Olympic Games in 2015，and implements a strict plan to control the emission of construction dust. Thus, The Youth Olympic Games provides a good opportunity to analyze the neutralization of alkaline dusts emitted from construction in Nanjing. Experiment is conducted by collecting the total of rainfall events from June to September in 2015, besides, TSP (total suspended particles) before and after each rainfall events is collected due to find the collaboration with rainfall. Ca2+,Mg2+,K+,Na+,Sr2+,F-,Cl-,SO42-,NO3- concentrations in rain water and water soluble fraction of TSP are analyzed using ICP-OES and ICS in Nanjing University. Results showed that Ca2+and SO42- makes the major part of total ions, indicating the fact that Nanjing is suffering from a severe acid rainfall and alkaline dusts which mainly consist of Ca2+ neutralize a large number of acid particles. pH of rainfall has a good correlation with the flux of TSP. pH of rainfall keeps falling as the YOG plan starts and picking up after the YOG, which indicates that the declination of artificial alkaline dust in TSP reduces the neutralization on the acid rainfall.",

The World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (version 2, 2015) is now based on a higher resolution 5 km grid, so many more dike swarms are apparent. We review this latest compilation. Several new high resolution planetary magnetic data sets have also recently become available, and we review evidence for igneous processes, and dikes, in these new data sets. We also review the prospect for new planetary magnetic data sets that might further elucidate igneous processes. At Mars, for example, we have photogeologic evidence for a host of dike swarms, but because of the high altitude of the magnetic data sets, no magnetic evidence exists. A new technique based on remotely sensing the magnetic field of the atomic Na in micro-meteorite ablation layers offers the promise of improving the spatial resolution by a factor of 2-4 at Mars.",

            "abstract": "The biogeochemical redox ladder of alternative electron acceptors constitutes a first principle of understanding energy and matter transformations in ecosystems. The theoretical underpinning is that electron acceptors should be reduced in a predictable sequence, provided that microbes compete for electron donors in a homogeneous environment. However, we see many lines of evidence that theory does not work as cleanly as predicted in heterogeneous, natural settings. This creates a paradox: the first principle of biogeochemical studies does not always hold up in natural settings. Furthermore, the main method of measuring the dominant redox process, redox potential (also known as Eh; defined as a measure of electron availability) is often not reproducible. To better understand this redox paradox, we explore: 1) when and where redox ladders work as predicted by theory and contrast that with environments in which the ladder does not work, 2) the need to understand a redox couple from both the electron accepting and donating process, and how increased understanding of both sides may improve redox ladder predictability, and 3) the trade-offs in understanding the redox ladder using redox potential vs. the underused redox buffering capacity. We find that the redox ladder works in highly simplified or homogeneous environments (e.g., oligotrophic lake water columns), but fails in complex soil environments or environments with hydrologic variation. We also compare multiple potential electron donors, in addition to the commonly used organic carbon, to investigate how competing electron donors may influence the dominant redox couple. Finally, we argue that simply measuring redox potential isn’t a powerful enough predictor of the dominant redox couple, but instead posit that a combination of redox potential and redox buffering capacity will give superior predictive power. Incorporating these concepts into our understanding of redox ladders in naturally heterogeneous environments will improve the predictive capacity of empirical and modeling biogeochemical studies.",

We present a new high resolution 1.2 Myr record of neodymium isotopes (εNd) - a proxy for water mass mixing - measured on foraminifera and fish debris from site ODP 929 [6.0°N, 43.7°W, 4356 m] on the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean. This record reveals a fundamental step-change in the nature of glacial Atlantic overturning across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition as well as providing new insight into the relationship between ocean circulation and greenhouse gas forcing during the period known as the “lukewarm” interglacials.\nComparison with benthic foraminiferal carbon isotopes from the same core reveals periods of significant decoupling between εNd and δ13C, demonstrating that deep Atlantic water mass mixing proportions and nutrient chemistry can vary independently of one another. In contrast, comparison of the εNd record with benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopes reveals a tight coupling, exhibiting the control of Northern Hemisphere climate on both ice volume and Atlantic overturning. The high resolution of the records allows cross spectral analysis of the phasing between authigenic εNd and both benthic foraminiferal δ13C and δ18O. This reveals that the different proxy records are coherent at time periods of 100-, 40- and 23-kyr which correlate with orbital forcing. However, the changes in each variable at these periods are not always in phase, indicating that the proxies exhibit different temporal responses to climatic forcings.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_15_Poster_TVS_v2_submitted.pdf\nGlobally, agricultural water use accounts for most of the water that is withdrawn from surface water and groundwater. Rice, one of the world's leading food crops, requires that fields be continuously flooded to obtain optimal yields. High air temperature and consecutive rainless days in rice-growing areas can significantly reduce rice yields, leading to food scarcity. Climate change is expected to affect water demand for rice via changes in rainfall regime, soil water balance, and evapotranspiration. Higher temperatures and increased variability of precipitation are predicted to increase water demand and could potentially require more irrigation in lowland rice-growing areas. In this study we present the first results from model simulations in which we integrated a rice model into the Agro-IBIS dynamic ecosystem model. We predict the impact of climate change on the water use requirement of rice production in southern Brazil and evaluate changes in irrigation needed to meet minimum water demand to sustain current yields. Brazil is the 9th top rice producer in the world, and southern Brazil accounts for about 80% of the national production. The Agro-IBIS model was driven with historic weather data provided by CRU (1961-90) and with two future climate scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for 2015-2100 – Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP45) and 8.5 (RCP85). On an hourly time step, Agro-IBIS accounts for gains (precipitation) and losses (evaporation, transpiration, infiltration and runoff) of water in each grid cell, and uses rules to irrigate in order to maintain a specific height of standing water on the field. Simulated historic and future amounts of irrigated water needed to maintain this water height will be evaluated to predict future water demand for rice production in southern Brazil.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing provides continuous observations of the sea ice pack across basin scales and has revolutionized our understanding of ice mass balance over the last two decades. Satellite and airborne altimeters deliver a unique set of measurements of sea ice elevation, from which thickness may be derived. Recent analyses provide details on the interannual variability of Arctic sea ice thickness and volume, superimposed on a multi-decadal decline. Results indicate that the largest losses are to the multiyear ice (MYI) cover. A declining MYI cover will precondition the pack for further loss, severely altering the mass and energy budgets.\nAdvancing our understanding of how and why the MYI cover is changing is therefore critical for improved predictions of the future Arctic climate system. Using seven years of high-resolution Operation IceBridge airborne measurements with complementary satellite radar imagery and scatterometry data we map the interannual variability of the MYI pack. We describe key features including the variability and trends in the thickness distribution and extent. During this period mean ice thickness was around 3.2 m with a modal thickness of 2.8 m. We examine the influence of dynamic processes on recent variability, gaining new insights on the age, thickness and morphology of the MYI pack.",

            "abstract": "Global warming would accelerate glacier retreat and permafrost degeneration on the Tibetan Plateau. The carbon stored in permafrost would be released to nearby lakes. However, little is known about how the carbon sink and source situation could be altered and what role the microbial community could play in Tibetan lakes in response to global warming. To fill this knowledge gap, six lakes (Erhai Lake, Qinghai Lake, Tuosu Lake, Gahai Lake, Xiaochaidan Lake and Lake Chaka) on the Tibetan Plateau were studied. In order to compare the seasonal variations in geochemistry and microbial communities, two sampling cruises were performed (May and July of 2015, corresponding to dry and wet seasons, respectively). For each lake, salinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll were measured for water samples, and salinity and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured for sediments. Chamber-based greenhouse gas flux measurement were performed on the surface of each lake. Microbial communities were analyzed by using MiSeq sequencing technique. The results showed that in response to seasonal variation (from dry to set season), lake surface increased by 5-20% (calculated on the basis of satellite data) and salinity decreased by 4-30% for the studied lakes, suggesting the studied lakes were diluted by precipitations. The DOC contents of the lake waters were almost stable for the studied lakes, whereas TN increased by more than 70% for the lakes with salinity less than 100g/L. In the meanwhile, chlorophyll content increased by more than 180% for lakes with low salinities (Erhai Lake, Qinghai Lake, and Tuosu Lake) and decreased by 17-94% for lakes with high salinities (Gahai Lake, Xiaoxhaidan Lake, and Lake Chaka. This indicated that desalination (precipitation plus glacier melt) would increase carbon fixation potential in Tibetan lakes. Microbial community analyses showed that microbial diversity increased in response to desalination. All in all, global warming could increase microbial diversity and thus carbon fixation potential, thus alter the carbon sink and source situation in Tibetan lakes.",

These features may have a profound effect on earthquake nucleation, propagation and arrest. Incorporating these existing features in modeling and the ability to spontaneously generate new one in response to earthquake loading is crucial for predicting seismicity patterns, distribution of aftershocks and nucleation sites, earthquakes arrest mechanisms, and topological changes in the seismogenic zone structure.\nHere, we report on our efforts in modeling two important mechanisms contributing to the evolution of fault zone topology: (1) Grain comminution at the submeter scale, and (2) Secondary faulting/plasticity at the scale of few to hundreds of meters.\nWe use the finite element software Abaqus to model the dynamic rupture. The constitutive response of the fault zone is modeled using the Shear Transformation Zone theory, a non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamic framework for modeling plastic deformation and localization in amorphous materials such as fault gouge. The gouge layer is modeled as 2D plane strain region with a finite thickness and heterogeenous distribution of porosity. By coupling the amorphous gouge with the surrounding elastic bulk, the model introduces a set of novel features that go beyond the state of the art. These include: (1) self-consistent rate dependent plasticity with a physically-motivated set of internal variables, (2) non-locality that alleviates mesh dependence of shear band formation, (3) spontaneous evolution of fault roughness and its strike which affects ground motion generation and the local stress fields, and (4) spontaneous evolution of grain size and fault zone fabric.",

There has been a large range of approaches to estimating G for large-scale applications, with a subsequent wide range of accuracies/errors. We provide the largest review of these approaches to date (n=10), evaluating modeled G against measured G from 78 FLUXNET sites. Empirical relationships constrained by vegetation indices and Rn better capture daily variability of instantaneous G, while a physically based heat transfer model exhibits lower bias and error across all sites. Global relationships calibrated to in situ measurements also reveal low bias and error in addition to capturing the variability comparable to the other empirical relationships. We produced global decadal datasets of G for all models to illustrate regional sensitivities by model. This work has potential to improve energy balance estimates of LE and provides a new dataset to assimilate into or assess land surface models.",

            "abstract": "Long range transport of Asian dust into the Arctic has been observed for many years. The dust often contains anthropogenic aerosols such as black carbon. Radiation measurements beneath a dust layer over the NOAA Barrow Observatory showed cooling of the surface by >5 Wm−2/day with calculated heating of 3 K/day within the layer. Airborne vertical profiles of aerosols were conducted across the Arctic Basin during the Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP, 1983-91) and the Aerosol, Radiation, and Cloud Processes Affecting Arctic Climate (ARCPAC, 2008). The most salient observation from these profiles was that aerosol concentrations above the top of the marine boundary (cloud) layer were often an order of magnitude greater than within the boundary layer or at the surface.\nLidar measurements from Barrow and Alert show that there are layers of dust and haze flowing into the Arctic Basin that are not detected at the surface or are measured only as minor aerosol perturbations. There are programs conducting aerosol measurements in the Arctic with UAVs, but these are limited in scope and not conducted on a year around basis. Models of Arctic aerosol distributions and concentrations do not adequately describe either surface aerosol measurements or aerosols above the marine boundary layer. Climate models are not able to adequately describe the forces involved in the accelerating melting of the Arctic ice cap. There are conjectures that dust and black carbon aerosols on the ice may be contributing to this melting.\nConsidering their importance in Arctic climate forcing, we suggest that atmospheric and climate modeling scientists have an obligation to develop a plan for sustained profiling of aerosol optical properties (light scattering and absorption) and cloud nucleating properties (CCN and IN) in the Arctic. These profiles need to extend from near the surface through the marine cloud layer and into the upper reaches of the free troposphere",

            "abstract": "An important component of Earth’s deep carbon cycle is the return of surficial carbon to the planet’s interior. Most recycled carbon is bound in CaCO3 minerals, of which aragonite is the most significant at upper mantle pressures. It is therefore essential to understand the phase stability and compressibility of aragonite at high pressures and temperatures. Aragonite has an orthorhombic 2/m 2/m 2/m structure and a Z of 4. The high-pressure behavior of aragonite has been studied under dynamic and static compression using both X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques, but these results have been contradictory and inconclusive. To address these issues, a single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction study of aragonite under hydrostatic compression was performed to 40 GPa in a diamond anvil cell at ambient temperature. To supplement the compressional experiment, thermal expansion was also measured via powder X-ray diffraction at ambient pressure between 298-673 K. Ambient-pressure single-crystal measurements confirm the orthorhombic 2/m 2/m 2/m structure and yield a unit cell volume of 226.932(5) Å3. At room temperature, aragonite is stable in the orthorhombic structure to 40 GPa, with an isothermal bulk modulus of 66.5(7) GPa and K’ = 5.0(1). The a-axis is most compressible and the c-axis is the least compressible. The b-axis is intermediate, but starts to decrease in compressibility at ~15 GPa. Between 25-30 GPa the aragonite unit cell distorts due to the stiffening of the b-axis, which is controlled by the orientation and distortion of the carbonate groups, layered in the aragonite structure parallel to the a-axis. The carbonate groups elongate and deform from equilateral to isosceles between 15 and 30 GPa, thus influencing the compressibility of the b-axis. The thermal expansion measurements yield expansion coefficients a0 = 4.9(2) x 10‑5 and a1 =3.7(5) x 10-8, in agreement with previous data. The combination of the isothermal and isobaric studies allows the derivation of a thermal equation of state. The new data provide constraints on the behavior of carbonates and carbon cycling in the Earth’s crust and mantle.",

            "abstract": "Critical-taper theory has given diverse insight into kinematics, roles of erosion and sedimentation, and the morphology of compressive mountain belts. We have made progress by recasting the parameter-rich mathematics into a simpler form that describes a linear, co-varying relationship between surface slope and detachment dip (α, β), and internal- and basal-sliding strengths (W, F).\nUsing distinct-element models, we tested this simpler theory over a range of wedge strengths and structural styles. We also obtained W & F from observations of surface slope α and detachment dip β in active natural systems, all of which including the numerical models, show wedges are strong but detachments are weak, with F/W=0.1 or less.\nModel-derived W & F vary about a mean that matches geometry-derived values. Time- and spatially-averaged dynamical F & W are observed to be equal to wedge-derived results. Critical taper reflects the dynamical strengths during wedge growth and is controlled dynamically as base friction varies between an assigned quasi-static value and lower values during slip events. In the wedge, W varies more than F, which may also be true for natural systems. Detachments have frictional stick/slip behavior on a basal wall, but the wedge has more going on within it. Tandem faulting & folding serve to simultaneously weaken and strengthen the wedge, and may occur anywhere: structural style appears to be important to wedge strength evolution. The dynamics of deformation within the wedge and slip upon the base control the finite wedge geometry: static strengths drop to dynamic levels during seismicity, resulting in materials and faults that are weaker than prescribed in models or determined by testing.\nRelationships between α and W & F are complex. All sudden, stepwise changes in α, W & F with time coincide with seismicity spikes in the models. Large events trigger or are triggered by large changes in F and W. We examine the complex details of dynamically driven changes in W & F by close monitoring of models at single time-step resolution. Peak values of W occur as the first ‘damage wave’ passes through the wedge, leaving the rest of the wedge damaged, less cohesive, and unable to sustain large loads thereafter. This has implications for ‘micro-taper’ in the wedge and likely also for the location and behavior of megathrusts in these terrains.",

This case study approach leads users through the forensics necessary to diagnose an unknown disease in a Central American village. This disease, Chagas, is endemic to 21 Latin American countries. The CDC estimates that of the 110 million people living in areas with the disease, 8 million are infected, with as many as 300,000 US cases. Chagas is caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, and is spread via blood feeding insect (vectors), that feed on vertebrates and live in crevasses in the walls and roofs of adobe homes. One-third of the infected people will develop chronic Chagas who are asymptomatic for years before their heart or GI tract become enlarged resulting in death.\nThe case study has three parts. Students play the role of WHO field investigators and work collaboratively to: 1) use genetics to identify the host(s) and vector of the disease 2) use a STELLA™ SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) system dynamics model to study Chagas at the village scale and 3) develop management strategies. The simulations identify mitigation strategies known as Ecohealth Interventions (e.g., home improvements using local materials) to help stakeholders test and compare multiple optima.\nHigh school students collaborated with researchers from the University of Vermont, Loyola University and Universidad de San Carlos, Guatemala, working in labs, interviewing researchers, and incorporating mulitple field data as part of a NSF-funded multiyear grant. The model displays stable equilibria of hosts, vectors, and disease-states. Sensitivity analyses show measures of household condition and presence of vertebrates were significant leverage points, supporting other findings by the University research team. The village-scale model explores multiple solutions to disease mitigation for the purpose of producing students who can think long-term, better understand feedbacks, and anticipate unexpected consequences associated with non-linear systems. This case study enables high school teachers to incorporate ongoing research, systems modeling, and engineering design, three core goals Next Generation Science Standards and STEM initiatives.",

The radar group in the Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies (ISAS) at the University of Saskatchewan is designing and building the radar which will be located near the university in Saskatoon, SK, Canada and will have a field of view over Wollaston Lake in northern Saskatchewan. This novel radar will simultaneously obtain high spatial and temporal resolution through the use of a bistatic setup and pulse modulation techniques. The bistatic setup allows the radar to transmit and receive continuously, while pulse modulation techniques allow for enhanced spatial resolution, only constrained by the radio bandwidth licensing available. A ten antenna array will be used on both the transmitter and receiver sides, with each antenna having an independent radio path. This enables complete digital control of the transmitted 1 kW signal at each antenna, allowing for digital beam steering and multimode broadcasting. On the receiver side the raw digitized signal will be recorded from each antenna, allowing for complete digital post-processing to be performed on the data. From the measurements provided using these modern digital radar capabilities, further insights into the physics of E-region phenomena, such as Alfvén waves propagating from the magnetosphere above and ionospheric irregularities, may be investigated.",

GUVI column O/N2 shows consistent features in its latitudinal and solar cycle variability during the December and June solstice periods. At low solar activity, latitudinal gradients of O/N2 are small at both solstices, and they are slightly larger at the December solstice than that at the June solstice. The latitudinal gradient of O/N2 at the December solstice increases significantly with increasing solar activity, whereas it changes very little at the June solstice. Consequently, at solar maximum, column O/N2 at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere winter is greatly larger than that in the southern hemisphere winter. Despite considerable longitudinal variability, these features are true at different longitude sectors as well as in zonal mean column O/N2. This suggests that ionosphere winter anomaly should occur more readily in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. Model simulations using NCAR/TIE-GCM show the same features. It is considered that high O/N2 in the winter hemisphere is due to the summer to winter inter-hemispheric circulation. However, model simulation shows that the prevailing vertical advection of O/N2 at mid-latitudes in the northern winter is not necessarily larger compared to the southern winter, especially at some longitude sectors. We will use model simulations to understand the causes of the differential latitudinal gradients of O/N2 at the solstices and their solar cycle variability.",

Efforts to elucidate meandering channel dynamics from such records have been further stymied by the poor time and spatial resolutions of the available data. The highly-active Ucayali River in Peru provides a unique opportunity to reveal natural, well-resolved meandering channel dynamics. In the past three decades alone, the Ucayali River has undergone many cutoffs including some bends growing from inception (nearly straight sections of river) until cutoff.\nAnnual binarized water masks of the Ucayali River were generated from over 30 years of Landsat imagery. A nearly-automated methodology employing image-processing techniques computes pixel-resolution banklines, centerline, width, curvature, and migration rate along hundreds of kilometers of river. This methodology together with the rapid migration of the Ucayali River captures the effects of flow, bar size, tributaries, and cutoffs on local migration rates. In this study, we document how cutoff-generated local perturbations in slope and sediment storage induces nonlocal accelerated meander migration both upstream and downstream. This process introduces a feedback through which amplified migration rates increase cutoff rates while cutoffs amplify migration rates. We also relate the magnitude of cutoff reaches to the spatial and temporal extents of their corresponding accelerated migration rates.",

An especially difficult task is to make quantitative and non-unique connection between laboratory experiments, seismological mapping and geophysical modeling of glacial isostasy and mantle flow. Advances in seismology and from theoretically modeled high pressure and temperature laboratory experiments make a new set of assessments now possible. We explore the most recent whole mantle seismic models for 3-D shear wave velocity νS( θ, φ, r ): S40RTS (Ritsema et al., 2011) and S362ANI+M (Moulik and Ekström, 2014) together with new data for grain boundary sliding and dislocation mechanics in the olivine/wadsleyite/ringwoodite portions of the upper mantle, connecting these to the well-constrained effective viscosity profiles known for Fennoscandia and Laurentia derived from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) data. The latter regions also provide information that connect the operative flow laws for perovskite (Mg,FeSiO3) – periclase (Mg,FeO) mixtures appropriate to levels in the lower mantle corresponding to the high-to-low spin transition occurring at about 2000 km depth (Bardo et al., 2003). Three classic relations for effective viscosity, ηeff, proposed by Ranalli (1990) are employed and evaluated using the two seismic models. We discuss the implications for modeling both Würm-Wisconsin and Little Ice Age deglaciation-related rebound. In addition we discuss the parameter range ηeff, appropriate to modeling GIA in Antarctica, and provide reasonable bounds on errors in forward models. Finally, the implications for GIA removal from GRACE solutions for continent-wide ice sheet mass balance are also treated.",

Such experts and decision makers worked together in the Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Testbed 11 to address a scenario of population displacement by coastal inundation due to the predicted sea level rise. In a Policy Fact Sheet \"Harnessing Climate Data to Boost Ecosystem & Water Resilience\", issued by White House Office of Science and Technology (OSTP) in December 2014, OGC committed to increase access to climate change information using open standards. In July 2015, the OGC Testbed 11 Urban Climate Resilience activity delivered on that commitment with open standards based support for climate-change preparedness.\nUsing open standards such as the OGC Web Coverage Service and Web Processing Service and the NetCDF and GMLJP2 encoding standards, Testbed 11 deployed an interoperable high-resolution flood model to bring climate model outputs together with global change assessment models and other remote sensing data for decision support. Methods to confirm model predictions and to allow “what-if-scenarios” included in-situ sensor webs and crowdsourcing. A scenario was in two locations: San Francisco Bay Area and Mozambique. The scenarios demonstrated interoperation and capabilities of open geospatial specifications in supporting data services and processing services. The resultant High Resolution Flood Information System addressed access and control of simulation models and high-resolution data in an open, worldwide, collaborative Web environment. The scenarios examined the feasibility and capability of existing OGC geospatial Web service specifications in supporting the on-demand, dynamic serving of flood information from models with forecasting capacity.\nResults of this testbed included identification of standards and best practices that help researchers and cities deal with climate-related issues. Results of the testbeds will now be deployed in pilot applications. The testbed also identified areas of additional development needed to help identify scientific investments and cyberinfrastructure approaches needed to improve the application of climate science research results to urban climate resilence.",

            "abstract": "Surface water hydrologic models are increasingly used to analyze the transport of solutes through the landscape, such as nitrate. However, many of these models cannot adequately capture the effect of groundwater flow paths, which can have long travel times and accumulate legacy contaminants, releasing them to streams over decades. If these long lag times are not accounted for, the short-term efficacy of management activities to reduce nitrogen loads may be overestimated. Models that adopt a simple ‘well-mixed’ assumption, leading to an exponential transit time distribution at steady state, cannot adequately capture the broadly skewed nature of groundwater transit times in typical watersheds.\nHere I will demonstrate how StorAge Selection functions can be used to capture the long lag times of groundwater in a typical subwatershed-based hydrologic model framework typical of models like SWAT, HSPF, HBV, PRMS and others. These functions can be selected and calibrated to reproduce historical data where available, but can also be fitted to the results of a steady-state groundwater transport model like MODFLOW/MODPATH, allowing those results to directly inform the parameterization of an unsteady surface water model. The long tails of the transit time distribution predicted by the groundwater model can then be completely captured by the surface water model. Examples of this application in the Chesapeake Bay watersheds and elsewhere will be given.",

            "abstract": "The unsteadiness of stream water age is now well established, but the controls on the age dynamics, and the adequate representation and prediction of those dynamics, are not. A basic distinction can be made between internal variability that arises from changes in the proportions of flow moving through the diverse flow pathways of a hydrologic system, and external variability that arises from the stochasticity of inputs and outputs (such as precipitation and streamflow). In this talk I will show how these two types of age variability can be formally defined and distinguished within the framework of rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) functions. Internal variability implies variations in time in the rSAS function, while external variability does not. This leads naturally to the definition of several modes of internal variability, reflecting generic ways that system flowpaths may be rearranged. This rearrangement may be induced by fluctuations in the system state (such as catchment wetness), or by longer-term changes in catchment structure (such as land use change).\nOne type of change, the ‘inverse storage effect’ is characterized by an increase in the release of young water from the system in response to an increase in overall system storage. This effect can be seen in many hydrologic settings, and has important implications for the effect of altered hydroclimatic conditions on solute transport through a landscape. External variability, such as increased precipitation, can induce a decrease in mean transit time (and vice versa), but this effect is greatly enhanced if accompanied by an internal shift in flow pathways that increases the relative importance of younger water. These effects will be illustrated using data from field and experimental studies.",

            "abstract": "In conjunction with the rise of unconventional oil and gas production, there has been a recent rise in interest in noble gas and carbon isotope changes that can occur during the migration of natural gas. Natural gas geochemistry studies use bulk hydrocarbon composition, carbon isotopes, and noble gas isotopes to determine the migration history of gases from source to reservoir, and to trace fugitive gas leaks from reservoirs to shallow groundwater. We present theoretical and experimental work, which helps to explain trends observed in gas composition in various migration scenarios.\nNoble gases are used as tracers for subsurface fluid flow due to distinct initial compositions in air-saturated water and natural gases. Numerous field studies have observed enrichments and depletions of noble gases after gas-water interaction. A theoretical two-phase gas displacement model shows that differences in noble gas solubility will cause volatile gas components will become enriched at the front of gas plumes, leaving the surrounding residual water stripped of dissolved gases. Changes in hydrocarbon gas composition are controlled by gas solubility in both formation water and residual oil.\nIn addition to model results, we present results from a series of two-phase flow experiments. These results demonstrate the formation of a noble gas isotope banks ahead of a main CO2 gas plume. Additionally, we show that migrating hydrocarbon gas plumes can sweep biogenic methane from groundwater, significantly altering the isotope ratio of the gas itself.\nResults from multicomponent, two-phase flow experiments qualitatively agree with the theoretical model, and previous field studies. These experimentally verified models for gas composition changes can be used to aid source identification of subsurface gases.",

Recent upward revisions to the thermal conductivity of iron in the core strain the energy budget by increasing the conductive heat flow that must be overcome in order to drive thermal convection and maintain an ancient geodynamo. We address this paradox by computing thermal-magnetic evolutions of the Earth using a 1-D model with parameterizations for heat sources and sinks in the mantle and core. This model includes a number of important new features that have not been previous coupled in a single model. New features in the mantle model include enhanced mantle heat loss to due extrusive volcanism, crust formation and insolation, and latent heating due to magma ocean solidification. New features in the core model include realistic iron conductivities, time-dependent partitioning of light elements (O, S, and Si) between solid and liquid and their effect on the liquidus depression and gravitational energy release. Core evolutions derived from an energy model are compared to an energy-entropy model, which accounts for ohmic dissipation. We identify the conditions necessary to avoid shut-down of the geodynamo prior to inner core nucleation and to maintain a strong magnetic field over the last 4.2 Gyr. Using a dipole field scaling law derived from numerical dynamo models we compare the predicted paleo-dipole intensity to the paleointensity record and speculate on possible observational evidence for the inner core nucleation event.",

In a previous study we determined the FWF from Greenland for the period 1958-2010 using a combination of observations and regional climate modeling. Here, we update the analysis with data from new satellite observations to extend the record both in space and time. The new FWF estimates cover the period 1958-2014 and include the Canadian, Russian and Norwegian Arctic (Svalbard) in addition to the contributions from Greenland. We combine satellite altimetry (including CryoSat 2) with grounding line flux data, regional climate modeling of surface mass balance and gravimetry to produce consistent estimates of solid ice and liquid FWF into the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans.\nThe total cumulative FWF anomaly from land ice mass loss started to increase significantly in the mid 1990s and now exceeds 5000 km^3, a value that is about half of the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s. The majority of the anomaly is entering two key areas of deep water overturning in the Labrador and Irminger Seas, at a rate that has been increasing steadily over the last ~20 years. Since the mid 2000s, however, the Canadian Arctic archipelago has been making a significant contribution to the FW anomaly entering Baffin Bay. Tracer experiments with eddy-permitting ocean GCMs suggest that the FW input from southern Greenland and the Canadian Arctic should accumulate in Baffin Bay with the potential to affect geostrophic circulation, stratification in the region and possibly the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We also examine the trajectory of freshwater input in the form of icebergs, which does not have the same fate as liquid input.",

Field monitoring has been performed to gain insights into the unsaturated zone characteristics, moisture dynamics, and contaminant transport rates. The objective is to provide quantitative estimates of surface fluxes (quantification of infiltration and evaporation) and investigations of unsaturated zone processes controlling water infiltration and spatial variability in head distributions and flow rates. One particular issue is to examine the effectiveness of the clayey soil cap installed to prevent infiltration of water into the waste repository and the top sand soil cover above the clayey layer to divert the infiltrated water laterally. The spatial variability in the unsaturated zone properties and associated effects on water flow and contaminant transport observed at the site, have led to a concerted effort to develop improved model of flow and transport based on stochastic concepts. Results obtained through the unsaturated zone model investigations are combined with the hydrogeological and geochemical components and develop predictive tools to assess the long term fate of the contaminants at the waste management site.",

Recent drought events (2004-2006 & 2010-2012) in the UK have highlighted a continued vulnerability to this hazard. The period 2010-2012 was characterised by departures from typical seasonal climatic conditions, resulting in a severe drought, which had a significant impact on water resources in parts of the UK. Recent droughts highlight the need for better understanding of extreme drought events, particularly from a water resource perspective. The UK has a wealth of long climate series that are under used for water resource management planning. Standardised drought indicators offer a potential monitoring and management tool for operational water resource management. However, the application of these metrics for operational water resource management needs further investigation, particularly links between meteorological drought indices, streamflow, groundwater and water supply systems.\nThis work uses standardised drought indices (Standardised Precipitation Index and Standardised Precipitation Evaporation Index) to characterise drought from 1858-2013 within a 21,000 km2 water supply region serving 7.4 million people. Meteorological drought characterisation highlights the severity of late 19th Century droughts (1887-1889, 1890-1910) which are rarely considered in water resource modelling and drought management planning; current UK water resource modelling typically uses data from 1920-2012. Drought characterisation is used to extend the water resources modelling period back to 1884, permitting investigation of the impacts of pre-1920s droughts on reservoir yields and exploring how meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics impact the water supply system. Drought characteristics are also used to investigate the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought using observed data from rivers, aquifers and reservoirs to develop a better understanding of the links between drought indices and observed drought impacts. Exploring how meteorological drought indicators link to the water supply region helps build an understanding of their utility for water resource management.",

            "abstract": "While chondrites are the most common meteoroids to enter our atmosphere, they represent a small fraction of recovered falls. Most stony meteorites disrupt during entry, consumed by ablation or lost by weathering; in contrast, small iron meteorites (<10 m) disrupt and disperse to create strewnfields due to interacting atmospheric bow shocks [e.g., Passey and Melosh, 1980]. The Carancas impact crater in 2007, however, challenged our understanding [Tancredi et al., 2008]: (a) first eyewitness of a crater formed by a stony meteorite; (b) undetected thermal entry at altitude; (c) no accessory meteorite falls; (d) “explosion” (not low-speed compression) crater; (e) infrasound/seismic data indicating a high-speed entry/collision; and (f) petrologic evidence for shock deformation/melting in breccias indicative of speeds >4 km/s. Although a monolithic chondrite (~ 10 m across) might allow surviving entry, most objects of this size contain multiple flaws, ensuring atmospheric disruption. Hence, an alternative “needle model” was proposed wherein a small rubble-pile object gradually re-shaped itself during entry [Schultz, 2008], a process that minimizes drag, thermal signatures of entry, and catastrophic disruption. First proposed to account for smaller than expected craters on Venus [Schultz, 1992], such a process resembles subsequent Shoemaker-Levy entry models [Boslough and Crawford, 1997] that predicted much deeper entry than standard models.\nLaboratory experiments at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range simulated this process by breaking-up hypervelocity projectiles into a cloud of debris and tracking its path at near-full atmospheric pressure. The resulting cloud of fragments exhibited less deceleration than a solid sphere at the same speed. Moreover, shadowgraphs revealed constituent fragments “surfing” the pressure jump within the mach cone/column. Previous models proposed that crater-forming impacts must be >50-100 m in diameter in order to survive entry [Bland and Artemieva, 2004]. The “needle model” for the Carancas meteorite entry, however, raises questions about this lower limit for threats by rubble-pile asteroids, e.g., Itokawa. Consequently, we modeled the fate of a rubble-pile entering earth’s atmosphere using GEODYN, an Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement (Antoun et al., 2001).",

            "abstract": "In June 2011, the first recorded eruption of Nabro volcano, took place at the border of Eritrea and Ethiopia. This eruption was the largest in what could be considered an ongoing sequence of eruptions in the Afar-Red Sea region since 2005. It halted air travel in northern Africa, contaminated food and water sources, and displaced thousands from their homes. Geographic isolation, previous quiescence, and regional civil unrest meant that this volcano was effectively unmonitored at the time of eruption, and opportunities for field study were limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the quantity of erupted products and the timing and mechanisms of their emplacement using predominantly free, publicly available satellite data. We use MODIS and OMI data to examine rates of lava effusion and SO2 emission, and quantify the amount of erupted products. We also examine published images from other satellites, such as ALI and SEVIRI in order to understand the temporal evolution of the eruption. Synthesizing these data, we then attempt to infer the mechanisms through which the eruption progressed. Examination of satellite data reveals a bimodal eruption, beginning with explosive activity marked by high SO2 emission totalling 1824 - 2299 KT, and extensive ash fall of 270 - 440 km2. This was followed by a period of rapid effusion, producing a ~17 km long lava flow, and a volume of ~22.1 x 106 m3. Mass balance between the SO2 and lava flows reveals no sulfur 'excess', suggesting that nearly all of the degassed magma was extruded. This eruption of Nabro continued for nearly 6 weeks, and may be considered the second largest historic eruption in Africa. This type of work highlights the effectiveness and importance of accessible satellite remote sensing data for the study of active volcanoes, particularly those in remote regions that may be otherwise inaccessible.",

This study models climate change impacts on river inflows to three headwaters hydropower lakes (Pukaki, Tekapo, and Ohau) in the Upper Waitaki Basin of the central South Island using the TopNet hydrological model based on the 1990s (baseline), 2040s, and 2090s periods. The IPCC 4th assessment report A1B emissions scenario and average temperature and precipitation results of 12 Global Circulation Models with statistical downscaling were used as input to TopNet. Indicators of hydrologic alteration were used to estimate and compare 63 flow metrics across the full flow regime based on TopNet output. Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to evaluate significant differences between metrics among the three periods. Implications for hydropower operations, other water resources management needs, and braided river flows and ecology were also evaluated. Results show that annual and cumulative inflows increase for future climate periods for all three lakes. However, seasonal effects cause flows to generally increase in winter and early spring and decrease slightly in summer due to warmer temperatures with more winter rain and less snow. The number of inflow metrics with statistically significant changes is greatest for Lake Pukaki, with the most glacierized catchment, and least for Lake Ohau. High flows and floods generally increase, and low flows/extreme low flows decrease. Overall these changes may be beneficial for hydropower and some braided river floodplain ecological features, but the seasonal shifts will result in greater flood risk in winter and spring, more drought risk in summer and autumn, and additional challenges managing water volumes in these mountain hydropower lakes.",

Until now, the presumed insensitivity of a fully developed Antarctic Ice Sheet to orbital forcing and a wide range of greenhouse gas concentrations has made Miocene and Pliocene ice volume variability difficult to reconcile. Here, we show how the inclusion of new ice-model physics, more highly resolved atmospheric models, and new ice-climate coupling techniques are reducing the strength of Antarctic Ice Sheet hysteresis, bringing data-model comparisons into better agreement. This is especially true in light of new atmospheric CO2 reconstructions hinting at concentrations higher than previous estimates.

            "abstract": "Regional and continental carbon stock and flux estimates differ among assessments depending on the scaling approach used and the budget components considered. This is particularly manifest across the vast circum-boreal region, which has experienced substantial modification of the major driving forces of the carbon cycle in recent decades, including pronounced climate warming and associated increases in the frequency and severity of disturbances. In Canada, inventory-based estimates suggest a small carbon sink for its managed forest, but do not include unmanaged lands nor capture major driving forces such as climate change and atmospheric chemistry. On the other hand, estimates from process-based models vary widely and often do not consider critical disturbance and management impacts. Here, we demonstrate results from an updated approach that integrates inventory-based information on management and disturbances with process-level representation of ecological dynamics using a terrestrial biogeochemistry model.\nThe integrated approach facilitates more comprehensive diagnosis of Canada’s land-based carbon budget within a framework that also allows for attribution of the major driving forces and prediction under future scenarios. Using this framework, we diagnose an approximately 30 Tg C yr−1 sink in Canada over the first decade of the 21st Century, which represents a significant reduction in the strength of the CO2 sink estimated for previous decades. This decline in sink strength is attributed primarily to CO2 emissions from the substantial area disturbed by wildfire and insect outbreaks in recent years. Such changes are predicted to create positive feedbacks to the climate system that accelerate global warming. Compared to other assessments, our results suggest that CO2 uptake by the region’s ecosystems may not be as strong as estimated by atmospheric inverse approaches, which are highly uncertain over the high latitudes, or by process-based models that do not consider permafrost dynamics, disturbance and management impacts, or other important drivers in these regions. Although there are benefits in retaining independence among approaches for estimating and comparing carbon fluxes, our approach demonstrates the significant progress to be made by more formally integrating them.",

To further investigate this link, melt inclusions, which are blebs of melt trapped in growing crystals, were the obvious choice for optimal comparison of sources and determination of pre-eruptive volatile contents and magmatic conditions. Olivine-hosted inclusions were chosen for both volcanoes and pyroxene-hosted inclusions were also sampled from Las Pilas to represent the evolved melt. Major, volatile and trace elements reveal a distinct geochemical continuum with Cerro Negro defining the primitive end member and Las Pilas representing the evolved end member. Volatile contents are high for Cerro Negro (up to 1260 ppm CO2, 4.27 wt% H2O and 1700 ppm S) suggesting that volatile exsolution is likely the trigger for Cerro Negro’s explosive eruptions. Las Pilas volatile contents are lower but consistent with degassing and evolutionary trends shown by major oxides. Trace element contents are rather unique and suggest Cerro Negro magmas fractionally crystallize while Las Pilas magmas are the products of mixing. Magmatic conditions were estimated with major and volatile contents: at least 2.4 kbar and 1170 °C for Cerro Negro melts and 1.3 kbar and 1130 °C for Las Pilas melts with an overall oxygen fugacity at the NNO buffer. In combination with available literature data, this study suggests an interconnected subsurface plumbing system and thus Cerro Negro should be considered as the newest vent within the Las Pilas-El Hoyo Complex.",

            "abstract": "Over the past two decades warming temperatures over Greenland have caused many changes on land, over its ice-covered areas and in surrounding ocean waters. While previous studies have concentrated on changes to individual systems (e.g. ice cover, ocean, vegetation), fewer have focused on the interactions of multiple systems (e.g. ice-ocean interactions) and very few have focused on how changes in multiple physical systems will affect biology and the Greenlandic population. Although small, Greenland’s vegetated areas are of primary importance to its indigenous population as it supports herbivorous mammals and their importance to livelihood strategies.\nThis research explores the links between physical and biological systems, investigating how increased melt from the Greenland ice sheet and changes in snow covered area impact vegetation phenology. Using a fifteen-year Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series obtained by MODIS, seasonality descriptors are derived for ice sheet sub-basins in western Greenland. The start, end and duration of the growing period, timing of peak NDVI, and primary productivity are generated and used to describe the relationship between vegetation and runoff. In some basins years of high melt coincided with observable differences in the remotely sensed phenology descriptors, however, in other years the relationship is more complex.\nBoth inter- and intra-regional differences in phenology are characterized. Trends for individual basins are presented along with trends for the whole of western Greenland. Because the relationship between phenological descriptors and high melt years is complex across sub-basins, differences in snow-seasonality and snow accumulation patterns are assessed to better understand the dynamics of these systems.",

            "abstract": "Airborne and terrestrial lidar are increasingly used in forest attribute modeling for carbon, ecosystem and resource monitoring. The near infra-red wavelength at 1064nm has been utilised most in airborne applications due to, for example, diode manufacture costs, surface reflectance and eye safety. Foliage reflects well at 1064nm and most of the literature on airborne lidar forest structure is based on data from this wavelength. However, lidar systems also operate at wavelengths further from the visible spectrum (e.g. 1550nm) for eye safety reasons. This corresponds to a water absorption band and can be sensitive to attenuation if surfaces contain moisture. Alternatively, some systems operate in the visible range (e.g. 532nm) for specialised applications requiring simultaneous mapping of terrestrial and bathymetric surfaces. All these wavelengths provide analogous 3D canopy structure reconstructions and thus offer the potential to be combined for spatial comparisons or temporal monitoring. However, a systematic comparison of wavelength-dependent foliage profile and gap probability (index of transmittance) is needed. Here we report on two multispectral lidar missions carried out in 2013 and 2015 over conifer, deciduous and mixed stands in Ontario, Canada. The first used separate lidar sensors acquiring comparable data at three wavelengths, while the second used a single sensor with 3 integrated laser systems. In both cases, wavelenegths sampled were 532nm, 1064nm and 1550nm. The experiment revealed significant differences in proportions of returns at ground level, the vertical foliage distribution and gap probability across wavelengths. Canopy attenuation was greatest at 532nm due to photosynthetic plant tissue absorption. Relative to 1064nm, foliage was systematically undersampled at the 10% to 60% height percentiles at both 1550nm and 532nm (this was confirmed with coincident terrestrial lidar data). When using all returns to calculate gap probability, all wavelengths were within 6% but when using first returns only, gap probability was overestimated by 67% at 532nm and 11% by 1550nm. These results demonstrate that each wavelength contains distinct information about canopy attributes and models must account for variations in wavelength if applied to data for monitoring purposes.",

While such citations provide the appropriate links, even if informally, to their origins, they are often done so inconsistently, making such citations hard to analyze. While significant progress has been made in the past few years in the development of recommendations, policies, and procedures for creating and promoting citable identifiers, progress has been mixed in tracking how data sets and other digital infrastructures have actually been identified and cited in the literature.\nUnderstanding the full extent and value of research infrastructures through the lens of scholarly literature requires significant resources, and thus, we argue must rely on automated approaches that mine and track persistent identifiers to scientific resources. Such automated approaches, however, face a number of unique challenges, from the inconsistent and informal referencing practices of authors, to unavailable, embargoed or hard-to-obtain full-text resources for text analytics, to inconsistent and capricious impact metrics.\nThis presentation will discuss work to develop and evaluate tools for automating the tracing of research resource identification and referencing in the research literature via persistent citable identifiers. Despite the impediments, automated processes are of considerable importance in enabling these traceability efforts to scale, as the numbers of identifiers being created for unique scientific resources continues to grow rapidly. Such efforts, if successful, should improve the ability to answer meaningful questions about research resources as they continue to grow as a target of advanced analyses in research metrics.",

The survival of wholly coherent tissues from primarily soft-bodied organisms is far more unusual. However, the literature is now well- populated with spectacular examples of soft-tissue preservation ranging from a 2,600 year old human brain to the tissues of the Ediacaran biota that have survived ~600 million years. Some of the most exceptional examples of soft tissue preservation are from the Proterozoic-Cambrian transition, however, nearly all modes of fossil preservation during this time are debated. Clay mineral templates have been implicated as playing a role in several types of soft tissue preservation, including Burgess Shale and Beecher’s Trilobite-type preservation, and more recently, Bitter Springs-type silicification. Yet, there is still much debate over whether these clay mineral coatings form during early stage burial and diagenesis, or later stage metamorphism. This research addresses this question by using in situ fluid cell Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to investigate the nucleation and growth of silicate minerals on model biological surfaces. Herein we present preliminary results on the deposition of hydrous magnesium silicates on self-assembled monolayers (-OH, -COOH, -CH3, and -H2PO3 terminated surfaces) at ambient conditions.",

Recent estimates predict that over one billion people don’t have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs. The ability of remote sensing tools to monitor and model crop production and predict crop yield is essential for providing governments and farmers with vital information to ensure food security. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform, which integrates storage and processing algorithms for massive remotely sensed imagery and vector data sets. By providing the capabilities of storing and analyzing the data sets, it provides an ideal platform for the development of advanced analytic tools for extracting key variables used in regional and national food security systems. With the high performance computing and storing capabilities of GEE, a cloud-computing based system for near real-time crop land monitoring was developed using multi-source remotely sensed data over large areas. The system is able to process and visualize the MODIS time series NDVI profile in conjunction with Landsat 8 image segmentation for crop monitoring.\nWith multi-temporal Landsat 8 imagery, the crop fields are extracted using the image segmentation algorithm developed by Baatz et al.[1]. The MODIS time series NDVI data are modeled by TIMESAT [2], a software package developed for analyzing time series of satellite data. The seasonality of MODIS time series data, for example, the start date of the growing season, length of growing season, and NDVI peak at a field-level are obtained for evaluating the crop-growth conditions. The system fuses MODIS time series NDVI data and Landsat 8 imagery to provide information of near real-time crop-growth conditions through the visualization of MODIS NDVI time series and comparison of multi-year NDVI profiles. Stakeholders, i.e., farmers and government officers, are able to obtain crop-growth information at crop-field level online. This unique utilization of GEE in combination with advanced analytic and extraction techniques provides a vital remote sensing tool for decision makers and scientists with a high-degree of flexibility to adapt to different uses.",

Changes in tundra productivity have been associated with sea ice dynamics on the basis that most tundra ecosystems lay close to the sea. Although some studies have addressed the potential effect of sea ice decline on the primary productivity of terrestrial arctic ecosystems (Bhatt et al., 2010), a clear picture of the mechanisms and patterns linking both processes remains elusive.\nWe hypothesised that sea ice might influence tundra productivity through 1) cold air advection during the growing season (direct/weather effect) or 2) changes in regional climate induced by changes in sea ice (indirect/climate effect). We present a test on the direct/weather effect hypothesis: that is, tundra productivity is coupled with sea ice when sea ice remains close enough from land vegetation during the growing season for cold air advection to limit temperatures locally.\nWe employed weekly MODIS-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (as a proxy for primary productivity) and sea ice data at a spatial resolution of 232m for the period 2000-2014 (included), covering the Svalbard Archipelago. Our results suggest that sea ice-induced cold air advection is a likely mechanism to explain patterns of NDVI trends and heterogeneous spatial dynamics in the Svalbard archipelago. The mechanism offers the potential to explain sea ice/tundra productivity dynamics in other Arctic areas.",

            "abstract": "Solar flares are among the most energetic events in the solar system. Magnetic energy previously stored in the coronal magnetic field is transferred to particle acceleration, plasma motion and plasma heating. Magnetic energy release is likely to occur in coronal currents sheets associated with regions of strong gradient of magnetic connectivity. Coronal current sheets can be traced by their footprints at the surface on the Sun, in e.g. photospheric current ribbons. We aim to study the relationship between the current ribbons observed at the photospheric level which trace coronal current sheets, and the flare energetic electrons traced by their X-ray emissions. The photospheric magnetic field and vertical current density are calculated from SDO/HMI spectropolarimetric data using the UNNOFIT inversion and Metcalf disambiguation codes, while the X-ray images and spectra are reconstructed from RHESSI data.\nIn a first case (the GOES X2.2 flare of February 15, 2011), a spatial correlation is observed between the photospheric current ribbons and the coronal X-ray emissions from energetic electrons (Musset et al., 2015). Moreover, a conjoint evolution of both the photospheric currents and the X-ray emission is observed during the course of the flare. Both results are interpreted as consequences of the magnetic reconnection in coronal current sheets. Propagation of the reconnection sites to new structures during the flare results in new X-ray emission sites and local increase of the photospheric currents We will examine in this contribution whether similar results are obtained for other X-class flares.",

            "abstract": "Criegee intermediates (CI) are formed during the ozonolysis of unsaturated compounds and have been intensively studied in the last few years due to their possible role as oxidants in the troposphere. Stabilised CI (SCI) are now known to react very rapidly, k(298 K) = 10-12 to 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, with a large number of trace gases (SO2, NO2, organic acids, water dimers). An assessment of their effective oxidative capacity remain challenging as, CI chemistry is complex, it spans a large range of rate coefficients for different SCI conformers reacting with water dimers and trace gases, and in addition, no reliable measurement technique able to detect ambient SCI concentrations is currently available.\nIn this study, we examine the extensive dataset from the HUMPPA-COPEC 2010 and the HOPE 2012 field campaigns, aided by literature data, to estimate the abundance of SCI in the lower troposphere. The budget of SCI is analyzed using four different approaches: 1) based on an observed yet unexplained H2SO4 production; 2) from the measured concentrations of unsaturated volatile organic compounds (VOC); 3) from OH reactivity measurements; 4) from the unexplained production rate of OH. A SCI concentration range between 5 x 103 and 2 x 106 molecule cm-3 is calculated for the two environments. The weighted mean estimate of the SCI concentration over the boreal forest of ~ 5 x 104 molecules cm-3 implies a significant impact on the conversion of SO2 into H2SO4.\nIn addition, we present measurements obtained using our inlet pre-injector laser-induced fluorescence assay by gas expansion technique (IPI-LIF-FAGE) for the above-mentioned campaigns. A recent laboratory study performed with the same instrumental setup showed that the IPI-LIF-FAGE system is sensitive to the detection of the OH formed from unimolecular decomposition of SCI. In order to investigate the applicability of the laboratory findings to the ambient data, measurement of the background OH (OHbg), the signal detected by the IPI-LIF-FAGE after the removal of ambient OH, measured during the two field campaigns are represented in comparison with many other trace gases to assess if the observations in controlled conditions are transferable to ambient conditions.",

            "abstract": "Spectrally resolved absorption measurements have been used to attribute the absorption and radiative effects due to brown carbon (BrC), and suggest a significant contribution. Since black carbon (BC) and BrC are co-emitted from combustion and burning processes, BrC absorption in global models has either been implicitly included in absorption by BC or more recently, characterized by a global constant refractive index. An inventory-based optical treatment for the brown carbon absorption has been developed for primary organic aerosol emissions. Results of a simple radiative transfer model with a global emission inventory show that the BrC absorptivity leads to a ∼27% reduction in the cooling effect by organic aerosols compared to the non-absorbing assumption. Here we implement the wavelength-dependent absorption properties of brown carbon parameterized as a function of BC to organic carbon ratio into a global climate model (CAM5) for different fuel emission sectors and biomass burning. This version of CAM5 also simulates the aging of freshly emitted BC and BrC into the aged accumulation-mode aerosols due to condensation of sulfate and organics. The calculated aerosol light absorption properties and spectral dependence will be compared with ground-based AERONET measurements and field observations available. Sensitivity studies of BrC radiative effects based on a global constant refractive index and the inventory-based method in this study will be discussed.",

The identified objects are used to perform an assessment of HRRR model forecasts of warm season convective precipitation over the complex terrain of the western US (west of 105W). The constellation of satellites comprising the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission provide observations of precipitating objects in the domain, and can be used to assess not only the quality of the rain/no-rain forecast, but also the model’s representation of the microphysical and other environmental properties governing precipitation behavior (e.g. latent heating, vertically integrated liquid, etc.). Special attention will be paid to vertical profiles of liquid and ice water contents that can be inferred from the observed reflectivity profiles of the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and other imaging and sounding instruments. Potential relationships between these properties and the success or failure of the model forecast will be discussed.",

Recent studies on atmospheric conditions (tropospheric temperature) and snow cover over Himalayan range suggest changing regional climatic conditions. Enhanced melting of glaciers is corroborated by reports of increasing number of melt-water lakes. A systematic study of state of high-altitude mountain glaciers and melt-water lakes is required for understanding and forecasting impact of global environmental changes in a regional and local scale. Daily snow cover and snow fraction data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua have been used to study intra-annual and inter-annual variation of snow during 2000-2015 over the Himalayan mountain range. Daily MODIS data at 500 m grid resolution show large amount of gaps due to cloud cover. An adaptive Savitzky-Golay polynomial filter have been used to fit the time series of daily data for each grid cell. The missing values in daily images have been filled with calculated values to create daily time series of snow over the study region. Statistical study of the snow cover such as seasonal and yearly count, peak season (magnitude and timing), length of snow deposition and melting season are showing significant changes across Himalayan range. Region wise trend analysis of snow cover have been computed at 95% confidence interval. Enhanced melting rate of snow cover and glaciers in Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau is visible in the form of increasing number and aerial coverage of melt-water lakes. Detailed region wise analysis of total number (count) and aerial coverage of melt-water lakes show conspicuous increasing trend that varies across the study area. Increasing number of new melt-water lakes have been found in the central and eastern Himalayas. Statistical analysis of dynamics of snow cover and melt-water lakes in the study area will be presented in detail. Observed variation in the extent of snow cover and formation of new melt-water lakes represents a changing atmospheric and climatic condition over Himalaya and is also corroborated by the long term temperature trend of the middle troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Climate change presents potential risks to global food supply. To date, understanding of climate change effects on crop production remains uncertain due to (1) uncertainties in projected climate change trends and their spatial and temporal variability; (2) uncertainties in the physiological, genetic and molecular basis of crop adaptation to climate change and adaptive management practices and (3) uncertainties in current land surface models to estimate crop adaptation to climate change. We apply the process-based land surface model, the Integrated Science Assessment model (ISAM), to assess the impact of climate change on the production of row crops (corn, soybean, rice, cotton, sugarcane and wheat) at global and regional scales. The results are compared to the corresponding simulations performed with the crop model in the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). Three questions are addressed: (1) what is the impact of different climate change projections on global crop production; (2) what is the effect of crop adaptation and adaptive management practices on projected crop production; and (3) how do model differences in ISAM and CLM4.5 impact projected global crop production and adaptive management practices over the 21st century.\nISAM and CLM4.5 have been included in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP). Both models consider the effects of temperature, light and soil water and nitrogen availability on crop photosynthesis and temperature control on crop phenology and carbon allocation. ISAM also considers the adaptation of crop phenology, carbon allocation and structures growth to drought, light stress and N stress. The effects of model differences on projected crop production are evaluated by performing the following experiments. Each model is driven with historical atmospheric forcing data (1901-2005) and projected atmospheric forcing data (2006-2100) under RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5 from CESM CMIP5 simulations to estimate the effects of different climate change projections on crop production potential. For each set of atmospheric forcing data, crop production is simulated with and without inclusion of adaptive management practices to assess the effect of adaptation on projected crop production. The result of this study contributes to the overall objective of the AgMIP project.",

However, the southern source of these ∆14C anomalies remains in question (e.g., Sortor and Lund, 2011; Huang et al., 2014). An alternative source could be the Nordic and Arctic basins (Cléroux et al., 2011; Lund et al., 2015). On the basis of d11B, ∆14C, Cd/Ca and d13C, measured in the shells of the planktic foraminiferal species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) and ∆14C measured in benthic foraminifera, we assess the evolution of subsurface seawater carbonate chemistry, ventilation age and nutrients in the southern Norwegian Sea. We find no evidence for an aged outflow from the Norwegian Sea enough to explain the ∆14C anomalies previously found south of Iceland during the early and late Heinrich Stadial (HS) 1. At mid-HS 1 (~16.5 ka), our seawater carbonate chemistry and ventilation age reconstructions suggest a southward export of relatively well-ventilated waters, possibly by brine formation, potentially ventilating the thermocline in the northern North Atlantic. We also document interspecies differences in the benthic radiocarbon ages from a few hundred years to several thousands of years, adding evidence for caution in using ‘mixed benthic species’ for 14C dates.\n",

            "abstract": "Changes in runoff can be caused by climatic variations, land-use changes and water regulation. In this paper we propose a separation of the power spectral response of runoff in watersheds in terms of the product of the power spectra of precipitation and the impulse response function for the watershed. This allows a formal separation of the spectral response in climatic factors – the precipitation – from those of land-use change and regulation – the impulse response function. The latter function characterizes the surface water-groundwater interaction, stream network topology and open channel hydraulics. Based on daily data of digitalized hydro-climatological data from 1961, we constructed synthetic, but calibrated data of runoff from 1001 watersheds in Sweden. From spectral analysis of the data we found periodic fluctuations occurring on time scales of about a decade and a bi-annual peak. These multi-annual fluctuations could be statistically linked through the coherence spectra to climatic indices like the NAO, PDO, geostrophic wind velocity and sun spot numbers on common periods of 3,6 and 7,6 years. Such long-term fluctuations in runoff are not significantly affected by the land-use or regulation other than indirectly through impact on local hydro-climate. Based on a spectral separation of precipitation and impulse response function of the watersheds, we found that the intra-annual variation in runoff was primarily affected by the land-use change in 79 unregulated catchments with up to century-long time series of measured daily discharge. There is a statistically significant increasing slope of the catchments impulse response function for 63 of the 79 catchments and this suggest a significant hydrological effect of land-use practice in agriculture, urbanisation and forestry.",

When combined with output from multiple climate models and climate scenarios, DA can also be used to produce estimates of future forest dynamics in a change climate that robustly estimate a hierarchy of the known unknowns. Our project aim is to comprehensively predict future loblolly pine productivity and carbon sequestration, along with a quantified uncertainty, across the Southeastern U.S. Using the computationally tractable Physiological Principles Predicting Growth model (3-PG), we integrated multiple observation types from geographically dispersed data, including ecosystem-scale experiments, to constrain our predictions. Specifically, we used a recently developed productivity dataset based on decades forest industry research to constrain slow responses of biomass accumulation and allocation to climate, flux tower estimates of gross primary productivity to constrain higher-time frequency climate sensitivity, recent through fall-exclusion experiments in four loblolly pine stands to constrain precipitation sensitivity, and the Duke Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) to constrain productivity response to elevated CO2. We describe results from the DA of the 3-PG model by exploring how estimates of future forest productivity depend on each of these data sources. The most important constraint was provided by the geographically widespread annual forest plot measurements but the Duke FACE site was critical for constraining the parameter governing CO2 enhancement of photosynthesis. We present results for future Southeastern U.S. pine forest productivity that are consistent with decades of forest research in the region and that comprehensively represents uncertainty in future predictions of forest dynamics.",

            "abstract": "A cross-borehole seismic dataset was acquired using two 50 m deep test boreholes drilled into Permian age sandstones near Mels, Switzerland. The boreholes were approximately 20 m apart, and useful data frequencies between 100 Hz and 4000 Hz. The survey comprised 181 source locations and 192 receiver locations, using multiple deployments of a 24-element receiver array to ensure adequate spatial sampling. Imaging velocities and attenuation using Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) proved difficult due to the presence of significant trigger delays in the survey.\nTrigger delays can be solved for using either a Traveltime Tomography (TT) approach (by including additional unknowns), or a FWI approach (by individual source estimation). However, these methods introduce significant ambiguities, particularly in the presence of an unknown level of anisotropy. Moreover, the trigger delays break coherency in the common source and common receiver domains, preventing simple removal of the tube wave energy in the data.\nWe introduce a \u0007novel \bmethod for estimating the trigger delays through cross-correlation of tube waves. Repeat records from identical source-receiver array combinations are shifted and then stacked to create a “reference dataset”. We make use of the high amplitude and highly coherent tube waves, which travel at a constant velocity: receiver hole tube wave arrivals are aligned and enhanced by applying a linear moveout and an f-k filter to the common source gathers. Each physical source location is recorded by four closely spaced and interleaved receiver elements; the high level of redundancy enables recovery of a stable set of delay estimates. A similar approach is used for the common receiver gathers to remove the remaining delays between source locations.\nTrigger delays were corrected with a mean absolute value of 153 μs, a mean bulk shift of −41 μs and a standard deviation of 75 μs. Their removal from the raw seismic data, allowed i) the tube waves to be removed by standard f-k processing, ii) the resulting (shifted) waveform arrival picks to be used for anisotropic TT, and iii) FWI to be successfully applied to the pre-processed data.",

            "abstract": "Diamond resorption morphology reflects conditions and events in the host kimberlite magma and in diamond sources in subcratonic mantle. Recent experimental studies on diamond dissolution enable us now to use surface features of diamonds to examine magmatic fluid in kimberlites. This study uses optical and scanning electron microscopy examination of ~750 macro-diamonds from two kimberlites in Orapa cluster, Botswana. Kimberlite A is a simple body filled with coherent kimberlite facies (CK); kimberlite B is a complex body with two facies of coherent kimberlite and a massive volcaniclastic kimberlite facies (MVK). Distinction between kimberlite-induced and mantle-derived resorption was based on: the type of the most abundant resorption style, morphology of crystals with attached kimberlite fragments, and the study of pseudohemimorphic diamonds. Kimberlite-induced resorption is the focus of this work. The three facies in the pipe B show three contrasting diamond resorption types. Resorption in MVK facies leads to glossy rounded surfaces with fine striation and hillocks, and is identical to the resorption style in CK facies of pipe A. This type of resorption is typical for volcaniclastic facies and indicates emplacement in the presence of abundant COH fluid with high H2O:CO2 ratio (>50mol% of H2O). We propose that pipe A is a root zone supplying material to a larger kimberlite body filled with VK. The two CK in pipe B have very different resorption style. One forms similar glossy surfaces but with regular small cavities of rounded outline, while the other seems more corrosive and develops extremely rough features and deep cavities. Comparison to the experimental data suggests that the former had almost pure H2O fluid at low pressure (where solubility of SiO2 is low). The later CK facies was emplaced in the absence or very low abundance of a free fluid, and possibly in melt closer to carbonatitic composition.",

            "abstract": "Pine Island Glacier terminates in a rapidly melting ice shelf, where ocean forcing of the melt rate has been implicated in the acceleration and retreat of the glacier. A set of mooring records close to the Pine Island ice shelf were recovered in 2014, two of which are combined to provide an unprecedented five-year time series of temperature, salinity and current velocity. These data reveal considerable seasonal and interannual variability in intermediate to deep ocean temperatures, of sufficient magnitude to make a substantial impact on the melt rate of Pine Island ice shelf. The seasonal cycle in ocean temperature is correlated with surface wind speed over the continental shelf, suggesting a role for local surface heat fluxes and convection in influencing the observed temperatures down to 600 m depth.\nThe period August 2011 to August 2013 was anomalously cold; comparison with ship-based summertime observations suggest the heat content at the glacier front in December 2012 was the coldest in the observational record. Similar cold anomalies are observed concurrently at other moorings within Pine Island Bay. This cold spell coincided with a reduction in the concentration of melt water observed, consistent with reduced melting implied by lower temperatures at the mooring locations near the ice shelf. Current observations suggest this was accompanied by a reversal in the circulation pattern around the bay, and the concurrent increase in salinity implies increased sea ice formation. Mooring records in one of the two continental shelf-edge depressions leading to PIG do not indicate a change in temperature during this cold period.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, dynamic flood mapping in near real time is becoming a reachable goal for decision-makers. This talk describes a newly developed framework for predicting biophysical flood vulnerability using public data, cloud computing and machine learning. Our objective is to define an approach to flood inundation modeling using statistical learning methods deployed in a cloud-based computing platform. Traditionally, static flood extent maps grounded in physically based hydrologic models can require hours of human expertise to construct at significant financial cost. In addition, desktop modeling software and limited local server storage can impose restraints on the size and resolution of input datasets. Data-driven, cloud-based processing holds promise for predictive watershed modeling at a wide range of spatio-temporal scales. However, these benefits come with constraints. In particular, parallel computing limits a modeler’s ability to simulate the flow of water across a landscape, rendering traditional routing algorithms unusable in this platform. Our project pushes these limits by testing the performance of two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests, at predicting flood extent. Constructed in Google Earth Engine, the model mines a suite of publicly available satellite imagery layers to use as algorithm inputs. Results are cross-validated using MODIS-based flood maps created using the Dartmouth Flood Observatory detection algorithm. Model uncertainty highlights the difficulty of deploying unbalanced training data sets based on rare extreme events.",

            "abstract": "The western margin of the Central Andes in northern Chile and southern Peru has an arid climate that is thought to have persisted for at least 15 Ma [1–3]. The onset of aridity has been linked to uplift of the Andes, which blocked moisture from the Amazon, creating a rain shadow [e.g. 1]. However, the timing of this uplift and its potential effect on regional climate is poorly understood, with uplift estimates ranging from slow and steady since ≥25 Ma to recent and rapid between ∼10 and 6 Ma [4 & refs therein].\nA direct consequence of both tectonic uplift and climate desiccation is the downward migration of the water table [e.g. 5, 6]. Therefore, the timing and rate of water table drop can help to discern between uplift and aridity models.\nHere, we directly track the temporal downward migration of the Atacama water table using (U-Th)/He dating of hematite [7]. The hematite (Fe2O3) formed by reaction of oxygenated groundwater with ferrous-bearing minerals above the redox interface [e.g. 8]. Thus, the depth of hematite precipitation as a function of time can be used to constrain the relative movement of the water table.\nNine samples were collected in drill core from an active mine in northern Chile, providing precise depth profiles through the top few 100 m beneath the surface. Our results imply a slow and steady lowering of the water table from ~15 Ma to the present day at a rate of ~11 m/Ma. This change at ~15 Ma reflects onset of river incision due to either an increase in climate aridity or an increase in rock uplift rate along the western Andean margin. Whatever the cause, the steady rate of lowering of the water table implied by our data suggests that the driver has been constant over the last ~15 Ma.\n[1] Alpers & Brimhall (1988), GSAB 100, 1640–1656.

            "abstract": "In plants, leaf mitochondrial respiratory CO2 release is inhibited by light. Bessel Kok first demonstrated this inhibition in 1948. Based on curves of CO2 assimilation vs irradiance, it is understood that respiration is maximal in the dark. It then frequently decreases linearly with irradiance until reaching some value around the compensation point, beyond which it is constant. CO2 released by mitochondrial respiration is the result of decarboxylation through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCAP) and the oxydative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). The overall activity of these three reactions is reduced by light. However, their individual contributions to the Kok effect are unknown. We measured the rate of decarboxylation of glucose, position-specifically labeled with 13C, to evaluate the participation of PDH, TCAP and OPPP in the Kok effect of sunflower. Leaves were fed with labeled glucose through their transpiration stream. The δ13C of the CO2 released by the leaf was then measured as a function of irradiance. The results showed that the inhibition of the decarboxylation of carbon positions 3 and 4 in glucose is at the origin of the Kok effect. These are the positions of carbon atoms decarboxylated by PDH. In addition, the rate of decarboxylation of position 1 was not different in the light and in the dark. Thus OPPP plays no role in the Kok effect in sunflower leaves. This work improves our current understanding of leaf mitochondrial respiratory metabolism in the light. Invoking the Kok effect in plant physiology models should improve our ability to simulate carbon fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems.",

Monitoring the kinematics of active movement helps to characterize the ongoing natural hazard. In this study, we document the status of several large landslide complexes along the Columbia River Gorge. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from multiple satellites (ERS, ENVISAT and ALOS) to reveal the spatial-temporal movement of slow-moving landslides over two decades, 1992-2011. To increase the spatial extent of the signal we developed a new InSAR time-series method based on pixel coherence and derived the time series of the landslides. We also investigate the ability of Persistent Scatterer InSAR to better illuminate active movement.\nWhile many historical landslide complexes show minimal or non-existent movement, we measure significant creep on the Redbluff landslide, which is part of the Cascade Landslide Complex near the Bonneville Dam. The InSAR time-series data reveal approximately 25 cm of line-of-sight movement from 5 years of ALOS observations, which translates into greater than 60 cm of downslope movement. The Redbluff landslide is seasonally activated, with accelerated movement observed during the early winter of each year. However, the amplitude of the seasonal signal is variable from year-to-year. To assess the triggering mechanisms, we compared the deformation time series data with local precipitation data. The deformation correlates well with precipitation, implying the slow movement is controlled by rainfall that infiltrates to the base of the slide. A preliminary comparison with the bare earth 2m-resolution digital elevation model from LiDAR reveals that the overall deformation pattern and the active perimeter is highly correlated with the morphology of the landslide.",

To assess net infiltration, we performed a statistical analysis of meteorological data as the basis for hydrological and climatic investigations and predictions for the Rifle site, Colorado, USA, located within a floodplain in a mountainous region along the Colorado River, with a semi-arid climate. We carried out a statistical analysis of meteorological 30-year time series data (1985-2015), including: (1) precipitation data, taking into account the evaluation of the snowmelt, (2) evaluation of the evapotranspiration (reference and actual), (3) estimation of the multi-time-scalar Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), (4) evaluation of the net infiltration rate, and (5) corroborative analysis of calculated net infiltration rate and groundwater recharge from radioisotopic measurements from samples collected in 2013. We determined that annual net infiltration percentage of precipitation varies from 4.7% to ~18%, with a mean of ~10%, and concluded that calculations of net infiltration based on long-term meteorological data are comparable with those from strontium isotopic investigations. The evaluation of the SPEI showed the intermittent pattern of droughts and wet periods over the past 30 years, with a detectable decreasein the duration of droughts with time. Local measurements within the floodplain indicate a recharge gradient with increased recharge closer to the Colorado River.",

By acting as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and/or Ice Nuclei (IN), these aerosols influence cloud presence and formation, and in turn cloud radiative properties and forcing.\nWe analyze the impact of pollution plumes on cloud microphysical properties, including droplet effective radius and cloud optical depth, by calculating an indirect effect (IE) parameter. This IE parameter is defined by the ratio of relative change in cloud microphysical properties to relative variations in pollution concentrations. We also study the impact of aerosols on the cloud thermodynamic phase. In our study we used three sets of data: (i) A combination of POLDER-3/PARASOL and MODIS/AQUA satellite measurements to retrieve cloud properties, (ii) an atmospheric chemistry transport model GEOS-Chem carbon monoxide tracer for concentrations of biomass burning and anthropogenic pollution plumes, (iii) and reanalysis data from ECMWF for the meteorological state.\nThe pollution plumes from biomass burning sources appear to be good IN, whereas pollution from anthropogenic sources appears to act as better CCN. We extend the analysis to different specific humidity and stability regimes to find that the specific humidity and lower tropospheric stability increase the cloud microphysical sensitivity to pollution loading. For example, for low specific humidity situations the IE parameter is close to zero whereas for the highest values of specific humidity – greater than 5 g kg-1 – the impact of aerosols is a maximum: The IE parameter is up to 0.1 and 0.2 for the effective radius and the optical depth respectively. When the lower tropospheric stability is greater than 25˚K, the IE parameter is approximately 0.3 for the optical depth. We hypothesize that the observed correlation between IE and stability is because cloud formation in the Arctic region is dominated by radiative cooling.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHG). Robust measurements of natural GHG emissions are vital for evaluating regional to global carbon budgets and for assessing climate feedbacks on natural emissions to improve climate models. Diffusive and ebullitive (bubble) transport are two major pathways of gas release from surface waters. To capture the high temporal variability of these fluxes in a well-defined footprint, we designed and built an inexpensive automatic device that includes an easily mobile diffusive flux chamber and a bubble counter, all in one. Besides a function of automatically collecting gas samples for subsequent various analyses in the laboratory, this device utilizes low cost CO2 sensor (SenseAir, Sweden) and CH4 sensor (Figaro, Japan) to measure GHG fluxes. To measure the spatial variability of emissions, each of the devices is equipped with an XBee module to enable a local radio communication DigiMesh network for time synchronization and data readout at a server-controller station on the lakeshore. Software of this server-controller is operated on a low cost Raspberry Pi computer which has a 3G connection for remote monitoring - controlling functions from anywhere in the world. From field studies in Abisko, Sweden in summer 2014 and 2015, the system has resulted in measurements of GHG fluxes comparable to manual methods. In addition, the deployments have shown the advantage of a low cost automatic network system to study GHG fluxes on lakes in remote locations.",

Remote sensing of vegetation is a non-invasive methodology to monitor physiological characteristics of plants. The potential of high-resolution thermal infrared remote sensing and the three-temperature model (3T model) for monitoring the effects of combined stresses on mangrove plant Kandelia obovata was assessed. The experiment consists of four levels of CdCl2 stress (0, 1, 5 and 10 mg·L-1) in each of four NH4Cl stress levels: 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg·L-1, respectively. The non-destructive testing indices, including plant transpiration transfer coefficient (hat) and estimated instant transpiration rate, were calculated from thermal images and the 3T model. The photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) were also tested to validate the results of non-destructive testing. The results showed that: (1) The plant transpiration transfer coefficients (hat) were changed from 0.246 to 0.928 and the estimated instant transpiration rates ranged from 0.590 to 6.119 mmol H2O m-2s-1 among different combined stresses. With increasing stress, there were significant decreases for estimated instant transpiration rate and increases for hat (P < 0.05). (2) The photosynthetic characteristics, including Pn, Gs and Tr, were significantly decreased with the increasing combined stresses (P < 0.05). (3) The effects of Cd, N, and their interaction on non-destructive indices and photosynthetic parameters were significant (P < 0.05). (4) The hat was significantly negatively correlated with photosynthetic parameters and the T-3T was significantly positively correlated with photosynthetic parameters (P < 0.05). Therefore, the transpiration transfer coefficient (hat) and\nestimated instant transpiration rate  detecting by infrared thermography device could be indicators to reflect the stress conditions. Based on\nhigh-resolution thermal infrared remote sensing, we developed a new method for health diagnose of mangrove under combined stress.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster.pdf\nSince 2013 we have undertaken annual microgravity and deformation surveys at Laguna del Maule, Chile, to characterise the causes of rapid inflation observed since 2007. The maximum increase in residual gravity is 125 ± 12 microgal between 2013 and 2014, but only 60 ± 15 microgal between 2014 and 2015. The spatial pattern of the gravity anomaly also appears to vary with time. During the 2013-2014 interval, the location of the maximum increase in gravity is near the maximum of the deformation pattern observed by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) between 2007 and 2015 (Le Mével et al. 2015, Geophys. Res. Lett.). During the 2014-2015 interval, the maximum increase in gravity occurs approximately 4 kilometers south west of the center of inflation. Here we present initial source models to explain the observed increases in microgravity. The models are decribed in a framework derived from new spatial Bouguer gravity data, which allows for a better interpretation of time-lapse models. We use a Monte Carlo-type Genetic Algorithm to solve for the optimum source parameters of a range of finite geometry models including spherical, ellipsoidal and sill-like bodies. Finally we compare the finite geometry models to free geometry 3D gravity inversion models. Sources for the 2013-2014 interval locate close to the center of deformation at a depth of approximately 2 to 4 km. Sources for the 2014-2015 interval locate approximately 3 km southwest of the 2013-2014 source, at a similar depth. Positive density contrasts of several hundred kg/m3 are recovered from the source models. The 2013-2014 source locates close to the center of an approximately 15 milliGal Bouguer gravity low while the 2014-2015 source locates close to the edge of the gravity low. Our initial interpretation is that the Bouguer gravity low represents a low density magma body and the 2013-2015 residual microgravity increases represent spatially varying injections of fresh dense magma into that body.",

            "abstract": "Complex bed morphology is deemed necessary to restore salmonid habitats, yet quantifiable metrics that capture channel complexity have remained elusive. This work utilizes high resolution topographic data from the 40 miles of the Trinity River of northern California to determine a suitable metric for characterizing morphological complexity at the reach scale. The study area is segregated into reaches defined by individual riffle pool units or aggregates of several consecutive units. Potential measures of complexity include rugosity and depth statistics such as standard deviation and interquartile range, yet previous research has shown these metrics are scale dependent and subject to sampling density-based bias. The effect of sampling density on the present analysis has been reduced by underrepresenting the high resolution topographic data as a 3’x 3’ raster so that all areas are equally sampled. Standard rugosity, defined as the three-dimensional surface area divided by projected area, has been shown to be dependent on average depth. We therefore define R*, a empirically depth-corrected rugosity metric in which rugosity is corrected using an empirical relationship based on linear regression between the standard rugosity metric and average depth. By removing the dependence on depth using a regression based on the study reach, R* provides a measure reach scale complexity relative to the entire study area. The interquartile range of depths is also depth-dependent, so we defined a non-dimensional metric (IQR*) as the interquartile range dividing by median depth. These are calculated to develop rankings of channel complexity which, are found to closely agree with perceived channel complexity observed in the field. Current efforts combine these measures of morphological complexity with salmonid habitat suitability to evaluate the effects of channel complexity on the various life stages of salmonids. Future work will investigate the downstream sequencing of channel complexity as it relates to high value ecological functioning for salmonid production.",

            "abstract": "The Naval Research Laboratory is studying of the changing Arctic with a focus on ice thickness and distribution variability. The goal is optimization of computer models used to predict sea ice changes. An important part of our study is to calibrate/validate Cryosat-2 ice thickness data prior to its incorporation into new ice forecast models. The footprint of the altimeter over sea-ice is a significant issue in any attempt to ground-truth the data. Along-track footprints are reduced to ~ 300 m by SAR processing of the returns. However, the cross-track footprint is determined by the topography of the surface. Further, the actual return is the sum of the returns from individual reflectors within the footprint making it difficult to interpret the return, and optimize the waveform tracker. We therefore collected a series of grids of scanning LiDAR and radar on sub-satellite tracks over sea-ice that would extend far enough cross-track to capture the illuminated area. The difficulty in the collection of such grids, which are comprised of adjacent overlapping tracks is ice motion of as much as 300 m over the duration of a single flight track (~ 20 km) of data collection. With a typical LiDAR swath width of < 500m adjustment of the survey tracks in near real-time for the ice motion is necessary for a coherent data set. This was accomplished by a an NRL devised photogrammetric method of ice velocity determination. Post-processing refinements resulted in typical track-to-track miss-ties of ~ 1-2 m, much of which could be attributed to ice deformation over the period of the survey. This allows us to reconstruct the ice configuration to the time of the satellite overflight, resulting in a good picture of the surface actually illuminated by the radar. The detailed 2-d LiDAR image is the snow surface, not the underlying ice presumably illuminated by the radar. Our hope is that the 1-D radar profiles collected along the LiDAR swath centerlines will be sufficient to correct the grid for snow thickness.\nA total of 15 grids 5-20 km wide (cross-track) by 10-30 km long (along-track) centered on ice illuminated by CryoSat-2 were collected north of Barrow, AK. This occured over three field seasons which took place from 2013-15. Data from the grids are shown here and are being used to examine the relationship of the tracked satellite waveform data to the actual surface.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - DSM Using Agriculture.ppt.pdf\nEnergy demand management, also known as demand side management (DSM), is the modification of consumer demand for \nenergy\n through various methods such as smart metering, incentive based schemes, payments for turning off loads or rescheduling loads. Usually, the goal of demand side management is to encourage the consumer to use less power during periods of\npeak\n demand, or to move the time of energy use to off-peak times. Peak demand management does not necessarily decrease total \nenergy consumption\n, but could be expected to reduce the need for investments in networks and/or \npower\n plants for meeting peak demands.\nElectricity use can vary dramatically on short and medium time frames, and the pricing system may not reflect the instantaneous cost as additional higher-cost that are brought on-line. In addition, the capacity or willingness of electricity consumers to adjust to prices by altering elasticity of demand may be low, particularly over short time frames. In the scenario of Indian grid setup, the retail customers do not follow real-time pricing and it is difficult to incentivize the utility companies for continuing the peak demand supply. A question for the future is how deeper penetration of renewable will be handled? This is a challenging problem since one has to deal with high variability, while managing loss of load probabilities.\nIn the case of managing the peak demand using agriculture, in the future as smart metering matures with automatic turn on/off for a pump, it will become possible to provide an ensured amount of water or energy to the farmer while keeping the grid energized for 24 hours. Supply scenarios will include the possibility of much larger penetration of solar and wind into the grid. While, in absolute terms these sources are small contributors, their role will inevitably grow but DSM using agriculture could help reduce the capital cost. The other option is of advancing or delaying pump operating cycle even by several hours, will still ensure soil moisture requirements met while, balancing the overall system load with generation, reducing critical power mismatches. Through this presentation the author will describe different techniques and results from field experiments in India.",

            "abstract": "Climatic trends and extensive implementation of drainage tiles in poorly drained agricultural lands have left significant fingerprints on the hydrology and water quality of the receiving streams. Tiles were initially designed to increase the crop productivity by removing excess soil moisture and improving field conditions. However, their hydro-ecological consequences have gradually emerged through observations of enhanced rates of nitrate and phosphorus delivered to the streams, as well as altered runoff volumes and timing. The Redwood River Basin (a 1,800 km2 basin located in southwest Minnesota) is an example of such a system where a considerable switch from small grains to row crops has taken place since 1970’s, driving intensive tile installation culminating in a doubling of tiled length in the past two decades. Long-term hydrologic analysis of this basin shows that the daily streamflow has increased in all months after the land-use change period, and rising limbs of daily hydrographs exhibit increased dependence on precipitation during May-June. In this study we employ the recently developed theory of time-variant travel time distributions within the storage selection function framework to examine the interplay of climate and land-use change on transport dynamics. Comparison of two periods representing the tiled and untiled conditions demonstrates 18-38 days decrease in the mean travel time due to tile drainage during spring-summer, while almost no change is observed during winter showing an overall cyclic behavior over a year. Statistics of the marginal distributions also show less variability in the mean travel time for the tiled period, probably revealing the response of the more constrained engineered system. Furthermore, the relative impact of the climate and the spatial heterogeneity of the soil properties on the travel times are investigated via numerical experiments performed on nested sub-basins under untiled condition. The simulations suggest that climate dynamics have more influence on the distribution of travel times than the soil matrix dispersive properties, leading to much larger travel times in catchments with dry climate. Moreover, the mean travel time was found to be independent of scale above a characteristic upstream contributing area corresponding to approximately 200 km2.",

For the purpose of the present study, 100 Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR; level 0) scenes that were acquired along four tracks and covering a time span of seven years (2004 to 2010) were used. The scenes extend from the Mediterranean coast in the north to Cairo city in the south. These scenes were focused using Repeat Orbit Interferometry PACkage (ROI_PAC) software and the subsequent PSI processing was done using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) method. A low coherence threshold (0.2) was used to decrease the impact of vegetation-related poor coherence and decorrelation of the scenes over the investigated time span. Subsidence was observed over: (1) the Demietta Nile River branch (3 to 14 mm/yr) where it intersects the Mediterranean coastline, (2) thick (~ 40 m) Holocene sediments in lake Manzala (up to 9 mm/yr), (3) reclaimed desert areas (west of Nile Delta; up to 12 mm/yr) of high groundwater extraction, (4) along parts of a previously proposed flexure line (up to 10 mm/yr), and (5) along the eastern sections of the Mediterranean coastline (up to 15.7 mm/yr). The city of Alexandria (underlain by carbonate platform) and the terminus of the Rosetta branch of the Nile River seem to experience almost no ground movement (mean subsidence of 0.28 mm/yr and 0.74 mm/yr respectively) while the cities of Ras Elbar and Port Said (underlain by thick Holocene sediment) exhibit the highest subsidence values (up to 14 mm/yr and 8.5 mm/yr respectively). The city of Cairo has also experienced subsidence in limited areas of up to 7.8 mm/yr. High spatial correlation was also observed between the subsiding areas and the Abu Madi incised valley; the largest gas field in the Nile Delta. Most of the area undergoing subsidence in the Nile Delta is related to sediment compaction and/or groundwater extraction, with other factors such as gas extraction and tectonic drivers correlating with smaller areas.",

            "abstract": "The ENSO growth rate has an annual cycle. The growth rate reaches a minimum in the spring (strongly damped) and increases to a maximum in the fall (weakly growing). This cycle of growth rate results in the spring predictability barrier. In this system, the stochastic forcing imposed before the growth rate minimum has a significantly reduced impact on the eventual El Niño magnitude, while stochastic forcing imposed after the growth rate minimum is more likely to trigger an El Niño event. In this framework, the Westerly Wind Burst (WWB) that occurred in February of 2014 occurred too early. The eastern edge of the warm pool that shifted in response to the WWB quickly returned to its climatological position, reducing the impact of additional noise forcing through the warm pool edge processes associated with state-dependent noise. The lack of additional WWBs doomed the 2014/15 El Niño event to weak status. This is in contrast to what was observed with the 1997/98 and the ongoing 2015 event where the initial WWBs helped condition the ocean for future WWBs. The sum total of the additional forcing provided by WWBs over the period from boreal spring to fall, while the growth rate is increasing, helped to produce the large El Niño events in 1997/98 and the rapidly developing event this year.",

For an additional set of retrospective simulations, ERA Interim Reanalysis from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was also utilized to access forecast uncertainties from the meteorological data used. Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia (MICS-Asia) and National Institute of Environment Research (NIER) Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emission inventories are used for foreign and domestic emissions, respectively. In the study, we evaluate the CMAQ and CAMx model performance during the campaign by comparing the results to the airborne and surface measurements.

            "abstract": "The Amazon floodplain contains a variety of wetland environments which contribute CO2 and CH4 to the regional and global atmospheres. The partial pressure and emission of these greenhouse gases (GHGs) varies: 1) between habitats, 2) seasonally, as the characteristics these habitats changes and 3) diurnally, in response to diurnal stratification. In this study, we investigated the combined influence of these factors on the partial pressure and emission of GHGs in Lago Janauacá, a central Amazon floodplain lake (3o23' S; 60o18' O). All measurements were made between August of 2014 and April of 2015 at two different sites and in three distinct habitats: open water, flooded forest, flooded macrophytes. Concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in air were measured continuously with a cavity enhanced absorption spectrometer, Los Gatos Research´s Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (UGGA). Vertical profiles o pCO2 and pCH4 were measured using the UGGA connected to an electric pump and equilibrator. Diffusive surface emissions were estimated with the UGGA connected to a static floating chamber. To investigate the influence of vertical stratification and mixing on GHG partial pressure and emissions, a meteorological station and submersible sensor chain were deployed at each site. Meteorological sensors included wind speed and direction. The submersible chains included thermistors and oxygen sensors. Depth profiles of partial pressure and diffusive emissions for both CO2 and CH4 varied diurnally, seasonally and between habitats. Both pCO2 and pCH4 were consistently higher in bottom than surface waters with the largest differences occurring at high water when thermal stratification was most stable. Methane emissions and partial pressures were highest at low water while pCO2 and CO2 fluxes were highest during high water periods, with 35% of CO2 fluxes at low water being negative. The highest average surface value of pCO2 (5491 µatm), encountered during rising water, was ~3 times higher than that encountered at low water (1708 µatm). Partial pressures and emissions of both CO2 and CH4 were greatest in open water habitats and consistently higher at night. These patterns reflected the higher levels of wind driven mixing and turbulence in open water environments and higher convective mixing at night which promoted diffusive emission.",

Because of the central role of water vapor (WV) and ozone (O3) in climate change, it is important to understand how accurately these species are represented in reanalyses, and whether or not significant differences exist among the existing global reanalyses.\nThe SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is aimed at improving understanding of reanalysis products and ultimately contributing to future reanalysis developments. In this presentation, we present initial results from the WV and O3 component of S-RIP. Comparisons are made over a range of timescales between the different reanalyses, and between reanalyses and independent observational data from sondes, aircraft, and satellites.\nBecause stratospheric O3 is assimilated in the newer reanalyses, the reanalysis O3 fields are generally found to be in better agreement with independent non-assimilated data. On the other hand, since stratospheric WV data are not currently assimilated, the fidelity of reanalysis WV is sensitive to how accurately the fundamental drivers of stratospheric WV are represented in the reanalyses. We relate differences in reanalysis WV to processes known to affect WV such as tropical tropopause layer temperatures, tape recorder speed of propagation, amplitude of the QBO response, and extent of polar dehydration. Ensemble trajectory runs coupled with a dehydration model are used to analyse WV variability related to these processes, and to assess the self-consistency of the reanalysis WV fields in the stratosphere.",

The extent of the evacuation area was predetermined according to earthquake magnitude, which in this case was severely underestimated primarily due to magnitude saturation experienced with seismic data. Rapid magnitude-estimation schemes that utilize magnitude-scaling relationships based on maximum P-wave amplitude and peak ground displacement require accurate near-field displacements that are difficult to obtain with traditional strong-motion data alone because of baseline offsets at low frequencies. Here we describe a real time seismogeodetic approach that computes accurate near-field broadband displacements and velocities by combining collocated accelerometer data and high-rate GNSS displacement observations. The number of collocated stations currently operating in Western North America is insufficient for routine application of the method, especially for intermediate size events, and expansion is limited by the high cost of observatory-grade accelerometers. To ameliorate this, we have developed an inexpensive MEMS accelerometer package to upgrade established GNSS stations and an SIO Geodetic Module to transmit very-high-rate (10 Hz and greater) displacement and velocity waveforms via on-site precise point positioning. These packages have already been installed at 25 stations in California but have yet to experience a large event. We use experiments on the NEES@UCSD Large High-Performance Outdoor Shake Table to demonstrate the capabilities. We find that the seismogeodetic solutions using the MEMS and 10Hz GNSS data are comparable to those using observatory-grade accelerometers. We describe the expected performance of the MEMS seismogeodetic combination in the field based on these results and the benefits of such seismogeodetic data to earthquake and tsunami early warning.",

GPS satellites transmit L-band microwave signals, which are strongly influenced by water at the surface of the Earth. GPS signals take two different paths: (1) the “direct” signal travels from the satellite to the antenna; (2) the “reflected” signal interacts with the Earth’s surface before travelling to the antenna. The direct signal is used by geophysicists to measure the position of the antenna. By analyzing these GPS data over multiple years, the motion of the site can be estimated. The effects of reflected signals are generally ignored by geophysicists because they are small. This is not happenstance, as significant effort has been made to design and deploy a GPS antenna that suppresses ground reflections.\nOur group has developed a remote sensing technique to retrieve terrestrial water cycle variables from GPS data. We extract the water cycle products from signal strength data that measures the interference between the direct and reflected GPS signals. The sensing footprint is intermediate in scale between in situ observations and most remote sensing measurements. Snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), near surface soil moisture, and an index of vegetation water content are currently estimated from nearly 500 PBO sites. These PBO H2O products are updated daily and are available online (http://xenon.colorado.edu/portal/index.php). Validation studies show that retrieved products are of sufficient quality to be used in a variety of applications. The root mean square error (RMSE) of GPS-based SWE is 2 cm, based on a comparison to snow survey data at nearly 20 GPS sites. The RMSE of near surface volumetric soil moisture is < 0.04 cm3 cm-3, sufficient for validation of SMAP soil moisture and similar products.",

The first mission phase, currently in progress, focuses on reconnection occurring at Earth’s dayside magnetopause. The relevant electron and ion scale processes have never before been fully resolved and differentiated, owing to limitations in the time (thus spatial) resolution available. The Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) was developed for flight on MMS in order to fully resolve 3D plasma distribution functions on both the ion scale and the substantially smaller electron scale. MMS is designed to provide multi-point measurements of fast plasma, electric and magnetic fields, ion composition and energetic particles at the four points of a variably sized tetrahedron. Thus, MMS enables specification of all relevant plasma parameters and their spatial derivatives in order to understand the roles of the various terms in the Generalized Ohm’s Law that governs the plasma behavior at reconnection sites. In this talk, we provide a brief description of FPI and show a sampling of early results, including MMS crossings of the magnetopause.",

Agricultural activity is one of the most important processes driving human-induced land use land cover change (LULCC) in a region. In addition to future socioeconomic changes, climate-induced changes in crop yield represent another important factor shaping agricultural land use. In feedback, the resulting LULCC influences the direction and magnitude of global, regional and local climate change by altering Earth’s radiative equilibrium. Therefore, assessment of climate change impact on future agricultural land use and its feedback is of great importance in climate change study. In this study, to evaluate the feedback of projected land use changes to the regional climate in West Africa, we employed an asynchronous coupling between a regional climate model (RegCM) and a prototype land use projection model (LandPro). The LandPro model, which was developed to project the future change in agricultural land use and the resulting shift in natural vegetation in West Africa, is a spatially explicit model that can account for both climate and socioeconomic changes in projecting future land use changes. In the asynchronously coupled modeling framework, LandPro was run for every five years during the period of 2005-2050 accounting for climate-induced change in crop yield and socioeconomic changes to project the land use pattern by the mid-21st century. Climate data at 0.5˚ was derived from RegCM to drive the crop model DSSAT for each of the five-year periods to simulate crop yields, which was then provided as input data to LandPro. Subsequently, the land use land cover map required to run RegCM was updated every five years using the outputs from the LandPro simulations. Results from the coupled model simulations improve the understanding of climate change impact on future land use and the resulting feedback to regional climate.",

RAM-CPL is the cold plasma component of the ring-current atmosphere interactions suite (RAM-SCB) and describes the evolution of plasma density in the magnetic equatorial plane near Earth. Geomagnetic events observed by the RBSP satellites in different magnetic local time (MLT) sectors enable a comparison of local asymmetries in the input electric field and output densities of these simulations. Using a fluid MHD approach, RAM-CPL reproduces core plasmaspheric densities (L<4) to less than 1 order of magnitude difference. Approximately 80% of plasmapause crossings, defined by a low-density threshold, are reproduced to within a mean radial difference of 0.6 L. RAM-CPL, in conjunction with a best-fit driver, can be used in other studies as an asset to predict density conditions in locations distant from RBSP orbits of interest.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) remains the largest single contributor to the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing with 80% of the emissions originating from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Currently, urban emissions represent about 70% of the global emissions and will very likely increase rapidly as large metropolitan areas are projected to grow twice as fast as the world population in the coming 15 years. Monitoring changes in urban emissions using independent approaches will give an additional assurance to emission reduction efforts and is therefore a critical need for current and future regulation policies. Atmospheric inversion systems are expected to be a promising tool and currently being developed and examined for quantifying/verifying emissions from several cities and metropolitan areas.\nWe propose here an atmospheric inversion-based urban CO2 emission monitoring framework that can be applicable to any locations on the globe. We define the different components of the system including the a priori emission products based on various remote-sensing products globally available and a flexible inverse modeling framework. We developed a nested high resolution configuration on an optimal grid resolution, adapted to specific cities, and present some initial experiments on several megacities with various urban landscapes, both in terms of economic activities, spatial distribution, and local atmospheric dynamics. The system is tested with in-situ measurements from the Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) and compared to existing inverse CO2 emissions estimates. Fine-grained emission inventories that can be used for prior information are likely to be unavailable at many locations of interest. Prior CO2 emissions are thus given using disaggregation of the reported country emissions. We examined several remotely-sensed data such as nighttime light data and impervious surface data to prescribe fine spatial emission structures in urban domains. Finally, we simulate column CO2 observed from carbon observing satellites such as GOSAT and OCO2 and discuss how to utilize those space-based information in our monitoring framework.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Coropuna poster_AGU.pdf\nNevado Coropuna is a large volcanic complex in southern Peru (15.56°S, 72.62°N; 6,425 m). The complex is approximately 12 km east-west and 8 km north-south with elevation from ~4,500 m at the base to over 6,000 m at the highest points. This ice cap is the largest hosted by a volcano in the tropics, and one of the ten biggest ice masses in the tropics. Previous workers have predicted that the Coropuna ice cap will completely melt by 2050. We present a new analysis of historic satellite imagery to test this hypothesis. In this study, ice and snow are classified based on unique spectral signatures including spectral band thresholds, Normalized Difference Snow Index, and Band 4/5 ratio. Landsat scenes (L2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) from 1975 to present in addition to one SPOT scene (2013) are used. Previous workers used images from June and July, which are peak snow periods in southern Peru, leading to overestimates of ice area. This study uses November and December images when snow is at an annual minimum. Annual equilibrium line altitudes are calculated for each end of year image (November/December). The glaciers of Nevado Coropuna were found to be shrinking at ~0.5 km2/yr, which is ~1/3 the rate previously published. In this study, SPOT (1.5 m resolution) and Landsat 7 ETM scenes from November 23 and 26, 2013 respectively were used to calibrate the spectral band threshold classification. While this study suggests that the ice cap of Coropuna will persist until 2100 given current rates, water quantity and security remains a concern for Peruvian agriculture. Coropuna is an active volcano, so it poses great risk to surrounding inhabitants from lahars, flooding, and debris avalanches. Our new data suggest that these will continue to be risks late into this century.",

In turn 4D seismic surveying is a proven tool for CO2 monitoring. At the Ketzin pilot site (Germany) 4D seismic data have been acquired by means of a baseline (pre-injection) survey in 2005 and monitor surveys in 2009 and 2012. At Ketzin CO2 was injected in supercritical state from 2008 to 2013 in a sandstone saline aquifer (Stuttgart Formation) at a depth of about 650 m. The 4D seismic data from Ketzin reflected a pronounced effect of this injection. Seismic forward modeling using results of petrophysical experiments on two core samples fromthe target reservoir confirmed that effects of the injected CO2 on the 4D seismic data are significant. The petrophysical data were used in that modeling in order to reflect changes due to the CO2 injection in acoustic parameters of the reservoir. These petrophysical data were further used for a successful quantitative interpretation of the 4D seismic data at Ketzin. Now logs from a well (drilled in 2012) penetrating the reservoir containing information about changes in the acoustic parameters of the reservoir due to the CO2 injection are available. These logs were used to estimate impact of the petrophysical data on the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the 4D seismic data at Ketzin. New synthetic seismograms were computed using the same software and the same wavelet as the old ones apart from the only difference and namely the changes in the input acoustic parameters would not be affected with any petrophysical experiments anymore. Now these changes were put in computing directly from the logs. In turn the new modelled changes due to the injection in the newly computed seismograms do not include any effects of the petrophysical data anymore. Key steps of the quantitative and qualitative interpretation of the 4D seismic data at the Ketzin pilot site were repeated with these new seismograms. Now the impact of the petrophysical data on the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the 4D seismic data at Ketzin can be estimated.",

The observation shows that the energy flux of the particles increases inside the geosynchronous orbit during substorms. For some night-side events around the apogee, the energy flux of O+ ion enhances below ~10 keV at lower L shell, whereas the flux below ~8 keV sharply decreases at higher L shells. This structure of L-energy spectrogram of flux is observed only for the O+ ions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the generation mechanism of the structure by using numerical simulations.\nWe utilized the global MHD simulation developed by Tanaka et al (2010, JGR) to simulate the electric and magnetic fields during substorms. We performed test particle simulation under the electric and magnetic fields by applying the same model introduced by Nakayama et al. (2015, JGR). In the test particle simulation each test particle carries the real number of particles in accordance with the Liouville theorem. Using the real number of particles, we reconstructed 6-dimensional phase space density and differential flux of O+ ions in the inner magnetosphere.\nWe obtained the following results. (1) Just after the substorm onset, the dawn-to-dusk electric field is enhanced to ~ 20 mV/m in the night side tail region at L > 7. (2) The O+ ions are accelerated and transported to the inner region (L > ~5.5) by the large-amplitude electric field. (3) The reconstructed L-energy spectrogram shows a similar structure to the Van Allen Probes observation. (4) The difference in the flux enhancement between at lower L shell and higher L shells is due to two distinct acceleration processes: adiabatic and non-adiabatic. We will discuss the relationship between the particle acceleration and the structure of L-energy spectrogram of flux enhancement in detail.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes is a central challenge for water management. Commonly, studies on climate-change effects focus on surface flow and feed-backs between surface and subsurface flows are neglected frequently. Furthermore, changes in hydrological processes are generally not distributed realistically. Integrated catchment models, based on partial-differential-equations, have the potential of overcoming these difficulties. However, these models are complicated to use in realistic settings, notably because of their long simulation time. In this presentation, we demonstrate a successful application of an integrated catchment model (HydroGeoSphere) in a semi-arid catchment in north-east Spain. The study area recently underwent a transition to irrigated agriculture, which is reflected in our model evaluations conducted under varying irrigation conditions. To accelerate model calibration, we developed a novel calibration method based on a hierarchy of computational grids. The climate scenarios for the region are based on four regional climate models, which are downscaled using a weather generator. These scenarios are used to estimate climate change impacts on hydrologic parameters in different irrigation settings. The effects of climate change strongly depend on the presence of irrigation. Water table depth and low flows are more sensitive to climate change when irrigation is present, while peak flows exhibit a more pronounced response to climate in scenarios without irrigation. In addition to the climatic means, we examined the impacts of changes in drought conditions. We compare the outcomes of droughts predicted by our hydrological model with simpler approaches based on drought indices. We show that drought indices oversimplify future hydrological impacts of droughts and can result in biased estimation of drought impacts, especially if drought indices do not take temperature changes into account.",

We present such an approach in reconstructing the emplacement, differentiation and cooling history of the Bergell Intrusion (N Italy/SE Switzerland), a normally-zoned pluton preserving a ~10 km mid-crustal transect. U-Pb zircon, titanite and allanite geo-/thermochronology of Bergell granitoids provide key empirical constraints for informing numerical simulations of pulse-wise, incremental assembly. Protracted zircon crystallization histories, representing the time between magma zircon saturation and cooling to the solidus, provide a direct petrologic link to forward models of magma emplacement, both of which can be used to derive quantitative magmatic cooling rates for the middle crust. Titanite and allanite dates provide additional constraints on the timing of solidification. Geochronology and modeling are performed in the context of detailed field and structural observations, including those previously interpreted as evidence of upward, pluton-scale melt migration via floor convergence/roof ballooning. Combined Bergell data and modeling demonstrate that pulsed assembly can lead to the formation of substantial melt reservoirs in the middle crust: this finding is largely in contrast to similar models of shallow crustal plutons, highlighting the importance of factors such as ambient country rock temperature in affecting melt residence timescales. This work emphasizes the importance of implementing joint data/modeling studies to intrusive rocks across the full range of spatial scales, emplacement levels and tectonic settings observed on Earth.",

We include routine emissions from condensate tanks, dehydrators, pneumatic devices, fugitive leaks and liquids unloading. We explore the variability in natural gas emissions from these individual well-pad sources, and find that routine short-term episodic emissions such as tank flashing and liquids unloading result in the appearance of a skewed, or ‘fat-tail’ distribution of emissions, from an individual well-pad over time. Additionally, we explore the expected variability in emissions from multiple wells with different raw gas composition, gas/liquids production volumes and control equipment. Differences in well-level composition, production volume and control equipment translate into differences in well-level emissions leading to a fat-tail distribution of emissions in the absence of operational upsets. Our results have several implications for recent studies focusing on emissions from oil and gas sources.\nTime scale of emission estimates are important and have important policy implications.\nFat tail distributions may not be entirely driven by avoidable mechanical failures, and are expected to occur under routine operational conditions from short-duration emissions (e.g., tank flashing, liquid unloading).\nAn understanding of the expected distribution of emissions for a particular population of wells is necessary to evaluate whether the observed distribution is more skewed than expected.\nTemporal variability in well-pad emissions make comparisons to annual average emissions inventories difficult and may complicate the interpretation of long-term ambient fenceline monitoring data. Sophisticated change detection algorithms will be necessary to identify when true operational upsets occur versus routine short-term emissions.",

            "abstract": "Short-lived halocarbons were measured in Arctic sea-ice brine, seawater and air above the Greenland and Norwegian seas at about 81°N in mid-summer, from a melting ice floe at the edge of the ice pack. In the ice floe, concentrations of C2H5I, 2-C3H7I and CH2Br2 showed significant enhancement in the sea ice brine, of average factors of 1.7, 1.4 and 2.5 times respectively, compared to the water underneath and after normalising to brine volume. Concentrations of mono-iodocarbons in air are the highest ever reported, and our calculations suggest increased fluxes of halocarbons to the atmosphere may result from their sea-ice enhancement. Laboratory measurements suggest that sea-ice diatoms produce iodocarbons in response to salinity stress. Concentrations of halocarbons in the Arctic ice were similar to those in earlier work in Antarctic sea ice that was similarly warm and porous. As climate warms and Arctic sea ice becomes more like that of the Antarctic, our results lead us to expect the production of iodocarbons and so of reactive iodine gases to increase.",

            "abstract": "Nine years of ozone observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and Microwave Limb Sounder have been assimilated into the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 data assimilation system. We investigate the magnitude and spatial distribution of the influence by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tropospheric column ozone (TCO) in the tropics through the middle latitudes. The tropospheric response in the tropics agrees well with previous studies. A newly identified two-lobed response symmetric about the Equator in the western Pacific/Indonesian region is consistent with the large-scale vertical transport. The ozone response is weaker in the middle latitudes, but significant explained variance of the TCO is found over several small regions, including the central United States. However, the sensitivity of TCO to the Niño 3.4 index is significant over a large area of the middle latitudes. The sensitivity maxima and minima coincide with anomalous anti-cyclonic and cyclonic circulations. The associated vertical transport is consistent with the sign of the sensitivity. ENSO related changes to the mean depth of the tropospheric column have little impact on the TCO response in the tropics but can contribute significantly to the midlatitude response. Comparisons to a 22-year chemical transport model simulation demonstrate that these results from the nine-year assimilation are representative of the longer-term. This investigation brings insight to several seemingly disparate prior studies of the El Niño influence on tropospheric ozone in the middle latitudes. In addition, these results are valuable as a process-oriented assessment of the tropospheric response in model simulations.",

The volcanic arc is composed of several immerged volcanic islands (St Kitts, Nevis Montserrat, Basse Terre, Dominica, Martinique, St Lucia, Grenada) and submerged volcanoes (Kick em’Jenny). These volcanoes are known to be explosives and when they are entering in an eruptive cycle, debris flow could potentially initiate a tsunami and generate peculiar deposits within the sedimentary record recognized as tsunami deposits (or tsunamite). Subduction- related earthquakes might also initiate slope instabilities and trigger debris flow. Another controlling factor of slope (in-)-stabilities and debris flow is massive rainfalls. During cyclonic season (June to December), massive rainfalls are recorded in the area, which moreover is located on the trajectory of Atlantic Hurricanes that are responsible for numerous landslides. As a consequence, tsunami deposit are described and well studied in the Lesser Antilles arc as the islands shoreline and coastal plain are perpetually re-shaped by hurricanes responsible for tempestite deposits.\nHowever, the report of these deposit concern recent to actual events, for example present-day deposits consisting of large (metric) boulders, more or less aligned, located in the supralittoral fringe can be observed along Guadeloupe shore. In this study, we investigate the Plio-pleistocene sedimentary sequence of Grande Terre carbonate platform (Guadeloupe), and track the presence of such extreme-event related deposits and discuss our findings in the frame of the Lesser Antilles geological context.",

            "abstract": "A representation of integrated surface-subsurface hydrology is the central component to process-rich watershed models that are emerging as alternatives to traditional reduced complexity models. These physically based systems are important for assessing potential impacts of climate change and human activities on groundwater-dependent ecosystems and water supply and quality. Integrated surface-subsurface models typically couple three-dimensional solutions for variably saturated flow in the subsurface with the kinematic- or diffusion-wave equation for surface flows. The computational scheme for coupling the surface and subsurface systems is key to the robustness, computational performance, and ease-of-implementation of the integrated system. A new, robust approach for coupling the subsurface and surface systems is developed from the assumption that the vertical gradient in head is negligible at the surface. This tight-coupling assumption allows the surface flow system to be incorporated directly into the subsurface system; effects of surface flow and surface water accumulation are represented as modifications to the subsurface flow and accumulation terms but are not triggered until the subsurface pressure reaches a threshold value corresponding to the appearance of water on the surface. The new approach has been implemented in the highly parallel PFLOTRAN (www.pflotran.org) code. Several synthetic examples and three-dimensional examples from the Walker Branch Watershed in Oak Ridge TN demonstrate the utility and robustness of the new approach using unstructured computational meshes. Representation of solute transport in the new approach is also discussed.

Plasma with turbulently fluctuating magnetic and velocity fields can be generated using a plasma gun source and launched into a flux-conserving cylindrical tunnel. No background magnetic field is applied so internal fields are allowed to evolve dynamically. Point measurements of magnetic and velocity fluctuations yield broadband power-law spectra with a steepening breakpoint indicative of the onset of a dissipation scale. The frequency range at which this steepening occurs can be correlated to the ion inertial scale of the plasma, a length which is characteristic of the size of current sheets in MHD plasmas and suggests a connection to dissipation. Observation of non-Gaussian intermittent jumps in magnetic field magnitude and angle along with measurements of ion temperature bursts suggests the presence of current sheets embedded within the turbulent plasma, and possibly even active reconnection sites. Additionally, structure function analysis coupled with appeals to fractal scaling models support the hypothesis that current sheets are associated with dissipation in this system.",

In collaboration with geocellular and multiphase modeling, detailed characterization of the Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone (LMSS), a reservoir utilized for carbon capture storage, is supporting data-driven conceptual models to better understand reservoir heterogeneity and its relationship to reservoir properties. This includes characterization of sedimentary facies and pore scale modeling of the reservoir\nThe Cambrian-age Lower Mt. Simon Sandstone (LMSS) is a reservoir utilized for two-different carbon capture storage projects in the Illinois Basin, USA. The LMSS is interpreted to have formed in a braided river environment comprising a hierarchy of stratification, with larger scale depositional facies comprising assemblages of smaller scale facies. The proportions, geometries, length scales, and petrophysical attributes of the depositional facies, and of the textural facies they comprise, are being quantified. Based on examination of core and analog outcrop in adjacent areas, the LMSS is comprised of five dominant depositional facies, the most abundant facies being planar to trough cross-bedded sandstones produced by subaqueous sand dunes. This facies has the best reservoir conditions with porosity up to 27% and permeability up to 470 mD. Three-dimensional pore network modeling via micro computed tomography of this facies shows well-connected and unobstructed pore throats and pore space. This presentation will outline the depositional heterogeneity of the LMSS, its relationship to diagenetic fabrics, and its influence on fluid movement within the reservoir.",

            "abstract": "A scrutiny of heterogeneity at the UK’s Source Area BioREmediation (SABRE) test site is presented to better understand how spatial heterogeneity in subsurface properties and process occurrence may constrain performance of enhanced in-situ bioremediation (EISB). The industrial site contained a 25 to 45 year old trichloroethene (TCE) dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) that was exceptionally well monitored via a network of multilevel samplers and high resolution core sampling. Moreover, monitoring was conducted within a 3-sided sheet-pile cell that allowed a controlled streamtube of flow to be drawn through the source zone by an extraction well. We primarily focus on the longitudinal transect of monitoring along the length of the cell that provides a 200 groundwater point sample slice along the streamtube of flow through the DNAPL source zone. TCE dechlorination is shown to be significant throughout the cell domain, but spatially heterogeneous in occurrence and progress of dechlorination to lesser chlorinated ethenes – it is this heterogeneity in dechlorination that we primarily scrutinise. We illustrate the diagnostic use of the relative occurrence of TCE parent and daughter compounds to confirm: dechlorination in close proximity to DNAPL and enhanced during the bioremediation; persistent layers of DNAPL into which gradients of dechlorination products are evident; fast flowpaths through the source zone where dechlorination is less evident; and, the importance of underpinning flow regime understanding on EISB performance. Still, even with such spatial detail, there remains uncertainty over the dataset interpretation. These includes poor closure of mass balance along the cell length for the multilevel sampler based monitoring and points to needs to still understand lateral flows (even in the constrained cell), even greater spatial resolution of point monitoring and potentially, not easily proven, ethene degradation loss.",

            "abstract": "Alfvenic current systems are a ubiquitous feature of planetary magnetospheres that can be generated by several mechanisms including the braking of flows (e.g. associated with reconnection at substorm onset) and via moon-planet interactions. The energetic electrons needed to carry the field-aligned currents are generally thought to be accelerated on either electron inertial or ion acoustic gyroradius scale lengths in the limit of inertial and kinetic Alfven waves respectively. Recent 2D dipolar hybrid gyrofluid-kinetic electron simulations of kinetic Alfven waves (Damiano et al., JGR, 2015), associated with the braking of fast flows in the terrestrial magnetotail, have illustrated that hot ion effects can act to limit the extent of the parallel current (all along the field line) from what would be expected in the cold ion limit. This correspondingly affects the characteristics of the electron energization, reducing both the parallel elongation in the electron distribution function associated with electron trapping in the kinetic Alfven wave regime and the extent of high energy tails evident in the inertial Alfven wave region above the ionosphere. In this presentation, we build on these initial simulation results analyzing the characteristics of the parallel current system and electron acceleration (associated with both inertial and kinetic Alfven waves) for a range of wave amplitudes and ratios of the electron to ion temperature. One finding is that for a given ion temperature, increasing wave amplitude recovers some of the features of the electron energization evident in the cold ion limit, but this is modulated by the effect of wave energy dispersion perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. These results will be summarized and the relevance and extension of this work to consider Alfvenic aurora in the Jupiter magnetosphere (e.g. via either interchange motion or the Io-Jupiter interaction) will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has enabled unprecedented scientific discovery in a variety of physical Earth sciences. However, with the launch of GRACE Follow-On not taking place until 2017 and the declining health of the current GRACE satellites, it is necessary to cultivate the ability to estimate the Earth’s gravity field without the full suite of GRACE measurements. Using a single GRACE satellite, equipped with an accelerometer and a GPS receiver, as well as a compliment of SLR satellites, large-scale features of the Earth’s gravity field can be determined. While the accuracy of such solutions are noticeably degraded relative to the nominal GRACE product and smaller-scale features of the Earth’s gravity field are impossible to discern without the use of GRACE’s satellite-to-satellite (SST) tracking measurements, single satellite solutions do capture continental scale variations in the Earth’s gravitational field. These large-scale variations can be used to track global trends such as polar ice loss and water storage, in the event of a gap between GRACE and GRACE Follow-On. In addition, the lessons learned from gravity field solutions computed using only GRACE GPS data provide valuable insight into the optimal combination of GPS data with SST for GRACE Follow-On and other future missions.",

            "abstract": "In a changing terrestrial climate, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to quantify Earth systems cycles, including thecarbon cycle. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue toincrease as a result of anthropogenic activity, but less is understood about how forest systems will affect the carbon cycle. In practice, it is difficult to measure carbon flux in a forest system. Flux towers, satellite and remote sensing methods, and dynamic vegetation models have been used to quantify current and future forest net primary productivity.\nTree rings provide us with information about forest carbon storage in the past, and have been used to reconstruct above ground biomass increment (aBI). However, uncertainty from measurement error, assumptions about tree architecture including circular stems and diameter-volume relationships, and the fading record - the challenge of quantifying the growth of previously live trees - are often not accounted for. As a first step towards reconstructing aBI and its uncertainty, we develop a tree ring sampling protocol and a Bayesian hierarchical model toestimate aBI while accounting for measurement and architecture uncertainty.\nTree-ring and repeated census plot data have been collected from several sites using a protocol that allows us toquantify growth dependence across trees in a local area. We also use multiple cores per tree to investigate the number of cores needed to reduce uncertainty from the assumption of stem circularity. For short-time-scale reconstructions, we avoid the fading record issue by coring dead trees and co-locating tree-ring data with censuses, thus avoiding having to make assumptions about stand density andmortality. We also statistically investigate the importance of including census data and of coring dead trees to quantify how uncertainty and bias are affected as we go back further in time. Preliminary results show that the model is able to estimate yearly variation in aBI well for many decades when census data are available. Estimates without census data are accurate for approximately 40 years before the fading record introduces biases in second growth forests dominated by 1-2 tree species.",

            "abstract": "The Indo-Burma fold-thrust belt (FTB) in northeast India and Myanmar records shortening of a forearc prism resulting from ongoing collision of the Burma microplate and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. A >5 km thick succession of deep water, deltaic and tidal as well as fluvial deposits that span the Oligocene to present were deformed to form a ~400 km wide FTB between 91.5-96°E longitude. India-Eurasia convergence across the Indo-Burma region trends northeast and is highly oblique to the northerly structural trend of the FTB. According to geodetic data, 21 mm/yr of dextral shear and 18 mm/yr of approximately east-west shortening must be accommodated within the FTB between the active thrust front in Bangladesh (90.5°E) and the Sagaing Fault in Myanmar (96°E). This paper presents new surface geologic data collected along a ~250 km transect that crosses 15 anticline-syncline pairs between the cities of Argatala (~91.2°E) and Champhai (93.3°E), the part of FTB exposing syn-Himalayan sediment, to determine the degree of noncoaxial shear that is accommodated internally within the belt. Results indicate that the majority of the folds are upright or asymmetric horizontal folds that are either concentric or have a narrow hinge (chevron folds) and form open—closed interlimb angles which generally tighten from the foreland toward the hinterland. A cylindrical best fit describes the data well and shows dominantly east-west shortening with a horizontal north-trending regional fold axis (005/01 ± 2°). Shortening was partly accommodated by flexural slip. Flexural slip-lineations (n=32) are subperpendicular to the regional fold axis. In some locations the limbs of folds are breached by thrust faults that dip either east or west and strike north. Incremental strain axes calculated from the flexural-slip surfaces and thrust faults (n=61) indicate horizontal west-trending shortening (279/03 ± 8°) and vertical extension that is kinematically compatible with folding. Altogether, contractional structures that formed internally within the FTB are indicative of east-west horizontal shortening and plane strain. This result suggests that the dextral component of shear measured by geodetic data is primarily partitioned onto discrete right-lateral strike-slip faults such as the Churachandpur-Mao and Kabaw faults.",

            "abstract": "Leaks in natural gas infrastructure release methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The estimated fugitive emission rate associated with the production phase varies greatly between studies, hindering our understanding of the natural gas energy efficiency. This study presents a new application of inverse methodology for estimating regional fugitive emission rates from natural gas production. Methane observations across the Marcellus region in northeastern Pennsylvania were obtained during a three week flight campaign in May 2015 performed by a team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Division and the University of Michigan. In addition to these data, CH4 observations were obtained from automobile campaigns during various periods from 2013-2015. An inventory of CH4 emissions was then created for various sources in Pennsylvania, including coalmines, enteric fermentation, industry, waste management, and unconventional and conventional wells. As a first-guess emission rate for natural gas activity, a leakage rate equal to 2% of the natural gas production was emitted at the locations of unconventional wells across PA. These emission rates were coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the chemistry module (WRF-Chem) and atmospheric CH4 concentration fields at 1km resolution were generated. Projected atmospheric enhancements from WRF-Chem were compared to observations, and the emission rate from unconventional wells was adjusted to minimize errors between observations and simulation. We show that the modeled CH4 plume structures match observed plumes downwind of unconventional wells, providing confidence in the methodology. In all cases, the fugitive emission rate was found to be lower than our first guess. In this initial emission configuration, each well has been assigned the same fugitive emission rate, which can potentially impair our ability to match the observed spatial variability. The current model also does not distinguish between natural gas emissions during the different stages of transportation. We finally discuss the use of additional tracers such as the 13CH4 isotopic ratio and ethane concentrations to separate the various contributors to the regional atmospheric CH4 enhancement.",

            "abstract": "Lunar surface maturity is consistently examined using the NIR optical maturity parameter (OMAT) [1]. However, the NIR only provides a perspective of the upper microns of the lunar surface. Recent studies of Lunar Prospector (LP) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data sets are now demonstrating additional measures of maturity with sensitivities to greater depths (~2 m) in the regolith. These include thermal infrared, S-band radar, and epithermal neutron data sets [2-4]. Interestingly, each of these parameters is directly comparable to OMAT despite each measuring slightly different aspects of the regolith. This is demonstrated by Lawrence et al. [3] where LP-measured non-polar highlands epithermal neutrons trend well with albedo, OMAT, and the Christensen Feature (CF). Lawrence et al. [3] used these data to derive and map highlands hydrogen (H) which is dominantly a function of H-implantation. With this in mind, areas of enriched-H are mature, while areas of depleted H are immature. Surface roughness as measured by S-band radar [4], also provides a measure of maturity. In this case, the circular polarization ratio (CPR) is high when rough and immature, and low when smooth and mature. Knowing this, one can recognize areas in the non-polar lunar highlands that show contradictory measures of maturity. For example, while many lunar localities show consistently immature albedo, OMAT, CF, CPR, and H concentrations (e.g., Tycho), others do not. Orientale basin is the most prominent example, shown to have immature CPR, CF, and H concentrations despite a relatively mature albedo and OMAT values as well as an old age determination (~3.8 Ga). To better understand how the lunar regolith is weathering in the upper 1-2 m of regolith with time we examine the Orientale basin relative to other highlands regions.\n[1] Lucey et al.

The NSF/NCAR GV employed standard flight-level measurements and new airborne lidar and imaging measurements of gravity waves (GWs) from sources at lower altitudes throughout the stratosphere and into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The new GV lidars included a Rayleigh lidar measuring atmospheric density and temperature from ~20-60 km and a sodium resonance lidar measuring sodium density and temperature at ~75-105 km. An airborne Advanced Mesosphere Temperature Mapper (AMTM) and two IR “wing” cameras imaged the OH airglow temperature and/or intensity fields extending ~900 km across the GV flight track. The DLR Falcon was equipped with its standard flight-level instruments and an aerosol Doppler lidar measuring radial winds below the Falcon. DEEPWAVE also included extensive ground-based measurements in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Southern Ocean Islands.\nDEEPWAVE performed 26 GV flights and 13 Falcon flights, and ground-based measurements occurred whether or not the aircraft were flying. Collectively, many diverse cases of GW forcing, propagation, refraction, and dissipation spanning altitudes of 0-100 km were observed. Examples include strong mountain wave (MW) forcing and breaking in the lower and middle stratosphere, weak MW forcing yielding MW penetration into the MLT having very large amplitudes and momentum fluxes, MW scales at higher altitudes ranging from ~10-250 km, large-scale trailing waves from orography refracting into the polar vortex and extending to high altitudes, GW generation by deep convection, large-scale GWs arising from jet stream sources, and strong MWs in the MLT arising from strong surface flow over a small island. DEEPWAVE yielded a number of surprises, among them the tendency for very strong MLT responses under weak forcing conditions, frequent GW penetration to the highest altitudes, and often remarkable abilities of the various forecast models to provide good qualitative agreement with observed GW fields for those sources that were resolved, especially orography and jet streams.",

In particular, measurements from the SAGE instruments, UARS MLS, UARS HALOE, and most recently Aura MLS, have provided overlapping data since 1984. In order to quantify interannual- to decadal-scale variability in water vapor and ozone, it is necessary to have a uniform and homogenous record over the period of interest. With this in mind, we merged the aforementioned satellite measurements to create the Stratospheric Water and Ozone Satellite Homogenized (SWOOSH) data set, which contains vertically resolved zonal-mean (2.5°) monthly-mean water vapor and ozone concentration at levels covering the stratosphere.\nIn this presentation, we describe the process of merging the satellite data sets, which involves adjusting the data to a reference measurement using offsets calculated from coincident observations taken during instrument overlap periods. Uncertainties associated with individual measurement precision, geophysical variability, and the merging process are quantified and compared to one another. We show that while the SWOOSH data can be used to quantify interannual variability, quantifying long-term trends in SWOOSH is complicated by the various sources of uncertainty, as well as by potential drifts of individual instruments. The issue of satellite-derived trends is discussed in relation to the long-term record of balloon-borne frostpoint hygrometer measurements from Boulder, CO.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is the primary source of surface water in the western United States and for approximately one sixth of the global population. Climate change is altering the magnitude of the mountain snowpack and the timing and rate of snowmelt. We ask how these changes to the mountain snowpack impact how snowmelt is partitioned between evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow across the western United States. We hypothesize that rapid snowmelt is able to quickly satisfy atmospheric demand for water and bring the soil column to field capacity, inducing infiltration past the root zone and generating streamflow. We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model run at 1/16 of a degree from 1950-2013 using a gridded meteorological data set to simulate snow water equivalent (SWE), ET, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and baseflow (Qbf). We compute long-term ET/precipitation (P) and PET/P ratios to derive a simulated streamflow anomaly for each model grid cell using the Budyko framework. We use changes in simulated SWE to compute the long-term average snowmelt rate for each model grid cell. Simulation results show a significant positive relationship between snowmelt rate and simulated streamflow anomaly (r2=0.321, p<0.001). There is also a significant, non-linear relationship between snowmelt rate and simulated Qbf/P (r2=0.73, p<0.001) showing that grid cells with rapid snowmelt partition more water to Qbf. Furthermore, we see that grid cells with high Qbf/P have correspondingly high streamflow anomalies (r2=0.52, p<0.001). This shows that rapid snowmelt causes greater infiltration below the rooting zone to produce streamflow and positive streamflow anomalies within the Budyko framework, confirming our hypothesis. Due to these relationships, we can expect early, slower snowmelt driven by climate change to produce less streamflow across the western United States.",

            "abstract": "Objectives for management of forest ecosystems on public land incorporate a focus on maintenance and restoration of ecological functions through silvicultural manipulation of forest structure. The spatial pattern of residual trees – the horizontal element of structure – is a key component of ecological restoration prescriptions. We tested the ability of a simple LiDAR individual tree segmentation method – the watershed transform – to generate spatial pattern metrics similar to those obtained by the traditional method – ground-based stem mapping – on forested plots representing the structural diversity of a large wilderness area (Yosemite NP) and a large managed area (Sierra NF) in the Sierra Nevada, Calif. Most understory and intermediate-canopy trees were not detected by the LiDAR segmentation; however, LiDAR- and field-based assessments of spatial pattern in terms of tree clump size distributions largely agreed. This suggests that (1) even when individual tree segmentation is not effective for tree density estimates, it can provide a good measurement of tree spatial pattern, and (2) a simple segmentation method is adequate to measure spatial pattern of large areas with a diversity of structural characteristics. These results lay the groundwork for a LiDAR tool to assess clumping patterns across forest landscapes in support of restoration silviculture. This tool could describe spatial patterns of functionally intact reference ecosystems, measure departure from reference targets in treatment areas, and, with successive acquisitions, monitor treatment efficacy.",

            "abstract": "Inland retreat of sea cliffs in response to post LGM (last glacial maximum) sea-level rise is an ongoing process that affects coastal environments and communities worldwide. Here, we examine a globally recurring pattern where reported sea-cliff retreat rates since the 20th century often appear to exceed longer-term millennial-scale (‘background’) rates that rarely exceed ~0.1 m/yr. Focusing on Israel’s 30-km-long Mediterranean ‘Sharon’ sea-cliff as a case study we demonstrate that such apparent increase in rates may also reflect a widely acknowledged sampling bias in geologic rate estimates inferred from observation time windows (‘Tobs’) shorter than process episodicity. We show that this possible bias leads to an ambiguity in conventional rate estimates obtained by averaging observed retreat distances over Tobs, and that as a result despite ubiquitous and robust observations of cliff retreat since the 20th century (e.g., aerial photographs) recent/current retreat rates for many of the world’s episodically retreating sea cliffs remain essentially unknown. To address this present limitation in our ability to detect and quantify recent changes in sea-cliff retreat rates we use airborne LiDAR to measure the continuous wave-driven volumetric erosion of collapsed material from the cliff base as an effective upper-bound constraint for the m/yr rate of episodic retreat of the cliff itself. We find that while conventional retreat rate estimates since the 20th century along the Sharon sea cliff artefactually increase up to several m/yr as an inverse function of Tobs, the LiDAR-constrained retreat rates are not susceptible to this sampling bias, are comparable to the cliff’s background retreat rate of 0.03-0.07 m/yr since the mid Holocene and thus indicate no recent acceleration in retreat. This ability to unambiguously constrain sea-cliff retreat rates with annual to decadal-scale observations directly impacts the global-scale push to quantify, better understand and ultimately predict the response of sea cliff erosion and retreat to recent/projected changes in environmental conditions such as sea-level, climate, near-shore ocean dynamics and anthropogenic influences.",

            "abstract": "GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) is rather sophisticated algorithm was developed recently by Dubovik et al. (2011, 2014) with objective of achieving more complete and accurate aerosols and surface retrieval. Specifically, GPASP searches in continuous space of solutions and doesn't utilize look-up-tables. It based on highly elaborated statistically optimized fitting. For example, it uses multi-pixel retrieval when statistically optimized inversion is implemented simultaneously for a group of satellite pixels. This allows using additional a priori information about limited variability of aerosol of surface properties in time and/or space. As a result, GRASP doesn't use any specific information about aerosol or surface type in the each observed pixel, and the results are essentially driven by observations. However GRASP retrieval takes longer computational time compare to most conventional algorithms that is the main practical challenge of employing GRASP for massive data processing. Nonetheless, in last two years, GRASP has been significantly optimized and adapted to operational needs. As a result of this optimization, GRASP has been accelerated to the level acceptable for processing large volumes of satellite observations. Recently GRASP has been applied to multi-years archives of PARASO/POLDER and ENVISAT/MERIS. Based, on the preliminary analysis GRASP results are very promising for comprehensive characterization of aerosol even for observations over bright surfaces and for monitoring very high aerosol loading events (with AOD 2 or 3). In addition, it was made the attempts to estimate such aerosol characteristics as aerosol height, air mass, radiative forcing, aerosol type, etc. The results and illustrations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is theoretically the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a given size storm area at a particular geographical location at a certain time of the year. It is used to develop inflow flood hydrographs, known as Probable Maximum Flood (PMF), as design standard for high-risk flood-hazard structures, such as dams and nuclear power plants. PMP estimation methodology was developed in the 1930s and 40s when many dams were constructed in the US. The procedures to estimate PMP were later standardized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1973 and revised in 1986.\nIn the US, PMP estimates were published in a series of Hydrometeorological Reports (e.g., HMR55A, HMR57, and HMR58/59) by the National Weather Service since 1950s. In these reports, storm data up to 1980s were used to establish the current PMP estimates. Since that time, we have acquired additional meteorological data for 30 to 40 years, including newly available radar and satellite based precipitation data. These data sets are expected to have improved data quality and availability in both time and space. In addition, significant numbers of extreme storms have occurred and selected numbers of these events were even close to or exceeding the current PMP estimates, in some cases. \nIn the last 50 years, climate science has progressed and scientists have better and improved understanding of atmospheric physics of extreme storms. However, applied research in estimation of PMP has been lagging behind. Alternative methods, such as atmospheric numerical modeling, should be investigated for estimating PMP and associated uncertainties. It would be highly desirable if regional atmospheric numerical models could be utilized in the estimation of PMP and their uncertainties, in addition to methods used to originally develop PMP index maps in the existing hydrometeorological reports.

            "abstract": "In Northwest China, an extremely dry region, more than 20,000 mountain glaciers are developed. Glacial melt water is vital for local water resources, ecosystem in the lower reaches, peoples’ living and city development there. During the past several decades, due to climate warming, the most glaciers in NW China are in a state of rapid retreating. To obtain the general idea on response of glaciers in that region, Tianshan Glaciological Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences selected more than ten glaciers in six sub-regions along Altai Mountain, Tianshan and Qilian Mountain, respectively, doing in-situ observations. Based on field observation and remote sensing technique, this study has revealed that the area reductions in different regions range between 8.8%~34.2 % during the past four decades. The potential impact of the glacier recession on water resource in future will be spatially different. For the Tarim River, the glacier runoff is estimated to maintain its current level or increase somewhat in next 30~50 years. In the north slope of Tianshan, the glaciers with a size smaller than 1 km2 are most likely to be melted away in next 20~40 years, and those larger than 5 km2 are melting intensively. In eastern Xinjiang, because the number of the glaciers is small and also because the climate is extremely dry, the glacier retreating are causing the water shortage problem. For Ili River and Irtysh River, because they are dominant by snow melt runoff, the impact of the glacier shrinkage and temperature rise would be limited on the quantity of the river runoff, but significant on the annual distribution of the river runoff. For Qilian Mountains, glaciers are quite small. The vanishing of small glacier will have significant impact on local water resources in near future.",

The pore space is represented using a large number of interconnected pore elements of different sizes. Flow and transport of chemical components are simulated within each pore element by taking into account advective and diffusive transport processes, as well as both equilibrium and kinetic type chemical reactions.\nWe will show how regime of flow and reaction (characterized using Péclet number and Damköhler number) results in different responses such as uniform dissolution, shaper front dissolution as well as formation of channels or wormholes. Each of these reaction regimes affects pore-size distribution differently controlling two-phase hydraulic proprieties.\nFigure descriptions:\nFigure 1: Porosity-hydraulic conductivity relation, due to dissolution, for different flow rates (Péclet Number).

California soil carbon pool estimates taken to 1 m typically vary between 95 and 260 Mg-C/ha depending on land use with a mean of 133 Mg-C/ha (Soil Survey Staff, 2013). Previously unaccounted for deep C pools (1-3m) are generally considered to have low carbon contents and be stable C pools. This study assessed these deep carbon pools associated with alluvial floodplain soils that are transitioning from agricultural production to restoration of native vegetation. The study site covers approximately 400 ha of riparian and floodplain systems along the Cosumnes River in the Central Valley of California. Surface soils (0-0.15m) and subsurface soils (0.15-3m) were collected and analyzed for C and N. Subsurface soils were found to have significantly more C than most California soil carbon stocks with nearly half of total C residing from 1-3m. Burial of sediments resulting from flooding is most likely the key process for the observed storage of large quantities of C in these soils as is seen in apparent buried horizons found at approximately 1 m in 14 of 25 subsurface boreholes (> 0.15 m). In addition, past marsh and riparian habitat would have promoted high C inputs prior to burial. Floodplain soils are highly complex and therefore are not considered homogenous. In spite of this, considerable amounts of C were found to be sequestered at depths greater than 1 m even in soils without a C concentration indicative of a buried O-horizon which suggests that these soils have significant amounts of unaccounted for C as well as the potential for future long term C storage when seasonal inundation is restored.",

            "abstract": "It is unknown when Earth’s dynamo magnetic field originated. With crystallization ages ranging from 3.0-4.38 Ga, detrital zircon crystals found in the Jack Hills of Western Australia might preserve a record of the missing first billion years of Earth’s magnetic field history. Recently, Tarduno et al. (2015) argued that magnetization in Jack Hills zircons provides evidence for a substantial geomagnetic field dating back to their U/Pb formation ages (3.3 and 4.2 Ga). However, the identification of such ancient field records requires establishing that the zircons have avoided remagnetization since their formation. At a minimum, it should be demonstrated that they have not been remagnetized since being deposited at ~3.0 Ga. To establish the timing and intensity of the metamorphic and alteration events experienced by the zircon, we conducted 12 paleomagnetic field tests in combination with U-Pb geochronology on their host rocks (see Weiss et al. 2015, EPSL). Our data show that the Hadean zircon-bearing rocks and surrounding region have been pervasively remagnetized, with the final major overprinting likely from emplacement of the Warakurna large igneous province at 1.1 Ga (see Figure).\nEven if some Jack Hills zircons do record a pre-depositional magnetization, they still could have been remagnetized sometime during the 1.4 Gy between their crystallization and their deposition. First, the temperatures capable of remagnetizing magnetite inclusions are well below those that could reset a U-Pb date or result in significant discordance. Therefore, thermal events capable of completely remagnetizing Jack Hills zircons could be undetected by the techniques reported by Tarduno at al. (2015).\nSecond, the zircons’ magnetization might be dominated by secondary ferromagnetic inclusions or contamination. To address the latter possibility, we are conducting electron microscopy, x-ray tomography, and magnetic field mapping on the zircons. Our initial quantum diamond magnetometry high-resolution (<20 um) imaging has found that the magnetization of many zircons resides in grain exteriors, suggesting a dominantly secondary origin. We conclude that there is currently no robust evidence for pre-depositional (>3.0 Ga) magnetization in the Jack Hills detrital zircons. We are continuing to search for such magnetic records.",

Anthropogenic nitrogen loading may alter greenhouse gas (GHG, including CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions and carbon sequestration in salt marshes. We measured GHG emissions biweekly for two growing seasons across a nitrogen-loading gradient of four Spartina salt marshes in Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. In addition, we conducted nitrogen addition experiments in a pristine marsh by adding low and high nitrate bi-weekly during the summer. The GHG flux measurements were made in situ with a state-of-the-art mobile gas measurement system using the cavity ring down technology that consists of a CO2/CH4 analyzer (Picarro) and an N2O/CO analyzer (Los Gatos). We observed strong seasonal variations in greenhouse gas emissions. The differences in gas emissions across the nitrogen gradient (between 1 and 10 gN m-2y-1) were not significant, but strong pulse emissions of N2O were observed after nitrogen was artificially added to the marsh. We found that the studied salt marsh was a significant carbon sink (NEP ~ 380 gC m-2y-1). CH4 fluxes are 3 orders of magnitude less than CO2 fluxes in the salt marsh. Carbon fluxes are driven by light, salinity, tide, and temperature. We conclude that restoration or conservation of this carbon sink has a significant social benefit for carbon credit.",

            "abstract": "Double ITCZ phenomena (dITCZ) occur in the east Pacific mainly during boreal spring. In our recent studies, 5 different states of the phenomenon could be distinguished from daily satellite observations during 1981-2012: 1) northern, 2) southern, 3) double, 4) equatorial and 5) non-present ITCZ. Analyses on a climatological time-scale suggest that interactions exist between the dITCZ and the large-scale tropical climate (e.g. Haffke et al, paperID A51E-3087, AGU 2014). In this work, we aim to quantify the influence of the dITCZ on vegetation in tropical regions.\nWe use 32 years of vegetation index data (GIMMS NDVI-3g) and 3 precipitation datasets derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis data, namely: a) the monthly average of ERA precipitation data, b) the monthly average over 32 years and c) the monthly average over 32 years weighted proportional to the occurrences of the 5 ITCZ states. For each dataset, we calculate the temporal correlation with the NDVI. As an indicator quantifying the influence of the dITCZ phenomena on the vegetation, we calculate an improvement factor in NDVI prediction capability when using ITCZ-weighted precipitation as compared to unweighted averaged precipitation (a factor of 1 indicates a prediction capability equivalent to the real precipitation; a factor of 0 indicates a prediction capability equivalent to the average precipitation, i.e. no improvement). This is done by calculating the ratio of the differences between the correlations of c) and b) with the NDVI and the correlations of a) and b) with the NDVI, respectively.\nOur initial investigations show strong interactions of ITCZ-weighted precipitation and NDVI on the west coast of South America (i.e. Peru; Ecuador including Galapagos Islands), where 50% - 80% of the precipitation-induced vegetation variability can be explained by the dITCZ phenomena (see figure). In the rest of South America values reach up to 20%. In Africa, influences are rather small/noisy (minor improvements at the horn of Africa; however, degradations in Kenya, i.e. factor < 0). In Oceania/Australia, some regions suggest positive interactions of the dITCZ and the NDVI, most prominent on the east coast of Borneo with up to 30%. Finally, we present the large-scale dITCZ as a potential indicator for variations in vegetation patterns on a global scale in tropical ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of ecosystem response to changing environment have been improved by the convergence of observational and experimental approaches that allow disentangling mechanisms involved and large scale subsequent patterns. However, such approaches often face context-dependence of underlying processes, and a major challenge of community ecology is to deepen our understanding of this context-dependency for reliable upscaling.\nHere we used the results from several transplant experiments of heath communities in the Northern Fennoscandian during the last two decades to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic drivers and the plant functional response. The plant community composition of blocks of heath vegetation from diverse origins transplanted in contrasted abiotic and biotic conditions was monitored from 6 to 23 years depending on the design.\nConsidering both abiotic severity and biotic environment, the transplantation along altitudinal gradient constituted major habitat perturbation, in particular for communities from the mountain tundra vulnerable to strong functional shift. In addition, the joint effects of multiple drivers associated to grazing pressure and abiotic micro heterogeneity resulted in divergent community in the long-term. However, the different factors operated on different temporal scales. The vegetation depending on their origin and functional type also showed contrasted patterns from immediate and transient response to strong biological inertia.\nOur results reveal the potential for alternative response of plant communities depending on the interplay between the multiple drivers and the functional attributes of the vegetation. This interplay should drive plant communities toward divergent alternative states, but our ability to extrapolate longer-term trajectories from partial dynamics is challenged by the temporal differences in drivers pressure and plant response. The responses to manipulation appear as successional processes and long-term experiments might be inescapable to bridge process and pattern in the response of ecosystem to changing environment.",

            "abstract": "Alarcon Rise is a ~50km long spreading segment and the northernmost of the East Pacific Rise. A near-continuous spectrum of lava compositions from basalt to rhyolite occur in the northern section of the Rise along a ~8km fault-lineament, with a rhyolite dome (~2340 m below sea level, ~0.01 km3) near its center. Lava flow mapping with~1m resolution AUV reveals that individual flows are compositionally variable. Two distinct trends are apparent in glass major elements. The dominant trend is fractional crystallization melt evolution from basalt to rhyolite. A subordinate trend from basalt to dacite offset to lower FeOT, TiO2, S03, and P2O5is interpreted as mixing between mafic and felsic magmas. Evidence for mixing is also preserved in mineral compositions that are commonly out of equilibrium with their host melts. SHRIMP U-Th zircon ages from 4 rhyolites yielded a pooled weighted mean age of 23.4 ± 4.5 (2σ) ka and a small population at 45 ± 9ka, likely inherited. Preliminary Ar-Ar incremental heating of 4 splits of oligoclase from one rhyolite sample yielded an identical age of 23.7 ± 4.3 ka. Marine-calibrated radiocarbon ages of foraminifera collected in pushcores atop separate andesite and dacite flows west of the rhyolite dome support minimum eruption ages >11.7 ka and >2.1- 3.4 ka, and geological relationships indicate they erupted both before and after the dome. Thus, the generation of differentiated magmas was protracted and their eruptions were repeated. Pending age data on older basalts to the west and interspersed intermediate lavas will clarify the minimum timescales of basalt-to-rhyolite differentiation.\nIntra-flow and closely-spaced inter-flow compositional variability recorded in relatively few eruptions means that the magma reservoir was stratified, also observed in many much larger terrestrial silicic eruptions, and that an eruptive episode(s) may evacuate a significant volume that was stored in the reservoir, partially mixed with and expelled by newly injected melt. These processes may be ubiquitous along ridges, but it is more evident here because the stored, differentiated melts and the newly input mafic melts are so dissimilar chemically and mineralogically.",

However, it is not always possible to get access to them from ground based measurements, particularly in ungauged catchments. The mesoscale model WRF (Weather Research & Forecasting model) can be used for prediction of hydro-meteorological variables. However, hydro-meteorologists would like to know how well the downscaled global data products are as compared to ground based measurements and whether it is possible to use the downscaled data for ungauged catchments. Even with gauged catchments, most of the stations have only rain and flow gauges installed. Measurements of other weather hydro-meteorological variables such as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature, and dew point are usually missing and thus complicate the problems. In this study, for downscaling the global datasets, the WRF model is setup over the Brue catchment with three nested domains (D1, D2 and D3) of horizontal grid spacing of 81 km, 27 km and 9 km are used. The hydro-meteorological variables are downscaled using the WRF model from the National Centers for Enviromental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis datasets and subsequently used for the ETo estimation using the Penman Monteith equation. The analysis of weather variables and precipitation are compared against the ground based datasets, which indicate that the datasets are in agreement with the observed datasets for complete monitoring period as well as during the seasons except precipitation whose performance is poorer in comparison to the measured rainfall. After a comparison, the WRF estimated precipitation and ETo are then used as a input parameter in the Probability Distributed Model (PDM) for discharge prediction. The input data and model parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty estimation are also taken into account for the PDM calibration and prediction following the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach. The overall analysis suggests that the uncertainty estimates in predicted discharge using WRF downscaled ETo have comparable performance to ground based observed datasets and hence is promising for discharge prediction in the absence of ground based measurements.",

In general the composition of the regolith of an object can be investigated by comparing photometric models to reflectance spectra of the surface. However, since the rings as a whole are not a solid surface and the A and B ring particles clump together into self-gravity wakes, the light scattering behavior of the rings has a complex dependence on the geometry of the observations. In order to deal with this we first determine the ring particle albedo for the A, B, and C rings and the Cassini Division at discrete far ultraviolet wavelengths across the water ice absorption edge at 165 nm. We next use the retrieved albedos to compare to spectral models that use available optical constants in the FUV for water ice and various plausible non-water-ice contaminants such as organic tholins, silicates, and other ices.. We retrieve the ring particle albedo by comparing observations of the lit face of the rings to a single scattering Chandrasekhar model. We then compare the observations to photometric models where we assume that the non-water-ice constituents are either embedded in water ice grains so that the effective optical constants are a linear combination of constituent optical constants or that the regolith consists of discrete grains of water ice and non-ice constituents. We find that the best fit of the compositional models to the ring particle albedo is for water ice abundances greater than 95% and water ice grain sizes of a few microns.",

            "abstract": "A new hybrid optimization algorithm for the calibration of computationally-intensive hydrological models is introduced. The calibration of hydrological models is a blackbox optimization problem where the only information available to the optimization algorithm is the objective function value. In the case of distributed hydrological models, the calibration process is often known to be hampered by computational efficiency issues. Running a single simulation may take several minutes and since the optimization process may require thousands of model evaluations, the computational time can easily expand to several hours or days.\nA blackbox optimization algorithm, which can substantially improve the calibration efficiency, has been developed. It merges both the convergence analysis and robust local refinement from the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, and the global exploration capabilities from the heuristic strategies used by the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm. The new algorithm is applied to the calibration of the distributed and computationally-intensive HYDROTEL model on three different river basins located in the province of Quebec (Canada). Two calibration problems are considered: (1) calibration of a 10-parameter version of HYDROTEL, and (2) calibration of a 19-parameter version of the same model.\nA previous study by the authors had shown that the original version of DDS was the most efficient method for the calibration of HYDROTEL, when compared to the MADS and the very well-known SCEUA algorithms. The computational efficiency of the hybrid DDS-MADS method is therefore compared with the efficiency of the DDS algorithm based on a 2000 model evaluations budget. Results show that the hybrid DDS-MADS method can reduce the total number of model evaluations by 70% for the 10-parameter version of HYDROTEL and by 40% for the 19-parameter version without compromising the quality of the final objective function value.",

            "abstract": "North of Yakutat Bay in southeastern Alaska, the subducting Yakutat Block intersects with the Fairweather transform fault system. A series of large earthquakes occurred in the region in September of 1899, including a Mw 8.2 event on 10 September that resulted in >14 m of coseismic uplift and a 6 m tsunami in Yakutat Bay. Despite recurrence risk of the 1899 or similar events in the region, the fault(s) that ruptured in 1899 remain unidentified. Previous efforts to map active Yakutat Bay faults carried out by Plafker and Thatcher (2008) used post-1899 bedrock uplift measurements to infer the location of potentially important structures, including the Esker Creek and Bancas Point thrusts. As measurement error was not assessed in their study, we revisit the uplift measurements by quantifying uncertainty due to glacial isostatic adjustment, tidal range, and specific benchmark methods. We also combine new seismic reflection data with existing topography, bathymetry, GPS, and satellite photo data to update the original fault map. Our reevaluation of uplift measurements suggests that primary slip and uplift during the 10 September earthquake was limited to northwest of Yakutat Bay. Additionally, a high-resolution seismic reflection survey we conducted in Yakutat Bay during August 2012 constrains faulting to on- or near-shore based on the absence of bay-crossing faults. Collectively, our results imply that predominantly strike-slip and transpressive horsetail-type faults are southeast of Yakutat Bay, with compressional structures related to Yakutat Block subduction/collision to the northwest. We interpret the 10 September 1899 event to be the result of complex rupture somewhere within the Yakutat subduction/collision system. Based on our updated map of coseismic uplift and fault structure, we favor a rupture model where primary slip occurred along the Esker Creek system locally with possible induced coseismic slip along the neighboring Boundary transpressive fault system.",

While both species appear to migrate towards the poles like other volatiles, Na resides on the soil and exosphere for one to two months before getting lost to the solar wind or the subsurface. K exhibits a different evolutionary trend: it is lost much more quickly than ionization and sputtering rates allow for, suggesting that it is lost to the ground in just a few bounces. Thus, the two alkalis exhibit very different interactions with the lunar surface. Reproducing the monthly variation exhibited by Na requires higher source rates at Mare, or higher sink rates at Highlands, or a combination of both. The very different behavior of Na on Mare and Highlands soils is reminiscent of laboratory experiments of water binding on Apollo fine soils.",

            "abstract": "Over multi-decadal to multi-centennial timescales, ecosystem function and carbon storage is largely influenced by vegetation composition. The predictability of ecosystem responses to climate change thus depends on the understanding of long-term community dynamics. Our study aims to quantify the influence of the most relevant ecological factors that control plant distribution and abundance, in contemporary terrestrial biosphere models and in paleo-records, and constrain the model processes and parameters with paleoecological data. We simulated vegetation changes at 6 sites in the northeastern United States over the past 1160 years using 7 terrestrial biosphere models and variations (CLM4.5-CN, ED2, ED2-LU, JULES-TRIFFID, LINKAGES, LPJ-GUESS, LPJ-wsl) driven by common paleoclimatic drivers. We examined plant growth, recruitment, and mortality (including other carbon turnover) of the plant functional types (PFTs) in the models, attributed the responses to three major factors (climate, competition, and disturbance), and estimated the relative effect of each factor. We assessed the model responses against plant-community theories (bioclimatic limits, niche difference, temporal variation and storage effect, and disturbance). We found that vegetation composition were sensitive to realized niche differences (e.g. differential growth response) among PFTs. Because many models assume unlimited dispersal and sometimes recruitment, the “storage effect” constantly affects community composition. Fire was important in determining the ecosystem composition, yet the vegetation to fire feedback was weak in the models. We also found that vegetation-composition changes in the simulations were driven to a much greater degree by growth as opposed to by turnover/mortality, when compared with those in paleoecological records. Our work suggest that 1) for forecasting slow changes in vegetation composition, we can use paleo-data to better quantify the realized niches of PFTs and associated uncertainties, and 2) for predicting abrupt changes in vegetation composition, we need to better implement processes of dynamic turnover and fire in current ecosystem models.",

The governing equations for the unconfined flow are derived from conservation of mass and the Darcy law. The Dupuit approximation will be used to model the dynamics. The spatially varying nature of the tendency to conduct flow (e.g. the hydraulic conductivity) is represented as a stochastic process. Experimental studies in the literature have indicated that the conductivity belongs to a class of non-stationary stochastic fields, called H-ss fields. The uncertainty in the soil parameters is imparted onto the flow variables; in groundwater investigations the potentiometric head will be a random function. The structure of the head field will be analyzed with an emphasis on the scaling properties. The scaling scheme for the modeling equations and the simulation procedure for the saturated hydraulic conductivity process will be explained, then the method will be validated through numerical experimentation using the USGS Modflow-2005 software. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate that the head will exhibit multi-fractal scaling if the hydraulic conductivity exhibits multi-fractal scaling and the differential equations for the groundwater equation satisfy a particular set of scale invariance conditions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the Yellowstone caldera geological unrest between 1977 and 2010 by analyzing temporal changes in differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), precise spirit leveling andgravity measurements. The analysis of the 1992–2010 displacement time series has been retrieved by applying an “improved” version of the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR technique which complements a novel multi-temporal noise filtering approach with a suitable identification of the network of small baseline pairs. As a result, we have identified three areas of deformation: (i) the Mallard Lake (ML) and Sour Creek (SC) resurgent domes, (ii) a region close to the Northern Caldera Rim (NCR), and (iii) the eastern Snake River Plain (SRP). While the eastern SRP shows a signal related to tectonic deformation, the other two regions are influenced by the caldera unrest. We removed the tectonic signal from the InSAR displacements, and we modeled the InSAR, leveling, and gravity measurements to retrieve the best fitting source parameters. Our findings confirmed the existence of different distinct sources, beneath the brittle-ductile transition zone, which have been intermittently active during the last three decades. Moreover, we interpreted our results in the light of existing seismic tomography studies. Concerning the SC dome, we highlighted the role of hydrothermal fluids as the driving force behind the 1977–1983 uplift; since 1983–1993 the deformation source transformed into a deeper one with a higher magmatic component. Furthermore, our results support the magmatic nature of the deformation source beneath ML dome for the overall investigated period. Finally, the uplift at NCR is interpreted as magma accumulation, while its subsidence could either be the result of fluids migration outside the caldera or the gravitational adjustment of the source from a spherical to a sill-like geometry.",

            "abstract": "An annual bimodal rainfall cycle with peaks during the late spring and late summer is observed throughout the Intra-American Sea. A rainfall minimum occurs after the late spring early rainfall season (ERS) and is known as the “mid-summer drought” (MSD). Despite the interest in the well-studied MSD, there is a lack of research describing the onset and variability of the ERS. Rainfall during the ERS is important for Caribbean farmers as it moistens the soil after the dry season and can provide a catalyst for significant agricultural success.\n Contrary to the acceptance of long term regional anecdotal evidence, heavy rainfall during the ERS is not simply the result of mid-latitude fronts. Instead, heavy rainfall during the ERS arises through a series of storms or “weather events” that result from the simultaneous occurrence of two primary ingredients over the region: upper tropospheric uplift dynamics and lower tropospheric tropical moisture advection steered by the “Panama Low”. A seasonal rainfall pattern emerges during the late spring in the western Caribbean, known as the Caribbean rain-belt, from the accumulated rainfall of each weather event during the ERS.\n During some years the Caribbean rain-belt is weak or absent, however, it remains a climatological rainfall feature that is shaped by the consistency of late spring weather events. Sub-daily rainfall time series’ from the COCONet rain gauge network are used to construct the pattern of daily weather events that are then used to decompose the climatological Caribbean rain-belt. In addition, sub-daily rainfall observations are used to calculate the percent of seasonal rainfall that originates from the Caribbean rain-belt.\n Farmers depend on the succession of ERS weather events that shape the Caribbean rain-belt, but deadly flooding and landslides have also been recorded along the its path",

So, the understanding of the physical and spatial-temporal patterns of risk drivers (exposure, damage, and flood protection level) are required to conduct effective adaptation and reduce the negative impacts of flooding. Although the understanding of exposure and damage has greatly improved using a combination of numerical model simulation and spatiotemporal distributions of population and asset, that of flood protection level is still lacking in particular spatial patterns. Previous research clarifies its temporal variation and relationship with per-capita income, however they do not consider its spatial variation. Flood protection level was associated with geographical characteristics (e.g., soil type and tectonic zone etc). This study tried to estimate spatiotemporal of flood protection level at country level and discuss about relationship between its spatial patterns and geographical characteristics. Mortality rate (percentage of fatalities in modeled exposed population) and loss rate (percentage of losses in modeled exposed GDP) to fluvial river flooding across the world suggested by Jongmann et al. (2015) were estimated from modeled flood exposure and damage statistics taken from the International Emergency Disasters Database. The result indicated that mortality rate reduced across the world from 1990 to 2005. The degree of its reduction decreased with increasing per-capita income level. On the other hand, loss rate at high income and middle low income levels reduced, while that at middle high income and low income levels drastically increased between 1995 and 2000 due to growth economic and occurrence of serious fluvial river flooding. Spatial distribution of mortality and loss rates were high in East Asia, the western part of South America, and the eastern part of Europe. These regions seem to be corresponded to the Pacific tectonic region. An in-depth understanding of flood protection levels were important not only per-capita income level, but also the geographical characteristics. These results were useful for the effective adaptation strategy.",

The hypothesis was that Finasol would have a greater effect on larval grass shrimp development than Corexit. The experiment was conducted using 300 grass shrimp larvae that were 24 hours old. Each larva was exposed individually. In total, five sub-lethal concentrations were tested for each dispersant (control, 1.25, 2.50, 5.0,10.0 mg/L). The larvae were exposed for five days then transferred to clean seawater until metamorphosis into the juvenile stage. Key data measurements recorded included number of days to become juveniles, number of instars, length, dry weight, and mortality. Data from exposed shrimp was compared to the results of the control for each dispersant concentration. Corexit and Finasol exposure treatments of 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L showed significantly higher values for number of days and number of instars to reach juvenile status than values obtained from unexposed, control shrimp. Overall, mortality was higher in the Finasol treatments but the two dispersants did not respond significantly different from one another. Future studies are needed to determine the long term effects of dispersant exposure on all grass shrimp life stages and how any dispersant exposure impacts grass shrimp populations. Grass shrimp serve as excellent toxicity indicators of estuaries, and further studies will help to develop better oil spill mitigation techniques.",

Fo is thought to undergo a chemical decomposition associated with a structural phase transition when dynamically loaded to 40-71 GPa, but previous inferences about such decomposition have been based only on pressure-density data with no direct phase identification. To obtain direct data on the phase evolution of shocked Fo, synthetic single crystal samples of Mg2SiO4 Fo were loaded to pressures of 52 GPa using a two stage light gas gun. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on the static and the loaded samples in situ using a single pulse Mo Kα anode to provide a 17 keV X-ray source. X-ray polycapillary optics were used to couple the source to the sample. Clear Laue spots were observed in the static images, while the dynamic images show the appearance of new spots at early times and powder-like rings at late times. The angles of the dynamically driven spots and rings overlap with each other and indicate the change in phase of forsterite under pressure through a process that begins with the formation of single crystals and ends with polycrystalline material. Efforts are underway to identify the high-pressure phases from among the library of dense magnesium silicates, and further experiments covering a larger pressure range will be completed shortly.

The resulting changes in the ring current particle pressure change the global magnetic field, which affects the transport of the radiation belts. In order to determine the field changes during a storm it is necessary to understand the transport, sources and losses of the particles that contribute to the ring current. The source population of the storm time ring current is the night side plasma sheet. However, it is not clear how these convecting particles affect the storm time ring current pressure development. We use Van Allen Probes and Cluster observations together with the Volland-Stern and dipole magnetic field models to determine the contribution in the ring current pressure of the plasma sheet particles convecting from the night side that are on open drift paths, during the storm evolution. We compare storms that are related to different interplanetary drivers, CME and CIR, as observed at different local times.",

Here we show in simulations with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model that burning the currently attainable fossil-fuel resources is sufficient to eliminate the ice sheet. With cumulative fossil-fuel emissions of 10 000 GtC, Antarctica is projected to become almost ice-free with an average contribution to sea-level rise exceeding 3 meters per century during the first millennium. Consistent with recent observations and simulations, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet becomes unstable with 600 to 800 GtC of additional carbon emissions. Beyond this additional carbon release, the destabilization of ice basins in both West- and East Antarctica results in a threshold-increase in global sea level. Unabated carbon emissions thus threaten the Antarctic Ice Sheet in its entirety with associated sea-level rise that far exceeds that of all other possible sources.",

            "abstract": "Historically, longleaf pine (LLP) stands in the southeastern US experienced frequent fires. Today managed LLP stands are burned at 2-5 year intervals to reduce fuels and hardwood competition and manage for biodiversity. These are not stand replacing fires, though considerable amounts of biomass are burned and the conversion rate to biochemically stabilized black carbon (BC) is unknown. The primary mechanisms for long-term carbon sequestration in soil are mineral association, biochemical transformation (e.g. pyrogenesis) and physical protection. We quantified the recalcitrance of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its oxidation resistant fraction (SOCR; defined as residual SOC following H2O2 treatment and dilute HNO3 digestion) using radiocarbon dating (SOC and SOCR) and benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) as molecular markers for polyaromatic C associated with BC. Mineral stabilized C is largely represented by SOCR contents and BC by total BPCA contents. Soils were collected by depth (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, 50-100 cm) at 14 managed LLP stands in Louisiana (LA), Georgia (GA) and North Carolina (NC) burned every two to five years. Across all sites, SOC and SOCR contents declined with soil depth, though SOCR:SOC increased with depth (0.13, 0.15, 0.22, 0.31). SOCR was more 14C depleted than SOC and Δ14C values became more negative with soil depth (SOCR: -195, -318, -458, -553 vs. SOC 23, -39, -156, -334), indicating that SOCR had a much longer mean residence time. The Δ14C values correspond to mean ages of SOCR ranging from 1777 to 6969 years and of SOC from 84 to 3319 years. We obtained very low BPCA yield from SOCR, and it is unclear whether BC was absent or not accessible with the BPCA method. Preliminary analysis of total BPCA (bulk soil) indicates interactions between soil series and depth. Total BPCA concentration of SOC in the upper 10 cm was 136 g kg-1 C in LA and more than six times the concentration in GA and NC. On deep sands in NC, the highest BPCA concentration of SOC was found at 50-100 cm (68 g kg-1 C), which was three times higher than in GA or LA at that depth. Variation in bulk soil Δ14C was largely explained by SOCR:SOC and soil depth (combined partial R2 0.84), while BPCA:SOC contributed an additional 0.02 partial R2. This implies that SOC recalcitrance is largely controlled by mineral association versus pyrogenic transformation.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic storms can either increase 4 or decrease relativistic electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt. A statistical survey of 84 isolated storms demonstrates that geomagnetic storms preferentially decrease relativistic electron fluxes at higher energies while flux enhancements are more common at lower energies. In about 87% of the storms, 0.3-2.5 MeV electrons fluxes show increase, whereas 2.5-14 MeV electron fluxes increase in only 35% of the storms. Superposed epoch analyses suggest that such ’energy dependent’ behavior of electrons preferably occurs during conditions of high solar wind density which is favorable to generate magnetospheric electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and these ’energy dependent’ events are associated with relatively weaker chorus activities. We have examined one of the cases where observed EMIC waves can resonate effectively with >2.5 MeV electrons and scatter them into the atmosphere. The correlation study further illustrates that electron flux drop-outs during storm main phases do not correlate well with the flux build-up during storm recovery phases. We suggest that a combination of efficient EMIC-induced scattering and weaker chorus-driven acceleration provide a viable candidate for the energy dependent responses of outer radiation belt relativistic electrons to geomagnetic storms. These results are of great interest to both understanding of the radiation belt dynamics and applications in space weather.",

Due to the movement of water downstream, these lateral effects co-occur with longitudinal influences. We investigated both the lateral and longitudinal effects of deforestation in four streams in the Atlantic tropical rainforest of Brazil. We collected physical-chemical, geomorphic, hydrological data and samples of macroinvertebrates assemblages. We then categorized land cover at different scales (from different riparian and reach buffer sizes to sub and total watershed) using a SPOT-5 satellite image and ArcGIS. We also carried out a series of experiments along the streams to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which LCC affects periphyton and how these changes alter metabolism and nutrient uptake rates; 2) the downstream distance at which periphyton and the associated variables change in the transitions from one riparian category to the other. We used (i) a path analysis to test if our hypothesized land-cover cascade model described our data and (ii) non-linear models to describe the longitudinal effect on each variable. Our results showed that deforestation produced a range of physical changes at different spatial scale, longitudinally altering periphyton taxonomic composition (taxa depending on light), stoichiometry (nutritionally richer with increasing deforestation) and growth rates (greater in deforested). Macroinvertebrate assemblages behaved similarly to chlorophyll a in response to forest loss. Respiration rate increased with deforestation probably due to higher nutrient concentrations but primary production did not increase. Models were used to upscale LCC impacts on ecosystem processes from local scale experiments to landscape and our work has important implications for socio-economic decisions concerning ecosystem management and conservation.",

The Doppler radar measures the velocity of ejecta (>0.5 mm) and the reflected energy (a proxy for their cumulative size) within the eruption cloud. These data constrain the dynamics of the eruption cloud between 100-200m above the vent, where the field of view is located. We measure the precise timing of surface activity when tephra is included, while pure gas emissions (white steam clouds and fumaroles) are transparent to the radar.\nIn 2007 a new dome grew slowly within the crater, accompanied by almost daily tephra emissions. This continued until 2011, when a larger explosion signalled the end of the effusion. After 18 months of quiescence, a new eruptive episode commenced in January 2013 and continues to date (Aug. 2015).\nAnalysis of the temporal trends of ejecta velocities reveals that tephra emissions are pulsed. This matches observations, where the ash concentration commonly varies between discrete pulses. The statistical analysis of times between pulses best fits a log-logistic distribution. A log-logistic distribution indicates the interplay of two competing processes: for example short duration pressure release within a few seconds through a shallow fracture network vs. long term (tens of seconds) gas supply from deeper regions. Or it could be the competition of processes affecting the magma viscosity: rapid degassing acting to increase it, whilst a temperature increase from latent heat or shear heat generation acts to decrease the viscosity.\nThe repose-times (in 2007) also follow a log-logistic distribution with different parameters. A single set of parameters fitting both the repose- and inter-pulse-times has not been found.\nIn the recent data set (2014-2015) the number of events remarkably increased from 29 per month (June 2014) up to 23 per day in February 2015. The Doppler radar measured several pyroclastic flows until it was partly destroyed by a major flow on 11 July 2015. Statistics provide indirect insight into the explosion generation mechanism; the Doppler radar additionally provides direct insight into the dynamics of pyroclastic flows from a (usually) safe distance.",

Observations and reanalyses have shown that Southern Ocean winds have increased over the past 60 years [Thompson, 2002; Swart and Fyfe, 2012]. ACC baroclinic transport appears to remain stable [Böning et al., 2008], however, suggesting that the interior mechanisms that output momentum from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) system are counterbalancing changes in the input wind stress. Here we describe where and how momentum exits the ACC system in a six-year, eddy permitting state estimate of the Southern Ocean.\nWe find that 95% of the zonal momentum input via wind stress at the surface is balanced by topographic form stress across ocean ridges, while the remaining 5% is balanced via bottom friction and momentum flux divergences at the northern and southern boundaries of the analysis domain. While the time-mean zonal wind stress field exhibits a relatively uniform spatial distribution, time-mean topographic form stress concentrates at shallow ridges and across the continents that lie within the ACC latitudes -- primarily Kerguelen Plateau, the Macquarie Ridge region, and South America and the Drake Passage fracture zones -- as well as across deep basins separated by basin-scale plains. Topographic form stress can be divided into shallow and deep regimes: the shallow regime contributes most of the westward form stress that serves as a momentum sink for the ACC system, while the deep regime consists of strong eastward and westward form stresses that largely cancel in the zonal integral. The time-varying form stress signal, integrated longitudinally and over the ACC latitudes, tracks closely with the wind stress signal integrated over the same domain; at zero lag, 88% of the variance in the six-year form stress time series can be explained by the wind stress signal, indicating that changes in the integrated wind stress signal are communicated via rapid barotropic response down to the level of bottom topography.",

Nano-indentation combined with both 2D and 3D imaging was performed on a sample of Woodford shale. Significant plastic deformation was observed in the nano-indentation testing, and nano-scale resolution FIB-SEM imaging of the post-indented regions has revealed that the plastic deformation is accompanied by extensive micro-fracture of the shale's highly heterogeneous micro-structure.\nA spatial tensor that is similar to Eshelby's energy momentum tensor is shown to be energy conjugate to the plastic velocity gradient under large inelastic volume strain. These results are cast in MCC framework drawing on the concept of continuum damage. The resulting formulation provides a connection between density (porosity), elastic (and plastic) moduli, and micro damage/healing. Nonlinear finite element modeling is used for implementation of the constitutive model in simulation of both laboratory-scale and nano- to micro-scale experiments. The results show that the model is able to predict the inception and propagation of micro-fractures around inhomogeneities, as well as capture the resulting behavior observed at the much larger laboratory scale.",

            "abstract": "GIADA (Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust Accumulator) is an in-situ instrument mounted onboard Rosetta monitoring the dust environment of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. GIADA is composed of 3 sub-systems: 1) the Grain Detection System, based on particle detection through light scattering; 2) the Impact Sensor, giving momentum measurement; 3) the Micro-Balances System, constituted of 5 quartz crystal microbalances, giving cumulative deposited dust. The combination of the measurements performed by these 3 subsystems provides: the number, the mass, the momentum and the speed distribution of dust particles emitted from the comet nucleus. We will present the coma dust environment as observed by GIADA during the perihelion phase of the Rosetta space mission. Despite the large distance from the nucleus, more than 200 km, GIADA was able to detect temporal and spatial variation of dust density distribution. Specific high dust spatial density sectors of the coma have been identified and their evolution during the perihelion phase was studied.\nAcknowledgements.

It consists of Space Radiation Detectors (SRD), which will measure the ring current and radiation belt particles in the subauroral regions, and Space Plasma Detectors (SPD), which will measure the ionospheric ions and electrons in the middle and low latitude regions. SRD consists of two instruments: Medium Energy Particle Detector (MEPD) will measure electrons and ions in the range of ~25 to ~400 keV, and High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) will measure electrons of ~0.1 to ~2 MeV and ions up to ~20 MeV. With two and three telescopes for MEPD and HEPD, respectively, together with many spectral bins, SRD, will discriminate the trapped and precipitating particles with high spectral resolution. SPD is composed of three conventional instruments: a Langmuir Probe (LP), a Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA), and an Ion Drift Meter (IDM). LP of a planar shape will be used to determine the densities and temperatures of the ionospheric electrons, while RPA and IDM will determine the densities, temperatures, and the composition of the ionospheric ions as well as their drift velocities. With its high temporal resolution, SPD aims to observe substructures of plasma irregularities. This paper discusses the designs and scientific objectives of these instruments.",

Additionally, computational costs increase dramatically in presence of changing geometries, e.g. due to adsorption and dissolution processes, as re-meshing becomes necessary. In such scenarios, Immersed Boundary Methods (or IBMs) are an attractive alternative to classical unstructured body-fitted grids as they employ basic Cartesian grids. Since their development in the late 70s, IBMs have generally been implemented in an explicit manner: this imposes severe time-step restrictions and causes instability issues. Moreover their implementation for Neumann (constant flux) and Robin (e.g. reaction) boundary conditions (BCs) has not been well studied. We have developed an implicit IBM capable of handling all types of BC and have implemented it for several transport and flow scenarios. Successful validation against both experimental and numerical data has been carried out.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) (~55 Ma) is a warming event characterized by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) representing a large and rapid injection of carbon into global reservoirs. Debate continues regarding the mechanism, magnitude, and tempo of the carbon released. A few terrestrial and marine sediment records document two distinct δ13C excursions a pre-onset excursion (POE) and CIE interpreted as evidence of multiple carbon injections. We generated geochemical records of ocean carbonate chemistry and temperature using cores drilled by the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) that recovered expanded sections of the PETM onset along the mid-Atlantic coastal plain. Our stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) planktonic foraminifer records from South Dover Bridge (SDB), Maryland USA exhibit prominent anomalies across the Paleocene-Eocene boundary consistent to proximal coastal sites. δ13C records of mixed-layer (Acarinina spp.) and thermocline (Subbotina spp.) dwelling planktonic foraminifera show two negative carbon excursions that include a 2 ‰ POE and 3-4 ‰ CIE that return to baseline values between events in conjunction with bulk carbonate trends. Remarkably, contemporaneous foraminifer δ18O records exhibit only a minor response during the POE. This could be an artifact of preservation, or at face value, indicative of little to no warming. For the latter, this would require a rapid, but relatively small carbon release. To test the coupled link between atmosphere and surface ocean δ13C records we aim to integrate our geochemical results with model simulations to establish the duration and global extent of multiple carbon releases.",

Two IPCC-participated Integrated Assessment Models(IAMs) were used to developed those scenario pathways. The two emission processing systems, KU-EPS and SMOKE-Asia, were used to convert these future scenario emissions to comprehensive chemical transport model-ready form. The NIER/KU-CREATE (Comprehensive Regional Emissions inventory for Atmospheric Transport Experiment) served as the regional base-year emission inventory. For anthropogenic emissions, it has 54 fuel classes, 201 sub-sectors and 13 pollutants, including CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, OC, BC, PM10, PM2.5, and mercury.\nFast energy growth and aggressive penetration of the control measures make emissions projection very active for East Asia. Despite of more stringent air pollution control policies by the governments, however, air quality over the region seems not been improved as much – even worse in many cases. The needs of more scientific understanding of inter-relationship among emissions, transport, chemistry over the region are very high to effectively protect public health and ecosystems against ozone, fine particles, and other toxic pollutants in the air. After developing these long-term future emissions, therefore, we also tried to apply our future scenarios to develop the present emissions inventory for chemical weather forecasting and aircraft field campaign.\nOn site, we will present; 1) the future scenario development framework and process methodologies, 2) initial development results of the future emission pathways, 3) present emission inventories from short-term projection, and 4) air quality modeling performance improvements over the region.",

            "abstract": "Jazan City is a growing (in size and population) industrial city in the Jazan Province and an important port on the Red Sea coastline of Saudi Arabia. Parts of the city are built on sabkha deposits and others on a salt plateau (diaper) that intrudes overlying sedimentary sequences. Both areas are reported to experience various degrees of ground deformation, causing severe damages to buildings and infrastructure. An integrated study involving remote sensing (i.e. optical, multispectral, and radar) and geophysical (gravity) was applied to address the following objectives: (1) identification of the spatial distribution and areal extent of lithologic units in the study area, (2) assessment of the factors controlling the deformation, (3) locating the areas that are most susceptible to present and future deformation, and (4) quantifying the relative deformation rates in various parts of the city. The following methodology was adopted: (1) deformation rates were extracted applying both Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) radar interferometric techniques using seven Envisat scenes over a time span of six years (from 2003 to 2009), (2) the extracted deformation rates were correlated spatially in a GIS platform with relevant datasets (e.g. lithology, soil type, geologic structures, subsurface data) to identify the factors controlling land deformation, and (3) temporal datasets (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission; TRMM) were used to investigate whether deformation rates are affected by rainfall intensity. Our preliminary findings indicate a spatial correspondence between the PS results: (1) subsidence rates (-1.4 mm/yr) correlates with the distribution of the mapped sabkha units and uplift rates (0.95 mm/yr) with the mapped distribution of salt dome plateau outcrops. The sabkha subsidence could be associated with agricultural activities, poor waste management practices, and large rainfall events that induce salt removal from the sabkha soil. Inspection of regional airborne gravity data confirmed our findings (listed above) and suggest that the salt plateau extends beyond the surficial mapped unit to the south and north of the Jazan City.",

            "abstract": "The chemical interactions, mobility, and plant uptake of uranium (U) near abandoned mine wastes was investigated along the Rio Paguate, adjacent to the Jackpile Mine, located in Laguna Pueblo, New Mexico. Elevated U concentrations in surface water adjacent to mine waste range from 30 to 710 µg/L seasonally and decrease to 5.77 to 10.0 µg/L at a wetland 4.5 kilometers downstream of the mine. Although U concentrations in stream water are elevated, aqua regia acid digestions performed on co-located stream bed and stream bank sediments reveal that there is limited U accumulation on sediments along the reach between the mine and wetland, with most sediment concentrations being near the 3 mg/kg crustal average. However, U concentrations in sediments in the wetland are 4 times the background concentrations in the area. Individual results from salt cedar roots, stems, and leaves collected along the river transect show higher U concentrations in the roots adjacent to the mine waste (20 and 55 mg/kg) and lower in the stems and leaves. Translocation values calculated below 1 are evident in many of the plant samples, suggesting that U root to shoot translocation is minimal and U is accumulating in the roots. Concentrations of U in salt cedar roots from downstream of the mine waste decrease to 15 mg/kg. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis on sediment samples adjacent to the mine waste show a 75:25% ratio of Fe(III) to Fe(II), which can have an effect on adsorption properties. Electron microprobe results suggest that the ore in this area is present as a uranium-phosphate phase. Our results suggest that dilution, uptake by plants, and U sorption to wetland sediments are the dominant factors that help to decrease the U concentrations downstream of the mine.",

            "abstract": "Subsidence from longwall coal mining impacts the surface and sub-surface hydrology in overlying areas. During longwall mining, coal is completely removed in large rectangular panels and the overlying rock collapses into the void. Though the hydrologic impacts of longwall mine subsidence on overlying vegetation have been studied in more arid systems, in humid-temperate regions these effects are not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how longwall mining will impact water availability to forests. To explore potential impacts, a geospatial analysis of tree canopy water content using Landsat satellite imagery of southwestern Pennsylvania was carried out. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) derived from Landsat imagery was applied to expose patterns of vegetation water stress, which were then compared across a temporal gradient of mined panels. NDMI values associated with panels from 2000 through 2014 were assessed within September 2014 Landsat NDMI imagery and compared to a population of pixels un-impacted by mining. This study elucidates mining impacts to forest canopies and the landscape features driving patterns of tree canopy moisture content in southwestern, PA.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, scientists have been using satellite observations to infer climate budgets of terrestrial carbon uptake employing inverse methods in conjunction with ecosystem models and coupled global climate models. This is an extremely important Big Data calculation today since the net annual photosynthetic carbon uptake changes annually over land and removes on average ~20% of the emissions from human contributions to atmospheric loading of CO2 from fossil fuels. Unfortunately, such calculations have large uncertainties validated with in-situ networks of measuring stations across the globe. One difficulty in using satellite data for these budget calculations is that the models need to assimilate surface fluxes of CO2 as well as soil moisture, vegatation cover and the eddy covariance of latent and sensible heat to calculate the carbon fixed in the soil while satellite spectral observations only provide near surface concentrations of CO2.\nIn July 2014, NASA successfully launched OCO-2 which provides 3km surface measurements of CO2 over land and oceans. We have collected nearly one year of Level 2 XCO2 data from the OCO-2 satellite for 3 sites of ~200 km2 at equatorial, temperate and high latitudes. Each selected site was part of the Fluxnet or ARM system with tower stations for measuring and collecting CO2 fluxes on an hourly basis, in addition to eddy transports of the other parameters. We are also planning to acquire the 4km NDVI products from MODIS and registering the data to the 3km XCO2 footprints for the three sites. We have implemented a restricted Boltzman machine on the quantum annealing D-Wave computer, a novel deep learning neural net, to be used for training with station data to infer CO2 fluxes from collocated XCO2, MODIS vegetative land cover and MERRA reanalysis surface exchange products. We will present performance assessments of the D-Wave Boltzman machine for generating XCO2 fluxes from the OCO-2 satellite observations for the 3 sites by validating with monthly station flux data for one year as a potential assimilation input to the LIS model for obtaining the Net Ecosystem Exchange.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate melts are rare magmas with only a single active volcano (Oldoinyo Lengai,Tanzania [1]). They are of fundamental interest for their role in the Earth's deep carbon cycle and are of immense economic importance due to their affinity for REE strategic metals (niobium, uranium, tantalum, etc). They have remarkable physical properties such as very low viscosity [2] and magmatic temperatures for alkaline carbonate lavas [3] and it has been predicted that their compressibility could be significantly higher than that of silicate melts [4,5]. Despite the atomic structure of carbonate melts being fundamental for controlling their physical and chemical behavior in natural systems, very few structural studies have been reported and these have been largely computational. Here we present initial structural investigations of carbonate melts at mantle pressures using in situ x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells. The structure factor S(Q) is transformed to obtain the real space pair distribution function G(R) which describes the local and intermediate range atomic ordering allowing bond length and coordination number changes with pressure to be determined.

            "abstract": "The Prairie Peninsula in North America refers to the eastward extension of prairie and savanna ecosystems from western tallgrass prairie into deciduous forests of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. Historically, the Prairie Peninsula border defined one of the largest shifts in vegetation and biomass in North America. Today, the fertile soils of the Prairie Peninsula have been transformed into a large agricultural center of national economic importance. The existence and location of prairie and savanna on the Northwest border of the Prairie Peninsula has previously been attributed to strong, dry westerly winds, low precipitation, and high fire frequencies. However, these drivers remain untested with historical vegetation across the whole Prairie Peninsula. We use recently digitized historical survey data of vegetation at the time of European settlement (the Public Land Survey (PLS)) to test these hypotheses with past structure and composition data of the entire Prairie Peninsula region. We demonstrate that commonly cited hypotheses for the existence of these ecosystems (westerly winds, low precipitation, and fire) cannot predict the extent and composition of the pre-settlement landscape in the Prairie Peninsula. Using the PLS data in a statistical model of biomass run with environmental covariates (precipitation, soil hydrology parameters, and topography), we test which covariates best explain the distribution of biomass and species composition across the region. Explanatory power of each covariate is spatially variable, suggesting that a single environmental factor alone did not drive prairie and savanna vegetation in the Prairie Peninsula. Rather, this work suggests that variable interactions between climate, soil hydrology properties, and disturbances promote similar vegetation structure across space.",

The measurements can be compared to model predictions following the orbital evolution of dust grains originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt and migrating inward due to Poynting-Robertson drag. SDC's results, as well as data taken by the Pioneer 10 dust detector, are compared to model predictions to estimate the mass production rate and the ejecta size distribution power law exponent. On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft passed through the Pluto system and is now continuing to take measurements in the solar system’s third zone, the Kuiper Belt.

We analyze three global scale precipitation products (one instrument based, one reanalysis based, one satellite and gauge based) from monthly to centennial scales and planetary down to several hundred kilometers in spatial scale. Results from space-time scaling analyses of spectra and Haar fluctuations in precipitation show the presence – similarly to other atmospheric fields - of an intermediate “macroweather” regime between the familiar weather and climate regimes. These regimes qualitatively and quantitatively alternate in the way fluctuations vary with scale. In the macroweather regime, precipitation is characterized by negative temporal fluctuation exponents, which implies – contrary to the weather regime – that fluctuations tend to cancel each other out. This regime is important for seasonal, annual and decadal forecasts, and it is also important for assessing lower frequency anthropogenic effects that can be detected because (in the industrial epoch) they break the scaling.\nWe characterize systematically the macroweather precipitation temporal and spatial, and joint space-time statistics and variability, and the outer scale limit of temporal scaling (the critical scale is about 20 - 40 yrs, depending on the product, on the spatial scale). Our results clarify the different scaling regimes and further allow us to quantify the agreement (and lack of agreement) of the precipitation products as a function of space and time scales. We show how to detect the anthropogenic signal in precipitation above the natural variability noise. We also show how to make new space-time precipitation models that can be used for monthly to interannual forecasting. These clarifications are relevant for a full understanding of the changes affecting the hydrological cycle and the interactions between different hydrologic processes.",

During the first season in March of 2014 the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory led the on-ice group including NRL personnel and Naval Academy midshipmen. The second season (March 2015) included only NRL scientists and midshipmen. The in-situ data provided ground-truth for airborne measurements from a scanning LiDAR (Riegl Q 560i), digital photogrammetry (Applanix DSS-439), a low-frequency SAR (P-band in 2014 and P and L bands in 2015) and a snow/Ku radar procured from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets of the University of Kansas. The CReSIS radar was updated in 2015 to integrate the snow and Ku radars into a single continuous chirp, thus improving resolution. The objective of the survey was to aid our understanding of the use of the airborne data to calibrate/validate Cryosat-2 data.\nSampling size or “footprint” plays a critical role in the attempt to compare in-situ measurements with airborne (or satellite) measurements. Thus the in-situ data were arranged to minimize aliasing. Ground measurements were collected along transects a sites generally consisting of a 2 km long profile of Magnaprobe and EM31 measurements with periodic boreholes. A 60 m x 400 m swath of Magnaprobe measurements was centered on this profile.\nAirborne data were collected on multiple overflights of the transect areas. The LiDAR measured total freeboard (ice + snow) referenced to leads in the ice, and produced swaths 200-300 m wide. The SAR imaged the ice beneath the snow and the snow/Ku radar measured snow thickness. The freeboard measurements and snow thickness are used to estimate ice thickness via isostasy and density estimates.\nComparisons and processing methodology will be shown. The results of this ground-truth experiment will inform our analysis of grids of airborne data collected over areas of sea-ice illuminated by Cryosat-2.",

            "abstract": "Collisional belts result by thoroughly competing thermo-mechanical disaggregation and coupling within both continental and oceanic lithospheric slices, during construction of tectono-metamorphic architectures. In multiply reworked metamorphics, tectonic units may be contoured nowadays on the base of coherent thermo-baric and structural time-sequences rather than simply relying on lithologic affinities. Sequences of equilibrium assemblages and related fabric imprints are an approach that appears as a more reliable procedure, that enables to define tectonic units as the volume of crustal slices that underwent corresponding variations during the dynamics of an active margin and takes into account a history of physical imprints. The dimensions of these tectonic units may have varied over time and must be reconstructed combining the tracers of structural and metamorphic changes of basement rocks, since such kind of tectono-metamorphic units (TMUs) is a realistic configuration of the discrete portions of orogenic crust that experienced a coherent sequence of metamorphic and textural variations. Their translational trajectories, and bulk shape changes during deformation, cannot simply be derived from the analysis of the geometries and kinematics of tectonic units, but are to be obtained by adding the reconstruction of quantitative P-T-d-t paths making full use of fossil mineral equilibria. The joint TMU field-and-laboratory definition is an investigation procedure that bears a distinct thermo-tectonic connotation, that, through modelling, offers the opportunity to test the physical compatibilities of plate-scale interconnected variables, such as density, viscosity, and heat transfer, with respect to what current interpretative geologic histories may imply. Comparison between predictions from numerical modelling and natural data obtained by this analytical approach can help to solve ambiguities on geodynamic significance of structural and thermal signatures, also as a function of tectonic rate of simulated convergent or divergent kinematics. In addition the estimate of structurally and mineral-chemically re-equilibrated volumes assists the choice of physical parameters selected to constrain numerical models.",

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that large bursts of deep tremor ( >20km depth) near Parkfield, CA are associated with quasi-periodic shear dislocations on the deep extent of the San Andreas Fault. Geodetic studies have shown that slow slip accompanies tremor in several subduction zones [e.g. Rogers and Dragert, 2003; Ide et al 2008]. However, prior to this study deformation associated with tremor in a transform fault environment had not been observed despite the ubiquitous presence of tremor and LFEs [Shelly et al, 2007; Nadeau et al 2005] and targeted attempts to observe this deformation [Smith 2009]. In this study we report geodetic measurements of surface strains associated with large tremor swarms that are inferred to be concurrent with slow-slip events with moment magnitudes exceeding 5 [Guilhem et al 2012]. The strain rates associated with these events are below the detection level of GPS networks, thus in order to observe this deformation we have utilized two long-baseline laser strainmeters (LSM) located in Cholame, CA. In order to overcome a small signal-to noise-ratio in the strainmeter data, we have stacked the strain records associated with more than 50 large tremor-burst events, each approximately 10 days in duration. The average surface strains associated with these events are on the order of several nanometers and correspond to fault slip on the order of 5 millimeters per event (assuming a fault patch extending ~25 km along-strike and ~15km in depth). The measured moment associated with these events is a factor of two smaller than previously proposed based on theoretical estimates [Guilhem et al 2012]. In this study we also explore the deformation associated with a large increase in tremor activity following the August 24, 2014 M6.0 Napa earthquake, the largest observed burst in the Parkfield-Cholame area since the large tremor rate increase associated with the 2004 Parkfield M6 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Assessing climate change impacts often requires the use of multiple scenarios, types of models, and data sources, leading to a large number of potential sources of uncertainty. For example, a single study might require a choice of a forcing scenario, climate model, bias correction and/or downscaling method, societal development scenario, model (typically several) for quantifying elements of societal development such as economic and population growth, biophysical model (such as for crop yields or hydrology), and societal impact model (e.g. economic or health model).\nSome sources of uncertainty are reduced or eliminated by the framing of the question. For example, it may be useful to ask what an impact outcome would be conditional on a given societal development pathway, forcing scenario, or policy. However many sources of uncertainty remain, and it is rare for all or even most of these sources to be accounted for.\nI use the example of a recent integrated project on the Benefits of Reduced Anthropogenic Climate changE (BRACE) to explore useful approaches to uncertainty across multiple components of an impact assessment. BRACE comprises 23 papers that assess the differences in impacts between two alternative climate futures: those associated with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. It quantifies difference in impacts in terms of extreme events, health, agriculture, tropical cyclones, and sea level rise. Methodologically, it includes climate modeling, statistical analysis, integrated assessment modeling, and sector-specific impact modeling. It employs alternative scenarios of both radiative forcing and societal development, but generally uses a single climate model (CESM), partially accounting for climate uncertainty by drawing heavily on large initial condition ensembles.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the approach to uncertainty in BRACE are assessed. Options under consideration for improving the approach include the use of perturbed physics ensembles of CESM, employing results from multiple climate models, and combining the results from single impact models with statistical representations of uncertainty across multiple models. A key consideration is the relationship between the question being addressed and the uncertainty approach.",

This approach requires creativity and a willingness to reach out to and work with staff unfamiliar with scientific institutions, but can result in broad exposure and understanding of the impacts of climate change. In this presentation we highlight the successful science-art collaboration among the International Center of Photography, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society. The collaboration revolved around ICP’s 2014-2015 exhibition of renowned photographer Sebastiao Salgado’s Genesis, an eight-year worldwide survey of wildlife, landscapes, seascapes and indigenous peoples. Salgado’s photographs acted as a springboard for a unique public education program based at ICP and aimed at raising awareness of the urgent issue of climate change. Over the course of six months, Lamont and IRI scientists with expertise in climatology, dendrochronology, seismology and glaciology led gallery tours for the public, making links between their research and the places and people of Salgado’s photography. Lamont and IRI staff also gave talks throughout the exhibition period on topics ranging from climate change adaptation to the use of photography to help the public visualize the impacts of Earth’s changing climate. The research institutions also took over ICP’s Instagram feed for a week, showcasing the climate-related field work of more than a dozen scientists. All three institutions, the participating scientists and program attendees deemed the collaboration a success. We’ll explain what made this collaboration successful and provide tips on how scientists and their institutes can form similar collaborations with museums and other arts-based organizations.",

As such, this margin has become one of the most comprehensively studied formerly-glaciated continental margins in the world. Industrial operations have concentrated on the structure and geohazard potential of glacial sediments whilst academic work has looked at reconstructing environmental conditions during and since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This has generally consisted of mapping seafloor glacial geomorphology and a limited number of shallow sediment cores. Despite the increasingly large volume of 3D seismic reflection data available across the majority of the shelf, only limited work has been carried out investigating the oldest glaciations.\nA Plio-Pleistocene archive of glacial-interglacial history is preserved offshore and represents a unique study site because of the availability of 100s of 3D seismic reflection datasets. This database allows numerous different glacial erosion events and glacial landforms to be imaged throughout the glacially-derived NAUST Formation. We present an inventory of glacial history for the mid-Norwegian shelf and review the implications for the glacial history of Northwest Europe. This record shows glacial landforms such as iceberg scours, mega-scale glacial lineations and grounding-zone wedges, each of which provides an insight into ice characteristics. Dating is limited to a few tentative dates based on side-wall core data but we infer a further dating chronology based on dated sediments from the Voring Plateau, fluctuations in the benthic δ18O derived global sea level record, interpretation of seismic facies and the overall architecture. Glacial evidence is present regularly throughout the stratigraphy with the earliest evidence for marine terminating ice found at the base of the NAUST Formation at ~2.8 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Garnet enables constraints on all parameters relevant to lithosphere studies: pressure, temperature, strain, and time. This aspect, in combination with its widespread occurrence in metamorphic rocks and ability to resist retrogression, make the mineral a prime target in research into the dynamics of mountain belts. Garnet-based petrological and geochemical tools have diversified and improved as a result of recent advancements in spatial and analytical resolution. In particular, our ability to obtain precise age constraints using garnet Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology, and interpret these in a geological context has greatly improved. This contribution highlights a series of recent enhancements to the garnet toolkit and demonstrates its versatility in two case studies set in an archetypal collisional orogen: the Pamir-Himalaya-Tibet mountain chain.\nTo enable a more effective use of garnet geochronology, we investigated the retentiveness of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope signatures in naturally metamorphosed garnet. Diffusive re-equilibration of these signatures is shown to occur to a minor, if not insignificant, extent during crustal metamorphism, thus firmly establishing these methods as reliable geochronometers. Diffusive major-element zoning analysis of the same garnet led to the development of a new thermometric tool, which was shown to provide reliable temperature estimates for a wide variety of rocks and terranes.\nWe used Lu-Hf garnet geochronology to show that mid-crustal flow and ‘Barrovian-type’ metamorphism of rocks now exposed in the North Himalayan Gneiss Domes in Central Tibet commenced in the early Eocene. This result is the first to confirm that crustal thickening and contraction in the Tibetan Himalaya was broadly synchronous with the collision between Greater India and Eurasia. Garnet dating and thermometry, and rutile U-Pb thermochronology in the Pamir revealed a history of heating to 750-830 °C, commencing at 37 Ma in the South Pamir and occurring progressively later northward. This study advocates a causal link between Indian slab break-off to the south and progressive prograde heating of the Pamir hanging wall. Both studies demonstrate the ability of garnet to characterize crucial yet typically difficult to constrain early stages of mountain building.",

The Houston metropolitan area, especially the Houston Ship Channel, is a densely industrialized urban city with large concentrations of petroleum refining, petrochemical manufacturing, and heavy traffic during peak hours. Due to these and other emission sources, the area is heavily impacted by ambient PM. This study will be looking at fine PM (diameter less than 2.5µm, PM2.5) from all four sites. PM2.5fraction is relevant for understanding fate and transport of organic contaminants and is widely known to negatively impact human health.\nChemical analysis including radiocarbon (14C) and organic tracer measurements (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, hopanes, steranes, and levoglucosan) were used for source apportionment. The 14C measurements constrained CMB results to estimate both primary and secondary contributions to total organic carbon (TOC). Results indicate that Moody Tower had consistent primary motor vehicle exhaust contribution (18-27%) and a fossil secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contribution from 5-33% depending on atmospheric conditions. Conroe had a lower contribution of motor vehicle exhaust (5-10%) and similarly variable fraction of fossil SOA (4-25%). Manvel Croix had an interim motor vehicle contribution (9-15%) with a variable fossil SOA (5-30%). For contemporary OC, there was minimal contribution of wood smoke during examined weeks (0-9%) but larger contributor of biogenic SOA ranging from 40-75% at Moody Tower, 56-81% at Manvel Croix and 60-79% at Conroe. Overall, the motor vehicle contribution was consistent at each site during the analysis week, biogenic SOA was consistently high, while fossil SOA showed the most variability.",

The initial development times of bubbles were identified by manual processing of the data, and the periodic characteristics in the occurrence of bubbles were investigated using periodograms obtained from segments of bubble chains. Our preliminary results show that bubbles initiate at the time that the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) ends. This time corresponds to the time that the F region reaches the highest altitude where the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability is large. The initial onset time of bubbles varies with season and longitude in accordance with the variation of the PRE ending time. Our investigation of the periodicity in the occurrence of bubbles (spacing between bubbles) shows that a dominant periodicity does not exist; the spacing between bubbles ranges from 100 km to over 1000 km. A pronounced periodicity occurs in some series of bubbles, but, in general, multiple periodicity co-exists. The initiation of bubbles at a specific local time but the absence of a preferential wave property in the occurrence of bubbles lead to the conclusion that the onset of bubbles is controlled by the growth condition of the R-T instability.",

Removal of the vacuum pump and flow system may enable more compact instruments suitable for remote and mobile deployments as well as real time measurement of ‘sticky’ gases. However, open path operation introduces new challenges including exposure of high reflectivity mirrors to ambient air and aerosols, the need to measure wider (pressure broadened) spectral peaks and possible signal interferences due to optical extinction by aerosol particles in the cavity laser beam. The present submission focuses on the effects of aerosol particles on open-path CRDS using a near-infrared (1742 nm) methane gas measurement system as a test bed. A simple purge enclosure system was developed to prevent aerosol deposition on the cavity high-reflectors. The purge uses ambient air pulled in with a micro-pump through a hepa filter and maintained mirror reflectivity R>0.99996 over 100 hours of use in the presence of high aerosol loading. Optical extinction due to ambient aerosols can change the cavity loss and influence the recorded ring-down times. We observed relatively large fluctuations due to supermicron particles and a near-constant baseline shift due to smaller submicron particles. The fluctuations correspond to absorption on the order of 10-8–10-7 cm-1, comparable to the amplitude of the targeted methane absorption features, causing significant interference. Simple software filter approaches were developed to counter these fluctuations without a priori knowledge of the ambient aerosols. The filters exploit the statistical distribution of signals as well as the expected absorption lineshape. Using these filters, noise-equivalent sensitivities within a factor of ~3 of closed-path systems were obtained (4x10-10cm-1Hz-1/2). Outdoor open-path measurements were validated with side-by-side measurements with a commercial closed path system and showed agreement to <0.3 ppmv for measurement times of 10 s. We also present computations based on Mie theory to examine similar effects for our newer open-path CRDS sensors for detection of methane and ammonia in the mid-infrared.",

One data source is slant total electron content (TEC) from a ground station network to satellites, and along the occultation path between multiple satellites. This study examines GAIM-GM's capability to sense a scintillation feature in the ionosphere, overlaid on an IFM electron density grid, from simulated satellite constellations ingesting the slant TEC values into GAIM-GM. Satellite constellations were developed in an extension of Matlab, called STK. A real ground station network generated from IGS was ingested into STK to calculate access times to the satellite constellation and use the access data to compute the slant TEC values on the perturbed IFM grid. It was discovered that a Walker constellation would give the most frequent revisit time to the scintillation feature, which co-rotates with the Earth, capturing both the day and nightside ionosphere throughout the evaluation period (96 hrs). The size of the feature was varied along with the number of satellites in the Walker constellation. 25 different scenarios with these parameters varied were created to determine the sensitivity of GAIM-GM to sense the feature. A simple heuristic algorithm was applied comparing the truth data, in this case the perturbed IFM grid, to the GAIM-GM output in each scenario across the entire grid, and for those grid points within the feature.",

            "abstract": "A large gap between maize yields on average farmers’ fields and the highest yields achieved by either experiment or farmers is typical throughout the developing world, including in the North China Plain (NCP). This maize yield gap as identified by previous studies indicates large opportunities for raising yield by improving agronomy. Quzhou county is typical of the winter-wheat summer-maize system in NCP where the average plot size is as small as 0.25 hectares. To analyze this cropping system amidst the challenge of substantial heterogeneity, we identified fields that were either persistently higher or lower yielding according to the remote sensing yield estimates, and then conducted detailed field surveys. We found irrigation facility to be a major constraint to yield both in terms of irrigation water quality and farmers’ access to wells. In total, improving the access to unsalty water would be associated with a 0.32t/ha (4.2%) increase in multi-year average yield. In addition, farmers’ method of choosing cultivar, which likely relates to their overall knowledge level, significantly explained yield variation. In particular, those choosing cultivars according to technician advice, personal experiences and high yielding neighbors’ advice had on average higher yield than farmers that either followed seed sellers’ advice or collectively purchased seeds. Overall, the study presents a generalizable methodology of assessing yield gap as well as its persistent factors using a combination of satellite and survey data.",

The idea was that data sources would be identified with URIs, and data from these sources would be loaded in and a reasonable rendering of the data would be shown automatically. The scientist could then easily adjust plot axes and navigate the data. URIs would point to data files served on web sites, and Autoplot manages the download and freshness of the files. Data from different sources is easily integrated onto one page, and configurations are saved as \".vap\" files. The scientist can then easily communicate with others by sending URIs and attaching .vap files.\nAutoplot is used widely on many missions, and its set of features has grown as well. Autoplot's scripting is used by many students and workgroups to provide an alternate to IDL and Matlab which makes loading data and producing graphics trivial, and allowing the scientists to focus on the data. Autoplot has plug-ins that allow it to grab data directly from the CDAWeb and from the PDS/PPI Node, providing a more abstract facility for discovering data. Last, Autoplot has been used widely on the Van Allen Probes and Juno missions, and its use there is shown.",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs reduce water flow and increase the retention time which can provide conditions to increase primary production, sedimentation and nutrient retention. As a consequence, nutrient ratios and fluxes of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) may be altered which in turn affects the identity of limiting nutrients and the dynamics of primary production in downstream ecosystems. Residence time as well as the position of reservoirs along the longitudinal gradient (headwaters vs. mouth) may affect these processes. The Danube River Basin is one example where reservoirs have likely altered nutrient stoichiometry along the longitudinal gradient. It has a dam every 17 Km in the upper 1000 km of the river along with a very large dam complex (Iron Gates Dam) 117- Km from the mouth. There has been there has been an observed decline in Si flux, which may have led to changes in phytoplankton community structure in the Black Sea, but for which the causes for this decline are not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of reservoirs from headwaters to the mouth on nutrient stoichiometry in the Danube Basin.\nData on dissolved Si, N, and P concentrations from 1996 to 2012 were analyzed from 40 monitoring stations from the TransNational Monitoring Network (TNMN), which are located in the main stem of the Danube. Time series analysis is used to compare nutrient concentrations and ratios both through seasons and through the 15 year time-period. The monitoring stations are located above and below reservoirs in order to analyze the effect of reservoirs on nutrient ratios and fluxes. Preliminary results show that relationship of dissolved inorganic N (DIN): soluble reactive P (SRP) range from 207 to 76, while DIN:Si ratio ranges from 1.89 to 0.2 from the headwaters to the mouth.",

            "abstract": "The Interstellar Neutral (ISN) gas flow can be observed at Earth’s orbit due to the motion of the solar system relative to the surrounding interstellar gas. Since He is minimally influenced by ionization and charge exchange, the ISN He flow provides a sample of the pristine interstellar environment. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has observed the ISN gas flow over the past 7 years from a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth. IBEX is a Sun-pointing spinning spacecraft with energetic neutral atom (ENA) detectors observing perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. Due to the Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun, it is necessary for IBEX to perform spin axis pointing maneuvers every few days to maintain a sunward pointed spin axis. The IBEX operations team has successfully pointed the spin axis in a variety of latitude orientations during the mission, including in the ecliptic during the 2012 and 2013 seasons, about 5 degrees below the ecliptic during the 2014 season, and recently about 5 degrees above the ecliptic during the 2015 season, as well as optimizing observations with the spin axis pointed along the Earth-Sun line. These observations include a growing number of measurements near the perihelion of the interstellar atom trajectories, which allow for an improved determination of the ISN He bulk flow longitude at Earth orbit. Combining these bulk flow measurements with an analytical model (Lee et al. 2012 ApJS, 198, 10) based upon orbital mechanics improves the knowledge of the narrow ISN parameter tube, obtained with IBEX, which couples the interstellar inflow longitude, latitude, speed, and temperature.",

It has been proposed that the Capon method for spectral estimation can be used for high-resolution estimation of the brightness distribution. We investigate the application of the Capon method to measurements made by a small (7-baseline) 30 MHz ionospheric coherent backscatter radar interferometer in Sao Luis, Brazil. The longest baseline of the interferometer is only 15 times the wavelength of radar signal (10 m), and the ionospheric radar soundings have been made using only 4-8 kW transmitters. Nevertheless, we have been able to obtain high-resolution (kilometric scales in the zonal direction) images of scattering structures during equatorial spread F (ESF) events over a wide field of view (+/- 10 degrees off zenith). We will present numerical simulations demonstrating the performance of the technique for the Sao Luis radar setup as well as results of the Capon technique applied to actual measurements. We will discuss the behavior of the ESF scattering structures as seen in the Capon images. The high-resolution images can assist our interpretation of plasma instabilities in the equatorial ionosphere and serve to test our ability to model the behavior of ionospheric irregularities during space weather events such as those associated with ESF.",

Three 60-h cases are based on observations obtained during the RACORO field campaign at the ARM Climate Research Facility’s Southern Great Plains site. This study examines large-eddy simulation (LES) of one of the three cases that is dominated by boundary layer cumulus clouds. Two LES models are driven by continuous large-scale and surface forcings and are constrained by multimodal and temporally varying aerosol number size distribution profiles derived from aircraft observations. We compare simulated cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties with ground-based remote sensing and aircraft observations. The LES simulations capture the observed transitions of the evolving cumulus-topped boundary layers during the three daytime periods and generally reproduce variations of droplet number concentration with liquid water content (LWC), corresponding to the gradient between the cloud centers and cloud edges at given heights. While observed LWC values fall within the range of simulated values, observed droplet number concentrations are commonly higher than simulated, although differences remain on par with estimated experimental error in the aircraft measurements. Sensitivity studies examine the influences of bin microphysics versus bulk microphysics, aerosol advection, supersaturation treatment, and aerosol hygroscopicity. Simulated macrophysical cloud properties are found to be insensitive to microphysics treatment in this non-precipitating case, but microphysical properties are especially sensitive to bulk microphysics supersaturation treatment and aerosol hygroscopicity.",

Here, we present oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) isotope data on carbonate from sediment cores spanning 640 ka recovered as part of the Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid (SCOPSCO) project. Previous work on cores from the lake (up to 15 m, <140 ka) indicated that the Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) content of sediments was highly sensitive to climate change during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, comprising abundant endogenic calcite through interglacials and being almost absent in glacials, apart from discrete bands of early diagenetic authigenic siderite. Isotope measurements on calcite (δ18Oc and δ13Cc) reveal variations both between and within interglacials that suggest the lake has been subject to hydroclimate fluctuations on orbital and millennial timescales. We also measured isotopes on authigenic siderite (δ18Os and δ13Cs) and, with the δ18Oc and δ18Os, reconstruct δ18O of lakewater (δ18Olw). Glacials are observed to have lower δ18Olw when compared to interglacials, most likely due to cooler summer temperatures, a higher proportion of winter precipitation (snowfall), and a reduced inflow from neighbouring Lake Prespa. The isotope data suggest Lake Ohrid experienced a period of overall stability through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 15 to 13, highlighting MIS 14 as a particularly warm glacial, and MIS 9 was isotopically freshest. Following MIS 9, the variability between glacial and interglacial δ18Olw is enhanced and the lake became increasingly evaporated through to present day with MIS 5 having the highest average δ18Olw. These findings provide new evidence for long-term climate change in the northern Mediterranean region, which will form the basis to better understand the influence of major environmental events on endemic speciation within the lake.",

In addition to providing a reliable water supply in terms of water quantity and quality, the city has to fulfill other flow objectives to serve downstream communities. At times, such as during extreme hydrological events, water quality issues may restrict water usage for parts of the system. To support a risk-based water supply decision making process NYC has developed the Operations Support Tool (OST). OST combines a water supply systems model with reservoir water quality models, near real time data ingestion, data base management and an ensemble hydrological forecast. A number of reports have addressed the frequency and intensities of extreme hydrological events across the continental US. In the northeastern US studies have indicated an increase in the frequency of extremely large precipitation and streamflow events during the most recent decades. During this presentation we describe OST and, using case studies we demonstrate how this tool has been useful to support operational decisions. We also want to motivate a discussion about how undergoing changes in patterns of hydrological extreme events elevate the challenge faced by water supply managers and the role of the scientific community to integrate nonstationarity approaches in hydrologic forecast and modeling.",

Depending on the character of the sediments there is potential for leaching or sequestration of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from the sediments. This could have significant implications for water quality, aquatic metabolism, and global cycling of C and N. This study examines the fate of these sediments by: (1) determining the amount and quality of organic matter that can be leached into the surrounding water from coarse, medium and fine particle classes (2) assessing the C and N contents of various particles classes and the sources of the sediment through isotopic composition.\nBed sediment samples were collected along a 1-2nd order stream (eight locations) in a forested catchment in the Piedmont region of Maryland following a large storm event. Samples were sieved into three particle classes – coarse (2mm-1mm), medium (1mm-250µm) and fine (<250µm). Extractions were performed for each of three particle class sizes by leaching with DI water. Organic matter composition for the extracts was characterized using fluorescence. Stable isotopes of 13C and 15N were determined for bed sediment classes and upland source sediments to identify the origins of the eroded sediments.\nExtracts with low C:N ratios that also exhibit a higher percent protein and lower percent humic carbon content are considered most labile. Within the bed sediment deposits, differences were found in the distribution of labile compounds between each particle class size. Generally, course particle size exhibited the most labile characteristics, closely followed by medium particle size. Fine particle size exhibited the most refractory characteristics in all locations.\nThese results are critical since climate-change predictions reveal more intense and large storms for the northeast US, with potentially greater impacts on aquatic ecosystems from eroded upland sediments.",

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss from organic soil horizons occurs through hydrologically-mediated leaching processes, and contributes to downstream carbon both in deeper mineral soils and also in connected aquatic systems. However, the amount of DOC that leaves organic horizons and the environmental controls on this flux are poorly understood and are likely to be affected by climate changes. We sampled zero-tension lysimeters along 3 forested sites of a boreal climate transect to estimate DOC export from organic soil horizons of mesic boreal podzols (spodosols), and to investigate the climatic drivers of this flux. The sites are part of the Newfoundland and Labrador Boreal Ecosystems Latitudinal Transect (NL-BELT) and span approximately 5°C in mean annual temperature.\nLysimeters were sampled over 4 years and DOC flux was calculated for each seasonal period (summer, fall, and winter) of each year. DOC flux was greatest in the warmest site (114 mg C day-1 m-2), with the two cooler sites having lower flux rates (40 and 36 mg C day-1 m-2 in the intermediate and coolest sites respectively). Seasonal variation was most pronounced in the warmest site where more DOC exited the organic soil horizons during fall than during summer or winter. DOC flux was correlated with the volume of soil solution collected in the lysimeters (R2 = .46), however the larger sample volumes collected in the warmest climate do not reflect greater overall precipitation. During the 4-year period of this study, similar amounts of precipitation were recorded in all regions, and the number of days with >10mm precipitation did not differ. The greater DOC flux in the warmer climate site may be due to higher rates of both litterfall and decomposition, contributing to increased labile DOC sources in the warmer climate. Analyses of the carbon quality of these samples and a better understanding of the seasonal hydrological drivers of leaching are being pursued to further investigate the potential climate influence on DOC export from these boreal organic soil horizons.",

In particular, flask samples are analyzed for a number of hydrocarbons with policy and health relevance such as ozone precursors, greenhouse gases, and hazardous air pollutants. Because this global network’s sites are remote and therefore minimally influenced by local anthropogenic emissions, these data yield information about background ambient mole fractions and can provide a context for observations collected in intensive field campaigns, such as the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE), the Southeast Nexus (SENEX) study, and the DISCOVER-AQ deployments. Information about background mole fractions during field campaigns is critical for calculating hydrocarbon enhancements in the region of study and for assessing the extent to which a particular region’s local emissions sources contribute to these enhancements. Understanding the geographic variability of the background and its contribution to regional ambient mole fractions is also crucial for the development of realistic regulations. We present background hydrocarbon mole fractions and their ratios in North America using data from air samples collected in the planetary boundary layer at tall towers and aboard aircraft from 2008 to 2014. We discuss the spatial and seasonal variability in these data. We present trends over the time period of measurements and propose possible explanations for these trends.",

            "abstract": "The Mg/Ca of planktic foraminifera shells has become a widely used paleothermometer. However, culture-based calibrations have been confined primarily to low-latitude species with limited data from species growing below 12°C. Some core-top calibrations on high-latitude Neogloboquadrinids raise questions about the influence of [CO3-2] and low Mg/Ca “crusts” on shell geochemistry (e.g. 1). This study seeks to extend the low temperature range of culture-based calibrations to temperatures relevant in high-latitudes and active upwelling areas, taking into account the wide range of [CO3-2] observed in these environments. We further examine whether intrashell geochemical variability in the form of “crusting” poses a limitation to Mg/Ca paleothermometry of crust-forming species.\nHere we present the results of laboratory experiments with living Neogloboquadrina incompta and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma collected and cultured at UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory at temperatures between 6° and 12°C and a range of [CO3-2]. We use a combination of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry and Electron Microprobe mapping, to analyze both intraspecific and intrashell variability in Mg/Ca. We extend existing culture-based temperature calibrations to 6°C, while accounting for the effect of environmental [CO3-2]. Single-shell analyses reveal a high degree of intraspecific variability in the Mg/Ca of calcite grown under stable laboratory conditions. Intrashell analyses identify characteristic low Mg/Ca \"crusts\" in N. incomptagrown at constant temperature, which record chamber average Mg/Ca within the range of uncrusted conspecifics grown at the same temperature.\n1.

            "abstract": "It has been reported that phytoplankton growth in the High Nutrient-Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions is limited by dissolved iron (DFe) concentration (e.g., Martin and Fitzwater, 1988). Aerosol is known as one of the dominant sources of DFe to the ocean and classified into two origins such as anthropogenic and natural. A series of recent studies showed that Fe in anthropogenic aerosols is more soluble than that in natural aerosols (Takahashi et al., 2013) and has lower isotopic ratio (Mead et al., 2013). However, the difference between Fe isotopic ratio　(δ56Fe: [(56Fe/54Fe)sample/(56Fe/54Fe)IRMM-14]-1) of two origins reported in Mead et al. (2013) is not so large compared with the standard deviation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine Fe species and δ56Fe in anthropogenic aerosols more accurately and to evaluate its contribution to the ocean surface.\n Iron species were determined by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis, while δ56Fe in size-fractionated aerosols were measured by MC-ICP-MS (NEPTUNE Plus) after chemical separation using anion exchange resin.\n Dominant Fe species in the samples were, ferrihydrite, hematite, and biotite. It was also revealed that coarse particles contained a larger amount of biotite and that fine particles contained a larger amount of hematite, which suggested that anthropogenic aerosols were emitted during combustion processes. In addition, results of Fe isotopic ratio analysis suggested that δ56Fe of coarse particles were around +0.25‰, whereas that of fine particles were -0.5 ∼ -2‰, which was lower than the δ56Fe in anthropogenic aerosol by Mead et al. (2013). The size-fractionated sampling made it possible to determine the δ56Fe in anthropogenic aerosol. Soluble component in fine particles extracted by simulated rain water also showed much lower δ56Fe (δ56Fe = -3.9±0.12‰), suggesting that anthropogenic Fe has much lower isotopic ratio. The remarkably low δ56Fe may be caused by the anthropogenic combustion process. The δ56Fe in anthropogenic aerosols measured here is important to model the budget of iron in the surface ocean.",

It is found that stratiform precipitation is dominated in all regions of TCs, especially in IB, the proportion of convective precipitation is highest in IC regions and the proportion of stratiform precipitation is highest in IB regions. The highest average precipitation rate of convective precipitation, stratiform precipitation and other precipitation occur in IC regions, and the lowest occur in OB regions. Only 1.1% of all the precipitation features have maximum 20-dBZ radar echo ≥ 14 km, which contribute 24.4% of rainfall and 70.0% of lightning. The precipitation features in IC regions have much stronger radar echoes and ice scattering (i.e. lower 85 GHz PCT) than those in IB and OB regions, which indicates that the strongest convections appear in IC region, and the convection intensity increases as the TC intensity increases. Stronger convective cells also occur in IC regions, but there strength changes little during different TC categories. There is significant difference of flash density of precipitation feature normalized by the raining area in IC and OB regions among different TC categories, and the lowest flash density is always found in IB regions. The flash density in OB features is 1.2 times higher than that in IC features for all TC categories, the flash density in IC features 2.4 times higher than that in OB features for CAT35 TCs, but the flash rate of both precipitation features and convective cells in IC regions is highest except for CAT12 TCs",

            "abstract": "Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) which was launched on 27 June 2010, developed to detect, monitor, and predict the ocean phenomena around Korea. Although GOCI was developed to observe the ocean environment, GOCI has also enormous scientific data for land surface. However, it is extremely important to extract the cloud pixels over the land surface to utilize its data for the land application. Over the land surface, the reflectance variation is higher and the characteristic of surface is more various than those over the ocean. Furthermore, the infra-red (IR) channel is not included in 8 GOCI bands, which is useful to detect the thin cloud and the water vapor with cloud top temperature. Nevertheless, GOCI has potential to detect the cloud using the temporal variation due to the characteristics of geostationary satellite observation. The purpose of this study is to estimate the cloud masking maps over the Korean Peninsula. For cloud masking with GOCI, following methods are used; simple threshold with reflectance and ratio of bands, adaptive threshold with multi-temporal images, and stable multi-temporal vegetation image. In the case of adaptive threshold, high variable cloudy when comparing with surface reflectance is used by comparing the surface reflectance by temporal based analysis. In this study, the multi-temporal NDVI data processed by the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) modeling also used to reflect the relative solar-target-sensor geometry during the daytime. This result will have a substantial role for the land application using GOCI data.",

At regional scales, deviations in cyclone characteristics are often derived using idealized perturbations in the humidity, temperature and surface conditions. In this work, a more realistic approach is adopted by applying climate perturbations from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) to ERA-interim data to generate the initial and boundary conditions for future climate simulations. The climate signal perturbations are generated from the differences in 21 years of mean data from CCSM4 with representative concentration pathways (RCP8.5) for the periods: (a) 2070-2090 (future climate), (b) 2025-2045 (near-future climate) and (c) 1985-2005 (current climate). Four individual cyclone cases are simulated with and without climate perturbations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a nested configuration. Each cyclone is characterized by variations in intensity, landfall location, precipitation and societal damage. To calculate societal damage, we use the recently introduced Cyclone Damage Potential (CDP) index evolved from the Willis Hurricane Index (WHI). As CDP has been developed for general societal applications, this work should provide useful insights for resilience analyses and industry (e.g., re-insurance).",

A large part of the observed non-linear structures are associated with whistler waves and some of them can be directly driven by whistlers. The parameters favorable for the generation of TDS were studied experimentally as well as making use of 2-D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for the system with inhomogeneous magnetic field. It is shown that an outward propagating front of whistlers and hot electrons amplifies oblique whistlers which collapse into regions of intense parallel electric field with properties consistent with recent observations of TDS from the Van Allen Probe satellites. Oblique whistlers seed the parallel electric fields that are driven by the beams. The resulting parallel electric fields trap and heat the precipitating electrons. These electrons drive spikes of intense parallel electric field with characteristics similar to the TDSs seen in the VAP data. The decoupling of the whistler wave and the nonlinear electrostatic component is shown in PIC simulation in the inhomogeneous magnetic field system. These effects are observed by the Van Allen Probes in the radiation belts. The precipitating hot electrons propagate away from the source region in intense bunches rather than as a smooth flux.",

(3) At last, the energetic electron flux can be further raised in the BBFs due to adiabatic acceleration mechanisms.

            "abstract": "Vanadium (V) is a transition metal with isotopes of 50V and 51V, and oxidation states of +2, +3, +4 and +5. The average concentration in seawater is 1.9 ppb, which results in a marine residence time of ~50 kyrs. Its various oxidation states make it a potential tool for investigating redox conditions in the ocean and sediments due to redox related changes in the valance state of vanadium. In turn, chemical equilibrium between different oxidation states of V will likely cause isotopic fractionation that can potentially be utilized to quantify past ocean redox states. In order to apply V isotopes as a paleo-redox tracer, it is required that we know the isotopic composition of seawater and the relation to marine sources and sinks of V.\nWe developed a novel method for pre-concentrating V and measuring the isotope ratio in seawater samples. In our method, we used four ion exchange chromatography columns to separate vanadium from seawater matrix elements, in particular titanium and chromium, which both have an isobaric interference on 50V. The first column uses the NOBIAS resin, which effectively separates V and other transition metals from the majority of seawater matrix. Subsequent columns are identical to those utilized when separating V from silicate samples (Nielsen et al, Geostand. Geoanal. Res., 2011). The isotopic composition of the purified V is measured using a Thermo Scientific Neptune multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) in medium resolution mode. This setup resolves all molecular interferences from masses 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53 including S-O species on mass 50.\nTo test the new method, we spiked an open ocean seawater sample from the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station with 10-25 μg of Alfa Aesar vanadium solution, which has an isotopic composition of δ51V = 0 [where δ51V = 1000 × [(51V/50Vsample - 51V/50VAA)/51V/50VAA]. The average of six spiked samples is -0.03±0.19‰, which is within error of the true value of 0‰. The average yield of 96% further shows that our method is not associated with any loss of V. Preliminary results for un-spiked BATS seawater samples reveal V isotopic compositions close to that of the AA standard. Further analyses of BATS seawater as well as the NASS-6 seawater reference material are in progress.",

            "abstract": "On Mars, the crater degradation processes and rates seem to have changed drastically after the Noachian Period. Relative to the post Noachian craters and impact craters on the Moon and Mercury, Noachian craters generally have distinct cross-sectional profiles, with relatively flat floors and eroded rims. Craters are preserved at various stages of modification, and many larger craters are more heavily degraded than smaller ones. Furthermore, many small Noachian craters (<20–40 km in diameter) have been lost from the surface record, including nearly all Noachian craters <4 km in diameter, while larger ones were degraded to a rimless and shallow form, requiring substantial lateral erosion and infilling. This observation supports that more prolonged erosion is required than can be explained by late, short-lived events at the Noachian-Hesperian (N/H) transition. Longer-term conditions are also more relevant to biological evolutionary timescales than are shorter-term climatic excursions.\nWe have modeled the evolution of three study sites in the Martian highlands (Noachis Terra, Terra Cimmeria, and Margaritifer Terra near Parana Valles) to constrain the erosional processes and rates that prevailed before the valley networks formed. The purpose of this study is to determine which suite(s) of geomorphic processes and rates best reproduce the relict Noachian landscape and to constrain the long-term Noachian environment through landscape evolution modeling of representative study areas in the Martian highlands.\nOur model runs indicate that the rate and pattern of Noachian erosion might have been limited by the weathering rate of the bedrock, if runoff production was high. When the bedrock was set to as readily erodible as regolith, crater rims retreated rapidly, causing the resulting surface topography to be largely obliterated over the model timescale. Also an arid to semiarid climate with a low dependence of runoff upon contributing area best replicates the degree of fluvial dissection and crater degradation in these region.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - thiemann_sxr_agu2015_final.pdf\nThe Extreme UltraViolet Monitor (EUVM) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) probe at Mars characterizes the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft x-ray (SXR) input into the Martian atmosphere. EUVM measures solar irradiance at 0-7 nm, 17-22 nm and 121.6 nm at a nominal 1 second cadence. These bands were selected to capture variability originating at different heights in the solar atmosphere; and are used to drive the Flare Irradiance Solar Model at Mars (FISM-M) that is a model of the solar spectrum from 0.1-190 nm with 1 nm resolution and produced routinely as the EUVM Level 3 data product.\nThe 0-5 nm range of the solar spectrum is of particular aeronomic interest because the primary species of the Mars upper atmosphere have Auger transitions in this range. When an Auger transition is excited by incident SXR radiation, secondary electrons are emitted with sufficient energy to further ionize the atmosphere. Because these transitions are highly structured, sub-nm resolution of the solar spectrum is needed in the 0-5 nm range to fully constrain the solar input and more accurately characterize the energetics of the upper atmosphere.\nAt Earth, .1 nm resolution estimates of the solar 0-5 nm range are produced by the X-ray Photometer System (XPS) onboard the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite by combining broad-band SXR measurements with solar flare temperature measurements to drive an atomic physics based forward model of solar coronal emissions. This spectrum has been validated with other models as well as with photo-electron and day glow measurements at Earth.\nSimilar to XPS, the EUVM 0-7 nm and 17-22 nm bands can be used to produce an XPS-like model at Mars, but with reduced precision due to differences in the available bands. We present first results of this technique applied to a set of solar flares observed by MAVEN EUVM and Earth assets. In addition to comparing EUVM and Earth-asset derived 0-5 nm solar spectra to characterize the effectiveness of this technique, we compare Mars atmospheric photoelectron spectral measurements made by MAVEN's Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) against modeled photoelectron spectra which use the EUVM derived 0-5 nm solar spectrum as an input.",

Remote sensing sensors are the most useful tool to locate dust sources. These sensors include microwaves, visible channels, and lidar. On the global scale, major dust source regions have been identified using polar orbiting satellite instruments. The MODIS Deep Blue algorithm has been particularly useful to detect small-scale sources such as floodplains, alluvial fans, rivers, and wadis , as well as to identify anthropogenic sources from agriculture. The recent release of Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products allows to extend dust source detection to the entire land surfaces, which is quite useful to identify mid to high latitude dust sources and detect not only dust from agriculture but fugitive dust from transport and industrial activities. This presentation will overview the advantages and drawbacks of using MODIS Deep Blue for dust detection, compare to other instruments (polar orbiting and geostationary). The results of Collection 6 with a new dust screening will be compared against AERONET. Applications to long range transport of anthropogenic dust will be presented.",

However, a spurious cloud/boundary layer oscillation was identified in CAPT simulations with CLUBB. A case study indicates that the oscillation occurs when the boundary layer undergoes a 4-6-hour cycle of growth, decoupling, and replacement. Global screening proves that the oscillation is a common phenomenon in trade cumulus regimes over the world. This study will discuss the mechanism how drizzle-cloud-turbulence interactions in CAM5 with CLUBB causes the spurious oscillation. The findings from this study can help us better understand the drizzle-cloud-turbulence interactions in climate models with a higher-order turbulence scheme and guide the future improvement of this parameterization.\nAcknowledgement: This work is supported by the ASR Program for the Office of Science of the U.S. DOE.

            "abstract": "During the summer in the U.S. Great Plains, some of the heaviest precipitation falls from large thunderstorm complexes known as Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs). These frequently occurring MCSs are often nocturnal in nature, so the dynamics associated with these systems are more elusive than those in the daytime. The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign was launched over a 7-week period as an endeavor to better understand nocturnal MCSs occurring in the Great Plains. PECAN featured a dense array of ground-based and airborne instruments to observe nocturnal MCS, including dual-polarization radars at multiple frequencies, mobile mesonets, and sounding units. Our role in PECAN involved deploying Ott Parsivel disdrometers to gain information on drop size distributions (DSDs) and fall speeds. Analysis of disdrometer data in conjunction with radar data presented using Contour Frequency by Altitude Diagrams (CFADs) and high-resolution radiosonde data allows for a structural comparison of PECAN MCS cases to previously identified MCS archetypes. Novel insights into the structural evolution of nocturnal MCSs in relation to their synoptic, mesoscale, and thermodynamic environments are presented, using data collected from dense and numerous observation platforms. Understanding the environmental conditions that result in different nocturnal MCS configurations is useful for gaining insight into precipitation distributions and potential severe weather and flooding hazards in the Great Plains.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface liquid meltwater on ice shelves has been inferred to influence ice shelf stability if it induces hydrofracture and is linked to disintegration events on the Larsen B and the Wilkins ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer months. While the initial Wilkins disintegration event occurred in March of 2009, two smaller disintegration events followed in May and in July of that year. It has long been assumed meltwater refreezes soon after surface melt processes cease. Given this assumption, an earlier hypothesis for the two winter season disintegration events was hydrofracture via a brine infiltration layer. Two lines of evidence supported this hypothesis 1) early airborne radar surveys did not record a reflection from the bottom of the ice shelf, and 2) a shallow core drilled in 1972 on the Wilkins encountered liquid water at a depth of ~7 m. The salinity of the water and the temperature at the base of the core, however, were not described. The recent discovery of winter season liquid meltwater storage on the Greenland ice sheet has changed perceptions on meltwater longevity at depth in firn. Evidence of Greenland’s firn aquifer includes liquid meltwater encountered in shallow firn cores at 5 m depth and a lack of reflections from the base of the ice sheet in airborne surveys. Thus, previous lines of evidence suggesting brine infiltration may alternatively suggest the presence of a perennial firn aquifer.\nWe recently demonstrated the capability for observation of Greenland’s firn aquifer from space using multi-frequency active and passive microwave remote sensing. This research exploits the retrieval technique developed for Greenland to provide the first spaceborne mappings of winter season liquid meltwater storage on the Wilkins. We combine L-band brightness temperature and backscatter data from the MIRAS instrument (1.4 GHz) aboard ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission and the radar (1.3 GHZ) and radiometer(1.4 GHz) aboard NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive mission with C-band backscatter data from EUMETSAT’s Advanced Scatterometer aboard the tandem orbiting MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites. The presence of a firn aquifer on the Wilkins ice sheet provides a potentially important link between winter season liquid meltwater storage and ice shelf instability on the Antarctic ice sheet.",

Because this stock extends to several meters below the surface for many coastal wetlands, it becomes paramount to understand the fate of OC under ecosystem shifts, varying natural environmental constraints, and changing land use. In this project we analyze the major classes of biochemicals including total hydrolysable neutral carbohydrates, enantiomeric amino acids, phenols, and cutins/suberins at two study sites located on the Texas coastline to investigate chemical composition and its controls on organic carbon preservation in mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) dominated wetlands. Results show neutral carbohydrates and lignin contribute 30-70% and 10-40% of total OC, respectively, in plant litter and surface sediments at both sites. Sharp declines of carbohydrate yields with depth occur parallel to increasing Ac/AlS,V ratios indicating substantial decomposition of both the polysaccharide and lignin components of litter detritus. Contrasts in the compositions and relative abundances of all previously mentioned compound classes are further discussed to examine the role of litter biochemistry in OC preservation. For example, the selective preservation of cellulose over hemicellulose in sediments indicates macromolecular structure plays a key role in preservation between plant types. It is concluded that the chemical composition of litter material controls the composition and magnitude of OC stored in sediments. Ultimately, as these ecosystems transition from one dominant plant type to another, as is currently observed along the Texas coastline, there is the potential for OC sequestration efficiency to shift due to the changing composition of OC input to sediments.",

Here, we present the first ever longitudinal (north-south) inter-comparison of a multi-year dataset (2004-2014) of discharge for four drainage basins – Watson, Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua, Naujat Kuat, and North Rivers - along West Greenland. These in situ hydrologic measurements are compared with modeled runoff output from Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) regional climate model, and the performance of the model is examined. An analysis of the relationship between modeled and actual ice sheet runoff patterns is assessed, and provides insight into the model’s ability to capture inter-annual and intra-annual variability, spatiotemporal patterns, and extreme melt events.

            "abstract": "Roots are responsible for water and nutrient uptake for plant needs, functioning to couple the above and belowground ecosystems as a photosynthesis driver. Roots respond to their environment with foraging strategies to maximize nutrient acquisition. However, roots have one of the simplest representations in Earth System Models (ESMs). Most root algorithms in ESMs consist of a fixed rooting depth and distribution, which varies only with plant functional type (PFT). Although this method works in general for many ecosystems, there are several regions (e.g., arid, boreal) where root distribution is either overestimated or underestimated resulting in plant stress induced lost productivity. In order to allow ecosystems to respond to changes in environment such as from climate change, roots require a time varying structure to adapt to heterogeneity of water and nitrogen in the soil. This work presents a new approach to representing roots in the Community Land Model. The methodology is designed to optimize root distribution for both water and nitrogen uptake, with a priority given to plant water needs. The roots can respond to the soil vertical profile of nutrients, influencing the plant extractable resources and therefore the above ground vegetation dynamics. The dynamic root profile results in an increase in gross primary productivity and crop yield.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is widely recognized as a driver of many important biogeochemical processes. For example, ecosystem productivity, microbial lifecycles, soil organic matter decomposition, soil secondary mineralogy, the development and persistence of redox gradients, and the export of dissolved carbon are all sensitive to soil-water content and potential. In turn, each of these processes is recognized as an important control on the turnover of soil organic carbon. These dependencies raise a key question: Is the flux of water through unsaturated soils the dominant driver of soil organic carbon turnover across broad spatial scales?\nTo better characterize the importance of soil moisture fluxes, we synthesize data from a number of soil studies to evaluate how total soil carbon storage, carbon residence time, and depth dependent gradients vary in relation to soil hydrologic fluxes. Specifically, we compare soil carbon storage and stability to measured and/or modeled infiltration ([precipitation + condensation] – [evapotranspiration + runoff]) and long-term soil water flux estimates from chloride mass balance, or other techniques. Additionally, we consider the interaction of soil age and hydrology, as the development of secondary mineral horizons during pedogenesis represents a critical threshold in both soil water flux and soil organic carbon turnover. We focus on data from 3 previously descried soil chronosequences, including the Santa Cruz, Mattole, and Merced terraces, which together span a wide range of age and soil moisture conditions. Across these sites, organic carbon accumulates to greater depths in the soils with highest infiltration but the relationship between turnover and soil moisture is not as straightforward. To help interpret these results, we compare field data against simulations of biogeochemical reactions involving soil carbon and the resulting isotopic gradients using the reactive transport model CrunchTope. Overall, this effort provides for an improved understanding of the role of soil moisture fluxes in controlling soil carbon turnover and is an essential step toward accurate predictions of soil responses to climate change.",

Previously acquired spectral data from ground-based observatories as well as by Voyager IRIS and Cassini CIRS during Jupiter flybys will be investigated using current methods and capabilities. The thermal (mid-) IR aurora from Jupiter’s polar regions, hydrocarbon abundances, and thermal structure retrieved from the ground and from space-based investigations will be compared and used to illustrate the different capabilities and complementarity of the measurement platforms. We report on the reexamination and re-analysis of hydrocarbon emission spectra from Jupiter obtained using ground-based ultra-high spectral resolution infrared heterodyne spectroscopy (IRHS) and Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) from Cassini CIRS during its flyby of Jupiter in 2000-2001 and Voyager IRIS data obtained during flybys in 1979. Measurements with IRHS have been made over 30 years, primarily of ethane near 12 micrometer wavelength. These measurements yield fully resolved individual spectral lines whose shape provides unique information on variability of temperature and abundance. CIRS and IRIS data at coarser spectral resolution provide extended spatial distributions covering a broad spectral region, including abundances and auroral response of hydrocarbon constituents in the 8–13 micrometer spectral region (ethane, methane, ethylene, and acetylene). Analysis shows detailed spatial variability of the primary hydrocarbons in northern latitudes. Temporal changes of the ethane line emission over three solar cycles and comparison of retrievals from ethane data taken contemporaneously during the Cassini flyby by both techniques will be compared and results discussed. From these analyses, the expectation is that the thermal IR auroral emission may be low during the Juno tour at Jupiter Results will be useful for the Juno mission, since it does not have instrumentation in this spectral region and this work provides complementary information and diagnostics to study Jupiter in a spectral region and altitude range not directly probed by Juno.",

With proper thermo-chronological tools we can detect the transporting routes of analyzed grains, unroofing history of intended study area, denudation pattern of target watershed, and potentially the activity of existing active structures.\nIn this study, we applied multiple thermo-chronometers to gain our understanding toward the surface process of middle Yarlung-Tsangpo, Tibet. Modern river samples were collected near the river mouth of two major tributaries of Yarlung-Tsangpo, Lhasa River and Nyang River. Basement rock samples were acquired across some transects of well-known rifting structures within the Lhasa River catchment. Target minerals were separated and subject to a series of thermo-chronological analyses: Apatite and zircon grains for fission track dating; K-feldspar grains for Ar-Ar (laser ablation) analyses; in addition, zircon grains were firstly counted for fission track results and then double analyzed for U/Pb ages.\nResults from apatite/zircon fission track and Ar-Ar (K-feldspar) analyses all display a distinctive pattern showing high fraction of young thermal age component (younger than 20 Ma) dominates within the Lhasa River (over 80%). Zircon double dating results suggest that these young thermal ages are not directly linked to recent emplacement of crystalline bodies but reflecting an episode of exhumation in the Lhasa River catchment. Comparisons of Ar-Ar results between upstream and downstream samples from Lhasa River further imply that the key area generating young thermal ages lies upon the upstream regime of the catchment, where the Nyainqentanglha Range and the active Gulu rifting belt are situated. Thermo-chronological data from basement transects across the rifting belt and the modern sediments are compiled to better depict the focused denudation pattern.",

In general for a given pressure, lower temperature increases the partitioning of hydrogen into ppv for the aluminous models, but not for the aluminum free models.

            "abstract": "Presented here are preliminary results of a numerical modeling study on the feasibility of using DC resistivity data to make useful inferences on depth, size and orientation of subsurface fracture systems in an active oilfield environment. Specifically, we consider an experiment where the steel-cased borehole (consisting of a shallow, vertical section and deep, horizontal section) is one electrode of the DC source, with the other source electrode grounded at the Air/Earth interface some distance away. For simplicity, the fractures are modeled as short sequence of vertical sheets intersecting the horizontal section of the well casing. Finite element analysis of this system shows that as fracture conductivity is elevated, two effects (at least) are observed: a local perturbation in the electric potential in the vicinity of the fracture set, with limited far-field expression; and, an overall change in the electric potential of the entire borehole casing due to current leakage at the site of the fractures. Under ideal conditions, our results suggest that far-field, time-lapse measurements of DC potentials surrounding a borehole casing can be reliably interpreted by simple, linear inversion for a Coulomb charge distribution along the borehole path, including a local charge perturbation due to the fractures. In contrast to regularized, nonlinear 3D inversion of broadband EM or DC data, this approach offers an inexpensive method for detecting and monitoring the time-evolution of electrically conducting fractures while ultimately providing an estimate of their effective conductivity – the latter providing an important measure independent of seismic methods on fracture shape, size, and hydraulic connectivity.",

In our work to date, we have focused on hydrocarbon-rich environments, including the La Brea Tar Pits and the Gulf of Mexico.

            "abstract": "Advances in high performance computational resources and frameworks now make possible the use of Numerical Weather Predication (NWP) models for high-resolution simulations of atmospheric flows. In order to develop best practices, standards, and procedures for multi-scale simulations, we need to carry out extensive validation of NWP models across unprecedented range of scales from hundreds of kilometers to tens of meters. However, there are limited observational data available for evaluating high-resolution models. Recently, Nunalee et al (2015) validated large-eddy simulations (LES) using WRF for flow and dispersion based on the Cinder Cone Butte experiment carried out in Idaho in 1982. This study involved moderately complex terrain. We now extend the study to a significantly more complex terrain based on a more recent field study in Idaho. This field study include two experiments: the first one carried out in 2010 and centered on the Big Southern Butte (BSB) and the second in 2011 centered on the Salmon River Canyon both in Idaho (Butler et al., 2015).\nAs a first step, here we focus on using the observations from the BSB experiment to validate multi-scale simulations using the WRF model. We carry out both mesoscale simulations and large-eddy simulations (LES). Nested mesoscale simulations are carried out using the innermost nest with grid cell size of 300m while nested WRF-LES are carried with grid cell size of ~50m. We analyze the performance of PBL scheme in mesoscale simulations and the resulting interplay between subgrid parameterization and numerical advection scheme in LES. The results of this analysis are used to assess performance of PBL schemes in complex terrain where the assumption of horizontal homogeneity on which these schemes are based are violated and to suggest the modifications to PBL scheme to account for the effect of heterogeneity.",

Various methods have shown the uncertainty of CERES fluxes over sea ice to be higher than other scene types. However validation against an independent radiative flux measurement has never been attempted. We present here an attempt to better quantify the uncertainty of time-and-space averaged CERES flux measurements using airborne measurements from the Arctic Radiation - IceBridge Sea Ice Experiment (ARISE). The ARISE campaign took place during September of 2014 based out of Fairbanks, Alaska, with most of the measurements taken in the vicinity of the sea ice edge between 125°W and 150°W, and 71°N to 77°N. For six of the flights, measurements were taken in a lawnmower type pattern over either 100 x 200 km box regions at a constant altitude of >6 km, or 100 x 100 km box regions at an altitude of between 200 m to 500 m. They were designed to resemble the CERES Level 3 spatial averaging grids, and were located and timed to coincide with a high number of CERES overpasses. On board the aircraft were a set of upward and downward facing shortwave and longwave broadband radiometers (BBR), along with other instruments measuring meteorological conditions and cloud properties. We have compared the broadband radiative fluxes from BBR with those from CERES for the three days where the aircraft was flying the high altitude pattern. We use the Fu-Liou radiative transfer model to account for differences in the measurement altitude between BBR and CERES. We will present results of the comparisons between the computed fluxes and the measured longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes.",

Here we present a combined analysis of InSAR derived strain maps and seismicity of the Afar triple junction from 2006 to 2010. Our analysis shows that that the plate spreading motion is accommodated in different modes. A dogbone-shaped seismicity and strain distribution dominates the northern Red Sea branch of the triple junction, likely as a result of repeated dike intrusions 2005-2010. East of the triple junction, in the Gulf of Aden branch the strain and seismicity distribution appears decoupled. The strain focuses across the central part of several overlapping rifts, while the seismicity mainly occurs at the rift tips. Conversely, the Main Ethiopian Rift branch shows a narrow and elongated zone of both high strain and seismicity. The pattern suggests that the recent history of magmatic intrusions in the northern branch and mainly tectonic extension in the other branches creates a diverse triple junction accommodation zone.",

However, while these systems make available a large amount of crop monitoring data to the agriculture and food security analysts, there is no global platform which provides agricultural production hotspot warning in a highly automatic and timely manner. Therefore a web based system providing timely warning evidence as maps and short narratives is currently under development by the Joint Research Centre. The system (called “HotSpot Detection System of Agriculture Production Anomalies”, HSDS) will focus on water limited agricultural systems worldwide. The automatic analysis of relevant meteorological and vegetation indicators at selected administrative units (Gaul 1 level) will trigger warning messages for the areas where anomalous conditions are observed. The level of warning (ranging from “watch” to “alert”) will depend on the nature and number of indicators for which an anomaly is detected. Information regarding the extent of the agricultural areas concerned by the anomaly and the progress of the agricultural season will complement the warning label. In addition, we are testing supplementary detailed information from other sources for the areas triggering a warning. These regard the automatic web-based and food security-tailored analysis of media (using the JRC Media Monitor semantic search engine) and the automatic detection of active crop area using Sentinel 1, upcoming Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery processed in Google Earth Engine. The basic processing will be fully automated and updated every 10 days exploiting low resolution rainfall estimates and satellite vegetation indices. Maps, trend graphs and statistics accompanied by short narratives edited by a team of crop monitoring experts, will be made available on the website on a monthly basis.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing hydrological extreme events and assessing their societal impacts is perpetual challenge for hydrologists. Climate models predict that anticipated temperature rise leads to an intensification of the hydrological cycle and to a corresponding increase in the reoccurrence and the severity of extreme events. The societal impact of the hydrological extremes are interlinked with anthropogenic activities therefore the damages to manmade infrastructures are rarely a good measure of the extreme events' magnitudes.\nExtreme events are rare by definition therefore detecting change in their distributions requires long-term observational records. Currently, only in-situ monitoring time series has the temporal extent necessary for assessing the reoccurrence probabilities of extreme events, but they frequently lack the spatial coverage.\nSatellite remote sensing is often advocated to provide the required spatial coverage, but satellites have to compromise between spatial and temporal resolutions. Furthermore, the retrieval algorithms are often as complex as comparable hydrological models with similar degree of uncertainties in their parameterization and the validity of the final data products.\nIn addition, anticipated changes over time in the reoccurrence frequencies of extreme events invalidates the stationarity assumption, which is the basis for using past observations to predict the probabilities future extreme events.\nProbably the best approach to provide more robust predictions of extreme events is the integration of the available data (in-situ and remote sensing) in a comprehensive data assimilation frameworks built on top of adequate hydrological modeling platforms.\nOur presentation will provide an overview of the current state of hydrological models to support data assimilations and the viable pathways to integrate in-situ and remote sensing observations for flood predictions. We will demonstrate the use of socio-economic data in combination with hydrological data assimilation to assess the resiliency to extreme flood events.",

            "abstract": "Latent heating by tropical weather systems produces vertical mass fluxes of high potential temperature that fill upper isentropic layers with mass. This produces an expanded isentropic layer in the tropical Upper troposphere – Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) of elevated potential energy. Because this elevated potential energy is converted to kinetic energy if it flows poleward, we call it JAPE (Jet Available Potential Energy). This conversion effectively prevents wholesale movement into the extratropics, an effect of inertial stability due to the Earth’s rotation. As a result, the JAPE takes the form of a potential energy bubble spanning heights between 10 km and 18 km and meridionally between 30N and 30S on average with occasional poleward plumes reaching up to 50 degrees latitude. The JAPE bubble is bounded on its poleward edge by the subtropical jet (STJ) and its upper surface by the elevated tropical tropopause.\nAs potential energy is continually fed into the bubble by tropical convective and tropical cyclone activity, the JAPE bubble builds mass and an increasing potential to surge that mass into the extratropics, leading to “JAPE surge” events. These events occur at weaknesses in the inertial wall of the bubble, usually related to interactions with a polar jet. These surges become energy conduits, infusing the JAPE (and reducing the bubble mass) into the extratropical Rossby wave stream via a STJ-PJ interaction. The poleward JAPE surge events are periodic and occur in 3-5 locations simultaneously around the globe, usually in the winter hemisphere.\nAt the oral presentation, a 36 year analysis of the behavior of the JAPE bubble will be presented, and its role in energizing the Rossby wave train will be discussed.",

In this presentation, we’ll use sets of climate model simulation that designed to identify the role of the oceanic feedback in increasing climate extremes under global warming. One is with a fully coupled climate model forced by 1% ramping CO2, and the other is with an atmosphere only model forced by the same CO2 forcing.

            "abstract": "Understanding the rupture processes of intermediate-depth earthquakes in active subduction zones and their dependence to inherited geophysical parameters, such as the maturity and orientation of pre-existing faults, is still of prime interest. Unfortunately, quantitative values describing the nucleation and propagation processes at depths are rare, and the earthquake source parameters determined from global databases or far-field measurements are often very heterogeneous, especially for the smallest and deepest earthquakes. In order to leveling this problem and discriminate specific characteristics of the intermediate-depth earthquakes in Chile (IDEQ-Chile), we conducted high precision measurements using local and regional waveforms data obtained from broadband and strong-motions stations of IPOC network in northern Chile. A strict and rigorous methodology was used to reduce the scattering of the source parameter estimation usually observed. With this high-quality database, we examined the source characteristics of a few hundreds of intra-slab intermediate depth-earthquakes, with depth varying from 40 km to 300 km. For the effective comparison of the source parameters, we studied with the same approach a hundred of interplate earthquakes located along the same latitude-dependent zone of the subducted slab. Based on static and cinematic considerations, we compared these source parameters with macroscopic geophysical parameters such as the stress regime, the coupling degree or the style of faulting, in order to show the possible correlations between them. Interestingly, we observed three major depth-dependent zones corresponding to three different sets of static and dynamic source parameters. We show that there are some evident differences between these distinct Chilean zones, although the apparent quasi-constant velocity and age of the subducted Nazca plate along Chile. We discuss how some of the various proposed sources mechanisms, explaining the earthquakes occurrence at depths, can be correlated with those parameters.",

Forestry reclamation approaches (FRA) for post-mining sites can significantly enhance C storage in minesoils and established species; however the mechanism that not widely assessed to predict changes in ecosystem functions. A chronosequence post-mining sites (2-years, 5-years, 9-years, 15-years and 21-years old reclaimed afforested minesoils at Raniganj Coalfield, India) were investigated to: (i) quantify the amount of soil C accumulating in developing ecosystem; (ii) examine several physiochemical properties and biological processes that govern the rate of C-sequestration; (iii) identify the relationships between C-sequestration and soil properties, and (iv) develop a soil quality index by principal component analysis (PCA). From changes in ecosystem C perspective, although soil organic carbon (Corg) was less in newly developed ecosystem in comparisons to older one (21-years). However, rate of soil C-accumulation was greater (2.6 Mg C ha-1yr-1) in newly formed minesoil ecosystem. The overall microbial indices, dehydrogenase activities (DHA-15.7 µg-1TPF g-1 24 hrs-1); microbial biomass carbon (MBC-368 mg C kg-1); and rates of soil CO2 flux (15 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1) were found highest in older minesoils in comparisons to younger minesoils. PCA showed that three PCs with eigenvalues > 1 explained 74.5% of the total variance in the soil properties. The first PC is mostly characterized by soil nutritional and biological properties; second PC by physical properties and showed a positive correlation with soil C-accumulation and changes in plant species diversity. The present study showed that changes in ecosystem C and nutrients are direct function of enhanced and established forest land use managements.",

            "abstract": "In addition to being an excellent venue for investigating the tectonics of the Andean margin, northern Chile is of particular interest to seismologists because of its potential for an imminent megathrust earthquake. Such events often trigger destructive seismic activity in the populated forearc, as demonstrated for example in the aftermath of the 2010 Maule event. To investigate the nature of deformation in the forearc, we generated high resolution images of the subsurface from Rayleigh wave dispersion curves derived from cross correlation of ambient noise. The ambient noise data were recorded over a period of three years by 60 stations from three different networks of broad band stations. Because of the proximity of the stations to the Pacific Ocean, we estimated the bias in the estimated Green’s functions caused by the asymmetry of the noise distribution using a technique based on that described by Yao and van der Hilst (2009). Our results suggest that this bias can be as large as 5% for some station pairs. The unbiased times are then used to refine phase velocity maps, from which we derived transit times to generate a 3D image of shear wavespeed (Vs) from the surface to about 50 km depth. To first order, low-Vs anomalies correlate well with the geometry of the Atacama Bench Structure (western foreland basin) where leaching processes are related to large incisions in the Atacama Desert (north of 19ºS). In addition, high Vs anomalies correlate with the locations of fossil magmatic arcs developed as trench-parallel belts from the coast to the Altiplano. For example, high Vs correlates with the Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatic arc along the coast, the Paleocene-Oligocene magmatic arc in the central depression, and the Eocene-Oligocene magmatic arc in the Frontal Cordillera. A continuous seismic anomaly of low-Vs, located between 15 - 25 km depth, may be evidence of a weak and/or hydrated zone within the lower continental crust, related to slab-linked upper plate hydration processes and partial melting at the base of the crust. Finally, well located crustal seismicity correlates with the western Andean thrust structure that controls the western uplift of the Altiplano.",

Located inside of the polar vortex, near the transantarctic mountain orographic wave hot spot, the oberved 3-10 h IGWs can be generated by either the instabilies in the jet streams or oragraphic sources or both. This study is to correlate the locations and intensities of the polar jet streams using the ECMWF data with those of the observed 3-10 h IGWs. Comparison will be made between simultaneous observations at McMurdo and Davis station. Comparison between waves observed inside (McMurdo) and outside of the polar vortex area (Lauder) will also be made.

Whether iron favours the liquid or solid phase of (Mg,Fe)O has important implications for the Earth’s mantle, both chemically and dynamically. As iron is much heavier than magnesium, the partitioning of iron between liquid and solid will lead to a contrast in densities. This difference in density will lead one phase to be more buoyant than the other and would help, in part, to explain how the mantle crystallised from the magma ocean of the Hadean eon to its current state. The partitioning of iron between the two phases is characterized by partition coefficients. Using ab-initio methods, thermodynamic integration and adiabatic switching these coefficients have been determined. Results are presented for pressures encompassing the region between the upper mantle and the core-mantle boundary (10-140GPa).",

            "abstract": "Convective motion in the cores of differentiated metal-silicate bodies may sustain a global dynamo magnetic field. Progressive crystallization in a dynamo-generating core is expected to play a central role in determining the observable properties of the hosted magnetic field. Importantly, the release of light elements and latent heat during core crystallization is a key source of entropy for sustaining core convection. Therefore, the persistence and intensity of a dynamo magnetic field depend directly on the extent and style of core crystallization.\nWe present and discuss paleomagnetic data from the Earth and asteroid-sized bodies to characterize internally generated magnetic fields during the early histories of these objects. In the case of the Earth, recent and ongoing paleomagnetic experiments of zircons from the Jack Hills of Australia can potentially constrain the existence and intensity of the geodynamo before 3.5 Ga. If robust, such measurements hold strong implications for the energy budget of the Earth’s early core and the dynamics of the early mantle. We will discuss both recently published and preliminary results and assess carefully the challenges and uncertainties of paleomagnetic experimentation on ancient zircon samples.\nIn the case of small bodies, several classes of meteorites record ancient magnetic fields likely produced by core dynamos on their parent bodies. Data from the CV carbonaceous chondrites and pallasites indicate that dynamos in planetesimal-sized bodies persisted for a broad range of timescales between ~10 My and >100 My. Meanwhile, measurements of the angrite group of achondrites show that their earliest-forming members crystallized in an almost non-magnetic environment, suggesting a delayed onset of the planetesimal dynamo until several My after initial differentiation. We will discuss the possible causes for this observed diversity of small body dynamo properties, including the role of core crystallization and the distribution of short-lived radioisotopes.",

We utilize this feature and samples from a PDF-based moist turbulence parameterization to produce a version of CAM where all convection (shallow, stratiform, and deep) is simulated with a single set of dynamic and microphysical equations. We call this version of the model CAM-CLUBB-SILHS, where CLUBB (Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals) is our higher-order closure convection and turbulence parameterization and SILHS (Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler) is our sampler and the basis for our subcolumn generation.\nEach physics timestep in this model, the CLUBB parameterization runs to calculate convective tendencies. In order to close the higher order moments, CLUBB calculates a new multi-variate PDF describing the subgrid distribution of moisture and temperature at each level. SILHS samples from that PDF and creates profiles of vapor, temperature, vertical velocity, cloud water and ice, and cloud water and ice number concentration. The microphysics scheme runs on each subcolumn seperately. The resulting tendencies are averaged together and returned to the model as a grid mean tendency. This use of subcolumns allows us to explicitly represent subgrid scale clouds and moisture distributions for microphysical calculations. Using this framework and no other convective parameterizations, we are able to produce stable, realistic, global atmospheric simulations in CAM. This study will present results from long-term atmospheric simulations, discuss the impact of subcolumns on the model, and show improvements in the model's tropical wave simulation.",

However, in addition to potential impacts of climate change and population growth that may compromise water supply and demand on small islands, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) often lack hydrogeological data for characterizing aquifers and have limited institutional means for managing the groundwater resource. As part of UNESCO-IHP’s Transboundary Water Assessment Programme (TWAP), an assessment of groundwater systems on 43 SIDS was undertaken. This SIDS assessment represents the first baseline global assessment of the status of groundwater in SIDS, covering all major island states of the world with an area less than 50,000 km2. As many SIDS comprise multiple islands with different hydrogeologic settings, a representative island from each SIDS was chosen to represent the majority of the population. Data were compiled from publications, accessible datasets and a questionnaire distributed to collect local expertise. A total of 74 variables were defined for each SIDS, according to the level of confidence in the data (i.e. high confidence when based on specific studies and low confidence when inferred). These variables represent the current hydrogeologic conditions for each island and were used to define indicators that characterise vulnerability. Recharge was modelled for both current and future projected climate change for the 2060s using regionally downscaled data for each SIDS to identify islands likely to experience significant stress due to changes in recharge. The assessment results were categorized based on island type to identify trends in hydrogeologic conditions and vulnerability for similar island types. Despite limitations and uncertainty in the data used in the assessment, the results provide a broad assessment of current and future groundwater resource vulnerability for SIDS throughout the world.",

A key aspect of dam safety is anticipating extreme precipitation, runoff and the associated inflow of water to the reservoir within a probabilistic framework for risk analyses. The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) has partnered with Reclamation to improve understanding and estimation of precipitation in the western United States, including the Taylor Park watershed. A significant challenge is that Taylor Park Dam is located in a relatively data-sparse region, surrounded by mountains exceeding 12,000 feet. To better estimate heavy precipitation events in this basin, a high-resolution modeling approach is used. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is employed to simulate events that have produced observed peaks in streamflow at the location of interest. Importantly, an ensemble of model simulations are run on each event so that uncertainty bounds (i.e., forecast error) may be provided such that the model outputs may be more effectively used in Reclamation’s risk assessment framework. Model estimates of precipitation (and the uncertainty thereof) are then used in rainfall runoff models to determine the probability of inflows to the reservoir for use in Reclamation’s dam safety risk analyses.",

This surely limits the frequency that new theory is rigorously tested against data by scientists outside the group that developed it, and limits the impact that new tools could have on the advancement of science. Reducing the barriers to adoption through online education and open-source code can bridge the gap between theory and data, forging new collaborations, and advancing science.\nA pilot venture aimed at increasing the adoption of a new theory of time-variable transit time distributions was begun in July 2015 as a collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI). There were four main components to the venture: a public online seminar covering the theory, an open source code repository, a virtual short course designed to help participants apply the theory to their data, and an online forum to maintain discussion and build a community of users. 18 participants were selected for the non-public components based on their responses in an application, and were asked to fill out a course evaluation at the end of the short course, and again several months later. These evaluations, along with participation in the forum and on-going contact with the organizer suggest strengths and weaknesses in this combination of components to assist participants in adopting new tools.",

Luckily, fuzzy logic provides a method to work with different types of data using language-based propositions such as “the landscape is undisturbed,” and a simple set of logic constructs. Just as many surveys allow different levels of agreement with a proposition, fuzzy logic allows values reflecting different levels of truth for a proposition. Truth levels fall within a continuum ranging from Fully True to Fully False. Hence a fuzzy logic model produces continuous results.\nThe Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS) is a platform-independent, tree-based, fuzzy logic modeling framework. An EEMS model provides a transparent definition of an evaluation model and is commonly developed as a collaborative effort among managers, scientists, and GIS experts. Managers specify a set of evaluative propositions used to characterize the landscape. Scientists, working with managers, formulate functions that convert raw data values into truth values for the propositions and produce a logic tree to combine results into a single metric used to guide decisions. Managers, scientists, and GIS experts then work together to implement and iteratively tune the logic model and produce final results.\nWe present examples of two successful EEMS projects that provided managers with map-based results suitable for guiding decisions: sensitivity and climate change exposure in Utah and the Colorado Plateau modeled for the Bureau of Land Management; and terrestrial ecological intactness in the Mojave and Sonoran region of southern California modeled for the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan.",

            "abstract": "Plant phenology in arid and semi-arid ecoregions is constrained by water availability and governs the life history characteristics of primary and secondary consumers. We related the behavior, demography, and distribution of mammalian herbivores and their principal predator to remotely sensed vegetation and climatological indices across the western United States for the period 2000-2014. Across scales, terrain and topographic position moderates the effects of climatological drought on primary productivity, resulting in differential susceptibility among plant functional types to water stress. At broad scales, herbivores tie parturition to moist sites during the period of maximum increase in local forage production. Consequently, juvenile mortality is highest in regions of extreme phenological variability. Although decoupled from primary production by one or more trophic levels, carnivore home range size and density is negatively correlated to plant productivity and growing season length. At the finest scales, predation influences the behavior of herbivore prey through compromised habitat selection, in which maternal females trade nutritional benefits of high plant biomass for reduced mortality risk associated with increased visibility. Climate projections for the western United States predict warming combined with shifts in the timing and form of precipitation. Our analyses suggest that these changes will propagate through trophic levels as increased phenological variability and shifts in plant distributions, larger consumer home ranges, altered migration behavior, and generally higher volatility in wildlife populations. Combined with expansion and intensification of human land use across the region, these changes will likely have economic implications stemming from increased human-wildlife conflict (e.g., crop damage, vehicle collisions) and changes in wildlife-related tourism.",

            "abstract": "Regional seismic tomography studies in the Pacific ocean and continental western U.S show linear bands of low velocity anomalies that are aligned with absolute plate motion and coincident with volcanic lineaments located within the interior of plates far from plate boundaries. Small-scale convection provides one possible explanation for these lineations but does not predict age progressive seafloor volcanism that opposes plate motion. We propose a new hypothesis where viscous fingering instabilities form due to hot and wet mantle plumes which rise and discharge into the upper mantle asthenosphere and displace higher viscosity depleted mantle. We perform laboratory fluid experiments scaled to the Earth's mantle, with stationary and moving surface plates that use fluids with viscosities (μ) from 1 to 300 Pas and viscosity ratios (μ1/μ2) from 3 to 400. Viscous fingers are observed to form for all viscosity ratios we consider and after an initial growth period, exhibit a constant wavelength that depends on several parameters. Fingering wavelength is strongly dependent on plate spacing (and therefore asthenospheric layer thickness) but shows weak or no dependence on viscosity ratio and injection rate. The radius, Ro, at which fingers first form varies inversely with increasing viscosity ratio. This indicates that low viscosity mantle may flow long distances before fingers develop if viscosity ratios are small. For mobile plates, a ratio Γ of plume flux to plate velocity is defined where Γ is varied from 3.6x10-4 to 3.6x105 which considers the range expected in the Earth (6.3x10-3 to 1.5x10-2). Results indicate that fingers align with plate motion both upstream and downstream, with longer wavelengths in the downstream direction. Particle imaging successfully resolves particle motion vectors and also indicates the presence of a thin film layer above and below each finger. This new geodynamic model for viscous fingering in the asthenosphere links off-axis and rising mantle plumes indirectly to the spreading centers where they contribute to melting, surface volcanism and the growth and formation of new lithosphere.",

However, studies focusing on assessing how land data assimilation (DA) contributes to seasonal forecast skills are still lacking due to the limited number of large-scale land DA studies. In this study, taking advantage of the snow outputs from a multivariate global land DA system (i.e., DART/CLM), we systematically investigated the role of large-scale snow DA in influencing seasonal forecasts of surface air temperature. Three suites of ensemble seasonal forecast experiments were performed using the Community Earth System Model (CESM v1.2.1), in which three different snow initialization datasets were used. They are (1) CLM4 simulation without DA, (2) CLM4 simulation with MODIS snow cover DA, and (3) CLM4 simulation with joint GRACE and MODIS snow DA. Each suite of the experiment starts from multiple initialization dates of eight years from 2003 to 2010 and has three-month lead times. All experiments used the same atmosphere initializations from ERA-Interim (perturbed to get 8 ensembles) and the same prescribed SSTs. Our results show that snow DA plays an important role in surface air temperature predictions in regions such as Europe, western Canada, northern Alaska, Mongolia Plateau, Tibetan Plateau, and the Rocky Mountains. The analyses also account for multiple lead times as snow can influence the atmosphere through immediate snow-albedo effect and through delayed snow hydrological effect after snow melts and wets the soil. This is a first study to quantify the impacts of snow initializations on seasonal forecasts of surface air temperature with an emphasis on large-scale snow DA. The insights are helpful to both land DA studies as well as research on seasonal climate forecasts.",

Many of these reservoirs are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) according to water control manuals that specify elevations for an upper volume of reservoir storage that must be kept available for capturing storm runoff and reducing flood risk, and a lower volume of storage that may be used for water supply. During extreme rainfall events, runoff is captured by these reservoirs and released as quickly as possible to create flood storage space for another potential storm. These flood control manuals are based on typical historical weather patterns - wet during the winter, dry otherwise - but are not informed directly by weather prediction. Alternative reservoir management approaches such as Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO), which seek to incorporate advances in weather prediction, are currently being explored as means to improve water supply availability while maintaining flood risk reduction and providing additional ecosystem benefits.\nWe present results from a FIRO proof-of-concept study investigating the reliability of post-processed GEFS ensemble forecasts to predict the probability that day 6-to-10 precipitation accumulations in certain areas in California exceed a high threshold. Our results suggest that reliable forecast guidance can be provided, and the resulting probabilities could be used to inform decisions to release or hold water in the reservoirs. We illustrate the potential of these forecasts in a case study of extreme event probabilities for the Russian River Basin in California.",

Students have difficulty envisioning themselves as scientists, or in understanding the role of science in their lives as a result. Not all students can envision themselves as scientists when first enrolling in college. While student recruitment into geoscience programs starts before college enrollment at many universities, general education science requirements can act as a gateway into these majors as well. By providing students in general education science classes with more accurate insights into the scientific process and what it means to be a scientist, these classes can help students envision themselves as scientists.\nA short module, to be embedded within lectures, has been developed to improve recruitment from Clarion University's Introductory Earth Science classes entitled “What's A Geoscientist Do?”. As this module aims to help students visualize themselves as geoscientists through examples, diversity of the examples is critical to recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Images and subjects within these modules are carefully selected to emphasize the fact that the geosciences are not, and should not be, the exclusive province of the stereotypical older, white, male scientist. Noteworthy individuals (e.g. John Wesley Powell, Roger Arliner Young) may be highlighted, or the discussion may focus on a particular career path (e.g. hydrologist) relevant to that day's material. While some students are initially attracted to the geosciences due to a love of the outdoors, many students have never spent a night outdoors, and do not find this aspect of the geosciences particularly appealing. “What's A Geoscientist Do?” has been designed to expose these students to the breadth of the field, including a number of geoscience jobs focused on laboratory (e.g. geochemistry) or computer (e.g. GIS, remote sensing, scientific illustration) work instead of focusing exclusively on fieldwork. As Clarion University students tend to be very job-oriented, information on careers includes average starting salaries with the hope of improving student's opinions of the position as possible future employment – helping students (and their families) realize they can support themselves in a geoscience career.",

We briefly review the use of Cox in understanding C sink estimates, and its role in understanding the coupled nature of carbon and oxygen cycles, which derives from its relationship with ecosystem oxidative ratio (OR). The Cox of a carbon pool provides an integrated measure of all processes that create and destroy organic matter (e.g. photosynthesis, respiration, fire) and therefore, can be used to estimate the oxidative ratio (O2/CO2) of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Our preliminary data suggest that the OR of temperate hardwood forest and grassland ecosystems are influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentration. The variation in ecosystem Cox with atmospheric CO2 concentration suggest that OR is not a conservative property of terrestrial ecosystems on annual or decadal timescales. In the grassland ecosystem, the Cox of plant biomass increased by as much as 50% across a CO2 concentration gradient of 190 ppm, but the response was highly dependent upon soil properties. In the temperate forest, the Cox of the soil C pool increased by 40% after 9 seasons of CO2 enrichment (by 175 ppm). We will discuss our interpretation of Cox as a proxy and its potential use in studies of coupled O2 and CO2 cycling.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slow slip events (SSE) have been observed in many subduction zones such as southwest Japan and Cascadia. Despite their relatively well-observed nature, the physical mechanism that underlies slow slip and tremor remains unknown. Tremor has been thought either to be loaded directly by aseismic slip, or to represent the different manifestations of the same physical process as slow slip, or be modulated by the stressing and aseismic slip rate. In Cascadia, slow slip without tremor was observed only recently [Welch and Bartlow, 2014], suggesting a more complex relationship between episodic slip and tremor. We use the combined daily position time series from a NASA MEaSUREs project and a time-dependent Kalman filter to examine the spatiotemporal relationship between slow slip and tremor in Cascadia. The combined GPS position solutions are based on JPL and SIO independent solutions, using the GIPSY and GAMIT software, respectively, but with a consistent set of a priori epoch-date coordinates and metadata. We remove the outliers and common mode errors from the time series. We visually identify all transient slip events and fit the time series with a model that consists of inter-SSE velocity, offsets, annual and semi-annual variation, and slow slip transients. A grid-search is applied to estimate optimal duration and center time during the transient fit. The cleaned filtered time series with the inter-SSE velocity removed are then used in the slip inversion. Our application to some recent SSEs shows a spectrum of different slip and tremor behaviors. For example, despite good space-time correlation between high fault slip rate and tremor locations, we see the instances where the tremors locate at the downdip slip edge or slip front, suggesting possible stressing from the slip transient. We find that during the 2014 ETS event a period of high fault slip rate and tremor is followed by a short period of tremorless slip, indicating tremorless slip in Cascadia is more common than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The TOMS V9 total ozone algorithm will be applied to the OMPS Nadir Mapper instrument to supersede the exisiting V8.6 data product in operational processing and re-processing for public release. Becuase the quality of the V8.6 data is already quite high, enchancements in V9 are mainly with information provided by the retrieval and simplifcations to the algorithm. The design of the V9 algorithm has been influenced by improvements both in our knowledge of atmospheric effects, such as those of clouds made possible by studies with OMI, and also limitations in the V8 algorithms applied to both OMI and OMPS. But the namesake instruments of the TOMS algorithm are substantially more limited in their spectral and noise characterisitics, and a requirement of our algorithm is to also apply the algorithm to these discrete band spectrometers which date back to 1978. To achieve continuity for all these instruments, the TOMS V9 algorithm continues to use radiances in discrete bands, but now uses Rodgers optimal estimation to retrieve a coarse profile and provide uncertainties for each retrieval. The algorithm remains capable of achieving high accuracy results with a small number of discrete wavelengths, and in extreme cases, such as unusual profile shapes and high solar zenith angles, the quality of the retrievals is improved. Despite the intended design to use limited wavlenegths, the algorithm can also utilitze additional wavelengths from hyperspectral sensors like OMPS to augment the retreival's error detection and information content; for example SO2 detection and correction of Ring effect on atmospheric radiances. We discuss these and other aspects of the V9 algorithm as it will be applied to OMPS, and will mention potential improvements which aim to take advantage of a synergy with OMPS Limb Profiler and Nadir Mapper to further improve the quality of total ozone from the OMPS instrument.",

            "abstract": "Subduction surface in South America and the Caribbean represent a complex process of driving and resisting forces as part of region geodynamics, where dynamics is promoted from ridge push through potential energy toward trenches (Faccena, 2014). Energy produced is associated with the main source for building of mountain ranges, volcanic expressions and large earthquakes on the past few centuries, as detailed several authors although previous rupture descriptions and historical explanations of several of these events occurred before of 1900s related to subduction processes (Bilek, 2009; Stein and Wysession, 2013).\nDetermination of along-strike dip and along-dip variations have been a relevant target through different analysis for correlating them with orientation of tension axis, seismicity rate, volcanism, depth of seismicity, magnitude earthquakes, thermal structure, etc. (Gutcher et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001; Bilek, 2009; Shellart & Rawlinson, 2013). Records of GPS measurements and Seismotectonic Deformation (STD) estimations show that movement of the slivers parallel to the subduction trench are controlled by the angle of convergence and are associated with the features of the Andes Range and seismic/aseismic zones (Holt et al., 1991; Corredor, 2003; Teza et al., 2008; Vergolle et al., 2010; Nocquet et al., 2014), also previous works which have used empirical approaches between magnitude and frequency of seismicity based on the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law (Gutenberg & Richter, 1944).\nNowadays and based on a larger seismic hazard due to overpopulated cities along this geotectonic feature, it is necessary to identify better subduction zone segments potentiality dominated by relatively long recurrence times and related to giant earthquakes (Müller and Landgrebe, 2012). In this work, we will present the main results obtained from an analysis done along Caribbean and South American margin plates, in order to improve the knowledge of seismic sources along subduction zones. We will support this segmentation on subduction angles, tectonic moment rates from GPS measurements, Seismic Moment Rates and mapping of the b-values.",

            "abstract": "It is challenging for many to get a sense of what climate change means as long periods of time are involved – like decades – which can be difficult to grasp. However, there are a number of citizen science based projects, including NEON’s Project BudBurst, that provide the opportunity for both learning about climate change and advancing scientific knowledge. In this presentation, we will share lessons learned from Project BudBurst.\nProject BudBurst is a national citizen science initiative designed to engage the public in observations of phenological (plant life cycle) events and to increase climate literacy. Project BudBurst is important from an educational perspective, but also because it enables scientists to broaden the geographic and temporal scale of their observations. The goals of Project BudBurst are to 1) increase awareness of phenology as an area of scientific study; 2) Increase awareness of the impacts of changing climates on plants at a continental-scale; and 3) increase science literacy by engaging participants in the scientific process. It was important to better understand if and how Project BudBurst is meeting its goals. Specifically, does participation by non-experts advance scientific knowledge? Does participation advance educational goals and outcomes? Is participation an effective approach to advance/enhance science education in both formal and informal settings?\nCritical examination of Project BudBurst supports advancement of scientific knowledge and realization of educational objectives. Citizen science collected observations and measurements are being used by scientists as evidenced by the increase of such data in scientific publication. In addition, we found that there is a significant increase in educators utilizing citizen science as part of their instruction. Part of this increase is due to the resources and professional development materials available to educators. Working with partners also demonstrated that the needs of both science and education are being met. Project BudBurst, partners with the PhenoCam Network, National Geographic Society, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service botanic gardens, science centers and other organizations with both a scientific and educational mission.",

A common procedure to estimate the undisturbed in-situ temperature in a borehole is to use the ‘build-up’ method, based on the measured values and their measured time after circulation of drill fluid, to estimate the equilibrium temperature.

            "abstract": "The early Pliocene (5.3-2.6 Ma) is the most recent time in Earth history when CO2 levels were similar to today, yet model outputs show average global atmospheric temperatures were 3-4˚C warmer. Given the similar climate boundary conditions in the Pliocene and today (CO2, continental positions, ocean circulation), the Pliocene is the best analogue for future climate in the paleo-record. Proxy studies reveal Pliocene sea surface temperatures (SST) along the California margin were 3-9˚C warmer than today. The modern California margin is highly productive, driven by strong seasonal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water. If the thermocline and nutricline were coupled during the Pliocene as they are today, warmer SSTs would imply lower nutrient concentrations and reduced productivity. Yet previously published oceanic records do not show a clear relationship between SST and productivity.\nAlkenone mass accumulation rates (MAR), organic carbon, and biogenic silica show sustained levels of productivity in the Pliocene even as SST was cooling at ODP Site 1022 (40.0˚N, 125.5˚W, depth 1925 m). However, smear slide analysis suggests that diatom MAR decreased during the Pliocene. Because diatoms are the dominant silica-based primary producer, diatom MAR and biogenic silica analyses should display similar variations. The apparent difference between the two proxy records may be due to preservational effects, such as silica dissolution in the sedimentary pore waters and fragmentation of diatom frustules, resulting in reduced diatom MARs, whereas the fragments and non-diatom siliceous producers all contribute to the biogenic silica values.\nWe present smear slide and biogenic silica analyses as records of diatom productivity at the more southerly ODP Site 1016 (34.0˚N, 122.0˚W, depth 3835 m), and compare it to existing data from ODP Site 1022. In the modern ocean, diatoms dominate California margin phytoplankton under high nutrient upwelling conditions; thus changes in the relative abundance of diatoms should reflect changes in nutrient supply. In order to have confidence in our proxy records we must have a good understanding of the relationship between diatom abundances and biogenic silica values. This combined ODP Sites 1016 and 1022 study will also evaluate other site-specific differences in diatom preservation.",

Indicators provide information tailored to identified stakeholders and facilitate monitoring status, trends, extremes and variability of important climate features or processes. NOAA's Climate Monitoring program is in the middle of a three-year initiative toward supporting research toward the development of Ocean Climate Indicators for research, prediction, and decision makers. These indices combine ocean observations, climate data and products from platforms like (but not limited to) the drifting buoy, Argo, satellite, and buoy arrays that provide fundamental observations that contribute towards climate understanding, predictions, and projections. The program is supporting eight distinct projects that focus on primarily regional indices that target varied stakeholders and outreach strategies – from public awareness and education to targeted model performance improvement. This presentation will discuss the diverse set of projects, initial results, and discuss possibilities for and examples of using the indicators and processes for developing them for broader science outreach and education, with an eye toward the aim of organizing the ocean climate and observing community around developing a comprehensive ocean monitoring and indicators system.",

            "abstract": "The climate system exhibits low-frequency variability in characteristic spatial structures, but the mechanisms for this variability have remained unclear partly due to observational limitations and partly due to difficulties in analyzing simulations from nonlinear, chaotic models. In addition, recent studies have questioned the necessity of ocean circulations to generate such low-frequency variability. Our research is intended to clarify mechanisms of low-frequency climate variability that can occur purely from atmospheric dynamics coupled to an ocean mixed-layer model. For this purpose, we have built a new stochastic model based on the linearized primitive equations for the atmosphere, a slab mixed-layer model for the ocean, a gray radiation scheme for radiative effects, and a diffusive scheme for vertical turbulent eddy fluxes. Temperature is randomly excited in midlatitudes, and all variables except surface pressure are damped artificially with a 1-day time scale. The atmospheric model alone is shown to produce realistic seasonal mean eddy variances and fluxes in midlatitudes, despite the absence of moisture, clouds, moist convection, topography, and zonal asymmetries in the back- ground state. Because the atmospheric eddy statistics are realistic, it is argued that coupling these eddies to a mixed-layer model will produce more realistic low-frequency variability than the traditional Hasselmann model in which the atmospheric stochastic forcing is imposed by fiat. We have shown that such coupling does indeed generate peaks in the low-frequency power spectrum that otherwise would not occur in the absence of coupling. Now, we are trying to comprehensively analyze the mechanism for these low-frequency peaks, exploiting the fact that the model is purely linear. We further aim to analyze simulations from a comprehensive nonlinear aquaplanet GCM. The results from nonlinear simulations will serve as a baseline for theoretical statistical studies in low frequency variability.",

            "abstract": "Radar interferometry has been successfully applied to measure ground deformation for over two decades. However, until now the data have been acquired on an ad-hoc basis. The recently-launched Sentinel-1 mission is the first to acquire global data systematically. Moreover, the default mode of radar acquisition for Sentinel-1 is the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS). In this new acquisition mode the steering of the radar antenna in the along-track direction induces that certain areas of the image are illuminated more than once and any surface deformation projects with a different line-of-sight unit vector across the scene. The consequence is that the scanning feature of Sentinel-1 TOPS mode make interpretation and analysis of differential interferograms more complex to process and interpret than the traditionally use of radar interferometry. However, at the same time, it also presents a number of opportunities such as redundant data, and increased sensitivity to along track displacement. Here, we present in detail the basic processing steps which differ from the traditional stripmap mode interferometry, and we illustrate some of the special features with actual results of significant deformation events: the 2014-2015 eruption of Pico do Fogo volcano and The 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake. Here, we show that the new Sentinel-1 TOPS-mode interferometry can be used to estimate relevant geophysical parameters, and most applications should not be affected by the new mode. The planned 20 year Sentinel-1 mission, provides access to a wealth of open and free high-quality radar data that should greatly improve our understanding of deformation phenomena in the future.",

            "abstract": "The western United States is an important source of domestic energy resources. One of the primary environmental impacts associated with oil and natural gas production is related to air emission releases of a number of air pollutants. Some of these pollutants are important precursors to the formation of ground-level ozone. To better understand ozone impacts and other air quality issues, photochemical air quality models are used to simulate the changes in pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere on local, regional, and national spatial scales. These models are important for air quality management because they assist in identifying source contributions to air quality problems and designing effective strategies to reduce harmful air pollutants. The success of predicting oil and natural gas air quality impacts depends on the accuracy of the input information, including emissions inventories, meteorological information, and boundary conditions. The treatment of chemical and physical processes within these models is equally important. However, given the limited amount of data collected for oil and natural gas production emissions in the past and the complex terrain and meteorological conditions in western states, the ability of these models to accurately predict pollution concentrations from these sources is uncertain. Therefore, this presentation will focus on understanding the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model’s ability to predict air quality impacts associated with oil and natural gas production and its sensitivity to input uncertainties. The results will focus on winter ozone issues in the Uinta Basin, Utah and identify the factors contributing to model performance issues. The results of this study will help support future air quality model development, policy and regulatory decisions for the oil and gas sector.",

Predicting their future behaviour requires understanding their dynamics and state of balance, and geodetic techniques have provided information on these properties, on various time scales. Here, we give an overview of the major contributions of geodetic techniques to ice-sheet research over the past several decades. Early leveling measurements made in the 1960’s provided estimates of ice velocity (from the horizontal component) and height (from the vertical component) in a few regions, and this coverage has expanded since the 1980s through more routine GPS surveys. Time series of velocity changes inform about the local dynamics of an ice-sheet region, and time series of height measurements inform about both the mass balance and glacial isostatic rebound. Since the early 1990s, increased coverage of height measurements is obtained using satellite-derived height estimates from radar and laser altimetry, and for velocity measurements from SAR. Gravity measurements from GRACE since 2002 have provided independent way of monitoring ice sheet mass. Together these various techniques have transformed our understanding of the ice sheets and taught us about variability on short and long time scales, which is allowing us to identify the processes driving these changes.",

            "abstract": "Ecologically and hydrologically functioning montane meadows provide a variety of ecosystem services and create biological hotspots in high-elevation landscapes. They serve as wetlands that filter water, attenuate floods, sequester carbon, sustain downstream flows, and provide high productivity habitat in typically lower productivity mountain regions. Their importance to watershed quality and health is well recognized, and restoration of meadows is a high priority for resource management agencies and non-governmental organizations. Yet many meadow restoration projects have limited outcomes or fail to achieve the desired effects due to a lack of understanding the underlying hydrological and geomorphic processes inherent to meadows that contribute to their resiliency. Few studies exist on how meadows are sustained through time despite various land use impacts or how the origin of water supplying the meadow (snowmelt-dominated versus regional groundwater-dominated) may influence meadow conditions. Furthermore, as climate conditions continue to change, questions remain regarding which meadows will be most resistant to and resilient from climate warming and thus have the highest potential for successful and sustainable restoration of meadow processes. We discuss these concepts and present two methods for assessing the regional and local contributions of source water to meadows as an indicator of resiliency. On a broad scale, comparisons of satellite imagery using metrics such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for regions with meadows may be useful to detect inter-annual and seasonal variations in meadow wetness and thus indicate meadow sites with larger groundwater sources that are more resilient over time. Locally, use of a hydrogeomorphic typing key that relates water source, geomorphic position, groundwater table elevation, and plant species composition may be useful to detect local groundwater sources that provide greater consistency of conditions and resiliency through time than snowmelt-dominated surface water sources. Either or both methods may be useful to resource agencies looking to prioritize limited restoration dollars for meadows with the highest potential to remain resilient over time.",

Particle experiments of the Van Allen Probes missions observed multiple energetic particle injection signatures inside the geosynchronous orbit, which resemble particle injections in the magnetotail. It is not evident, however, whether these events are attributed to the magnetic field dipolarizations considering how strong the background magnetic field is. Similar signatures could be attributed to the boundary crossings, i.e., when the spacecraft are crossing from the inner magnetosphere into the plasma sheet. To investigate the nature of the injection-like events observed by Van Allen Probes in the inner magnetosphere we first identify them with the use of the energetic particle measurements from the RBSPICE experiment. We then explore their relationship to the magnetic field dipolarizations and boundary crossings by examining the magnetic field data from the EMFISIS instrument.",

            "abstract": "Slow slip events (SSEs) have been observed in GPS time series for many subduction zones worldwide, but they have not been documented in the decade-long time series from the Sumatran GPS Array (SuGAr) for the Sumatran subduction zone. An outstanding question has been whether the Sunda megathrust has simply not exhibited this behavior, or whether the signals have been obscured by the prodigious number of earthquakes (and their ensuing postseismic deformation) that have occurred within the time of geodetic observation. In this study, we remove all known tectonic signals from the SuGAr time series to search for evidence of SSEs. We find the residual position time series to be essentially flat at the centimeter scale. To search for signals at the millimeter scale we tested various filtering and visualization techniques. Despite these efforts, we conclude that it is difficult to confirm that SSEs exist at this scale using the current data, although we do see a few suspicious signals. For example, in the recent data since 2012, we find some signals that coincidently appeared at two nearby stations KTET and SMGY, which sit on Sipora and North Pagai islands, respectively, in the Mentawai seismic gap. These anomalous signals might suggest an SSE in the Mentawai seismic gap; however, we cannot confirm this hypothesis based on only two stations. The lack of evidence for SSEs could be the result of them occurring at a magnitude, location, or time scale that is undetectable with the current resolution of the SuGAr. Alternatively, the lack of observed events within those bounds could reflect this being a very active period in the earthquake cycle, or that the mechanical properties of this megathrust are not conducive to such events.",

            "abstract": "Investigations of land-atmosphere coupling have shown that surface conditions influence local boundary layer development and precipitation likelihood from sub-daily to seasonal time scales. With recent severe droughts and predictions of increased drought risk in the Central US, understanding how local land management practices may exacerbate or mitigate drying conditions has become especially important. Long-term, high-frequency observations from three eddy covariance towers on prairie sites with differing management practices and burn regimes provide a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of grassland management and woody encroachment on local land-atmosphere coupling strength. Observations from 2008 through 2014 are used to calculate time series of a detailed metric of land-atmosphere coupling strength, while self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to identify a comprehensive range of significant meteorological states. SOM classifications of meteorological variables are used in order to identify the sensitivity of coupling strength to environmental states more complex than conventional binary soil moisture classification and to determine if coupling metrics are able to capture this sensitivity. Periods of heavily gap-filled data stood out in a unique SOM class with unusual coupling characteristics, raising concern over how the technique used to gap fill observations can influence coupling estimates and related research. Wavelet analysis and spectra are used to determine the contribution of specific timescales to coupling under different characteristic environmental states. SOM and temporal analysis approaches of this study offer insight on the response of land-atmosphere interactions to variables beyond soil moisture status and improve understanding of how historical changes in land use and the transformation of most grasslands in the Central Great Plains has altered regional drought resilience through modified coupling characteristics.",

However, the uncertainty around the estimations of methane emissions from NG systems can lead to underestimation of climate and environmental impacts of using NG as a replacement for coal. Accurate estimates of methane emissions from NG operations is crucial for evaluation of environmental impacts of NG extraction and at larger scale, adoption of NG as transitional fuel. However there is a great inconsistency within the current estimates.\nForward simulation of methane from oil and gas operation sites for the US is carried out based on NEI-2011 using the WRF-Chem model. Simulated values are compared against measurements of observations from different platforms such as airborne (FRAPPÉ field campaign) and ground-based measurements (NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory). A novel inverse modeling technique is used in this work to improve the model fit to the observation values and to constrain methane emission from oil and gas extraction sites.",

Ionic strength and suspended solids play key roles in the ammonia volatilization process. These two parameters, however, are usually lumped together in form of totalsolids. The objective of this study was to separate the contribution of suspended solids (SS) from that of ionic strength (IS) on ammonia volatilization in liquid dairy manure. A two-way factorial experiment was conducted to simultaneously test the effects of IS and SS on ammonium dissociation: a key element of the ammonia volatilization process. The fraction of ammonia (β) in total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) was experimentally determined in a convective emission chamber, for each level of SS and IS, at a constant wind speed of 1.5 m s-1, and air and liquid temperature of 25°C. The two way analysis of variance showed a significant effect of SS concentration (p = 0.04) on fraction of ammonia in the liquid dairy manure, while the effect of ionic strength was marginal (p = 0.05). The highest dissociation of ammonium was observed in manure with the lowest SS concentration (0%) and the lowest ionic strength (0.10 mol L-1). Significant increases in suspended solids concentration and ionic strength were necessary to influence the ammonium dissociation in dairy manure. Results revealed that substantially high content of suspended solids (> 3.0%) or relatively high dilution of manure with water (30%) were necessary for these two parameters to play significant rolesin the ammonia volatilization mechanism in liquid dairy manure. Results also showed that the β was more sensitive to the changes in suspended solids concentration than in the changes in ionic strength within the ranges of SS and IS examined in this study.Overall, the SS and IS effects on ammonium dissociation (and by extension on ammonia volatilization process) were thus found negligible within the normal ranges of liquid dairy manure characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the flow, transport, and reaction in fractures and the evolution of fracture geometries as a result of geochemical reactions is especially relevant to geologic carbon storage. Both natural and injection-induced fractures may be abundant and thus control fluid migration in the subsurface. A second effect is that the development of low pH fluid as the CO2 dissolves into the native brine can alter fracture geometries and thus dominant flow pathways substantially over relatively short time scales, particularly when rapidly-reacting carbonate minerals are present. Existing experimental studies performed under conditions relevant to geologic carbon storage have shown complex dissolution patterns, which depend on the flow regimes and spatial distributions of reactive minerals. One of the dissolution patterns observed is the formation of a porous altered layer in the near-fracture region that is created by preferential dissolution of a reactive phase (e.g. calcite) dispersed in the rock matrix. However, there is still a lack of predictive understanding of this phenomenon and an even more limited ability to predict how the altered layer may influence subsequent evolution of the fracture. In this study, we present a reactive transport model that captures and predicts the development of the altered layer when the fracture surfaces are exposed to CO2-acidified brine. The model explicitly accounts for permeability heterogeneity caused by initial fracture aperture variations, and updates fracture apertures and the porosity of rock matrix in the near-fracture region based on local reactions. The simulation results lend important insights into the factors that control the evolution of the spatial distribution and thickness of the altered layer. This altered layer in turn affects flow distribution in the fracture and formation of preferential flow channels. It also has an impact on the mass transport between the fracture and the rock matrix, the accessibility of reactive minerals, and the reactions that take place subsequently. Furthermore, the model provides valuable information for future studies on how the altered layer will affect fracture geomechanical properties and the responses of the altered fractures to confining pressures that are often present in the deep subsurface.",

Laser pulses are emitted at a wavelength of 1064 nm by using an actively Q-switched Nd:Yag laser. The pulse energy and pulse repetition frequency are 17 mJ at 30 Hz, respectively. The emission time of each pulse is measured by the detector. The beam is reflected from the surface and received at a 25 cm diameter F/1 telescope. The returning laser pulse is refocused onto a silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) through back-end optics including a narrow bandpass interference filter for isolating the 1064 nm wavelength. The APD-signal is then amplified, sampled and fed to a digital range finder. The minimum acceptable SNR is approx. 1.2. This system determines the time of flight, pulse intensity, width and full shape.

We performed deformation experiments aimed at exploring the geometry and rate of CPO development in polycrystalline olivine aggregates and the influence of CPO on the anisotropic creep response. We deformed hot-pressed San Carlos olivine aggregates in a high-resolution gas-medium apparatus at temperatures of 1200° and 1250°C and a confining pressure of 300 MPa under dry conditions in a variety of deformation geometries, including axial compression, axial extension, shear on angled pistons, and torsion. Several specimens were deformed in multiple deformation geometries, varying the three-dimensional stress state as well as the CPO strength and geometry. Specimen microstructures were characterized using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) before and after each deformation experiment. EBSD maps were used to measure CPO, grain size and shape, and crystallographic misorientations between grains. By varying the deformation geometry and CPO, we are adding constraints to a model that will ultimately predict the high-temperature anisotropic creep response of dry olivine aggregates along complex three-dimensional strain paths. Although the upper mantle is typically modeled as isotropic polycrystalline olivine, numerical models and first-order calculations show that anisotropic creep strength could significantly modify the dynamics of a variety of geological processes, including the shape and internal flow structure of convection cells, the shape and timing of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the rate of post-glacial rebound, and the thermal structure and melt production rate in the mantle wedge of subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Commonly, geoscience data is presented to students in the lab and classroom in the form of data tables, maps and graphs. Successful data interpretation requires learners to become proficient with spatial thinking skills, allowing them to gain insight and understanding of the underlying real-world 3-D processes and concepts. Yet, educators at both the school and university level often witness students having difficulty in performing that translation. As a result, tools and resources that help to bridge that spatial capability gap can have useful application in the educational realm.\nA free, map-based data discovery and visualisation tool developed with NSF funding at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory caters to students and teachers alike by providing a variety of data display and manipulation techniques that enhance geospatial awareness. Called GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org), the tool provides access to hundreds of built-in authentic geoscience data sets. Examples include earthquake and volcano data, geological maps, lithospheric plate boundary information, geochemical, oceanographic, and environmental data.\nBarriers to entry are lowered through easy installation, seamless integration of research-grade data sets, intuitive menus, and project-saving continuity. The default base map is a cutting-edge elevation model covering the oceans and land. Dynamic contouring, artificial illumination, 3-D visualisations, data point manipulations, cross-sectional profiles, and other display techniques help students grasp the content and geospatial context of data. Data sets can also be layered for easier comparison. Students may import their own data sets in Excel, ASCII, shapefile, and gridded format, and they can gain a sense of ownership by being able to tailor their data explorations and save their own projects.\nGeoMapApp is adaptable to a range of learning environments from lab sessions, group projects, and homework assignments to in-class pop-ups. A new Save Session function allows educators to preserve a pre-loaded state of GeoMapApp. When shared with a class, the saved file allows every student to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same starting point from which to begin their data explorations. A wide range of enquiry-driven education modules for GeoMapApp is already available at SERC.",

            "abstract": "We examine Polar and FAST conjunction events along the cusp magnetic flux tubes to study the energization process of ion outflows in the mid- and low-altitude cusp, after these ions leave the upper ionosphere. FAST provides information on the boundary conditions at low-altitudes (~1.6 Re geocentric distance). Polar traverses cusp flux tubes at radial distances of 2 to 9 Re, providing good coverage of the low- and mid-altitude cusp. We compare the wave Poynting flux in the 1 mHz to 1 Hz range and the kinetic energy fluxes of the electrons and ions. The comparisons of these quantities between Polar and FAST determine the energy gain of the particles, especially the ion outflows between the two spacecraft. The Poynting flux is binned into major frequency bands, because it is important to understand the frequency spectrum of the wave energy, and which frequency bands energize the ions. Based on the conjunction events, altitude profiles of various quantities can be obtained. These altitude profiles will reveal the energy conversion between wave and particle in the low- and mid-altitude cusp. Determining the altitude where the most intense energy conversion occurs and what wave frequency bands provide the energy are important to explaining the physics of the heating and acceleration of the ion outflows.",

            "abstract": "Seismic sensitivity kernels, i.e. the basis for mapping misfit functionals to structural parameters in seismic inversions, have received much attention in recent years. Their computation has been conducted via ray-theory based approaches (Dahlen et al., 2000) or fully numerical solutions based on the adjoint-state formulation (e.g. Tromp et al., 2005). The core problem is the exuberant computational cost due to the large number of source-receiver pairs, each of which require solutions to the forward problem. This is exacerbated in the high-frequency regime where numerical solutions become prohibitively expensive.\nWe present a methodology to compute accurate sensitivity kernels for global tomography across the observable seismic frequency band. These kernels rely on wavefield databases computed via AxiSEM (abstract ID# 77891, www.axisem.info), and thus on spherically symmetric models. As a consequence of this method's numerical efficiency even in high-frequency regimes, kernels can be computed in a time- and frequency-dependent manner, thus providing the full generic mapping from perturbed waveform to perturbed structure. Such waveform kernels can then be used for a variety of misfit functions, structural parameters and refiltered into bandpasses without recomputing any wavefields.\nA core component of the kernel method presented here is the mapping from numerical wavefields to inversion meshes. This is achieved by a Monte-Carlo approach, allowing for convergent and controllable accuracy on arbitrarily shaped tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. We test and validate this accuracy by comparing to reference traveltimes, show the projection onto various locally adaptive inversion meshes and discuss computational efficiency for ongoing tomographic applications in the range of millions of observed body-wave data between periods of 2-30s.",

On 7 May 2015, a M4.0 earthquake occurred in Johnson County, TX, south of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. It is the largest event recorded to date in the Fort Worth (Barnett Shale) Basin, which is an active shale gas production area that has been associated with induced earthquakes. The USGS moment tensor indicated normal faulting along NE-SW trending faults and two additional felt aftershocks were reported in the National Earthquake Information Center catalog. Beginning on 11 May 2015, a temporary seismic network was deployed. Over the first week, SMU deployed 13 vertical-component RT125s and 3 USGS NetQuakes instruments. The RT125s were replaced with 7 short-period 3-component instruments provided by IRIS and 4 broadband stations deployed throughout Johnson County by the University of Texas. To date, we have located over 100 events that define a 5 km long normal fault striking 35°NE and dipping ~70°. Events occur in the Precambrian granitic basement at depths of 4-6km. These locations are near the bottom of the Ellenburger Group (~3.5km in depth), which is an Ordovician carbonate platform overlying the basement and is often used for wastewater disposal. Five large volume injection wells operate within 10km of the earthquake sequence and inject very near, if not through, the Ellenburger-basement contact. These wells were temporarily shut down by the Texas Railroad Commission for testing but were reported at the time to have no causal effect on the earthquake activity. We explore temporal and spatial correlations between seismicity, wastewater injection data and subsurface fault data to better understand the cause of the Venus sequence.",

In this work we determine that such anomalous behavior is also found in over 40% of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs), as identified by Richardson and Cane (2010). An analysis of the plasma composition during these events reveals significant depletions in densities of fully stripped ions of Carbon, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. We argue that these events are indicators of ICME plasma acceleration via magnetic reconnection near the freeze-in region of Carbon and Oxygen above the solar corona.",

A rich polymorphism and metastable modifications of solid Ga have been discovered and a number of studies of liquid gallium under high pressure conditions were reported. However, some fundamental properties, such as the equation of state (EoS) of Ga melt under extreme conditions remain unclear. To compare to the previous reports, we performed the pair distribution function (PDF) study using diamond anvil cell, in which synchrotron high-energy x-ray total scattering data, combined with reverse Monte Carlo simulation, was used to study the microstructure and EoS of liquid gallium under high pressure at room temperature conditions. The EoS of Ga melt, which was measured from synchrotron x-ray tomography method at room temperature, was used to avoid the potential relatively big errors for the density estimation from the reverse Monte Carlo simulation with the mathematical fit to the measured structure factor data. The volume change of liquid gallium have been studied as a function of pressure and temperature up to 5 GPa at 370 K using synchrotron x-ray microtomography combined with energy dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD) techniques using Drickamer press. The directly measured P-V-T curves were obtained from 3D tomography reconstruction data. The existence of possible liquid-liquid phase transition regions is proposed based on the abnormal compressibility and local structure change in Ga melts.",

The first phase of the project is occurring this August and September using the NASA Global Hawk to study the impact of targeted observations of hurricanes and tropical cyclones. This follows several successful research missions conducted by both NASA and NOAA. Instruments on the aircraft for SHOUT include the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS or dropsondes), the High Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR, a microwave sounder), the High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP, a scanning Doppler precipitation radar), and the Lightning Instrument Package (LIP). The observations are being utilized for real-time forecasting, ingestion into operational weather models, and in post mission impact studies. Data impact is being evaluated through a combination of Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). This presentation describes observations collected during this year’s campaign, utilization of the data at the National Hurricane Center, and the results of preliminary data impact assessments of the data from SHOUT and previous experiments.",

For future telescopes like JWST and UVOIR/HDST, an exoplanet’s host star will influence our ability to detect and interpret spectral features, including biosignatures. We present a complete suit of stellar models and a grid of model atmospheres for Earth-like planets at equivalent stages of geological evolution in their HZ for stellar effective temperature from Teff = 2300K to 7000K, sampling the entire FGKM stellar type range. Since M dwarfs are simultaneously the most numerous in the universe, the most active, and the most likely stars to host terrestrial exoplanets, we focus in particular on the range of UV emission possible in each sub M spectral class. The UV emission from a planet's host star dominates the photochemistry and thus the resultant observable spectral features of the planet. Using the latest UV spectra obtained by HST and IUE we model the effect of stellar activity on Earth-like planets. We also model the amount of UV flux reaching the surface for Earth-like planets at various geological epochs ranging from a pre-biotic world through the rise of oxygen and for Earth-like planets orbiting FGKM stars at equivalent stages of evolution. When modeling the remotely detectable spectra of these planets we focus on the primary detectable atmospheric features that indicate habitability on Earth, namely: H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, N2O and CH3Cl. We model the emergent as well as transit spectra of Earth-like planets orbiting our grid of FGKM stars in the VIS/NIR (0.4 – 4 μm) and the IR (5 – 20 μm) range as input for future missions like JWST and concepts like UVOIR/HDST.",

The large volume of individual flood basalt lavas demands correspondingly large magma reservoirs within or at the base of the crust. To erupt, some fraction of this magma must become buoyant and overpressure must be sufficient to encourage failure and dike propagation. Because the overpressure associated with a new injection of magma is inversely proportional to the total reservoir volume, buoyancy overpressure has been proposed as a trigger for flood basalt eruptions. To test this hypothesis, we develop a new one-dimensional model for buoyancy overpressure-driven eruptions that combines volatile exsolution, bubble growth and rise, assimilation, and permeable fluid escape through the surrounding country rocks. Degassing during emplacement of flood basalt provinces may have major environmental repercussions. We investigate the temporal evolution of permeable degassing through the crust and degassing during eruptive episodes. We find that assimilation of volatile-rich country rocks strongly enhances flood basalt eruptibility, implying that the eruptive dynamics of flood basalts may be intertwined with their climatic consequences.",

In-situ U-Th-Sm/He thermochronology eliminates many of the problems and inconveniences associated with traditional, whole grain methods, including; reducing bias in grain selection based on size, shape and clarity; allowing for the use of broken grains and grains with inclusions; avoiding bad neighbour effects; and eliminating safety hazards associated with dissolution. In-situ apatite laser ablation is challenging due to low concentrations of U and Th and thus a low abundance of radiogenic He. For apatite laser ablation to be effective the ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) line must have very low and consistent background levels of He. To reduce He background, samples are mounted in a UHV stable medium. Our mounting process uses a MicroHePP (Microscope Mounted Heated Platen Press) to press samples into FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) bonded to an aluminum backing plate. Samples are ablated using a Resonetics 193 nm excimer laser and liberated He is measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer on the ASI Alphachron noble gas line; collectively this system is known as the Resochron. The ablated sites are imaged using a Zygo Zescope optical profilometer and ablated pit volume measured using PitVol, a custom MatLab algorithm developed to enable precise and unbiased measurement of the ablated pit geometry.\nWe use the well-characterized Durango apatite to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the method. He liberated from forty-two pits, having volumes between 1700 and 9000 um3, were measured using the Resochron. The ablated sites were imaged using a Zygo Zescope optical profilometer and ablated pit volume measured using PitVol. U, Th and Sm concentrations were measured by laser ablation and the U-Th-Sm/He age calculated by standard age equation. An age of 33.8±0.31 Ma was determined and compares well with conventional U-Th/He methods, whole grain degassing and dissolution, that produced an age of 32.73±0.47 Ma for chips of the same Durango crystal. Further dating of other well characterized apatite crystals will be used to test the robustness of the method.",

            "abstract": "The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta, the largest in the world, is subject to deformation by active tectonics and dynamic river systems. It lies near the juncture of the Indian, Eurasian and Burmese plates and is being overthrust by both the Shillong Massif and the Indo-Burman Ranges. There are multiple major and minor active faults in Bangladesh, many of which are buried by the sedimentation. For example, the Madhupur tract is a Pleistocene upland in the middle part of Bengal Basin. Whether it is a passive interfluve of the river system or a tilted and tectonically uplifted block has been debated for decades. The Tippera Surface, in Comilla at the eastern part of the basin, is composed of uplifted and oxidized Holocene strata and overlies buried anticlines of the Indo-Burman fold belt. Furthermore, the rivers are subject to migrations, avulsions and other changes in course. The last major avulsion of the Brahmaputra River was only ~200 years ago. During the sea level fall in the last glaciation the major rivers created large incised valleys. In much of the exposed uplands there was the development of a weathered clay surface. This now forms a clay layer separating the Pleistocene and Holocene strata in large parts of Bangladesh.\nWe use electrical resistivity surveying and hand-drilled borehole lithological data to better understand the subsurface discontinuities and structures. The resistivity system consists of an 84 electrode array powered by 2 car batteries and is capable of imaging lithologies to ~100m depth, similar to the depths of the boreholes used to calibrate the data. We extend our previous work on the western margin of the Madhupur Tract with additional lines on the eastern flank of Madhupur. Resistivity lines along the exposed Lalmai anticline in Comilla image the now tilted Holocene-Pleistocene clay layer. Additional lines along the subsurface continuation of the anticline provide additional information on the subsurface lithologies associated with the complex interplay of fluvial dynamics and active tectonics. We will present the latest images and interpretations.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Reusch AGU Poster.pdf\nEvaluating uncertainty in GCMs and regional-scale forecast models is an essential step in the development of climate change predictions. Polar-region skill is particularly important due to the potential for changes affecting both local (ice sheet) and global (sea level) environments through more frequent/intense surface melting and changes in precipitation type/amount. High-resolution, regional-scale models also use GCMs as a source of boundary/initial conditions in future scenarios, thus inheriting a measure of GCM-derived externally-driven uncertainty.\nWe examine inter- and intramodel uncertainty through statistics from decadal climatologies and analyses of variability based on self-organizing maps (SOMs), a nonlinear data analysis tool. We evaluate a 19-member CMIP5 subset and the 30-member CESM1.0-CAM5-BGC Large Ensemble (CESMLE) during polar melt seasons (boreal/austral summer) for recent (1981-2000) and future (2081-2100, RCP 8.5) decades. Regional-model uncertainty is examined with a subset of these GCMs driving Polar WRF simulations.\nDecadal climatologies relative to a reference (recent: the ERA-Interim reanalysis; future: a skillful modern GCM) identify model uncertainty in bulk, e.g., BNU-ESM is too warm, CMCC-CM too cold. While quite useful for model screening, diagnostic benefit is often indirect.\nSOMs extend our diagnostics by providing a concise, objective summary of model variability as a set of generalized patterns. Joint analysis of reference and test models summarizes the variability of multiple realizations of climate (all the models), benchmarks each model versus the reference (frequency analysis helps identify the patterns behind GCM bias), and places each GCM in a common context.\nJoint SOM analysis of CESMLE members shows how initial conditions contribute to differences in modeled climates, providing useful information about internal variability, such as contributions from each member to overall uncertainty using pattern frequencies. In the climatological mean, ensemble members show local temperature anomalies of up to +/- 2 °C relative to the ensemble average. SOM pattern frequency analyses show interquartile ranges for individual patterns of 2-4% across the ensemble. Both are potentially significant sources of melt-prediction uncertainty.",

We present a reduced kinetic description that exploits gyrosymmetry (a symmetry associated with the gyromotion), providing an efficient, self-consistent approach that can be utilized in global models of the solar wind. We discuss the underlying physics of the mirror and firehose instabilities that allow for a reduced gyrokinetic description, and we verify the approach through comparisons of theory and simulations using gyrokinetic, hybrid, and fully kinetic descriptions. We present simulations showing the nonlinear development and saturation of the mirror instability and explain the amplitude and structure of the nonlinear state in terms of particle trapping. Finally, we present new insights into the nature of the parallel and oblique firehose instability by considering how the topology of the dispersion surfaces change as an anisotropic population is added to an isotropic plasma. We discuss the role of resonant and nonresonant particles in the instability and show that a gyrokinetic description is in good agreement with a fully kinetic description.",

Its location as a function of solar wind conditions has been estimated via theory, simulation, and empirical models. This presentation compares magnetopause standoff locations determined by all these methods. We use the Run-On-Request capabilities available from the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, specifically the BATS-R-US, OpenGGCM, LFM and GUMICS global physics-based MHD models. The simulated magnetopause standoff positions and response time to the solar wind changes will then be compared with the results obtained using empirical models (e.g. Shue et al. 1998), and to individual THEMIS, Cluster and the Geotail magnetopause crossing observations. We also inspect times of extreme solar wind conditions when magnetopause crossings have been observed by the GOES satellites. Rigorous analysis/comparison of observations with models is critical in determining the performance of the models used to capture magnetospheric dynamics. We will also identify which types of solar wind conditions lead to significant differences between the models. Preliminary results show that there can be significant discrepancies between magnetopause locations predicted by different global MHD models. The discrepancies are seen, for example, during increases in solar wind dynamic pressure and sharp changes in the IMF Bz component. Preliminary results also indicate that during nominal background solar wind conditions models do agree with the observed magnetopause locations.",

Low mountain snowpack resulted from an anomalously warm winter and subsequently affected water supply for irrigation, fish habitat, ecosystem, and recreation, necessitating a statewide drought emergency declaration in the Washington State. While the 2015 drought is likely a result of natural variability superposed with climate warming, we ask how the frequency of droughts of this character are likely to change as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Downscaled climate data from multiple Global Climate Models from the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project were used with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to calculate both the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Snow Melt and Rain Index (SMRI) indices for quantifying meteorological and snowpack droughts, respectively, in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) under historic and future climate change scenarios. Our results show that snowpack droughts increase in severity and frequency in the future in response to the sensitivity of the snowpack to warming, whereas there is a less systematic trend in meteorological drought. Water resources in the CRB largely depend on the mountain snowpack and spring snowmelt. More frequent occurrence of snowpack drought will have serious implications in this system, which need to be addressed in future studies.",

Using 1-meter resolution panchromatic satellite imagery paired with airborne and in situ data, we evaluated melt pond evolution for an entire melt season on drifting first-year and multiyear sea ice near the 2011 Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS) site in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. A new algorithm was developed to classify the imagery into sea ice, thin ice, melt pond, and open water classes on two contrasting ice types: first-year and multiyear sea ice. Surprisingly, melt ponds formed ~3 weeks earlier on multiyear ice. Both ice types had comparable mean snow depths, but multiyear ice had 0 - 5-cm deep snow covering ~37% of its surveyed area, which may have facilitated earlier melt due to its relatively low surface albedo. The observed difference in the pace of melt between first-year and multiyear ice was likely a result of their surface topographies. First-year sea ice, which was predominantly undeformed, exhibited uniform melt pond formation, growth, and drainage while melt pond evolution on multiyear sea ice was spatially and temporally non-uniform. Maximum pond fractions were 53 ± 3% and 38 ± 3% on first-year and multiyear ice, respectively. These results reveal considerable differences in pond evolution between ice types, and underscore the importance of snow depth distributions and surface topography in the timing and progression of melt pond formation.",

However, continuous monitoring of microbial gene expression in soils is challenging because genetically-encoded reporter proteins widely used in the lab are difficult to deploy in soil matrices: for example, green fluorescent protein cannot be easily visualized in soils, even in the lab. To address this problem we have developed a reporter protein that releases small volatile gases. Here, we applied this gas reporter in a proof-of-concept soil experiment, monitoring horizontal gene transfer, a microbial activity that alters microbial genotypes and phenotypes.\nHorizontal gene transfer is central to bacterial evolution and adaptation and is relevant to problems such as the spread of antibiotic resistance, increasing metal tolerance in superfund sites, and bioremediation capability of bacterial consortia. This process is likely to be impacted by a number of matrix properties not well-represented in the petri dish, such as microscale variations in water, nutrients, and O2, making petri-dish experiments a poor proxy for environmental processes.\nWe built a conjugation system using synthetic biology to demonstrate the use of gas-reporting biosensors in safe, lab-based biogeochemistry experiments, and here we report the use of these sensors to monitor horizontal gene transfer in soils. Our system is based on the F-plasmid conjugation in Escherichia coli. We have found that the gas signal reports on the number of cells that acquire F-plasmids (transconjugants) in a loamy Alfisol collected from Kellogg Biological Station. We will report how a gas signal generated by transconjugants varies with the number of F-plasmid donor and acceptor cells seeded in a soil, soil moisture, and soil O2 levels.",

At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more thermochemically stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. The differences in stability imply stronger carbon sequestration potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes.

This work focuses on a physical-chemical characterization of the aerosol population over a pristine site in Central Amazonia during the dry season. The submicrometer organic aerosols were measured with the Aerodyne ACSM (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor, Aerodyne Inc). Optical properties, size distribution and other micro-physical characteristics were also analyzed. Other instruments were simultaneously used. The measurements were taken during the dry season of 2013 in the Cuieiras ecological reserve (ZF2), northwest of Manaus. The statistical analysis of the data was done with the PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization) technique, in which the organic aerosol was separated into different factors, and then its sources and forming processes were attributed. Results show that the mean aerosol loading was 5,91 μg m-3, from which 78% are of organic composition, 8.5% are sulfate, 6.5% are equivalent black carbon, 4% are ammonium and 3% are nitrate. The mass spectra variability can be explained by 3 factors only, determined with the PMF technique. They were identified as BBOA (Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol), representing 12% of the total organic mass, OOA (Oxygenated Organic Aerosol), representing 66% of the total organic mass and IEPOX-SOA (Isoprene derived Epoxydiol–Secondary Organic Aerosol), representing 21% of the total organic mass. Even in remote and pristine regions, Central Amazonia is highly impacted by biomass burning. Biogenic secondary organic aerosols are also present during the dry season, and the suppression of its wet deposition processes increases their concentration. The oxidation level and other physical-chemical characteristics indicate that the long range transport is responsible for the regional range of this impact.",

            "abstract": "Long-term Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) at permanent meteorological sites is increasingly being used for the evaluation and improvement of parameterizations of fast boundary-layer physics for weather and climate models. Typically, idealized LES are generated that represent fine-scale downscalings of a large-scale model state at locations of interest, resolved at temporal and spatial resolutions at which turbulence and boundary layer clouds can be expected to be resolved. The setup relies on prescribed large-scale forings in combination with continuous nudging, at a time-scale large enough to allow the resolved fast physics to have enough freedom to establish their own, unique state. This study critically assesses the representativeness of such long-term LES, and asks to what degree the continuous nudging affects the budgets of thermodynamic state variables. To this purpose long-term, multi-year LES is confronted with relevant observations at a European midlatitude continental site. The large-scale advective forcings and surface properties used to drive the LES are derived from analyses of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Evaluated aspects of the boundary layer include near-surface meteorology, vertical structure, and bulk properties including clouds. The evaluation focuses on the diurnal cycle, with the oservational datasets derived from state-of-the-art instrumentation at the Juelich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE) in Germany. Conditional sampling is used to highlight results for regimes of interest, including the clear convective and shallow cumulus topped boundary layer. We find that the LES is able to reproduce the observed amplitude and time-variation of key boundary layer properties, including clouds. Budget studies of the thermodynamic state variables reveal that a rough balance exists between the prescribed larger-scale advection and the turbulence/convection as resolved by the LES, with the nudging term only playing a minor, secondary role. These results support the use of idealized, continuous LES for the evaluation of parameterizations.",

The importance of slow diffuse flow in certain geologic layers and rapid preferential flow in others complicates the prediction of vertical and lateral fluxes. Here we present a simple model designed to use limited geological site information to predict these critical subsurface flow processes in response to a sustained recharge source. The model is developed and tested using site-specific information from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP), where confined anthropogenic sources of infiltration from spills, leaks, waste-water disposal, or retention ponds are often associated with facilities where contamination is present. In the thick unsaturated zone overlying the ESRP Aquifer, multiple sedimentary interbeds, which vary in thickness and hydraulic properties, are interspersed between massive fractured basalt units. The combination of surficial sediments, basalts, and interbeds determines the water fluxes through the variably saturated subsurface. Interbeds are often less conductive, causing perched water to collect above them, which is consistent with a hypothesis of rapid flow through the basalt being impeded from vertical percolation by the interbeds. The model successfully predicts volume and extent of perching, and approximates vertical travel times, during events that generate high fluxes from the land surface. The model is useful at sites like the INL where little hydrologic information is available about the combination of preferential and diffuse fluxes, but simple approximations of these combined flow processes can help inform operational decisions.",

We found out that solar wind is roughly twice as Alfvénic during high-speed streams, which dominate the declining solar cycle phase, than during interplanetary coronal mass ejections, which occur more frequently during solar maxima. Furthermore, interplanetary coronal mass ejection -related solar wind is Alfvénic only for a few hours during their passage, while high-speed stream -related Alfvénic fluctuations last typically for several days, making high-speed streams powerful in modulating high-latitude geomagnetic activity.",

To date, limited observations have been made during these events. However, in September 2014 the California King Fire, which gained much public attention due to its rapid spread, effects on air quality, damage to infrastructure, and impacts on the Sierra Nevada landscape, burned an area where high resolution remotely sensed data had been acquired. These data include Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), hyper spectral visual to shortwave infrared Airborne Visual/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and high spatial resolution multi-band thermal infrared imaging (MASTER) technologies. These technologies were used to image the fire before, during and after the fire providing unprecedented detail describing fuel conditions and availability (AVIRIS and LiDAR), fire behavior (i.e., Land Surface Temperature and Fire Radiative Power from MASTER), and fire severity (AVIRIS). Although AVIRIS and MASTER data cover the full extent of the fire before, during, and after the burn, LiDAR data only covered ~34% of the extent. We used quadratic regression (0.53 < R2 < 0. 86) to extrapolate post-fire LiDAR structural metrics to the full extent of the fire before burning. Using these structural data with dominant vegetation maps generated using weighted multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (wMEMSA) from AVIRIS, we generated high-resolution fuel model maps. These were used as input to CAWFETM a high spatial and temporal resolution coupled weather-fire simulator. Although other fire models did not represent the King Fire very well, CAWFE did capture the unanticipated surge up the Rubicon Valley and features captured by MASTER resulted from fine-scale mountain airflows and periods of growth apparently driven by fire-induced winds. Results indicate remote sensing tools may be used to optimize data products for fire science and operations.",

            "abstract": "Widespread demographic shifts in the southern Maya lowlands at the end of the Classic period have been attributed to environmental change caused by human activity and/or climate variability. Fire was essential to landscape modification and was a primary agent of environmental change associated with prehispanic land use. While several studies have provided insight into the dynamic relationship between natural and anthropogenic drivers of change, defining the specific interplay between natural environmental change, human modification of the environment, and cultural response to changes remains a persistent challenge. Here we present the results of a multi-proxy study that reconstructs fire history, agricultural land use, and environmental change during and after Pre-Columbian Maya settlement. Results are interpreted in the context of settlement history as inferred from archaeological mapping around the study site.\nOur findings suggest landscape disturbance, as indicated by erosion, local burning, and nearby maize agriculture, was at its peak during the Early Classic period. This disturbance was likely due to large-scale settlement at the nearby site of Witzna’. All proxies indicate a slow decline in disturbance into the Late Classic period, beginning around 1300 cal yr BP. Cival and Chanchich, two proximal site centers to the south of Laguna Ek’Naab, supported their largest populations during the Late Preclassic and Late Classic, with little or no settlement during the Early Classic. The data from Laguna Ek’Naab suggests that Witzna’ may have been an important center during the Early Classic.\nWhether the decreasing environmental degradation after 1240 cal yr BP is do to a decline in local population or changing land use strategies is not discernable based on the data thus far. However, the near complete absence of burning and continued decrease in erosion from 1240-1090 cal yr BP suggests little anthropogenic activity in the area. Burning resumes in the watershed around 1090 cal yr BP and persists until all evidence for agriculture and environmental disturbance disappears at 995 cal yr BP. Permanent abandonment is inferred based on the last appearance of Zea pollen, a lack of burning, and minimal clay input into Laguna Ek’Naab. After this time, the data suggest abandonment through the present.",

Ground-MSPI is an eight-band spectropolarimetric camera mounted on a two-axis gimbal to acquire pushbroom imagery. The camera uses a photoelastic-modulator-based polarimetric imaging technique to measure linear Stokes parameters in three wavebands (470, 660, and 865 nm) with a 0.005 uncertainty in DoLP. A range of illumination geometries is acquired by collecting image data throughout the day; polarized light scattering models are evaluated over the range of sampled scattering angles.\nIn this work, we show how the orientation of a surface is related to the polarized light scattering from a solar illuminated object. We consider objects prevalent in outdoor scenery: grass, foliage, buildings, and roads; for these materials assuming a real-valued index of refraction is appropriate. The relationship between the orientation of reflected polarized light and the orientation of the surface heavily depends upon the texture of that surface relative to the wavelength of the light. For surfaces that are rough, relative to the wavelength, we observe a measured AoLP that is consistently perpendicular to the scattering plane. For smooth surfaces the AoLP measurements are projections of the surface normal vector onto the imaging plane (see Figure 1). The DoLP contains complementary information about surface orientation; the DoLP is related to the projection of the surface normal vector on to the scattering plane. Since the scattering plane changes with the sun position, increased temporal sampling throughout the day improves the reconstruction of this component of the surface normal vector. We demonstrate how to estimate the surface normal vector, for materials that are prevalent in outdoor scenery, by reconciling Ground-MSPI measurements with polarized light scattering models. We also report on the use of multiple wavebands and geometric shadowing functions to improve estimates of the surface normal vector. Implications for modeling the polarized light scattering of the Earth’s surface for top of atmosphere aerosol retrieval are included.",

            "abstract": "As wind energy deployment increases, questions arise regarding impacts on local climates and how these impacts evolve with the diurnal cycle of the boundary layer. Satellite observations suggest nocturnal increases of surface temperatures, and measurements of turbine wakes document stronger and more persistent reductions of wind speed and increases in turbulence downwind of turbines during stable conditions. Validations of mesoscale parameterizations of these effects have been constrained to idealized conditions defined by neutrally-stratified conditions and/or limited wind directions and wind speeds, or by comparison to idealized large-eddy simulations.\nSynthesis of conventional meteorological measurements and unconventional measurements can offer unique insights for validating models over a large heterogeneous domain. The CWEX-13 field experiment provides an extensive dataset for such validation at spatial scales on the order of 10 km in a range of atmospheric stability and wind conditions. CWEX-13 took place within a 300 MW wind farm in central Iowa during summer 2013 and featured strong diurnal cycles. The wind turbines are sited irregularly, creating a heterogenous “canopy”. Three profiling lidars, numerous surface flux stations, and a scanning lidar sampled wakes from multiple turbines. Further, the wind farm owner/operator has provided access to turbine power production and wind speed measurement data for model validation, providing ~ 200 measurements of proxies that integrate the wind profile over the rotor disk, from 40 m to 120 m above the surface.\nBuilding on previous work that identified optimal physics options, grid configurations, and boundary condition data sets by comparison to lidar wind profile measurements, we execute simulations with the WRF Wind Farm Parameterization for a ten-day period featuring moderate winds and strong diurnal cycles. We evaluate simulations with different modeling choices (e.g., vertical resolution, approaches to representing boundary-layer turbulence) by comparison to both the conventional meteorological measurements as well as the unconventional measurements from wind turbines. We find that model performance depends on these modeling choices. Recommendations for generalization of these results to other locations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In much of the world cities are warming at twice the rate of outlying rural areas. The frequency of urban heat waves is projected to increase with climate change through the 21st century. Addressing the economic, environmental, and human costs of urban heat islands requires a better understanding of their behavior from many disciplinary perspectives. The goal of this four-year Urban Heat Island Network is to (1) bring together scientists studying the causes and impacts of urban warming, (2) advance multidisciplinary understanding of urban heat islands, (3) examine how they can be ameliorated through engineering and design practices, and (4) share these new insights with a wide array of stakeholders responsible for managing urban warming to reduce their health, economic, and environmental impacts. The NSF-RCN Urban Heat Island Network involves atmospheric scientists, engineers, architects, landscape designers, urban planners, public health experts, and education and outreach experts, who will share knowledge, evaluate research directions, and communicate knowledge and research recommendations to the larger research community as well as stakeholders engaged in developing strategies to adapt to and mitigate urban warming.\nThe first Urban Climate Institute was held in Saint Paul, MN in July 2013 and focused on the characteristics of urban heat islands. Scientists engaged with local practitioners to improve communication pathways surrounding issues of understanding, adapting to, and mitigating urban warming. The second Urban Climate Institute was held in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2014 and focused on urban warming and public health. The third Urban Climate Institute was held in Athens, GA in July 2015 and focused on urban warming and the role of the built environment. Scientists and practitioners discussed strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Evaluation experts at the Science Museum of Minnesota have extensively evaluated the Institutes to inform other research coordination networks and to identify effective ways that researchers and practitioners can share knowledge and communicate more effectively. A final Institute is planned for July of 2016 in Saint Paul, MN. This institute will focus on synthesizing findings from the first three workshops and discuss education and outreach efforts.",

Developing an early warning system for storm surges is vital due to the high level of hazard they might cause. On 08 November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan generated storm surges that killed over 6,000 people in the central part of the Philippines. The Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards under the Department of Science and Technology was tasked to create storm surge hazard maps for the country’s coastal areas. The research project aims to generate storm surge hazard maps that can be used for disaster mitigation and planning. As part of the research, the team explored a scenario wherein a tropical cyclone hits the Metro Manila with strength as strong as Typhoon Haiyan. The area was chosen primarily for its political, economic and cultural significance as the country's capital. Using Japan Meteorological Agency Storm Surge model, FLO2D flooding software, LiDAR topographic data, and GIS technology, the effects of a Haiyan-induced tropical cyclone passing through Metro Manila was examined. The population affected, number of affected critical facilities, and potential evacuation sites were identified. The outputs of this study can be used by the authorities as basis for policies that involve disaster risk reduction and management.",

Ongoing model calibrations and solutions are presented for a very small, low-order watershed within a forested mountain range at ~10,000 ft. elevation.

During model calibration, potential configurations for spatial discretization and resolution are tested by comparison to field measurements—as are alternative soil properties and surface runoff parameters. Also demonstrated is the effect of variable geomorphology as it relates to the energy budget and the subsequent distribution of modeled outputs. Within the larger scope of the WYCEHG research group (i.e. The Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics), which works towards a multi-disciplinary approach to field modeling, additional complexities beyond stream flow and soil moisture can be conceptualized and tested based on measurements of snowpacks, evapotranspiration, and geophysical imaging.

Isotopes of CO2 provide insight into land-atmosphere CO2 exchange, and are useful in integration of processes over multiple scales. CO2 isotopes have played a central role in our understanding of the magnitude and inter-annual dynamics of the terrestrial carbon sink at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and will be crucial to understanding the carbon balance and carbon accounting of the North American continent. The carbon cycle has been studied for several decades at Niwot Ridge, a high-elevation site in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, U.S.A. Here we will focus on observations over the last decade at a subalpine forest site (3050 m elevation, the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux tower), and a tundra site 4 km away (3520 m, representing the overlying forest air). During this period, CO2 increased at an average rate of 18 ppm/decade, and d13C of CO2 decreased by 0.25 permil/decade. Variability in both quantities within a year was driven by processes at both the local forest and regional scales, and included anthropogenic processes. The monthly mean CO2 difference between tundra and forest sites was highly correlated with whole ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity derived from forest flux tower measurements.",

So significant is this risk that the USGS has created the ARkStorm Project. This project aims to prepare California for a future storm(s) on the scale of the disastrous 1861-1862 A.D. events. Unfortunately, our knowledge of pre-measurement floods in the coastal southwest US is not well known, excepting seven identified flood layers in the Santa Barbara Basin, which span the past 2000 years. As an alternative to marine archives, the lakes of the coastal southwest US represent untapped resources for pre-measurement flood reconstructions. Here, we present evidence for a flood ca. 4400 cal yrs BP using sediments from Lake Elsinore. Core LEGC03-4 was collected in 4.0 m water depth using a push core with a hollow stemmed augur; the core is 994 cm in length. The core is predominantly clayey silt with occasional sandy silt units of variable cm-scale thickness. Here we focus on a specific core section between 315 and 350 cm where a ~11 cm thick “unusual” sediment unit (319-330 cm) is well preserved and complete. The core section was digitally photographed, described, and sampled at 1 cm contiguous intervals for a variety of physical and chemical properties including: magnetic susceptibility, loss-on-Ignition (LOI) 550 and 950 °C, grain size, CN ratios, and d13Cbulk organics. The data suggest rapid deposition of sediment with classic “Bouma” sequence preservation. The unit is characterized by an erosional basal contact and flame structures. It is normally graded with laminae occurring in the upper section of the unit. It contains predominantly terrestrial organic matter and the upper boundary is gradational. The cause of this event unit is speculative but potentially associated with San Jacinto River flooding in response to a large atmospheric river storm. Curiously, the 1861-1862 A.D. events are not observed in the sediment core suggesting that this 4400 yr event was different (larger magnitude?) than anything observed in historic times. This event’s timing is compared to regional paleoclimatic reconstructions and examined in the context of potential forcings.",

Data from LADEE NMS, LADEE UVS, and LRO LAMP indicating the presence of H, H2, OH, and H2O are presented in terms of their relationship to external drivers. These observations point to the roles of solar wind and micrometeoroids in the source and release of hydrogen-bearing atoms and molecules in the exosphere. In particular, the implantation of H via solar wind is found to be the largest contributor to H2 in the moon’s exosphere. However, the spatial distribution is more consistent with a release mechanism centered on the morning hemisphere. Thus the data are consistent with H2 created through a 2-step process involving the implantation of solar wind and subsequent release by micrometeoroids. This accounts for >12% of the solar wind H budget, leaving < 50% of the solar wind proton budget unobserved. LADEE data are consistent with water mainly being released by micrometeoroids. We present an overall picture of the present-day water cycle occurring on the Moon.",

At Axial Volcano, located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, earthquakes occur preferentially when volumetric extension peaks near times of low ocean tide. Autonomous ocean-bottom hydrophone (OBH, 2007-2011) and cabled ocean bottom seismometer (OBS, Nov. 2014-) data are used to quantify the strength of tidal triggering in time periods before the April 2011 and April 2015 eruptions at Axial Volcano. The mean percent excess at times of low ocean-tide is ~14% (16% std) in the four years prior to the 2011 eruption and ~18% (17% std) in the five months prior to the 2015 eruption. The sensitivity of earthquakes to tidal stress does not evolve systematically prior to either eruption; however, this pattern is disturbed by much larger stress changes associated with the onset of dike intrusion. Following dike injection and eruption, seismicity rates drop sharply. As seismicity rates continue to rise in the months following the 2015 eruption, real-time data available from the cabled OBS network will be used quantify temporal patterns in microearthquake activity as dike induced stresses are relaxed and the magma chamber inflates.",

            "abstract": "With over 300 known subglacial lakes in Antarctica, substantial exploration could be aided by the logistical efficiency of melt probes. The classical Philberth probes were left beneath the ice due to the hole freezing shut during the passage of the probe. Leaving probes behind in a subglacial lake could harm the ecosystem. Here we are motivated to engineer a recoverable melt probe while keeping the logistical efficiency. We present results of numerical calculations on how one method could work for maintaining an open hole, thus maintaining mechanically free connection from which the probe could be recovered from. The numerical model evaluates heat flow and hole radius according to the cylindrical statement of the Stefan problem. Freezing in is modeled around the melted out hole at various depths and temperatures relevant in Antarctica. Modeled times until the hole completely closes in without heat or antifreeze are, under the Antarctic surface temperature of -55 oC: an hour, and basal conditions of -5 oC: about 18 hours. Current design speeds of the Ice Diver range from 6.5 to 10 m/hr, meaning the probe may be meters away before significant freezing occurs. Modeled results suggest that the initial freezing acts to decrease the thermal gradient in the surrounding ice after the passage of the melt probe. It is thus beneficial to let the ice freeze in and then add antifreeze to minimize the volume needed to reach the eutectic solution. This will also reduce the formation of slush as has seen in other boreholes. Further modeling will help to demonstrate the role additional heating of the hole will play in conjunction with antifreeze for maintaining an open hole. To prevent contamination of subglacial lakes the warmer basal section may be kept open by heating alone due to slow basal freezing rates and ethanol may be used as antifreeze since it will be buoyant on the basal water.",

Unfortunately, it is also considered the most threatened of all reef regions, with rising temperature and coral bleaching already taking a toll. Reproductive connectivity between reefs plays a critical role in the reef’s capacity to recover after such disturbances. Thus, oceanographic modeling efforts to understand patterns of reef connectivity are essential to the effective design of a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to conserve marine ecosystems in the Coral Triangle. Here, we combine a Regional Ocean Modeling System developed for the Coral Triangle (CT-ROMS) with a Lagrangian particle tracking tool (TRACMASS) to investigate the probability of coral larval transport between reefs. A 47-year hindcast simulation (1960-2006) was used to investigate the variability in larval transport of a broadcasting coral following mass spawning events in April and September. Potential connectivity between reefs was highly variable and stochastic from year to year, emphasizing the importance of decadal or longer simulations in identifying connectivity patterns, key source and sink regions, and thus marine management targets for MPAs. The influence of temperature on realized connectivity (future work) may add further uncertainty to year-to-year patterns of connectivity between reefs. Nonetheless, the potential connectivity results we present here suggest that although reefs in this region are primarily self-seeded, rare long-distance dispersal may promote recovery and genetic exchange between reefs in the region. The spatial pattern of “subpopulations” based solely on the physical drivers of connectivity between reefs closely match regional patterns of biodiversity, suggesting that physical barriers to larval dispersal may be a key driver of reef biodiversity. Finally, 21st Century simulations driven by the Community Earth System Model (CESM) suggest that these major barriers to larval dispersal persist into the future under 8.5 W/m2 of climate forcing, despite some regional changes in connectivity between reefs.",

The revitalized web portal is entitled the “Surface meteorological and Solar Energy” (SSE - https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/sse/) and has been supporting an estimated 175,000 users with baseline solar and meteorological parameters as well as calculated parameters that enable feasibility studies for a wide range of renewable energy systems, particularly those systems featuring solar energy technologies. The GIS tools enable, generate and store climatological averages using spatial queries and calculations (by parameter for the globe) in a spatial database resulting in greater accessibility by government agencies, industry and individuals. The data parameters are produced from NASA science projects and reformulated specifically for the renewable energy industry and other applications. This first version includes: 1) processed and reformulated set of baseline data parameters that are consistent with Esri and open GIS tools, 2) development of a limited set of Python based functions to compute additional parameters “on-the-fly” from the baseline data products, 3) updated the current web sites to enable web-based displays of these parameters for plotting and analysis and 4) provided for the output of data parameters in geoTiff, ASCII and .netCDF data formats. The beta version is being actively reviewed through interaction with a group of collaborators from government and industry in order to test web site usability, display tools and features, and output data formats. This presentation provides an overview of this project and the current version of the new SSE-GIS web capabilities through to the end usage. This project supports cross agency and cross organization interoperability and access to NASA SSE data products and OGC compliant web services and aims also to provide mobile platform support.",

An adequate model for study of this phenomenon is the Euler equation for potential flow of incompressible fluid with free surface in 2-D geometry. Numerical integration of these equations confirms completely the conjecture of rogue wave formation from modulational instability but the procedure is time consuming for determination of rogue wave appearance probability for a given shape of wave energy spectrum. This program can be realized in framework of simpler model using replacement of the exact interaction Hamiltonian by more compact Hamiltonian. There is a family of such models. The popular one is the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). This model is completely integrable and suitable for numerical simulation but we consider that it is oversimplified. It misses such important phenomenon as wave breaking. Recently, we elaborated much more reliable model that describes wave breaking but is as suitable as NLSE from the point of numerical modeling. This model allows to perform massive numerical experiments and study statistics of rogue wave formation in details.",

            "abstract": "Despite having a semi-arid cold region, the province of Saskatchewan in western Canada is home to major agricultural activities. This is due to a reliable water supply in North and South Saskatchewan rivers (hereafter NSR and SSR), initiated from the Rocky Mountain headwaters in south western Alberta. The incoming interprovincial streamflow to Saskatchewan, however, is subject to significant annual variations due to natural climate variability, climate change as well as human use and regulation. Most importantly, severe multi-year hydrologic droughts in NSR and SSR have been observed within historical and paleo records. Such long-term low flow conditions can cause vulnerability in the water supply systems, particularly if combined with an increased irrigation demand, due to global warming, crop change, meteorological drought and/or irrigation expansion. This study aims at providing a novel use of long-term annual paleo streamflow records for monthly, multi-sector drought impact assessment. By considering tree ring-based reconstructed annual streamflow records, 10-year drought sequences with 100-year return periods were obtained at NSR and SSR. The annual sequences were converted to monthly flow hydrographs using a stochastic reconstruction scheme. The water resource system was then conditioned to multiple realizations of the monthly drought sequence and simulated under various scenarios for reservoir operation and increment in irrigation demand. Simulation results show that Saskatchewan can still maintain the Saskatchewan/Manitoba apportionment requirement, even under a 10-year drought and 10 folds increment in irrigation demand. Such severe drought sequence, nonetheless, cause significant decline in Saskatchewan’s hydropower production, which is currently the most profitable water sector in the province. Changes in reservoir operation, however, can considerably mitigate the adverse effects of drought and increased irrigation demand on hydropower industry, depending on the stage of drought, state of the system as well as the level of increment in the irrigation demand.",

            "abstract": "Projected changes in global climate and associated shifts in vegetation have increased interest in understanding species persistence at local scales. We examine the climatic and physical factors that could mediate changes in the distribution of vegetation in regions of complex topography. Using massive networks of low-cost temperature and humidity sensors, we developed topographically-resolved daily historical gridded temperature data for the US Northern Rockies. We used the WindNinja model to create daily historical wind speed maps across the same domain. Using a spatially distributed ecohydrology model (ECH2O) we examine separately the sensitivity of modeled evapotranspiration and soil moisture to wind, radiation, soil properties, minimum temperature and humidity. A suite of physical factors including lower wind speeds, cold air drainage, solar shading and increased soil depth reduce evapotranspiration and increase late season moisture availability in valley bottoms. Evapotranspiration shows strong sensitivity to spatial variability in surface wind speed, suggesting that sheltering effects from winds may be an important factor contributing to mountain refugia.\nFundamental to our understanding of patterns of vegetation change is the role of stand-replacing wildfires, which modify the physical environment and subsequent patterns of species persistence and recruitment. Using satellite-derived maps of burn severity for recent fires in the US Northern Rockies we examined relationships between wind speed, cold air drainage potential and soil depth and the occurrence of unburned and low severity fire. Severe fire is less likely to occur in areas with high cold air drainage potential and low wind speeds, suggesting that sheltered valley bottoms have mediated the severity of recent wildfires. Our finding highlight the complex physical mechanisms by which mountain weather and climate mediate fire-induced vegetation changes in the US Northern Rocky Mountains.",

Additionally, we use dose rates measured by the CRaTER instrument on LRO to provide dose rates near Earth. Simulations of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model provided by the CCMC are utilized to show how the position of each observer and their magnetic connection to the shock front affect the observed radiation. We find that the results are in good qualitative agreement with expectations based on previous observations made by Reames (1999).

            "abstract": "Molybdenum has emerged as a powerful paleo-indicator of sulfidic conditions in studies of the evolution of Earth’s early oxygenation, either by examining patterns of Mo enrichment and/or the δ98Mo isotopic signature in sedimentary records. However, the processes leading to Mo incorporation in sulfidic sediments are still unknown, limiting its use as a proxy.\nThe Mount McRae Shale, deposited ~2.5 billion years ago (Ga) in the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia, provides a unique opportunity to examine Earth surface conditions during the Archean just prior to the Great Oxidation Event, and an important example of the deep time application of Mo geochemistry. Trace element [1] and iron speciation [2] data measured in the upper shale interval indicate deposition under euxinic conditions and significant aqueous transport of redox-sensitive trace elements.\nδ98Mo measured in the upper euxinic interval of the Mt. McRae Shale ranges from 0.99 to 1.86 ‰ [3]. These heavy δ98Mo values have been attributed to the effects of oxidative weathering and adsorption of Mo to oxide mineral surfaces. To further explore the implications of these data and to identify possible mechanisms controlling Mo burial, we analyzed samples from the upper euxinic shale using XANES and EXAFS. First, our data suggest an association between Mo and organic matter implying that metamorphic processes have not altered this interval. Perhaps more surprisingly, we find a strong relationship between Mo speciation and δ98Mo isotopic signature (r2 = 0.90). We suggest an alternative mechanism for explaining the Mo isotope systematics of the upper Mt. McRae Shale involving Mo reduction.

Mutliscale interactions between local and propagating convection lead to substantial enhancement of the local diurnal cycle over that region. CCKW activity strongly modulates magnitude of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Maritime Continent, but not its temporal evolution, which maintains characteristics of a diurnal cycle. The impact is such that precipitation is highly increased during convective part of the CCKW and little suppressed during its non-convective part. Timing of the increase in diurnal cycle magnitude strongly depends on the time of the day of the CCKW approach to the Maritime Continent. It is shown that precipitation anomaly associated with CCKW is phase locked with local diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Maritime Continent and that has implications for CCKW ability to propagate across that region. The composite daily-zonal evolution of the precipitation anomaly associated with CCKW is such that it is “in-phase” with local diurnal cycle over Sumatra, Borneo and surrounding seas.\nThis presentation is based on analysis of TRMM precipitation data and newly developed CCKW trajectories database.",

It is a protoplanet that is left over from the formation of the solar System about 4.6 billion years ago and its study could improve our knowledge of the early solar system. Quantifying these properties under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium forms the basis for interpreting shape and gravity data in terms of interior structure and infer deviations from hydrostaticity that can bring information on the thermal and chemical history of the planet. Here, we investigate the hydrostatic shape and gravitational potential coefficients of Ceres that is large enough to have undergone internal differentiation and chemical stratification. The Dawn spacecraft is expected to obtained a high-resolution shape data, with an accuracy better than 200 m/pixel. In order to reach an accuracy of few tens of meters for this 9 hours self-gravitating body, the shape models developed up to first order are not enough because they attain an accuracy of 1.8 km. Therefore, we numerically integrate Clairaut’s equations of rotational equilibrium expanded up to third order in a small parameter m, the geodetic parameter, to reach an accuracy of 25 meters. The following geodetical quantities under the hydrostatic hypothesis are derived: flattening and other shape parameters, gravitational potential coefficients, and moments of inertia. This type of modeling will be instrumental to the estimation of non-hydrostatic contributions to Ceres’ shape to be measured by Dawn.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the influence of radiative forcing on hydrological cycle changes in climate models can be challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, particularly for regional changes. One method of improving the signal-to-noise ratio, even for short simulations, is to use techniques from engineering, broadly known as system identification. Through this method, forcing (or any other chosen field) in multiple regions in a climate model is perturbed simultaneously by using mutually uncorrelated signals with a chosen frequency content, depending upon the climate behavior one wishes to reveal. The result is the sensitivity of a particular climate field (e.g., temperature, precipitation, or cloud cover) to changes in any perturbed region.\nWe demonstrate this technique in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We perturbed surface air temperatures in 22 regions by up to 1°C. The amount of temperature perturbation was changed every day corresponding to a predetermined sequence of random numbers between -1 and 1, filtered to contain particular frequency content. The matrix of sequences was then orthogonalized such that all individual sequences were mutually uncorrelated. We performed CESM simulations with both fixed sea surface temperatures and a fully coupled ocean. We discuss the various patterns of climate response in several fields relevant to the hydrological cycle, including precipitation and surface latent heat fluxes. We also discuss the potential limits of this technique in terms of the spatial and temporal scales over which it would be appropriate to use.",

The core was collected to test the potential for high-resolution reconstructions of basin-scale paleoclimate in the Pacific and the Mesoamerican region. Shipboard and post-cruise analyses include magnetic susceptibility (MS), smear slide counts and laser diffraction particle size analysis. The core is being analyzed for X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and color reflectance, and a 210Pb age model is being constructed. Preliminary results show that Rio Yaqui lower fan sediment differs significantly from that in the Guaymas Basin, which is dominantly diatom ooze. The lower ~2m of core P13 show prominent alternations (~10-20cm) between very-fine-grained, clay intervals characterized by higher MS and mixed diatom and clay intervals, with coarser grain size and lower MS values. In contrast, the upper ~1m has distinctive high MS sand turbidites alternating with diatom-rich layers. Previous core studies from nearby ODP Leg 64 site show sedimentation rates of ~1.2 m/ka; as these sites are further away from the Yaqui delta the sedimentation rates for core P13 should be higher possibly recording only the last few hundred years of sedimentation. Clay/diatom cycles in the lower part of the core could record decadal- or ENSO-scale wet/aridity cycles in the Sonoran Mainland. Conversely, the coarser siliciclastic intervals and the diatom layers in the upper part of the core could reflect the last few decades of land usage in the watershed of the Rio Yaqui, the most important river in the state of Sonora, Mexico. These include large modifications to the river’s hydrography (e.g. construction of dams and aqueducts), rapidly expanding mass agricultural practices in the region, and increased eutrophication in the Gulf.",

However the TISO varies seasonally in terms of direction of propagation and the geographical location of its occurrence. Minima in the Lanczos bandpass filtered (20-100 days) daily NOAA Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from 1979-2011, which represent maxima in precipitation rate, are tracked by using newly developed tracking algorithm based on a multi-object method. A total of 192 events were identified over the period, which were then classified into six categories on the basis of their propagation direction and geographical location. The TISO remains active throughout the year in one or another of the classes. Eastward propagation south of the equator occurs mostly in boreal winter. Northward propagation in the Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors occurs in boreal summer months. The seasonality of TISO is related to the intra-hemispheric migration of the mean background states of sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind and specific humidity. All events prefer warm SST, westerly or weak easterly wind and high tropospheric specific humidity. The intra-hemispheric migration of the mean state may play important role in the seasonality of TISO and its characteristics",

The model adequately reproduces the spatial distribution of the concentration of chlorophyll for the different seasons of the year. In general, the distribution of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) depends primarily on the seasonal circulation patterns, the total solar irradiance, and the vertical flux of nutrients. Interannual variability shows two extreme years in the analyzed period: 2006 and 2007. Year 2006 was an anomalous warm year, with a weak upwelling activity and low chlorophyll concentrations compared to year 2011. These anomalies are related to the activity of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the El Niño+3, and the regional Outgoing Longwave Radiation. Thus, in spite of the simplicity of the NPZD model, both temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of chlorophyll and nutrients are generally reproduced.",

Many microwave-based satellite observations have been utilized to estimate this parameter. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is one of many remotely sensors that collects daily information of land surface soil moisture. However, many factors such as ancillary data and vegetation scattering can affect the signal and the estimation. Therefore, this information needs to be validated against some “ground-truth” observations. NOAA – Cooperative Remote Sensing and Technology (CREST) center at the City University of New York has a site located at Millbrook, NY with several insitu soil moisture probes and an L-Band radiometer similar to Soil Moisture Passive and Active (SMAP) one. This site is among SMAP Cal/Val sites.\nSoil moisture information was measured at seven different locations from 2012 to 2015. Hydra probes are used to measure six of these locations. This study utilizes the observations from insitu data and the L-Band radiometer close to ground (at 3 meters height) to validate and to compare soil moisture estimates from AMSR2. Analysis of the measurements and AMSR2 indicated a weak correlation with the hydra probes and a moderate correlation with Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS probes).\nSeveral differences including the differences between pixel size and point measurements can cause these discrepancies. Some interpolation techniques are used to expand point measurements from 6 locations to AMSR2 footprint. Finally, the effect of penetration depth in microwave signal and inconsistencies with other ancillary data such as skin temperature is investigated to provide a better understanding in the analysis. The results show that the retrieval algorithm of AMSR2 is appropriate under certain circumstances. This validation algorithm and similar study will be conducted for SMAP mission.\nKeywords: Remote Sensing, Soil Moisture, AMSR2, SMAP, L-Band.",

This study focuses on acetonitrile, which is a robust tracer for biomass burning due to its relatively long atmospheric lifetime (weeks to months). By quantifying this tracer in atmospheric samples, we can not only identify biomass burning emission sources over varying spatial scales but also determine the effect of biomass burning on pollution events, such as the production of ozone, in remote or urban areas.\nWe use PoraPak N as a collection medium for both background and elevated levels of acetonitrile and other VOCs in discrete atmospheric samples. Thermal desorption tubes are inserted into a multi-tube active sampler, where each tube is capable of sampling between approximately 5 and 30 liters of ambient air over the course of 2-8 hours. After collection, we analyze these samples using thermal desorption into a cryofocusing trap with subsequent gas chromatography (GC) for separation and detection by a mass spectrometer (MS). To test the field deployment of this technique, we collected samples of both background ambient air and air that was impacted by biomass burning plumes at the Mount Bachelor Observatory (MBO) in central Oregon during summer and fall 2015. Based on previous studies by Wang et al. (2007) and others cited therein, we expect to see ambient concentrations at MBO between 0.1 and 10 ppb of acetonitrile.\nLong-term active sampling by multiple thermal desorption tubes along with analysis of these samples via Cryo-GC-MS provides a portable, low-maintenance method of measuring biomass burning tracers in remote or urban areas. With this technique, we can further investigate the relative impacts of regionally and long-range transported biomass burning emissions on air quality during high pollution events.",

To quantify the impact of these hotspots and hot moments on the carbon cycle, a 2D reactive transport model was developed for the saturated-unsaturated zone of a flood plain site in Rifle, CO. Previous studies have identified naturally reduced zones (NRZs) in the saturated zone of the Rifle site to be hotspots and important regions for subsurface biogeochemical cycling. Wavelet analysis of geochemical concentrations at the site suggested that hydrologic and temperature variations are hot moments and exert an important control on biogeochemical conditions in the Rifle aquifer.\nHere, we describe the development of a reactive transport model that couples hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to microbial functional distributions inferred from site-specific ‘omic’ data. The model includes microbial contributions from heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic processes. We use Monod based formulations to represent biomass formation and consider energy partitioning between catabolic and anabolic processes. We use this model to explore community emergence at the Rifle site and further constrain the extent and rates of nutrient uptake as well as abiotic and biotic reactions using stable carbon isotopes.\nResults from 2D model simulations with only abiotic reactions predict lower CO2 partial pressures in the unsaturated zone and severely underpredict (~200%) carbon fluxes to the river compared to simulations with chemolithoautotrophic pathways. δ13C-CO2 profiles also point to biotic sources for the locally observed high CO2 concentrations above NRZs. Results further indicate that groundwater carbon fluxes from the Rifle site to the river are underestimated by almost 180% (to 3.3 g m-2 d-1) when temperature fluctuations are ignored in the simulations. Preliminary results demonstrate the emergence of denitrifiers at specific depths in the unsaturated zone. This modeling study suggests that spatially (e.g., microbial and redox zonation) and temporally discrete conditions (e.g., temperature fluctuations) can significantly contribute to carbon cycling in flood plains and hotspots and hot moments need to be appropriately represented in model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands have the capability to produce and release significant amounts of free phase biogenic gasses (CO2, CH4) into the atmosphere and are thus regarded as key contributors of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Many studies throughout the past two decades have investigated gas flux dynamics in peat soils; however a high resolution temporal understanding in the variability of these fluxes (particularly at the matrix scale) is still lacking. This study implements an array of hydrogeophysical methods to investigate the temporal variability in biogenic gas accumulation and release in high resolution for a large 0.073 m3 peat monolith from the Blue Cypress Preserve in central Florida. An autonomous rail system was constructed in order to estimate gas content variability (i.e. build-up and release) within the peat matrix using a series of continuous, uninterrupted ground penetrating radar (GPR) transects along the sample. This system ran non-stop implementing a 0.01 m shot interval using high frequency (1.2 GHz) antennas. GPR measurements were constrained with an array of 6 gas traps fitted with time-lapse cameras in order to capture gas releases at 15 minute intervals. A gas chromatograph was used to determine CH4 and CO2 content of the gas collected in the gas traps. The aim of this study is to investigate the temporal variability in the accumulation and release of biogenic gases in subtropical peat soils at the lab scale at a high resolution. This work has implications for better understanding carbon dynamics in subtropical freshwater peatlands and how climate change may alter such dynamics.",

Heterogeneous storage systems are emerging which offer enhanced features for dealing with Big Data such as the IBM GPFS storage system’s integration into Hadoop Map-Reduce. Taking advantage of these capabilities requires file storage systems to be adaptive and accommodate these new storage technologies. We present the extension of the Lightweight Virtual File System (LVFS) currently running as the production system for the MODIS Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) to incorporate a flexible plugin architecture which allows easy integration of new HPC hardware and/or software storage technologies without disrupting workflows, system architectures and only minimal impact on existing tools.\nWe consider two essential aspects provided by the LVFS plugin architecture needed for the future HPC community. First, it allows for the seamless integration of new and emerging hardware technologies which are significantly different than existing technologies such as Segate’s Kinetic disks and Intel’s 3DXPoint non-volatile storage. Second is the transparent and instantaneous conversion between new software technologies and various file formats. With most current storage system a switch in file format would require costly reprocessing and nearly doubling of storage requirements.\nWe will install LVFS on UMBC’s IBM iDataPlex cluster with a heterogeneous storage architecture utilizing local, remote, and Seagate Kinetic storage as a case study. LVFS merges different kinds of storage architectures to show users a uniform layout and, therefore, prevent any disruption in workflows, architecture design, or tool usage. We will show how LVFS will convert HDF data produced by applying machine learning algorithms to Xco2 Level 2 data from the OCO-2 satellite to produce CO2 surface fluxes into GeoTIFF for visualization.",

Average annual rainfall in the Caribbean is predicted to decrease by 20% within the next 80 years. A drier wet season (May-Sept.) will account for the majority of the annual rainfall decrease compared to changes in dry season rainfall (Dec.-Apr.). But, what exactly does “climate” represent and how is this translated to future projections?\n Climate is nothing more than an average of weather events. Weather events that contribute to the Caribbean early season rainfall are diagnosed from 2 ingredients: low level tropical moisture transport and uplift dynamics from upper level troughs that dig deep into the Caribbean during the late spring. Heavy rainfall is observed where these two conditions occur simultaneously. Accumulated rainfall during this time contributes to a quasi-stationary “Caribbean rain-belt” pattern that accounts for the first peak of the annual bimodal Caribbean rainfall pattern.\n Rather than thinking of a general drier Caribbean at the end of this century, we should instead consider changes in circulation that will alter the wet season weather events between May and June, including the “Caribbean rain-belt”. Altering expected weather events over time ultimately causes a change in anticipated climate by the end of the 21st century. Farmers who depend on a predictable series of familiar late spring rains and the “Caribbean rain-belt” may need to adjust to a new normal that includes fewer rainfall events and an overall drier wet season.",

            "abstract": "The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (New Hampshire, USA) presents an unusual opportunity for the application of innovative isotope methods in forest biogeochemistry. Changes in biogeochemical cycling resulting from decades of acid deposition, subsequent reductions in acid deposition, and a series of experimental treatments (harvesting, Ca amendment) have been studied continuously for 60 years at this site. Importantly, researchers have archived soil, water, and vegetation samples for much of the site’s history. Our work seeks to complement earlier mass balance studies of Ca cycling by measuring Ca isotope ratios on archived samples. In the first component of our study, we examined the Ca isotopic response to an experimental clearcut in the early 1980’s. Earlier work showed that the clearcut promoted dramatic loss of Ca from the watershed, indicated by a 5-fold increase in streamwater Ca concentrations. The mechanism for this loss was unclear as no resolvable changes in soil Ca pools were observed. Our work shows that streamwater dissolved Ca becomes isotopically lighter as Ca concentrations increase. These data are best accounted for by an increase in Ca loss from the soil cation exchange complex. Soil exchangeable δ44Ca itself evolves towards lighter values in the years following the experimental harvest. We interpret this as replenishment of the soil exchange complex by release of isotopically light Ca from root biomass. In the second component of our study, we examine decadal-scale changes in streamwater and soil Ca in an un-manipulated biogeochemical reference watershed. Historical data from Hubbard Brook show that streamwater Ca concentrations began decreasing sharply in the early 1970’s, attributed to decreased deposition of both acidity and Ca with the passage of the Clean Air Act. Preliminary data indicate no resolvable change in the average δ44Ca of streamwater, with variability mostly attributable to discharge (flowpath control). Preliminary data similarly suggest that most of the variability in shallow soil exchangeable δ44Ca is related to landscape position rather than temporal trends.",

Modeling may be done to address short-term concerns such as determining the saturation of CO2 at the end of the injection period or long-term concerns such as estimating the mass of dissolved CO2 hundreds of years after the injection period. Model complexity describes the physics included in the flow model and encompasses how simply key input data can be described-- homogeneous or heterogeneous permeability, homogeneous or heterogeneous capillary pressure, simple or hysteretic relative permeability, and simple or hysteretic capillary pressure.\nStarting with a simple 3D model and building to a complex model in a stepwise manner, the effects of additional complexity on the short-term and long-term CO2 saturation and mass balance (free supercritical fluid, trapped, and dissolved) are being evaluated. Initial results suggest that the CO2 plume footprint, plume extent and mass balance vary significantly with model complexity over the short- and long-term, and that representing full complexity (i.e., heterogeneity and hysteresis in the characteristic relationships for capillary pressure and relative permeability, as they vary within the reservoir’s geologic architecture) may be critical to properly representing CO2 dynamics in some candidate reservoirs. Ultimately, we seek to demonstrate the significance of various pore-scale processes to the continuum-scale distribution of CO2.",

Progress has been made via theoretical models of regime shifts or experimental manipulation but natural, real world, examples of threshold change are limited and in many cases inconclusive. Lake sediments provide the potential to examine abrupt ecological change by directly observing how species, communities, and biogeochemical proxies responded to environmental perturbation or recorded ecosystem change. These records are not problem-free; age uncertainties, uneven and variable temporal resolution, and time-consuming taxonomic work all act to limit the scope and scale of the data or complicate its analysis.\nHere I use two annually laminated records\n1. Kassjön, a seasonally anoxic mesotrophic lake in N Sweden, and\n2. Baldeggersee, a nutrient rich, hardwater lake on the central Swiss Plateau\nto investigate lake ecosystem responses to abrupt environmental change using ideal paleoecological time series.\nRapid cooling 2.2kyr ago in northern Sweden significantly perturbed the diatom community of Kassjön. Using wavelet analysis, this amelioration in climate also fundamentally altered patterns of variance in diatom abundances, suppressing cyclicity in species composition that required several hundred years to reestablish. Multivariate wavelet analysis of the record showed marked switching between synchronous and asynchronous species dynamics in response to rapid climatic cooling and subsequent warming.\nBaldeggersee has experienced a long history of eutrophication and the diatom record has been used as a classic illustration of a regime shift in response to nutrient loading. Time series analysis of the record identified some evidence of a threshold-like response in the diatoms. A stochastic volatility model identified increasing variance in composition prior to the threshold, as predicted from theory, and a switch from compensatory to synchronous species dynamics, concomitant with eutrophication, was observed.\nThese results document in high resolution how two aquatic systems reacted to abrupt change and demonstrate that under ideal conditions sediments can preserve valuable evidence of rapid ecological change.",

            "abstract": "Wind energy development relies on estimates of the wind resource at a development site. The estimates are expected to portray production and variability over the lifetime of the wind farm. Since long-term measurements at the development site are rarely available, correlations with nearby long-term measurements are often used as a proxy. This common practice assumes that the long-term reference measurements, typically over 10‒20 years, adequately represent the actual resource characteristics of both the reference site and the target site. However, current methodologies do not consider the possibility of significant year-to-year correlations in the wind resource, suggesting that 10 or 20 years may not be long enough – or may be too long – to assess development potential.\nTo explore the role of year-to-year correlations in impacting interannual variability, we have investigated 54 years of homogenized hourly mean wind speed data from 117 Canadian stations. After selecting only stations with significant wind resources, we have extrapolated the hourly 10-meter winds to an altitude of 80 meters and calculated hourly power production and then an annual capacity factor for a widely-deployed turbine, the GE 1.5 MW XLE, deployed at the site of the wind speed measurements. We evaluate the effect of correlations between consecutive years by randomly permuting a station’s sequence of annual capacity factors, and comparing the statistics of the randomized data to the statistics of the actual data.\nEstimating the expected value of average production for a station’s final twenty years (a typical wind farm lifetime) from the immediately preceding years, we find for randomized data that the error decreases the more years are considered, as expected. However, surprisingly, for the actual time series the best estimate is obtained using just a short few-year segment immediately preceding the final 20-year target period. Further, using the sample standard deviation σ and mean μ of N-year data segments we find that interannual variability (σ/μ) for actual data continues to grow with N out to the 54-year limit of our records, while for randomized sequences it remains essentially constant. Our presentation will explore the effects of these correlation-induced errors and biases on P50 and P90 estimates.",

The development of conceptual and process models is currently hampered by a fundamental lack of understanding of runoff generation mechanisms, and whether these mechanisms changed in concert with declining surface flow. We used stable water isotopes as tracers, measuring their concentrations in rainfall, soil water, and surface runoff. The isotopic profiles of runoff were very similar to rainfall, and displayed no evidence of mixing with soil water, leading us to conclude that infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms were dominant, consistent with observed sharp rising and falling limbs in the regional hydrograph. This interpretation was supported by observations from nearly 100 surficial wells, which confirmed that water tables remained well below the level of the stream channel during the monsoon season. Infiltrometer measurements across different land uses in the catchment indicated broadly similar rates of infiltration capacity, suggesting that land use is unlikely to have altered the frequency with which infiltration excess runoff occurs. Changes in the occurrence of large storms over the 40 year period in which streamflow declines were observed are not sufficient to explain the decline in streamflow, if the runoff generation mechanism had not also changed during this period. We suggest that the results are consistent with the interpretation that a change in the dominant runoff generation mechanism has occurred simultaneously with the reductions in flow in the TG Halli catchment, potentially induced by the widespread expansion of groundwater pumping in the region.",

A few areas of in and around KOL, Odisha, and Sikkim influenced AOD ascertained using the Potential source contribution function (PSCF). Cluster analysis revealed preferred pathway as continental during February and both continental and marine during March to June. Episodic days identified for dust occurrence was examined and was further corroborated by MODIS Rapid response images. Further, comparative results of seven collateral AERONET sites in India, revealed a high AOD (α) at KOL during February to May (March and April) with Fine mode - FM (Coarse mode - CM) AOD of KOL being high during March and April (February to April) than other locations. Single scattering albedo (SSA) at 0.67 μm at KOL was slightly lower during February and March, with being equivalent and or higher than other sites during April to June. Comparison of AERONET - MODIS AOD at 0.55 µm for KOL (entire study period) for the collateral days revealed underestimation of MODIS during February to April and overestimation during May and June than AERONET.

            "abstract": "Oxygen, carbon and nutrient availability are defining parameters for microbial life. In contrast to organic-rich sediments of the continental margins, where high respiration rates lead to a depletion of O2 within a thin layer at the sediment surface, it was discovered that O2 penetrates several tens of meters into organic-poor sediments underlying oligotrophic ocean gyres. In addition, nitrate, another important oxidant, which usually disappears rapidly with depth in anoxic sediments, tends to accumulate above seawater concentrations in the oxic subsurface, reflecting the importance of nitrogen cycling processes, including both nitrification and denitrification. Two IODP drilling expeditions were vital for exploring the nature of the deep subsurface beneath oligotrophic ocean gyres, expedition 329 to the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) and expedition 336 to North Pond, located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic ridge beneath the North Atlantic Gyre. Within the ultra-oligotrophic SPG O2 penetrates the entire sediment column from the sediment-water interface to the underlying basement to depths of > 75 m. At North Pond, a topographic depression filled with sediment and surrounded by steep basaltic outcrops, O2 penetrates deeply into the sediment (~ 30 m) until it eventually becomes depleted. O2 also diffuses upward into the sediment from seawater circulating within the young crust underlying the sediment, resulting in a deep oxic layer several meters above the basalt. Despite low organic carbon contents microbial cells persist throughout the entire sediment column within the SPG (> 75 m) and at North Pond, albeit at low abundances. We explored the nature of the subsurface microbial communities by extracting intact cells from large volumes of sediment obtained from drill cores of the two expeditions. By using CARD-FiSH, amplicon (16s rRNA) and metagenome sequencing we shed light on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the elusive communities residing in the deep oxic sediments of these two different areas. Given the global extent of this oxic subsurface studies of the diversity and metabolic potential of its biome, together with the analyses of porewater geochemical and isotopic composition, are beginning to reveal its role in global biogeochemical cycles.",

The ponds, the communal reservoirs for harvested rainwater, also tend to be saline, some as high as 2 g/l. Drinking water salinity has several health impacts including high blood pressure associated major risk factor for several cardio-vascular diseases. Two representative drinking water ponds in Dacope Upazila of Khulna District in southwest Bangladesh were monitored over two years for rainfall, evaporation, pond and groundwater level, abstraction, and solute concentration, to better understand the controls on drinking water salinity. Water level monitoring at both ponds shows groundwater levels predominantly below the pond level throughout the year implying a downward gradient. The grain size analysis of the underlying sediments gives an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 3E-8 m/s allowing limited seepage loss. Water balance modelling indicates that the seepage has a relatively minor effect on the pond level and that the bulk of the losses come from the combination of evaporation and abstraction particularly in dry season when precipitation, the only inflow to the pond, is close to zero. Seasonal variation in salinity (electrical conductivities, EC, ranged between 1500 to 3000 µS/cm) has been observed, and are primarily due to dilution from rainfall and concentration from evaporation, except on one occasion when EC reached 16,000 µS/cm due to a breach in the pond levee. This event was analogous to the episodic inundation that occurs from tropical cyclone storm surges and appears to indicate that such events are important for explaining the widespread salinisation of surface water and shallow groundwater bodies in coastal areas. A variety of adaptations (either from practical protection measures) or novel alternative drinking sources (such as aquifer storage and recovery) can be applied in order to reduce health risks.",

Data from a network of autonomous sea ice mass balance ice buoys, installed in the drifting ice cover, provide key insights into the forces driving this decline. Measurements of sea ice temperature and mass balance are used to estimate the ocean heat flux and the net surface heat budget. Ice mass balance observations collected in the Western Arctic from 2000 to 2015 show spatial and temporal variability in the fluxes. Ocean heat fluxes tend to be near zero for much of the winter, increasing in the summer. The summer ocean heat flux is typically tens of W m-2, however it can exceed 100 W m-2 in areas of low ice concentration due to solar heating of the upper ocean. Mass balance observations also indicate that the net surface heat budget is negative throughout much of the year and positive for a few months in summer. These observationally-derived ocean and net surface flux estimates provide an important check on reanalysis products and an evaluation tool for predictive models.",

In this work, we develop and test a relatively low-cost strategy for watershed-scale mapping distributed GW-SW discharges for nitrate (NO3-) in a gaining lowland river. We employ ambient GW specific conductance (SC) and nitrate as tracers using a high-resolution longitudinal synoptic sensing along the lower Merced River (38 river km) in Central California. Using available GW SC, we first calibrate a simple distributed GW-SW discharge model (segment-by-segment mixing model) at 1-km resolution for 13 synoptic sampling events at upstream daily flows ranging from 1.3 to 31.6 m3s-1. We then apply the distributed discharge estimates to a similar distributed nitrate loading model, adding a first-order decay term representing shallow aquifer denitrification along the GW-SW flow path. Best-fitting model outcomes (RMSE = 0.06-0.98 mg L-1) were found when we censored GW nitrate data following below detection thresholds (typically 0.5 mg L-1 NO3-N). The range of reach-estimated dimensionless denitrification rate terms varied from 0 to 0.432, which is slightly lower than previous regional results (0.17-1.06), accounting for our reach travel time.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, it has been well established that in the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet, surface melt water makes its way to the bed and seasonally modulates ice-flow speed. With a conventional sliding law, the basal shear stress is proportional to the nonlinear product of the sliding speed and the effective pressure (difference between ice overburden and water pressure). Thus, when seasonal surface melting raises subglacial water pressure, it lowers the effective pressure, requiring additional sliding to restore the basal shear stress to maintain an overall force balance. This variation need not be uniform, however, and the basal hydrological system may produce variability at different spatial scales. To examine variability at scales of a few ice thicknesses, we use control-method inverse techniques to determine the basal shear stress using a shallow-shelf, ice-flow model constrained by speckle-tracked velocities measured over 11 and 22-day intervals.\nWe begin by determining a reference basal shear stress estimated for a typical winter velocity field (typically over a 30-by-50 km region). We then determine the corresponding estimates for the region during periods of enhanced summer flow. In general, we find that relative to the winter data, summer basal shear stress tends to increase in areas of steep surface slope (high driving stress) and decrease, despite elevated speeds, in low slope regions, which often correspond to the basins where supraglacial lakes form. Computing the ratio of summer to winter effective pressure indicates little seasonal change in effective pressure for areas of high basal shear stress and a summer decrease in low-slope regions. This pattern is consistent with surface and bed slopes that drive water away from areas of high slopes and stress concentration (e.g., where ice flows over bedrock bumps) toward weak, low-slope regions of the bed. The net result is that, during the summer delivery of water to the bed, basal shear stresses are re-distributed from weaker to stronger areas of the bed.",

Just 20 years ago this river flowed freely. Today some 30 large dams exist in the basin, and over 100 more are being planned for construction. These dams will alter the river’s natural water, sediment and nutrient flows, thereby impacting river morphology and ecosystems, and will fragment fish migration pathways. In doing so, they will degrade one of the world's most valuable and productive freshwater fish habitats. For those dams that have not yet been constructed, there still exist opportunities to modify their siting, design and operation (SDO) to potentially achieve a more balanced set of tradeoffs among hydropower production, sediment/nutrient passage and fish passage. We introduce examples of such alternative SDO opportunities for Sambor Dam in Cambodia, planned to be constructed on the main stem of the Mekong River. To evaluate the performance of such alternatives, we developed a Python-based simulation tool called PySedSim. PySedSim is a daily time step mass balance model that identifies the relative tradeoffs among hydropower production, and flow and sediment regime alteration, associated with reservoir sediment management techniques such as flushing, sluicing, bypassing, density current venting and dredging. To date, there has been a very limited acknowledgement or evaluation of the significant uncertainties that impact the evaluation of SDO alternatives. This research is formalizing a model diagnostic assessment of the key assumptions and parametric uncertainties that strongly influence PySedSim SDO evaluations. Using stochastic hydrology and sediment load data, our diagnostic assessment evaluates and compares several Sambor Dam alternatives using several performance measures related to energy production, sediment trapping and regime alteration, and fish passage. We show that performance of the alternatives can be highly variable, and conduct a simultaneous multi-parameter factor screening sensitivity analysis to identify the subset of PySedSim model parameters that contribute most significantly to performance uncertainties in attempts to identify the more robust options.",

This asymmetry is evident in the spatial occurrence of both reconnection- driven transients and of the reconnection site itself. From a number of studies that investigated the cause of this asymmetry, there are two main, opposing explanations: ‘global’ and ‘local’. The ‘global’ explanation is that asymmetric ionospheric conductance is the cause. The ‘local’ explanation points to the asymmetric thinning of the plasma sheet as the cause of the asymmetry. A number of observational studies have identified the effects of the ‘local’ and ‘global’ controls of the properties of the non-reconnecting magnetotail current sheet. In this study, we analyze the properties of the reconnecting current sheet (in the vicinity of an active reconnection site) using in situ data from Geotail and Cluster encounters with the reconnection site. Our method is specific to the geometry of the current sheet crossing for either Geotail or Cluster. For all of our observations, we approximate the current sheet with the Harris model. For Cluster data, we use a modified curlometer technique to analyze the strength and profile of the ion-scale current. For Geotail data, our analysis technique depends on whether the encounter with the reconnection site was driven by the motion of the current sheet or the motion of the spacecraft. We compare the properties of the current sheet for reconnection observations near the dawn and dusk flanks (infrequent) with those for reconnection observations on the near-midnight duskside (more frequent). Initial results are presented.",

Mobilized fluids migrate to the seafloor where they are emitted into the water column changing ocean chemistry and fuelling chemosynthetic ecosystems. New seismic and geochemical data from the northern rift arm of the Guaymas Basin document the variety of fluid expulsion phenomena from large-scale subsurface sediment mobilization related to contact metamorphosis to focused small-scale structures. The geochemical composition of emitted fluids depends largely on the age of the fluid escape structures with respect to the underlying intrusions. Whereas, old structures are dominated by methane emission, young vent sites are characterized by hot fluids that carry a wide range of minerals in solution. The overall high geothermal gradient within the basin (mainly between 160 and 260 °C/km) leads to a thin gas hydrate stability zone. Thus, deep hydrothermal fluid advection affects the gas hydrate system and makes it more dynamic than in colder sedimentary basins.",

While the graphical map forecasts of the NMME are informative, there is a need to provide decision-makers with probabilistic forecasts specific to their region of interest. Here, we demonstrate the potential application of the NMME to address regional climate projection needs by developing new forecasts of temperature and precipitation for the North American Great Lakes, the largest system of lakes on Earth. Regional opertional water budget forecasts rely on these outlooks to initiate monthly forecasts not only of the water budget, but of monthly lake water levels as well. More specifically, we present an alternative for improving existing operational protocols that currently involve a relatively time-consuming and subjective procedure based on interpreting the maps of the NMME. In addition, all forecasts are currently presented in the NMME in a probabilistic format, with equal weighting given to each member of the ensemble. In our new evolution of this product, we provide historical context for the forecasts by superimposing them (in an on-line graphical user interface) with the historical range of observations. Implementation of this new tool has already led to noticeable advantages in regional water budget forecasting, and has the potential to be transferred to other regional decision-making authorities as well.",

Evaluation of potentially inaccurate measurements (i.e., outliers) poses particularly difficult challenges in extensive air quality datasets with multiple measurements distributed in time and space. This study investigated the identification and impact of outliers in measurements of NO­2, BTEX, PM2.5, and PM10 in the contiguous Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada international airshed. Measurements were taken at 100 locations during September 2008 and June 2009 and modeled at a 300m by 300m scale resolution. The objective was to determine if outliers were present and, if so, to quantify the magnitude of their impact on modeled spatial pollution distributions. The study built upon previous investigations by the Geospatial Determinants of Health Outcomes Consortium that examined relationships between air pollutant distributions and asthma exacerbations in the Detroit and Windsor airshed.\nFour independent approaches were initially employed to identify potential outliers: boxplots, variogram clouds, difference maps, and the Local Moran’s I statistic. Potential outliers were subsequently reevaluated for consistency among methods and individually assessed to select a final set of outliers. The impact of excluding individual outliers was subsequently determined by revising the spatially variable air pollution models and recalculating associations between air contaminant concentrations and asthma exacerbations in Detroit and Windsor in 2008. For the pollutants examined, revised associations revealed weaker correlations with spatial outliers removed. Nevertheless, the approach employed improves the model integrity by increasing our understanding of the spatial variability of air pollution in the built environment and providing additional insights into the association between acute asthma exacerbations and air pollution.",

            "abstract": "The main role of vertically propagating waves in the general circulation is to transfer pseudo momentum from the region of generation to the region of wave breaking. The most prominent examples in atmospheric dynamics are planetary Rossby waves forced in the troposphere, which drive a poleward residual circulation in the winter stratosphere, and mesoscale gravity waves with tropospheric origin, which drive a summer-to-winter-pole circulation in the mesopasue region. In addition, the role of energy deposition by gravity waves has long been recognized to contribute substantially to the energy budget above the stratopause. In atmospheric circulation models, gravity waves are usually parameterized. Their energy deposition can be computed along with the momentum deposition and the turbulent diffusivity associated with wave breaking. In particular, the energy deposition is expressed in terms of secondary moments of the parameterized waves. Therefore, one is tempted to assume that the energy deposition of waves that are resolved in circulation models, e.g., Rossby waves and thermal tides, is automatically taken into account. This assumption is, however, flawed. We show that the energy deposition by resolved waves corresponds to the shear production (frictional heating) of the subgrid-scale turbulence model by which these waves are damped. Computational results from an atmospheric circulation model with energetically consistent treatment of momentum diffusion and frictional heating show that the energy deposition of thermal tides is substantial above the mesopause. This effect is either incomplete or even ignored in conventional atmospheric models that resolve the mesopause region. An idealized sensitivity experiment furthermore shows that thermal tides lead to a significant downward shift of gravity-wave breaking in the upper mesosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Maipo river basin holds 40% of Chile’s total population and produces almost half of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. The basin is located in the semiarid and snowmelt dominated central region of the country and, aside from the typical pressures of growth in developing country basins, the Maipo river basin faces climate change impacts associated with a reduction in total runoff and changes in its seasonality. Surface water is the main water source for human settlements, natural ecosystems, and economic activities including agriculture, mining and hydropower production. In 2012 a research project, called MAPA (Maipo Plan de Adaptacion), began with the objective of articulating a climate variability and climate change adaptation plan for the Maipo river basin. The project engaged at the beginning a group of relevant water and land use stakeholders which allowed for a good representation of critical aspects of an adaptation plan such as the definition of objectives and performance indicators, future land use scenarios, modeling of the different components of the system and design of adaptation strategies. The presentation will highlight the main results of the research project with a special focus on the upper catchments of the basin. These results include the assessment of impacts associated with future climate and land use scenarios on key components of the hydrologic cycle including snowmelt and glacier contribution to runoff and subsequent impacts on water availability for the operation of hydropower facilities, satisfaction of instream (recreation and aquatic ecosystem) uses and provision of water for the city of Santiago (7 million people) and to irrigate more than 100,000 hectares of high value crops. The integrative approach followed in this project including different perspectives on the use of water in the basin provides a good opportunity to test the varying degree of impacts that could be associated with a given future scenario and also understand the challenges and opportunities that exist in the process of designing and implementing adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Although aerosols are only a fairly minor constituent of Earth's atmosphere they are able to affect its radiative energy balance significantly. Light detection and ranging (lidar) instruments have the potential to play a crucial role in atmospheric research as only these instruments provide information about aerosol properties at a high vertical resolution. We are exploring different algorithmic approaches to retrieve microphysical properties of aerosols using lidar. Almost two decades ago we started with inversion techniques based on Tikhonov's regularization that became a reference point for the improvement of retrieval capabilities of inversion algorithms. Recently we began examining the potential of the “arrange and average” scheme, which relies on a look-up table of optical and microphysical aerosol properties. The future combination of these two different inversion schemes may help us to improve the accuracy of the microphysical data products.\nThe novel arrange and average algorithm was applied to retrieve aerosol optical and microphysical parameters using NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) data. HSRL-2 is the first airborne HSRL system that is able to provide advanced datasets consisting of backscatter coefficients at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, and extinction coefficients at 355 and 532 nm as input information for aerosol microphysical retrievals. HSRL-2 was deployed on-board NASA LaRC's King Air aircraft during the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaigns over the California Central Valley and Houston. Vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties and size distributions were obtained from in-situ instruments on-board the NASA’s P-3B aircraft. As HSRL-2 flew along the same flight track of the P-3B, synergistic measurements and retrievals were obtained by these two independent platforms. We will present an intercomparison of the corresponding data products. The list of considered microphysical parameters traditionally includes the number, surface area and volume concentrations, and effective radius. For the first time we show complex refractive index and single-scattering albedo of aerosols observed with HSRL-2 during these campaigns.",

            "abstract": "The environment in which landmines are placed is oftentimes highly heterogeneous. These heterogeneities such as differences in soil type, packing and moisture, combined with changes in surface and climate conditions can oftentimes mask the presence of the mine. Understanding the impact of heterogeneity on heat and mass transfer behavior in the vicinity of landmines is paramount to properly identifying landmine locations for demining operations. This study investigates the impact of soil heterogeneity on soil moisture and temperature distributions around buried objects with the goal of increasing our ability to model and predict the environmental conditions that are most dynamic to mine detection performance. A ten-day field experiment was conducted in which two anti-personnel landmines at different depths and a limestone block of comparable size were buried. The site was instrumented with a series of sensors, monitoring atmospheric, surface and subsurface conditions to include measurements of soil moisture, soil and air temperature, relative humidity, vapor concentration, and meteorological conditions such as wind speed and net radiation. Infrared thermal imaging was used to provide continuous profiles of surface temperature conditions. The soil was well characterized in the laboratory to provide good understanding of field conditions for numerical modeling efforts. Experimental results demonstrate the strongest thermal contrast between shallow landmine emplacement and the surrounding soil occurring as the sun approaches its zenith and two hours after sunset until the sun directly impacts the soil above the landmine. A finite-element model of fluid flow and heat transport through porous media is compared against experimental observations, capturing the diurnal variation. A validated model, like this one, offers the opportunity to improve landmine detection probabilities and reduce false alarms caused by environmental variability.",

            "abstract": "Arctic atmospheric composition is strongly influenced by long-range transport from mid-latitudes as well as processes occurring in the Arctic locally. Using an on-line air quality prediction model GEM-MACH, simulations were carried out for the 2010 northern shipping season (April – October) over a regional Arctic domain. North American wildfire emissions and Arctic shipping emissions were represented, along with other anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Sensitivity studies were carried out to investigate the principal sources and processes affecting air quality in the Canadian Northern and Arctic regions.\nIn this paper, we present an analysis of sources, transport, and removal processes on the ambient concentrations and atmospheric loading of various pollutants with air quality and climate implications, such as, O3, NOx, SO2, CO, and aerosols (sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon components). Preliminary results from a model simulation of a recent summertime Arctic field campaign will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "We will discuss comparisons of collocated Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice cloud optical thickness (COT), effective radius (CER), and cloud thermodynamic phase retrievals. The ice cloud comparisons are stratified by retrieval uncertainty estimates, horizontal inhomogeneity at the pixel-scale, vertical cloud structure, and other key parameters. Although an estimated 27% globally of all AIRS pixels contain ice cloud, only 7% of them are spatially uniform ice according to MODIS. We find that the correlations of COT and CER between the two instruments are strong functions of horizontal cloud heterogeneity and vertical cloud structure. The best correlations are found in single-layer, horizontally homogeneous clouds over the low-latitude tropical oceans with biases and scatter that increase with scene complexity. While the COT comparisons are unbiased in homogeneous ice clouds, a bias of 5–10 microns remains in CER within the most homogeneous scenes identified. This behavior is entirely consistent with known sensitivity differences in the visible and infrared bands. We will use AIRS and MODIS ice cloud properties to evaluate ice hydrometeor output from climate model output, such as the CAM5, with comparisons sorted into different dynamical regimes. The results of the regime-dependent comparisons will be described and implications for model evaluation and future satellite observational needs will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The global distribution of water resources in general depends on geographic conditions but can be (virtually) modified by humans through mechanisms of globalization, such as trade, that make food commodities available to populations living far from the production regions. While trade is expected to improve access to food and (virtual) water, its impact on the global food system and its vulnerability to shocks remains poorly understood. It is also unclear who benefits from trade and whether it contributes to inequality and justice in resource redistribution. We reconstruct the global patterns of food trade and show with a simple model how the ongoing intensification of imports and exports has eroded the resilience of the global food system. Drawing on human rights theory, we investigate the relationship between inequality and injustice in access to water and food. We assess the fulfillment of positive and negative water and food rights and evaluate the obligations arising from the need to ensure that these rights are met throughout the world. We find that trade enhances the vulnerability to shocks but overall increase the number of people whose water and food rights are met.",

            "abstract": "The paucity of paleomagnetic records from the western South Atlantic Ocean presents a significant gap in our understanding of the spatial variations in geomagnetic field dynamics as they relate to the occurrence of geomagnetic excursions and changes in field strength. As such, high quality records from this region can help build upon Holocene observations and extend the geographic and temporal data coverage for spherical harmonic models. To that end, we present paleomagnetic directional (inclination) and strength (relative paleointensity) records from two cores from the Argentine Basin (RC11-49 and RC16-88). Although the cores were collected more than 40 years ago, the sediments appear to hold a stable remanence and reliable magnetic directions, as evidenced by their reproducibility between the two cores that are separated by ~25 km. The records show evidence of 4 excursional features in the uppermost 16-m of the sediments from the basin. A comparison of the relative paleointensity records from these cores to the South Atlantic Paleointensity Stack (SAPIS) (Stoner et al., 2002) and the relative paleointensity record from ODP Site 1089 (Stoner et al., 2003) indicate that the sediments reliably record relative changes in geomagnetic field intensity and suggests that the longest record (RC11-49) spans the last ~125 kyrs. Our results indicate that the sediments of the Argentine Basin are an important sedimentary archive of geomagnetic field behavior and strength at least through the Holocene and Late Pleistocene and highlight the need for further studies of cores within the basin.",

            "abstract": "Experimental studies were conducted using batch reactors, X-ray microtomography (XMT), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to determine changes in cement fracture surfaces, fluid flow pathways and permeability, and cement fracture propagation with geochemical and geomechanical processes. Portland cement-basalt interface sample with artificial fractures was prepared to study the geochemical and geomechanical effects on the integrity of wellbores containing defects caused by subsurface activities. Cement-basalt interface sample was subjected to mechanical stress at 2.7 MPa before the chemical reaction. CFD modeling was performed to simulate flow of supercritical CO2 within the fractures before and after the application of mechanical stress. The model results highlighted the complex flow characteristics within the fracture and also changes in flow patterns due to application of geomechanical stress. The CFD model predicted ~45% increase in permeability after the application of geomechanical force, which increases the fracture aperture. The same sample was reacted with CO2-saturated groundwater with impurity H2S (1 wt.%) at 50°C and 10 MPa for 3 to 3.5 months under static conditions. XMT provided three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of the opening and interconnection of cement fractures due to mechanical stress. Even after a 3.5-month reaction with CO2-H2S-saturated groundwater at 50°C and 10 MPa, CaCO3 (s) precipitation occurred more extensively within the cement fracture rather than along the cement-basalt interfaces. Micro X-ray diffraction analysis also showed that major cement carbonation products of CO2–saturated groundwater reacting with impurity H2S were calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, consistent with cement carbonation by pure CO2-saturated groundwater, while pyrite was not identified due to low H2S content. The experimental results imply that the wellbore cement with fractures is likely to be healed during exposure to CO2-saturated groundwater under static flow conditions, whereas fractures along the cement-caprock interface are likely to remain vulnerable to the leakage of CO2. The study suggests that geochemical and geomechanical processes have coupled effects on the wellbore cement fracture evolution and fluid flow along the fracture surfaces.",

            "abstract": "California’s ongoing drought condition shriveled not just the agricultural sector, but also the natural resources sector including forestry, wildlife, and fisheries. As future predictions of drought and fire severity become more real in California, there is an increased awareness to pursue innovative and cost-effective solutions that are based on silvicultural treatments and controlled burns to improve forest health and reduce the risk of high-severity wildfires. The main goal of this study is to develop a GIS map of the drought-impacted region of northern and central California using remote sensing data for the summer period of 2014. Specifically, Landsat/NAIP imagery will be analyzed using a combination of object-oriented classification and spectral indices such as the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI). This spectral index basically scales the line perpendicular to the soil line defined in the Red-NIR feature space in conjunction with added information about vegetative fraction derived using NDVI. The resulting output will be correlated with USGS-produced estimates of climatic water deficit (CWD) data to characterize the severity of the drought. The CWD is simulated based on hydrological tool, Basin Characterization Model (BCM) that ingests historical climate data in conjunction with soils, topography, and geological data to predict other monthly hydrological outputs including runoff, recharge, and snowpack. In addition to field data, data collected by state agencies including USFS, calforests.org will be used in the classification and accuracy assessment procedures. Visual assessment using high-resolution imagery such as NAIP will be used to further refine the spatial maps. The drought severity maps produced will greatly facilitate site-specific planning efforts aimed at implementing resource management decisions.",

            "abstract": "The behavior of heat flux (H) with respect to the stability parameter (ζ) in stable surface layer (SSL) is analyzed with in the framework of Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) theory. The analytical expressions of H are obtained as functions of wind speed (U) and wind shear (dU/dz) using the linear similarity functions and accordingly two cases, (i) U = δ (constant) and (ii) dU/dz = δ are considered. The mathematical analysis shows that the magnitude of H increases with ζ till it attains a maximum value at ζ =ζc and then starts decreasing with increasing stability suggesting the dual characteristic of heat flux with stability parameter. The point of maximum heat flux is found to be dependent on the roughness length (z0) as well as the height above the surface. An attempt has been made to analyze the sensitivity of this dual characteristic of H with ζ using the non-linear similarity functions. The analysis shows that the dual nature of H persists in the case of linear as well as non-linear similarity functions. However, the point of extremum appears to be dependent on the nature of the similarity functions. Turbulent data over a tropical site Ranchi (India) is analyzed to validate the observed nature of H with the theoretical nature as predicted by MOS. The analysis of observational data reveals the non-existence of any preferred stability state in SSL as speculated by Wang and Bras (2010, 2011) and supports the conclusions of Malhi 1995, Derbyshire 1999, van de Wiel et al. 2007, Basu et al. 2008, and van de Wiel et al. 2011. Thus, the non-uniqueness of MOS equations does not appear to be a mathematical artifact and it is consistent with the observations as far as the nature of heat flux with respect to stability parameter in SSL is concerned.",

Photochemical changes in organic materials occurring during investigations employing x-rays have been reported, particularly for biological samples examined in synchrotrons (e.g. George et al., J. Synchrotron Radiation, 19:875-876). However, little is known about the effect energies and fluxes typical to micro-XRF instruments may have on the organic molecules that are commonly preserved in rocks and sediments. In particular, it is essential to understand the effect of micro-XRF on organics preserved near surfaces that are later subjected to contact science that focuses on organic geochemistry (e.g. UV Raman/fluorescence instruments).\nWe report results of an investigation in which samples containing organic molecules were exposed to X-ray energies and fluxes typical to micro-XRF. Samples containing alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were characterized by GC-MS and UV Raman/fluorescence before being subjected to various X-ray energies and fluxes typical of PIXL. Following x-ray irradiation, samples were again characterized by GC-MS and UV Raman/fluorescence in order to characterize photochemical effects.",

            "abstract": "There are many, active Geoscience-related efforts around data support infrastructures, with an eye towards enabling improved access, usability, and sharing cross scientific disciplines. Beyond that and even beyond consistent and compatible interfaces between those data infrastructures and the software that relies on them, lies the challenge of sustainable and compatible software systems. There is a need to establish guidelines and mechanisms for collaboration and coordination around software interoperability within and between software communities. These software communities include multiple parties developing a full software stack: from operating systems and foundation infrastructure, to off-the-shelf vendor-supplied applications, to partner and community-developed codes, all the way to the end-user tools, used once or repeatedly. Expanding the scope of the challenge is the reality that users of these software stacks are no longer solely from the geoscience community; more and more research and industry disciplines and the general public are accessing and using data and tools previously contained to the geoscience arena. Finally, the increased focus on research transparency and reproducibility creates additional requirements that developers of software must design to, whether for desktop, mobile, cloud-based, or even instrument- and hardware-based software systems.\nThis talk will discuss the challenges involved in developing sustainable software within and across communities, including the various types of users and use cases that will need to be taken into account to build a successful model. In addition, the talk will outline requirements and potential solutions for addressing and achieving the level and consistency of coordination and quality required to support and sustain enduring software and effective software communities that use and support it.",

Of particular interest to MATERHORN-X-2 were synoptic dominated conditions in which synoptic flows interacted with the topography leading to external-flow generated lee and progressive waves and if the Froude number was low; development of eddies, large vortices, wakes and waves in the lee of Granite Mountain. To capture these phenomena, a suite of advanced instrumentation was used, which could characterize the upstream unmodified synoptic approach flow and identify the synoptic flow / mountain interactions. In addition to meteorological towers, three Doppler LiDARs, placed at two locations to the east and in the lee of Granite Mountain were particularly useful, showing the horizontal spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the synoptic generated phenomena.

            "abstract": "Societies rely on critical services such as power, water, transport networks and manufacturing. Infrastructure may be sited to minimise exposure to natural hazards but not all can be avoided. The probability of long-range transport of a volcanic plume to a site is comparable to other external hazards that must be considered to satisfy safety assessments. Recent advances in numerical models of plume dispersion and stochastic modelling provide a formalized and transparent approach to probabilistic assessment of hazard distribution. To understand the risks to critical infrastructure far from volcanic sources, it is necessary to quantify their vulnerability to different hazard stressors. However, infrastructure assets (e.g. power plantsand operational facilities) are typically complex systems in themselves, with interdependent components that may differ in susceptibility to hazard impact. Usually, such complexity means that risk either cannot be estimated formally or that unsatisfactory simplifying assumptions are prerequisite to building a tractable risk model. \nWe present a new approach to quantifying risk by bridging expertise of physical hazard modellers and infrastructure engineers. We use a joint expert judgment approach to determine hazard model inputs and constrain associated uncertainties. Model outputs are chosen on the basis of engineering or operational concerns. The procedure facilitates an interface between physical scientists, with expertise in volcanic hazards, and infrastructure engineers, with insight into vulnerability to hazards. The result is a joined-up approach to estimating risk from low-probability hazards to critical infrastructure. We describe our methodology and show preliminary results for vulnerability to volcanic hazards at a typical UK industrial facility. We discuss our findings in the context of developing bespoke assessment of hazards from distant sources in collaboration with key infrastructure stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster 2015.pdf\nThe discovery of pervasive year-round englacial meltwater in southeastern Greenland by Forster et. al (2012) in the form of a Perennial Firn Aquifer (PFA) with an estimated 140+/120 GT of water (pre-2011 melt season) has significantly changed the understanding of meltwater retention, energy balance models and Greenland hydrology. Prior to this, englacial meltwater was not considered a significant portion of the water budget in Greenland. The cryosphere and hydrology communities are currently observing and studying PFAs through data obtained from the NASA ICEBridge Program. Due to environmental and time constraints, data is limited to a few months each year beginning in 2010. This leaves a significant need to explore new methods of monitoring PFAs both throughout the year and across time in order to improve the understanding of PFA formation and hydrologic consequences. Both passive microwave and infrared radiation have been used to monitor surface melt via satellite remote sensing, are recorded regularly over Greenland, and are available from 1979. While infrared data are confined to the surface, microwaves have been noted to penetrate past the ice sheet surface and return a subsurface melt signal. A combination of microwave and infrared reflectance signals has the potential to identify subsurface meltwater distinct from surface melt throughout the year. This method of identifying englacial meltwater will be compared to recognized data sets, and correlated to meteorological requirements to determine accuracy. If this method proves effective, it could significantly extend the record of PFA location and physical and temporal extent so that hydrologic and climatic results can be better analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The use of sedimentary structures as indicators of flow and sediment morphodynamics in ancient sediments is essential for reconstruction of formative flow conditions generated in a wide range of grain sizes and sedimentary environments. Yet, the vast majority of past research has concerned bedforms generated in essentially cohesionless sediments that lack the presence of mud within the flow and within the sediment bed itself. However, most sedimentary environments possess fine-grained sediments, with recent work demonstrating how the presence of such fine sediment may substantially modify the fluid dynamics of such flows. It is thus increasingly evident that the influence of mud, and the presence of cohesive forces, is essential to permit a fuller interpretation and understanding of many modern and ancient sedimentary successions.\nIn this paper, we summarize on the fluid dynamics of turbulence modulation generated by the presence of fine suspended sediment, and use this knowledge to propose a new extended bedform phase diagram for bedforms generated in mixtures of sand and mud under rapidly decelerated flows. This diagram provides a phase space using the variables of yield strength and grain mobility as the abscissa and ordinate axes, respectively, and defines the stability fields of a range of bedforms generated under flows that have modified fluid dynamics due to the presence of suspended sediment within the flow. We also show data on a range of bedforms generated in such flows, from laboratory experiments and examples from ancient sediments, including: i) heterolithic stratification, comprising alternating laminae or layers of sand and mud; ii) the preservation of low amplitude bed-waves, large current ripples, and bed scours with intrascour composite bedforms; iii) low angle cross-lamination and long lenses and streaks of sand and mud formed by bed-waves; iv) complex stacking of reverse bedforms, mud layers and low-angle cross-lamination on the upstream face of bed scours; and v) planar bedding comprising stacked mud-sand couplets.",

            "abstract": "Librations identified in Cassinidata imply that Mimas either has a global ocean or an irregular core (Tajeddine et al., 2014). A global ocean is the only model consistent with Enceladus’ librations (Tajeddine et al., 2015). A global ocean can also explain gravity measurements of Enceladus as long as the overlying ice shell is thicker in the north pole than the south pole (McKinnon, 2015), although a regional sea is also possible (Iess et al., 2014). Generations of fractures at Enceladus’ south pole may indicate longitudinal migration of the ice shell, which would also require a global ocean (Patthoff and Kattenhorn, 2011). Because both Mimas and Enceladus have eccentric orbits (0.0196 and 0.0047, respectively) interior models that include oceans can generate much larger tidal stresses than models without oceans. However, the enhancement in tidal stress due to oceans creates complications for both moons.\nMimas’ surface is ancient and heavily cratered; only about 40 tectonic features have been identified, globally (Schenk, 2011). The lack of tidal-tectonic activity on Mimas implies that either it has not experienced large tidal stresses over its surface age or that its ice shell behaves quite differently than Europa. Enceladus has a young, heavily-fractured region at the south pole, and an old, heavily-cratered region at the north pole. Are global ocean models compatible with ongoing, tidal-tectonic activity at Enceladus’ south pole and the lack of activity on Mimas and at Enceladus’ north pole?\nWe consider whether global oceans are compatible with the geologic records of Mimas and Enceladus by calculating tidal stresses for 5-layer interior structure models. To explore the range of possible interior structures, we vary the ice shell thickness, the depth of the upper brittle ice layer, and the viscosities of the brittle and ductile ice layers. We find that a global ocean within Mimas generates tidal stresses comparable to those on Europa (~100 kPa) and in some cases much larger (>1 MPa), which is very difficult to reconcile with its lack of tectonic activity. We, thus, favor the interpretation that Mimas has an elongated core. For Enceladus, our preliminary analysis suggests that it is challenging to find global ocean models that would promote fracturing in the south pole while inhibiting fracturing in the north pole.",

            "abstract": "The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM) are a paradoxical tectonic feature as, despite their heavily dissected Alpine-type topography, they are located on Precambrian cratonic lithosphere. The GSM is significant because it is a key nucleation site for the development of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), ~34 Ma.\nPermian rifting and Cretaceous strike-slip faulting have been advanced as possible tectonic triggers for GSM uplift. However, more recent interpretations of detrital thermochronology data argue against major Cretaceous exhumation. This raises the question of whether Cenozoic erosion and the associated isostatic response were sufficient to drive a substantial part of the uplift of the GSM. To address this question, we have used new compilations of gravity and bedrock topography, together with spectral (free-air admittance and Bouguer coherence) models to estimate the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere (Te) and landscape evolution models to evaluate the effects of erosional unloading and flexural rebound. We find that, unusually for continents, the coherence between free-air gravity anomalies and bedrock topography in the GSM is high (>0.5) and that Te is anomalously low (15 - 25 km), in contrast to previously reported values of up to ~70 km. We also find that by calculating a peak accordance surface and then differencing it with the observed bedrock topography two fundamentally different styles of erosion: Alpine-style dendritic fluvial and glacial incision in the GSM and major EAIS outlet glacier-type erosion in the Lambert Rift (LR).\nUsing a variety of continuous elastic plate models for different Te scenarios, we have quantified the spatial distribution and magnitude of flexural uplift in both the GSM and LR. Although the pattern of peak uplift is affected by Te, the total amount of flexural uplift is not as sensitive. We estimate 500 m of uplift in the GSM and up to 1.2 km in the LR. The age of the uplift is not clear, but landscape evolution modeling based on low Te and long-term erosion rates suggest an age for the incision in the range 80-300 Ma.",

In particular, we examine the creation of graupel embryos, the Hallett-Mossop process, and the effect of entrainment on these processes. To characterize the evolution of cloud microphysical properties of maturing thunderstorms, the University of Wyoming King Air sampled the tops of fresh turrets between -15 and 0. Data sampled by the Cloud Droplet Probe, Cloud Imaging grayscale Probe (CIP-Grey) and 2D Precipitation Probe during four missions are examined. Here we characterize the variability of the cloud liquid and ice particle size distributions and liquid water contents (LWC) inside updraft cores, as a function of temperature, T, and vertical velocity, w.\nOn one of the days, the number concentration of particles with maximum dimension D > 300 µm, N>300, was less than 1 L-1, with very few ice hydrometeors observed. However, on the other missions, N>300 ranged from 1 L-1 to 250 L-1. The CIP-Grey detected liquid drops at T > -5 and a mixture of graupel and rimed columns at T < -5 for these missions, consistent with the warm rain process providing the frozen drops necessary to form graupel embryos that initiate secondary production. In general, LWC relative to adiabatic decreased from 0.75 to 0.2 with height and was lowest when N>300 > 1 L-1, consistent with precipitation growth by collision-coalescence and accretion. Finally, ice precipitation was primarily present at w < 7 m s-1 and greatest when w < 3 m s-1, suggesting that w influences the number of ice particles generated in the updraft cores sampled during COPE-MED.",

The main goal of the current study is to investigate the effects of the structural and geomechanical properties on the spall phenomena due to underground explosions and its subsequent effect on the seismo-acoustic signature at far distances. Two parametric studies have been undertaken to assess the impact of different 1) conceptual geological models including a single layer and two layers model, with and without joints and with and without varying geomechanical properties, and 2) depth of bursts of the explosions and explosion yields. Through these investigations we have explored not only the near-field response of the explosions but also the far-field responses of the seismic and the acoustic signatures. The near-field simulations were conducted using the Eulerian and Lagrangian codes, GEODYN and GEODYN -L, respectively, while the far-field seismic simulations were conducted using the elastic wave propagation code, WPP, and the acoustic response using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz-Rayleigh time-dependent approximation code, KHR. Though a series of simulations, we have recorded the velocity field histories a) at the ground surface on an acoustic-source-patch for the acoustic simulations, and 2) on a seismic-source-box for the seismic simulations. We first analyzed the SPE3 and SPE4-prime experimental data and simulated results, and then simulated SPE5, SPE6/7 to anticipate their seismo-acoustic responses given conditions of uncertainties. SPE experiments were conducted in a granitic formation; we have extended the parametric study to include other geological settings such dolomite and alluvial formations. These parametric studies enabled us 1) investigating the geotechnical and geophysical key parameters that impact the seismo-acoustic responses of underground explosions and 2) deciphering and ranking through a global sensitivity analysis the most important key parameters to be characterized on site in order to minimize uncertainties in prediction and discrimination.

            "abstract": "One of the most extensive surface deposits of carbonate on Mars is on the slopes of the Isidis Basin rising up to the Nili Fossae region (Ehlmann et al., 2008; Niles et al., 2012; Edwards and Ehlmann 2015). A key factor for the formation of carbonate in this region is the association of carbonate with olivine: this ubiquitous relationship shows the reactants and products are in direct association. There are four clear hypotheses for the geologic environment of formation. 1) Water-rock interaction in the shallow subsurface at slightly elevated temperatures altered olivine to Mg-carbonate perhaps through extended periods of heat and water with burial leading to olivine-serpentine-talc-chlorite alteration pathway (Brown et al., 2010; Viviano et al., 2013). 2) Olivine-rich material, heated by impact or volcanic processes, emplaced on top of a water-bearing phyllosilicate rich unit initiated hydrothermal alteration along the contact. 3) Olivine-rich rocks were weathered to carbonate at surface (cold) temperatures in a manner similar to olivine weathering of meteorites in Antarctica. 4) Carbonate precipitated from shallow ephemeral lakes. These hypotheses are quite different in their predictions of mineral assemblage, water requirements, and habitability. I will show new data and analyses that are providing insights to the question of the mineralogy and assemblages of carbonate-bearing units in the region, diagostic of processes. It is becoming more evident that surface aqueous activity, perhaps involving an extensive cryosphere in the form of Hesperian ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "Most of the Moon’s surface is covered by fine-grained regolith produced by impacts, but rocks of various sizes are also present. Rock abundances can be used to distinguish different surface units and quantify the ages of craters [1,2]. Furthermore, the size distribution of a population of rocks reflects the process by which they were formed and fragmented [3]. Knowing the distribution of rock sizes on the Moon can improve our understanding of regolith generation, evolution, and distribution, can be used to select landing sites, and can provide insight into the processes that have shaped the lunar surface.\nThe high thermal inertia of rocks compared to fine-grained regolith leads to multiple temperatures within the field of view of nighttime multispectral data returned from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner thermal radiometer. This data has been used to map the rock abundance across the lunar surface [1]. However, the derived rock abundance is not constant over the course of the lunar night; small rocks cool faster than large rocks and eventually become indistinguishable from regolith using Diviner data. Thus the detectable rock abundance will decrease over the course of the lunar night. Here we use this change in measured rock abundance with time to constrain the size distribution of rock fragments, and map its variation across the lunar surface. We will show results from this study and discuss the implications for the geologic processes shaping the lunar surface.\n[1] Bandfield J. L. et al. (2011) JGR, 116, E00H02. [2] Ghent R. R. et al.

These distributions will aid in the identification of key regions of the reconnecting plasma, such as the electron diffusion region and dipolarization fronts (DFs) in Earth’s magnetotail. Electron anisotropy and agyrotropy are particularly useful diagnostics for this purpose. Normally, anisotropy and agyrotropy are defined as properties of the total pressure tensor. However, such global velocity-space measures of the electron distribution can hide detailed energy-dependent variations. Using electron distributions from 2D and 3D PIC simulations of tail reconnection, we employ a combination of 3D velocity-space visualization techniques and energy-dependent anisotropy and agyrotropy measures to analyze the distributions from regions in the vicinity of the reconnection x-line, the magnetic separatricies, and DFs. For example, regions of the reconnection exhaust near a DF can exhibit a nearly isotropic pressure tensor due to the competing influences of low-energy electrons, which contribute disproportionately to the parallel pressure, and high-energy electron, which contribute disproportionately to the perpendicular pressure.",

To address this, we have performed a detailed structural interpretation of 2D time-migrated multichannel seismic lines shot as part of the Cascadia Open Source Seismic Transect (COAST) offshore Grays Harbor, Washington. Objectives of this study are to document (1) the relative timing of major thrusts and attendant super-wedge sedimentation, (2) the geometry of faulting, particularly the basal decollement and evidence, if any, for underthrust sediments, and (3) the porosity distribution based on interval velocity, all of which bear on stress state and therefore likelihood of large coseismic slip. Key features of the central Cascadia accretionary margin are a thick incoming sediment section, a shallowly dipping lower plate, an extremely low overall wedge taper angle, landward vergent faults in the outer wedge, and substantial sedimentation on the growing wedge. Relative timing of fault activity, revealed by detailed interpretation of deformation of slope basins, indicates out-of-sequence faulting in the outer wedge, with the majority of recent motion along faults in the central portion of the wedge. In the lower-slope terrace, relatively undisturbed basin sediments overly structures that appear to be landward vergent thrust sheets that are less developed than their outer-wedge counterparts. The deformation of lower packages of overlying sediment show that these inactive thrust sheets, which have incoherent internal reflections, may show evidence for (partial) diapiric intrusion. Velocity models and structural and sedimentary history as interpreted from 2D seismic sections are used to calculate porosity through the wedge down to the subducting oceanic crust. These calculated porosities are used to estimate the effective stress within the wedge and at depth to shed light on the stress-state in the Cascadia margin.",

The most intensive radiosonde measurements have a temporal resolution too coarse to detect the full diurnal variability of the PBL, but remote sensing such as lidar can fill in the gaps.\nUsing a method that combines two common PBL detection algorithms (wavelet covariance and iterative curve-fitting) PBL depth retrievals from micropulse lidar (MPL) at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site are compared to MPL-derived PBL depths from a multiyear lidar deployment at the Hefei Radiation Observatory (HeRO). With aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from both sites, it can be shown that a weak inverse relationship exists between AOD and daytime PBL depth. This relationship is stronger at the more polluted HeRO site than at SGP.\nFigure: Mean daily AOD vs. mean daily PBL depth, with the Nadaraya-Watson estimator overlaid on the kernel density estimate.

            "abstract": "Litter decomposition is one of the most studied ecosystem processes, given its role in carbon cycling and nutrient availability, yet our knowledge of how decomposition is influenced by novel species assemblages in tropical forests emerging on post-agricultural landscapes is limited. This is especially true in tropical dry forests, which are some of the most fragmented forests worldwide due to human pressures and sensitive to changes in rainfall and fire regimes. Here we tested for the effects of litter quality, site conditions, and microbial “home-field advantage” on decomposition rates in subtropical dry forests in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We conducted a 22-month in situ and reciprocal transplant field decomposition experiment of aboveground litter and fine roots in 10-year old sites dominated by an early successional N-fixing tree and 40-year old mixed-species secondary forests. Total annual litterfall mass did not differ between the two forest types, but monthly amounts did, with more litter accumulating in the 40-year old secondary forests during the dry season and in the 10-year old secondary forests during the wet season. Litter chemistry differed between the two forest types and showed divergent patterns over the two-year field incubation. To test for the effects of litter quality on decomposition rates, we compared mass loss rates for aboveground and root litter from each forest decomposed in situ and transplanted to the other forest type. Litter in the 10-year old forests decomposed faster in situ (k= 1.07 ± 0.04) than when it was transplanted (k=0.86 ± 0.04). Litter from the 40-year old forests showed the opposite pattern. In situ root decomposition in both forests occurred at the same rate compared to roots that were transplanted there from the other forest type, suggesting that site conditions were equally important as litter quality. Our results were not consistent with a microbial home-field advantage for litter and root decomposition, that is, microbes were not more efficient at decomposing their own native litter, regardless of chemistry. Rather, decomposition patterns may be largely controlled by litter quality (and the combined effects of litter quality and site conditions specifically for roots) in contrast to the decomposer community in these subtropical dry forests.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is warming much faster than any other place in the world and undergoes a rapid change dominated by a changing climate in this region. The impact of polluted air masses traveling to the Arctic from various remote sources significantly contributes to the observed climate change, in contrast there are additional local emission sources contributing to the level of pollutants (trace gases and aerosol). Processes affecting the emission and transport of these pollutants are not well understood and need to be further investigated.\nWe present aircraft based trace gas measurements in the Arctic during RACEPAC (2014) and NETCARE (2014 and 2015) with the Polar 6 aircraft of Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) covering an area from 134°W to 17°W and 68°N to 83°N. We focus on cloud, aerosol and general transport processes of polluted air masses into the high Arctic.\nBased on CO and CO2 measurements and kinematic 10-day back trajectories we analyze the transport regimes prevalent during spring (RACEPAC 2014 and NETCARE 2015) and summer (NETCARE 2014) in the observed region. Whereas the eastern part of the Canadian Arctic is affected by air masses with their origin in Asia, in the central and western parts of the Canadian and European Arctic air masses from North America are predominant at the time of the measurement. In general the more northern parts of the Arctic were relatively unaffected by pollution from mid-latitudes since air masses mostly travel within the polar dome, being quite isolated. Associated mixing ratios of CO and CO2 fit into the seasonal cycle observed at NOAA ground stations throughout the Arctic, but show a more mid-latitudinal characteristic at higher altitudes. The transition is remarkably sharp and allows for a chemical definition of the polar dome. At low altitudes, synoptic disturbances transport polluted air masses from mid-latitudes into regions of the polar dome. These air masses contribute to the Arctic pollution background, but also contain single pollution plumes that perturb the background tracer distribution. These plumes could be traced back to biomass burning or flaring in remote regions, as well as local ship emissions within the measurement region.",

            "abstract": "Wahlund et al. [1992] first categorized the upflow of ionospheric ions into two types: that driven by ion frictional heating and that caused by auroral precipitation. Motivated by rocket observations showing a variety of different ionospheric responses to precipitation, this paper explores the influence of the background ionospheric density on upflow resulting from auroral precipitation. Simulations of upflow driven by auroral precipitation were conducted using a version of the Varney et al. [2014] model driven by precipitation characterized by observations made during the 2012 Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Alfvén resonator (MICA) rocket mission and using a variety of different initial electron density profiles. The simulation results show that increased initial density before the onset of precipitation leads to smaller electron temperature increases, longer ionospheric heating timescales, weaker ambipolar electric fields, lower upflow speeds, longer upflow timescales, but larger upflow fluxes. The upflow flux can increase even when the ambipolar electric field strength decreases due to the larger number of ions that are accelerated. Long-term observations from the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Svalbard radar taken during the International Polar Year (IPY) support the effects seen in the simulations. This correlation between ionospheric density and ion upflows emphasizes the important role of photoionization from solar ultraviolet radiation, which the EISCAT observations show can increase ionospheric density by as much as an order of magnitude during the summer months.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Lackey_2015_AGU_Poster.pdf\nRegulations in the state of Colorado mandate that all oil and gas wells be constructed with surface casings that extend 50 feet below the depth of the deepest potable aquifer, and production casings that are cemented to at least 200 feet above the shallowest producing formation. Building wells in accordance with the minimum regulations leaves an uncemented annulus between the production casing and the surrounding rock matrix, extending from the bottom of the surface casing to the top of the production casing cement. In Colorado, this annulus is sealed at the ground surface by the “bradenhead valve”. Stray methane can enter the uncemented annulus through faulty cement in the producing formation or an intermediate gas-bearing zone and migrate upwards along the production casing. The gas dissolves into the annular fluid and accumulates below the bradenhead valve building pressure. Data from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) indicates that 1,492 wells in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin have recorded bradenhead pressures greater than 20 psi since 2007. A leak of this kind creates the potential for both the single-phase transport of dissolved methane and the multiphase transport of methane gas away from the well. The degree to which methane transport occurs depends not only on the size of the leak but also the construction of the wellbore. In Colorado, the definition of potable groundwater has changed with time. To meet increasing demands for water, drinking water wells have been drilled deeper. As a result, there are potentially 4,144 wells in the DJ Basin with surface casings too shallow to protect the deepest potable aquifer. In this work, we investigate how a methane leak into the open annulus of an oil and gas wellbore, could result in the transport of dissolved and gas phase methane into a nearby drinking water aquifer. We construct a multiphase wellbore model that computes the pressure distribution and gas fraction along the uncemented annulus of an oil and gas well during a methane leak. The results of the wellbore simulation are used as a boundary condition for a three-dimensional multiphase flow simulation of methane transport away from the annulus of a well. Data from the COGCC database are used to constrain the simulations and construct scenarios representative of the DJ Basin.",

            "abstract": "Marine sediments cover more than two-thirds of the Earth’s surface and represent a major part of the deep biosphere. Microbial cells and microbial activity appear to be widespread in these sediments. Recently, we reported the isolation of gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming piezophilic bacteria and detection of bacterial endospores in marine subsurface sediment from the Shimokita coalbed, Japan. However, the modern molecular microbiological methods (e.g., DNA-based microbial detection techniques) cannot detect bacterial endospore, because endospores are impermeable and are not stained by fluorescence DNA dyes or by ribosomal RNA staining techniques such as catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, the total microbial cell abundance in the deep biosphere may has been globally underestimated. This emphasizes the need for a new cultivation independent approach for the quantification of bacterial endospores in the deep subsurface.\nDipicolinic acid (DPA, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) is a universal and specific component of bacterial endospores, representing 5–15wt% of the dry spore, and therefore is a useful indicator and quantifier of bacterial endospores and permits to estimate total spore numbers in the subsurface biosphere. We developed a sensitive analytical method to quantify DPA content in environmental samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The method is sensitive and more convenient in use than other traditional methods. We applied this method to analyzing sediment samples from the South China Sea (obtained from IODP Exp. 349) to determine the abundance of spore-forming bacteria in the deep marine subsurface sediment. Our results suggest that gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria may be the “unseen majority” in the deep biosphere.",

So far only a small fraction of the obtained spectra have been processed because the steps in processing the spectra require human manipulation. We developed an automatic processing pipeline for CDA mass spectra which will consistently analyze this data. The preprocessing steps are to de-noise the spectra, determine and remove the baseline, calculate the correct stretch parameter, and finally to identify elements and compounds in the spectra. With the E ring constantly evolving due to embedded active moons, this data will provide valuable information about the source of the E ring, the subsurface of Saturn’s ice moon Enceladus, as well as about the dynamics of the ring itself.",

            "abstract": "Fragmentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many natural and engineering systems. It is the process by which an initially competent medium, solid or liquid, is broken up into a population of constituents. Examples occur in collisions and impacts of asteroids/meteorites, explosion driven fragmentation of munitions on a battlefield, as well as of magma in a volcanic conduit causing explosive volcanic eruptions and break-up of liquid drops. Besides the mechanism of fragmentation the resulting frequency-size distribution of the generated constituents is of central interest. Initially their distributions were fitted empirically using lognormal, Rosin-Rammler and Weibull distributions (e.g. Brown & Wohletz 1995). The sequential fragmentation theory (Brown 1989, Wohletz at al. 1989, Wohletz & Brown 1995) and the application of fractal theory to fragmentation products (Turcotte 1986, Perfect 1997, Perugini & Kueppers 2012) attempt to overcome this shortcoming by providing a more physical basis for the applied distribution. Both rely on an at least partially scale-invariant and thus self-similar random fragmentation process.\nHere we provide a stochastic model for the evolution of grain size distribution during the explosion process. Our model is based on laboratory experiments in which volcanic rock samples explode naturally when rapidly depressurized from initial pressures of several MPa to ambient conditions. The physics governing this fragmentation process has been successfully modelled and the observed fragmentation pattern could be numerically reproduced (Fowler et al. 2010). The fragmentation of these natural rocks leads to grain size distributions which vary depending on the experimental starting conditions. Our model provides a theoretical description of these different grain size distributions. Our model combines a sequential model of the type outlined by Turcotte (1986), but generalized to cater for the explosive process appropriate here, in particular by including in the description of the fracturing events in which the rock fragments, with a recipe for the production of fines, as observed in the experiments. To our knowledge, this implementation of a deterministic fracturing process into a stochastic (sequential) model is unique, further it provides the model with some forecasting power.",

Golestan National Park, is the first national park in Iran which is registered in the list of UNESCO World Heritage as one of the 50 Earth ecological reserves. In 2014, a number of fire occurred in this park. In this study, attempt to monitor Angstrom and Nestrov indexes in order to forecast future fire in the study area. For this purpose, Atmosphere General Circulation model data; Miroc4h, in 0.562*0.562 scale in CIMP5, are used for fire occurred during 4 days in this area. Calculations show that these indicators provide suitable results in fire forecasting, generally. Angstrom index, decreases to 1 or lower almost in 3 fire, in the starting day or one day before; while critical index values is lower than 2. In recent days before first fire, Nestrov index increases above 10000, which is the critical value. It also increases to 25000 during the other fires. Nestrov index increases during the happening of 4 fire without any decrease. The results show that Angstrom index can forecast the day of starting fires better than Nestrov. Conclusively, the results showed that outputs of CIMP5 can be used in forecasting fire, well. It seems that the value index better not to be dependent on daily precipitation but on consecutive and continues precipitations during serial days.",

            "abstract": "As fresh bedrock is exhumed into the Critical Zone and intersects with water and life, rock attributes controlling geochemical reactions, hydrologic routing, accommodation space for roots, surface area, and the mobile fraction of regolith are set not just by present-day processes, but are predicated on the ‘ghosts’ of past processes embedded in the subsurface architecture. Easily observable modern ecosystem processes such as tree throw can erase the past and bias our interpretation of landscape evolution. Abundant paleoenvironmental records demonstrate that unglaciated regions experienced profound climate changes through the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but studies quantifying how environmental variables affect erosion and weathering rates in these settings often marginalize or even forego consideration of the role of past climate regimes. Here we combine seven downscaled Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) paleoclimate reconstructions with a state of the art frost cracking model to explore frost weathering potential across the North American continent 21 ka. We analyze existing evidence of LGM periglacial processes and features to better constrain frost weathering model predictions.  All seven models predict frost cracking across a large swath to the west of the Continental Divide, with the southernmost extent at ~ latitude 35° N, and increasing latitude towards the buffering influence of the Pacific Ocean. All models predict significant frost cracking in the unglaciated Rocky Mountains. To the east of the Continental Divide, models results diverge more, but all predict regions with LGM temperatures too cold for significant frost cracking (mean annual temperatures < 15 °C), corroborated by observations of permafrost relics such as ice wedges in some areas. Our results provide a framework for coupling paleoclimate reconstructions with a predictive frost weathering model, and importantly, suggest that modeling modern Critical Zone process evolution may require a consideration of vastly different processes when rock was first exhumed into the Critical Zone reactor.",

            "abstract": "The Chaman fault system is a transcurrent fault system developed due to the oblique convergence of the India and Eurasia plates in the western boundary of the India plate. To evaluate the contemporary rates of strain accumulation along and across the Chaman Fault system, we use 2003-2011 Envisat SAR imagery and InSAR time-series methods to obtain a ground velocity field in radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. We correct the InSAR data for different sources of systematic biases including the phase unwrapping errors, local oscillator drift, topographic residuals and stratified tropospheric delay and evaluate the uncertainty due to the residual delay using time-series of MODIS observations of precipitable water vapor. The InSAR velocity field and modeling demonstrates the distribution of deformation across the Chaman fault system. In the central Chaman fault system, the InSAR velocity shows clear strain localization on the Chaman and Ghazaband faults and modeling suggests a total slip rate of ~24 mm/yr distributed on the two faults with rates of 8 and 16 mm/yr, respectively corresponding to the 80% of the total ~3 cm/yr plate motion between India and Eurasia at these latitudes and consistent with the kinematic models which have predicted a slip rate of ~17-24 mm/yr for the Chaman Fault. In the northern Chaman fault system (north of 30.5N), ~6 mm/yr of the relative plate motion is accommodated across Chaman fault. North of 30.5 N where the topographic expression of the Ghazaband fault vanishes, its slip does not transfer to the Chaman fault but rather distributes among different faults in the Kirthar range and Sulaiman lobe. Observed surface creep on the southern Chaman fault between Nushki and north of City of Chaman, indicates that the fault is partially locked, consistent with the recorded M<7 earthquakes in last century on this segment. The Chaman fault between north of the City of Chaman to North of Kabul, does not show an increase in the rate of strain accumulation. However, lack of seismicity on this segment, presents a significant hazard on Kabul. The high rate of strain accumulation on the Ghazaband fault and lack of evidence for the rupture of the fault during the 1935 Quetta earthquake, present a growing earthquake hazard to the Balochistan and the populated areas such as the city of Quetta.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have helped develop the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of rock surfaces, as applied to the age of the famous Great Gallery rock art panel in Canyonlands National Park. Chapot et al. (2012) dated a key rock fall to ~900 yrs ago by applying OSL to the outer 1-mm buried surface of a sandstone talus boulder, an age confirmed by independent radiocarbon dating. Later, in a novel approach and with the use of a local known-age calibration sample, Sohbati et al. (2012) modelled the millimeter-scale OSL-depth profile to determine a pre-burial exposure duration of ~700 years for the same rock fall. This combination of rock-fall dating and exposure dating--an approach with broad potential to date Holocene mass movements--constrains the creation of the Great Gallery rock art to a time window of 900 to ~1600 years ago (Pederson et al., 2014), a result met with some controversy.\nHere we report on a new phase of research to verify these results and further refine OSL-profile exposure dating for mass movements. New analyses from within and near the Great Gallery alcove include: i) exposure dating of the same alcove surface upon which the rock art is painted with a predicted exposure age of ~1600 years; ii) exposure dating of the top (light-exposed) side of the same rock-fall boulder whose buried side was previously dated to test for reproduction of the known age; and iii) an improved calibration sample from a nearby trail/road-cut for verification. The residual OSL signal is measured with depth in millimeter-thick increments of all samples. We first determine the site-specific luminescence reduction rate at the rock surface by fitting the OSL surface-exposure dating model to the calibration profile from the trail/road-cut. This parameterized model then provides exposure ages for the bleaching profiles observed in the other samples. Results have implications for the application of OSL rock-surface and exposure-profile dating in other settings where quartz-rich rock is available. We discuss how the light-exposed top and buried underside of clasts can be used in tandem for calibration. The technique has particular relevance to younger timescales over which cosmogenic nuclides are of limited application.",

            "abstract": "Water resource system planning regulations are increasingly requiring potential plans to be robust, i.e., perform well over a wide range of possible future conditions. Robust Decision Making (RDM) has shown success in aiding the development of robust plans under conditions of ‘deep’ uncertainty. Under RDM, decision makers iteratively improve the robustness of a candidate plan (or plans) by quantifying its vulnerabilities to future uncertain inputs and proposing ameliorations. RDM requires planners to have an initial candidate plan. However, if the initial plan is far from robust, it may take several iterations before planners are satisfied with its performance across the wide range of conditions. Identifying an initial candidate plan is further complicated if many possible alternative plans exist and if performance is assessed against multiple conflicting criteria. Planners may benefit from considering a plan that already balances multiple performance criteria and provides some level of robustness before the first RDM iteration. In this study we use many-objective evolutionary optimization to identify promising plans before undertaking RDM. This is done for a very large regional planning problem spanning the service area of four major water utilities in East England. The five-objective optimization is performed under an ensemble of twelve uncertainty scenarios to ensure the Pareto-approximate plans exhibit an initial level of robustness. New supply interventions include two reservoirs, one aquifer recharge and recovery scheme, two transfers from an existing reservoir, five reuse and five desalination schemes. Each option can potentially supply multiple demands at varying capacities resulting in 38 unique decisions. Four candidate portfolios were selected using trade-off visualization with the involved utilities. The performance of these plans was compared under a wider range of possible scenarios. The most balanced plan was then submitted into the vulnerability analysis step of RDM. This strategy was shown to perform significantly better in all metrics at moderate costs as compared to the baseline strategy.",

            "abstract": "Planetary surfaces relax over time to a hydrostatic configuration at a rate governed by a body’s rheological properties. Because rheology is a strong function of composition and temperature, observations of a body’s relaxation state offers a means to probe its interior structure and thermal evolution. In the case of Ceres, such analysis potentially constrains the hydration state of the rocky core, the rock content of the ice-rich shell, and the abundance of heat-producing radionuclides.\nGround-based observations of Ceres suggested that the long-wavelength topography of Ceres has undergone significant relaxation, closely approaching hydrostatic equilibrium. Recent preliminary data from the Dawn spacecraft show that the topography of Ceres exhibits anomalously low power at the longest wavelengths (exceeding ~150 km; spherical harmonic degree n = 20; Fig. 1).\nUsing the deal.II finite element library, we model global scale (n < 40) viscoelastoplastic relaxation on Ceres to constrain the range of compositional and thermal structures consistent with the observed topography. Simulations assuming a 60 km thick pure ice layer overlying a rocky interior suggests that medium wavelength topography (10 ≤ n ≤ 40) relaxes efficiently over timescales of << 1 My, while relaxation at n ≤ 8 occurs only over much longer timescales as determined by the rheology of the deep interior (Fig. 1). The comparable degrees of relaxation observed on Ceres at all spherical harmonic degrees less than 20 therefore suggest that the rheological contrast between the shell and core is less extreme than that of pure ice and dry rock. Potential explanations include: (1) the presence of silicates and dissolved contaminants in the ice-rich shell and (2) high temperatures (e.g., >400˚C given a wet olivine rheology) in the deep interior during Ceres’s early evolution. Ongoing simulations will test the viability of these scenarios in reproducing the observed topography.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the corrosion of the base of the lithosphere by heat and water transport facilitated by infiltrating melt. The origin of the rapid drop in seismic velocity observed near the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in many locations across the globe is thought to arise from either melt accumulation or a transition from dry lithosphere to hydrated asthenosphere. However, these two hypotheses are difficult to decouple; water lowers the peridotite solidus and melt will transport water due to its incompatibility with the crystalline matrix. To investigate the chemical and thermal evolution of the LAB, we construct forward models of the two-phase system describing 1D mass, momentum and energy conservation in melt and solid phases, including volatile transport and using a water-dependent solidus. In addition to 1D models, 2D models are used to investigate how both geometric and dynamic pressure-driven melt focusing may influence LAB topography. Using relationships between thermodynamic variables and elastic properties we predict seismic velocities and attenuation measurements that are compared directly to EarthScope measurements in the western U.S.. In addition to geophysical observations, the evolution of water content and accumulation zone depth are compared to observed equilibration depth and water contents of magmas from localities in the Basin and Range and the western margin of the Colorado Plateau. Preliminary modeling results in 1D show that in an open system where solid material upwells continuously beneath the LAB, water concentration in the melt increases at the upper boundary of the partially molten zone where crystallization occurs. This leads to a potential feedback wherein the increasing water content locally hydrates the base of the lithosphere, lowering its solidus, and generating melt that can migrate to shallower depths.",

            "abstract": "THEMIS observations analyzed by E. V. Panov and collaborators have shown that, when an earthward-moving plasma-sheet flow burst encounters the quasi-dipolar region of the magnetosphere, the plasma that formed the burst often oscillates a few times before coming to rest. The observed oscillation periods seem in good agreement with the frequency calculated theoretically for a thin filament oscillating in the same region. However, since a thin filament is an extreme idealization of a real flow burst, we have investigated the relationship between thin-filament oscillations and the normal modes of a 2D plasma system that is analogous to the magnetosphere. We have developed an analytic model of the normal modes of an idealized plasma configuration that consists of a wedge with circular field lines. For that system, the low-frequency wave obeys a one-dimensional differential equation that is essentially the same as the equation describing buoyancy oscillations in the neutral atmosphere. An important term in the neutral-atmosphere equation is proportional to the square of ωb, which is called the \"buoyancy frequency\" or \"Brunt-Väisälä frequency\", and the corresponding quantity in the plasma equation is exactly the square of the fundamental oscillation frequency of a thin filament. In both cases, a buoyancy wave of frequency ω propagates in the region where ωb>ω, but is evanescent in the region where ωb<ω. A thin-filament code has been used to calculate the buoyancy frequency in different regions of the magnetosphere, as represented by a force-balanced configuration based on a Tsyganenko model. The results suggest that, if the braking of a bursty bulk flow produces an oscillation at the buoyancy frequency at about 10 RE, it may generate a buoyancy wave that can propagate earthward to the plasmapause.",

            "abstract": "In the past, boulder dislodgement by tsunami and storm waves has been approached with a simple threshold approach in which a boulder was moved if the sum of the acting forces on the boulder is larger than zero. The impulse theory taught us, however, that this criterion is not enough to explain particle dislodgement. We employ an adapted version of the Newton’s Second Law of Motion (NSLM) in order to consider the essence of the impulse theory which is that the sum of the forces has to exceed a certain threshold for a certain period of time.\nFurthermore, a classical assumption is to consider linear waves. However, when waves travel toward the shore, they alter due to non-linear processes. We employ the TRIADS model to quantify that change and how it impacts boulder dislodgement. We present our results of the coupled model (adapted NSLM and TRIADS model). The results project a more complex picture of boulder transport by storms and tsunami. The following question arises: What information do we actually invert, and what does it tell us about the causative event?",

Several possible origins of chemically-dense material have been proposed, including recycling of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), primordial differentiation events, crystallisation of a basal magma ocean, or some combination of these creating a basal melange (BAM; Tackley 2012 Earth Sci. Rev.). Each of these possibilities would result in a different composition hence different mineralogy. In order to constrain this we have been running calculations of thermo-chemical mantle evolution over 4.5 billion years that include melting-induced differentiation, plate tectonics induced by strongly temperature-dependent viscosity and plastic yielding, core cooling and compressibility with reasonable assumptions about the pressure-dependence of other material properties. Some of our simulations start from a magma ocean state so initial layering is developed self-consistently. Already-published results (Nakagawa et al., 2009 GCubed, 2010 PEPI, 2012 GCubed) already indicate the importance of exact MORB composition on the amount of MORB segregating above the CMB, which in turn influences mantle thermal structure and the evolution of the core and geodynamo. In more recent results we have been additionally including primordial material. We find that melting-induced differentiation has several first-order effects on the dynamics, including (i) making plate tectonics easier (through stresses associated with lateral variations in crustal thickness) and (ii) reducing heat flux through the CMB (due to the build-up of dense material above the CMB); also (iii) tectonic mode (continuous plate tectonics, episodic lid or stagnant lid) also makes a first-order difference to mantle structure and dynamics. This emphasises the importance of appropriate treatment of small-scale processes in global models.",

These relationships are well illustrated in the Rand Mountains, situated just south of the Garlock fault in the northwestern Mojave Desert. Here, accreted rocks within the Rand Mountains are referred to as Rand Schist. The Rand Detachment fault juxtaposes Rand Schist beneath 87 Ma Sierran granitoids. New zircon (U-Th)/He age results from schist and basement juxtaposed across the Rand Detachment fault are 15 ± 3 Ma and 30 ± 5 Ma, respectively. When considered within the context of previously reported thermochronology from the Rand Mountains, our data shows that the Rand Detachment fault in the Rand Mountains is a middle Miocene fault that facilitated extension of the northwest Mojave Desert. This timing is in temporal and spatial agreement with regional extension throughout the Mojave triggered by northern migration of the slab window after collision of the Mendocino Triple Junction with the southern California margin. Further evidence of slab-window-related magmatism in the easternmost Rand Mountains is provided by the 19 Ma Yellow Aster pluton and 19 Ma rhyolite porphyry. It is possible that Miocene extension re-activated an older structure within the Rand Mountains. For example, a similar low-angle fault juxtaposing schist and basement present in the San Emigdio Mountains is believed to have accommodated large scale Late Cretaceous displacement, exhuming Rand Schist and overlying deepest Sierran basement to shallow crustal levels by 77 Ma [1]. However, 68-72 Ma phengite cooling ages and other thermochronology from the Rand Mountains indicates that any pre-Miocene extension in this area must postdate that in the San Emigdio Mountains.\n[1] Chapman et al., 2012.

Here we present preliminary findings from a new gravity survey which aims at i) creating a high precision Bouguer anomaly map of Solfatara and ii) imaging the hydrothermal plume. We carried out a high spatial density gravity survey of Solfatara and the surrounding area using a Scintrex CG5 gravimeter and simultaneous benchmark localisation using a GNSS system. We created a dense grid of 51 stations within Solfatara crater, and a reduced density network of 37 further stations outside the crater to 3km distance. Other geophysical techniques such as electromagnetism, electrical resistivity, and active seismic imaging have resolved the subsurface architecture to depths between a few hundred meters to 3km depth. Our coverage and spacing should capture the details of the plume under Solfatara and have resolution to approximately 3km depth.",

            "abstract": "The formation of a large sinkhole at the Napoleonville salt dome, Assumption Parish, Louisiana, in August 2012 was accompanied by a rich sequence of complex seismic events, including long-period (LP) events that were recorded 11 km away at Transportable Array station 544A in White Castle, Louisiana. The LP events have relatively little energy at short periods, which make them difficult to detect using standard high-frequency power detectors, and the majority of energy that reaches the station is peaked near 0.4 Hz. The analysis of the local records reveals that the onset of the 0.4 Hz signals coincides with the S-wave arrival, and therefore it may be a shaking induced resonance in a fluid filled cavern. We created a low-frequency (0.1-0.6 Hz) power detector (short-term average / long-term average) that operated on all three components of the broadband instrument, since considerable energy was detected on the horizontal components. The detections from the power detector were then used as templates in three-channel correlation detectors thereby increasing the number of detections by a little more than a factor of two to nearly 3000. The rate of LP events is approximately one event every other day at the beginning of recording in March 2011. Around 2 May 2012 the rate changes to approximately 7 events per day and then increases to 25 events per day at the beginning of July 2012. Finally, in the days leading up to the sinkhole formation there are approximately 200 LP events per day. The analysis of these events could aid in the development of local seismic monitoring methods for underground industrial storage caverns. Prepared by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

This project is part of a comprehensive, exploration geophysical study in a deep, highly stressed mine located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Data from in situ monitoring of the mining induced seismicity, conductivity, and stress dependent physical properties have been obtained from two boreholes located in this mine. These borehole are approximately 400 m long with NQ diameters and depths of about 1300 - 1600 m and 1700 - 2000 m. Two borehole logging surveys were performed on both boreholes, October 2013 and July 2015, in order to perform a time-lapse analysis of the geophysical changes in the mine. These multi-parameter surveys include caliper, full waveform sonic, televiewer, chargeability (IP), and resistivity. Multi-electrode array DC/IP borehole and borehole-to-borehole surveys were also conducted in 2014, showing an increase in resistivity only in the 1300 m borehole near the active mining area, possibly due to stress induced closing of fractures. There is only exploration activity near the 1700 m borehole over this time period, and it therefore shows no changes in resistivity. Laboratory experiments have been performed on borehole core samples from each borehole. These experiments have measured the geophysical properties including elastic modulus, bulk modulus, P- and S-wave velocities, and density.",

These zones of damaged rock display reduced elastic moduli compared to intact rock, resulting in both higher geodetic strain rates and lower seismic velocities within the fault zones. In this study, we investigate the CFZ surrounding the San Andreas Fault in the San Francisco Peninsula by examining interseismic deformation over the past several decades. We use new and existing survey GPS measurements, as well as older electronic distance measurements, to characterize the deformation of the CFZ. The data come from networks at Black Mountain and Lake San Andreas, both small-aperture geodetic networks on the San Francisco Peninsula with survey GPS occupations spanning at least 15 years. We compare the inferred fault zone properties between the two networks, which are separated by less than 40 kilometers but which represent different geologic boundaries and show different fault ages. We also compare patterns in seismicity between the two regions. The differences in inferred fault parameters between these two regions may be related to differences in fault age and development, giving clues into how CFZs develop over time.",

However, sampling methods for instantaneous CPOM transport rates and annual loads are not well developed, and hence not much is known about annual CPOM export from high energy, forested mountain streams.\nCPOM transport samples were collected over one-month snowmelt highflow seasons in two high-elevation, subalpine, Rocky Mountains streams with snowmelt regimes as well as in a montane torrent in the Swiss Pre-Alps with a pluvio-nival regime. Basin areas ranged from 1 to 13 km2. Bedload traps and automated hanging baskets installed at an overfall, developed for sampling gravel bedload, proved suitable for sampling CPOM transport.\nBedload traps with 0.3 by 0.2 m openings are typically deployed for an hour at a time during wadeable flows, collect samples back-to-back, and may trap volumes of up to 20 liters in the attached 1.4 m long nets. At the Swiss site, hanging baskets with a 1 m3 volume are deployed at an overfall in unwadeable flows, and bedload traps in wadeable flows. When flow overtopped bedload traps, CPOM transport rates were adjusted to estimate and add the unsampled CPOM portion traveling higher in the water column; when nets overfilled, CPOM transport rate were adjusted for the reduction in captured transport.\nCPOM transport rates in consecutive samples were well related to flow but showed pronounced hysteresis over diurnal fluctuations of flow, between consecutive days, and over the rising and falling limbs of the high-flow season. Hysteresis effects require intensive sampling and use of separate rating curves for all rising and falling limbs in order to compute annual CPOM load. Annual CPOM export for the two Rocky Mountain streams was 2.7 and 4 kg/ha/year, but both streams exported 6.5 and 6.6 kg/ha/year per forested portion of the watershed.\nInstantaneous CPOM transport rates are moderately well related to discharge, unit discharge, and unit stream power within individual streams. However, all three streams follow a similar transport relation of CPOM only with unit discharge, suggesting that unit discharge could be suitable to predict CPOM transport rates in steep streams.",

            "abstract": "Microbial communities play a central role in the functioning of natural ecosystems by heavily influencing biogeochemical cycles. Understanding how shifts in the environment are tied to shifts in biogeochemical rates via changes in microbial communities is particularly relevant in high latitude terrestrial systems underlain by permafrost due to vast carbon stocks currently stored within thawing permafrost. There is limited understanding, however, of the interplay among soil-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, microbial communities, and SOM chemical composition. To address this knowledge gap, we leverage the distinct spatial transitions in permafrost-affected soils at the Caribou Poker Creek Research Watershed, a 104 km2 boreal watershed ~50 km north of Fairbanks, AK. We integrate a variety of data to gain new knowledge of the factors that govern observed patterns in the rates of soil CO2 fluxes associated with permafrost to non-permafrost transition zones. We show that nonlinearities in fluxes are influenced by depth to permafrost, tree stand structure, and soil C composition. Further, using 16S sequencing methods we explore microbial community assembly processes and their connection to CO2 flux across spatial scales, and suggest a path to more mechanistically link microbes to large-scale biogeochemical cycles. Lastly, we use the Community Land Model (CLM) to compare Earth System Model predictions of soil C cycling with empirical measurements. Deviations between CLM predictions and field observations of CO2 flux and soil C stocks will provide insight for how the model may be improved through inclusion of additional biotic (e.g., microbial community composition) and abiotic (e.g., organic carbon composition) features, which will be critical to improve the predictive power of climate models in permafrost-affected regions.",

            "abstract": "Organic aerosols (OA) account for about 1/2 of the submicron particle mass in the atmosphere leading to important impacts on climate, human health, and other issues, but their sources, properties, and evolution are poorly understood. OA is comprised of primary OA (POA, emitted in the particle phase) and secondary OA (SOA, formed by gas-to-particle conversion). Together with others in the community and contrary to the understanding at the time, we demonstrated in the mid-2000s that SOA dominates over POA at most locations. This paradigm shift has led to intense research on the sources, processing, properties, and fate of SOA. Because pre-existing and commercial instruments were very limited for the analysis of the complex mixtures of highly oxidized species comprising real OA, we developed or co-developed several experimental and data analysis techniques aimed at extracting more information out of ambient and laboratory air, and pioneered their application in field experiments. We proposed a new paradigm (Jimenez et al., Science, 2009) that is consistent with worldwide measurements and in which OA and OA precursor gases evolve continuously by becoming increasingly oxidized, less volatile, and more hygroscopic, leading to the formation of oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA), with concentrations comparable to those of sulfate aerosol throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The amount of SOA formed from urban air is remarkably consistent across the world, although the contributions of different sources remain a subject of debate. Biomass burning emissions rarely form additional OA mass after emission, although rapid chemical aging is always observed. Global model-measurement comparisons suggest the need for a large (100 Tg/yr) “anthropogenically-controlled” SOA source, thought to be dominated by anthropogenically-enhanced biogenic SOA. SOA formed from several pathways from biogenic emissions is starting to be better characterized, as are key SOA properties such as hygrosopicity, volatility, and oxidation lifetime. In-situ SOA formation in oxidation flow reactors provides useful constraints on the SOA formation potential of different airmasses.",

            "abstract": "This work summarizes the development and application of a numerical model for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of salt caverns during cyclic gas storage. Artificial salt caverns are used for short term energy storage, such as power-to-gas or compressed air energy storage. Those applications are characterized by highly fluctuating operation pressures due to the unsteady power levels of power plants based on renewable energy. Compression and expansion of the storage gases during loading and unloading stages lead to rapidly changing temperatures in the host rock of the caverns. This affects the material behaviour of the host rock within a zone that extends several meters into the rock mass adjacent to the cavern wall, and induces thermo-mechanical stresses and alters the creep response.\nThe proposed model features the thermodynamic behaviour of the storage medium, conductive heat transport in the host rock, as well as temperature dependent material properties of rock salt using different thermo-viscoplastic material models. The utilized constitutive models are well known and state-of-the-art in various salt mechanics applications. The model has been implemented into the open-source software platform OpenGeoSys. Thermal and mechanical processes are solved using a finite element approach, coupled via a staggered coupling scheme. The simulation results allow the conclusion, that the cavern convergence rate (and thus the efficiency of the cavern) is highly influenced by the loading cycle frequency and the resulting gas temperatures. The model therefore allows to analyse the influence of operation modes on the cavern host rock or on neighbouring facilities.",

            "abstract": "Rapid development of GIS techniques and constant advancement of digital elevation models significantly improved the accuracy of extraction of information on active tectonics from landscape features. Numerous attempts were made to quantitatively evaluate recent tectonic activity using GIS and DEMs, and a set of geomorphic indices (GI), however these studies focused mainly on sub-basins or small-scale areal units. In forearc regions where crustal deformation is usually large-scale and do not concentrate only along one specific fault, an assessment of the complete basin is more accurate. We present here the first attempt to implement thirteen GI in the assessment of active tectonics of a forearc region of an active convergent margin using the entire river basins. The GIs were divided into groups: BTAI - basin geomorphic indices (reflecting areal erosion vs. tectonics) and STAI - stream geomorphic indices (reflecting vertical erosion vs. tectonics). We calculated selected indices for 9 large (> 450 km2) drainage basins. Then we categorized the obtained results of each index into three classes of relative tectonic activity: 1 – high, 2 – moderate, and 3 – low. Finally we averaged these classes for each basin to determine the tectonic activity level (TAI).\nThe analysis for the case study area, the Guerrero sector at the Mexican subduction zone, revealed high tectonic activity in this area, particularly in its central and, to a lesser degree, eastern part. This pattern agrees with and is supported by interpretation of satellite images and DEM, and field observations. The results proved that the proposed approach indeed allows identification and recognition of areas witnessing recent tectonic deformation. Moreover, our results indicated that, even though no large earthquake has been recorded in this sector for more than 100 years, the area is highly active and may represent a seismic hazard for the region.",

Elements which are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere, i.e. those with FIP less than about 10 eV, are enhanced in abundance in the corona by a factor of about 3-4, while elements that are predominantly neutral are essentially unchanged (although He and Ne can be further depleted). A compelling explanation for this phenomenon invokes the ponderomotive force associated with Alfven or fast mode waves propagating through or reflecting from the chromosphere. The usual solar FIP effect, and most of its variations, are best modeled by waves resonant with the coronal loop on which they propagate, and therefore most plausibly have a coronal origin.\nWe report on 3D compressible MHD simulations of coronal loop heating with the HYPERION code. A ponderomotive force of the correct sign and magnitude is produced naturally as a by-product of coronal heating processes that also produce a 1-3 MK corona loop, reinforcing our conjecture above. We argue that coronal element abundance anomalies, and the waves that produce them, offer a novel but hitherto largely untried approach to the problem of coronal heating.",

However, due to the complexity and custom nature of such combined data-software systems, it can be very challenging to curate and preserve them for the long term at reasonable cost and in a way that retains their scientific value. In this presentation, we describe how this challenge was met in preserving the Big Canopy Database (CanopyDB) system using an agile approach and leveraging the Sustainable Environment – Actionable Data (SEAD) DataNet project’s hosted data services. The CanopyDB system was developed over more than a decade at Evergreen State College to address the needs of forest canopy researchers. It is an early yet sophisticated exemplar of the type of system that has become common in biological research and science in general, including multiple relational databases for different experiments, a custom database generation tool used to create them, an image repository, and desktop and web tools to access, analyze, and visualize this data. SEAD provides secure project spaces with a semantic content abstraction (typed content with arbitrary RDF metadata statements and relationships to other content), combined with a standards-based curation and publication pipeline resulting in packaged research objects with Digital Object Identifiers. Using SEAD, our cross-project team was able to incrementally ingest CanopyDB components (images, datasets, software source code, documentation, executables, and virtualized services) and to iteratively define and extend the metadata and relationships needed to document them. We believe that both the process, and the richness of the resultant standards-based (OAI-ORE) preservation object, hold lessons for the development of best-practice solutions for preserving scientific data in association with the tools and services needed to derive value from it.",

            "abstract": "One of the most striking changes occurring in the Arctic over the past decade is the increased mass loss and freshwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). Improving our understanding and prediction of the mass balance and freshwater discharge of the GrIS requires improved knowledge of the different atmospheric drivers and weather events that impact the surface mass balance (SMB). In this study, we assess the relationship between both local and large-scale forcing of ocean heat and moisture advection (aka. moisture flux) on the GrIS SMB. To this aim, we employ a variety of tools and datasets such as the outputs of a regional climate model (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional, MAR) and reanalysis data. In particular, we test the hypothesis that useful information on the mass loss and freshwater discharge of the GrIS can be obtained from the computation of the atmospheric moisture flux in a Eulerian framework and focus on understanding the physical processes involved. Using the high-resolution outputs of a 35-year (1979–2014) simulation from the MAR model, we examine the spatiotemporal co-variability of mass loss and gain (divided regions based on latitude) during the strongest moisture flux events, as estimated from MAR and reanalysis datasets. We then classify the different weather events associated with the moisture flux that occur during strong mass loss events. Using conditional subsetting, rather than correlation analysis, our work identifies the spectrum of responses of the GrIS mass balance to strong atmospheric moisture fluxes into the region. Then, in a separate analysis, we characterize the variety of moisture fluxes that occur prior to large melt events.",

In this presentation, we explore how instrumental and astrophysical parameters will affect the ability of such missions to obtain spectral and photometric observations that are useful for characterizing their planetary targets. We discuss the development of an instrument noise model suitable for studying the spectral characterization potential of a coronagraph-equipped, space-based telescope. To be consistent with near-future missions and technologies, we assume a baseline set of telescope and instrument parameters that include a 2 meter diameter primary aperture, an operational wavelength range of 0.4–1.0 μm, and an instrument spectral resolution of λ/Δλ=70. We present applications of our baseline noise simulator to a variety of spectral models of different planet types, emphasizing Earth-like planets. With our exoplanet spectral models, we explore wavelength-dependent planet-star flux ratios for main sequence stars of various effective temperatures, and discuss how coronagraph inner and outer working angle constraints will influence the potential to study different types of planets. For planets most favorable to spectroscopic characterization—including nearby Earth twins and super-Earths—we study the integration times required to achieve moderate signal-to-noise ratio spectra. We also explore the sensitivity of the integration times required to detect the base of key absorption bands (for water vapor and molecular oxygen) to coronagraph raw contrast performance, exozodiacal light levels, and the distance to the planetary system. We will also discuss prospects for detecting ocean glint, a habitability signature, from nearby Earth-like planets, as well as the extension of our models to a more distant future Large UV-Optical-InfraRed (LUVOIR) mission.",

Even today, IPCC AR5 climate models exhibit a range in global SWA of ~10 Wm-2 and as a class underestimate our present best observed estimate of SWA by ~5 Wm-2. While a significant part of this range may result from differing assumptions about cloud and aerosol, it is also possible that there is a sizable contribution from poor representation of SWA by radiative gases in GCM radiation codes. Part of the problem stems from that until recently there was considerable uncertainty about the SWA of gases. However, improved measurements of the line and continua spectra of gases in the past decade have considerably narrowed this uncertainty range. In this work we derive a best and uncertainty estimate of the SWA by each important greenhouse gas. This provides benchmark values that can be used to perform a robust test of the quality of SWA by gases in GCM radiation codes. ",

The effects of fallow land on land-atmosphere interactions in drought years are not well studied, but theoretically should alter local energy balance and surface climate relative to normal years, which in turn could affect neighboring cropland. We examined these effects using a regional climate model (Weather Research and Forecasting model) coupled with a dynamic crop growth model (Community Land Model) that has an irrigation scheme to study the effects of fallow land in 2014, an extreme drought year in California. In our study, we used satellite-derived maps of cultivated and fallowed acreage, and defined summer fallow land in 2014 as the reduced percentage of cultivated land for each grid cell relative to the 2011 cultivated area (2011 was the most recent year following a winter with average or above average precipitation). Using a sensitivity experiment that kept large-scale climate boundary conditions constant, we found that fallow land resulted in even dryer and warmer weather that worsened the drought impact. Fallow land increased 2-meter air temperature by 0.1- 4 °C with 0-80% fallow land, mainly due to an increase in nighttime temperature. Fallow land warmed the atmosphere up to 850hpa during the day, and after sunset, the warmed atmosphere emitted downward longwave radiation that prevented the surface from rapidly cooling, and therefore resulted in warmer nights. Fallow land reduced near surface relative humidity by 5-30% and increased vapor pressure deficit by 0.5-2 kPa. These drier conditions increased the irrigation water demand in the nearby cropland: crops required 1-25% more irrigation with 10-80% fallow land within the same 10km grid cell. Our study suggests that fallow land has large impacts on land-atmosphere interactions and increases irrigation requirements in nearby cropland.",

To date the source of MMHg and the mechanism of this cycling remain unknown. We show that the rate of gaseous evasion of dimethyl mercury (DMHg) is fairly large. Vertical gradients of dimethyl mercury (DMHg) from cyclonic eddies in the California Current indicate an evasive loss of this compound of over 10 pmol m-2 d-1 from these and other upwelling systems. Previous experiments, however, indicated that the rate of photolytic demethylation of DMHg to MMHg is extremely slow in seawater. In this study we performed photodemethylation experiments in both natural seawater and seawater acidified to pH = 5 (the pH of fog). These results confirm the low rates of photodemethylation of DMHg previously observed, yet also show that photodemethylation is a significant factor in the demethylation of DMHg at low pH and thus a potential source of MMHg in fog. These findings suggest photodemethylation may occur atmospherically, and may explain both the high concentrations of MMHg found in fog, and the difference in concentrations of MMHg found in fog water vs rainwater.",

We relocate events (ML 0.4 ~ 3.9) that occurred in the western part of South Korea (35.5 ~ 38.5 °N 124.5 ~ 128 °E) from January 2009 to January 2015. We first make 21 groups from 495 events with local magnitude greater than 2 using kernel density estimation in the studied area. Second, we cross-correlate and classify events for each group, and define a set comprised of events with cross-correlation coefficient (CC) greater than 0.7. Events with local magnitude smaller than 2 are also assigned to a relevant set according to the value of CC (> 0.7). Finally, we relocate epicenters of events from the same set using travel-time double-differences computed by cross-correlation for Lg-wave. Relocated epicenters are more clustered by a factor of several tens, and their spatial distribution reflect location of classified events. For some earthquake sequences with good station coverage, the relocated epicenters lead us to reveal spatiotemporal migration of events, and is able to image structure of seismicity associated with a fault in fine-scale.",

The nature of ensemble data assimilation makes the framework efficient and flexible to integrate various types of observation data. We leveraged the level set concept to establish transformations between discrete hydrofacies and continuous variables, which is a critical element to implement ensemble data assimilation methods for hydrofacies delineation. T-PROGS is used to generate realizations of hydrofacies fields given conditioning points. An additional quenching step of T-PROGS is taken to preserve spatial structure of updated hydrofacies after each data assimilation step. This new method is illustrated by a two-dimensional (2-D) synthetic study in which transient hydraulic head data resulting from pumping is assimilated to delineate hydrofacies distribution. Our results showed that the proposed framework was able to characterize hydrofacies distribution and their associated permeability with adequate accuracy even with limited direct hydrofacies data. This method may find broader applications in facies delineation using other types of indirect measurements, such as tracer tests and geophysical surveys.",

Those aquifers were believed to be recharged during the previous wet climatic period but still receiving modest local recharge in interleaving dry periods such as those prevailing at present. Quantifying temporal and spatial variabilities in rainfall patterns, magnitudes, durations, and frequencies is of prime importance when it comes to sustainable management of such aquifer systems. In this study, an integrated approach, using remote sensing and field data, was used to assess the past, the current, and the projected spatial and temporal variations in rainfall over one of the major watersheds in KSA, Wadi Ar-Rumah. This watershed was selected given its larger areal extent and population intensity. Rainfall data were extracted from (1) the Climate Prediction Centers (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP; spatial coverage: global; spatial resolution: 2.5° × 2.5°; temporal coverage: January 1979 to April 2015; temporal resolution: monthly), and (2) the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; spatial coverage: 50°N to 50°S; spatial resolution: 0.25° × 0.25°; temporal coverage: January 1998 to March 2015; temporal resolution: 3 hours) and calibrated against rainfall measurements extracted from rain gauges. Trends in rainfall patterns were examined over four main investigation periods: period I (01/1979 to 12/1985), period II (01/1986 to 12/1992), period III (01/1993 to 12/2002), and period IV (01/2003 to 12/2014). Our findings indicate: (1) a significant increase (+14.19 mm/yr) in rainfall rates were observed during period I, (2) a significant decrease in rainfall rates were observed during periods II (-5.80 mm/yr), III (-9.38 mm/yr), and IV (-2.46 mm/yr), and (3) the observed variations in rainfall rates are largely related to the temporal variations in the northerlies (also called northwesterlies) and the monsoonal wind regimes.",

For example, it has been reported that ULF pulsations may be the likely acceleration mechanism for generating storm-time MeV “killer” electrons in the magnetosphere. However, the impact of this energetic ULF wave power onto the ionosphere is not yet explored very well. In this paper we unequivocally demonstrated that during intense Pc5 ULF wave activity period, distinct pulsations with the same periodicity were found in the TEC data observed by GPS receivers located at different latitudes. The GPS-TEC has been used as a powerful tool to study the propagation pattern of transient ionospheric disturbances generated by seismic or internal gravity waves. Since then the small-scale variations (undulation) of GPS TEC has been associated with either gravity wave or TIDs. However, these small scale undulations of TECs turned out to be sensitive enough to the intense global ULF waves as well. The wavelet analysis of GPS TEC small scale undulations shows a peak value at the frequency of 2-10mHz which is a typical frequency range of Pc5 ULF wave. The typical internal gravity wave frequency is less than 1.6 or 2 mHz, therefore the TEC waves are likely due to ULF waves. At the same time, we detect the ULF activity on the ground using a chain of ground-based magnetometer data, depicting the ULF wave penetration from high latitude to low latitude region. All these observations demonstrate that Pc5 waves with a likely driver in the solar wind can penetrate to the ionosphere and cause small scale undulation on the ionospheric density structures.",

Their small amplitudes (10’s of cm) make them difficult to detect and track in the ocean. Despite their small amplitudes, they generate vertically propagating atmospheric gravity waves. Decreasing atmospheric density with altitude and conservation of energy result in these initially small disturbances attaining appreciable perturbations in the thermosphere and ionosphere. Because these initial amplitudes are small, the subsequent wave propagation is linear, predisposing tsunami generated waves to survive into the thermosphere and ionosphere rather than breaking at lower altitudes. The large length-scales associate with tsunami-generated waves also contributes to their attaining high altitudes.\nUsing an anelastic finite-volume numerical model, we have performed simulations of tsunami-generated gravity waves and their propagation through a variety of background conditions in order to assess the viability of detecting and tracking tsunamis in the deep ocean. We have considered simple mean wind shears as well as representative oscillatory tidal structures. Results indicate that large-amplitude waves readily propagate to the ionosphere for a variety of wind profiles. The presence of turning levels in the wind profile partially block the waves, reducing but not eliminating the perturbations in the thermosphere and ionosphere. The wind's average shear both deforms the wave and, dependent on the wind direction, can enhance or reduce perturbation amplitudes.",

Existing models represent the global distribution of vegetation types using the Plant Functional Typeconcept. Plant Functional Types are classes of plant species with similar evolutionary and life history withpresumably similar responses to environmental conditions like CO2, water and nutrient availability. Fixedproperties for each Plant Functional Type are specified through a collection of physiological parameters, or traits.These traits, mostly physiological in nature (e.g., leaf nitrogen and longevity) are used in model algorithms to estimate ecosystem properties and/or drive calculated process rates. In most models, 5 to 15 functional types represent terrestrial vegetation; in essence, they assume there are a total of only 5 to 15 different kinds of plants on the entire globe. This assumption of constant plant traits captured within the functional type concept has serious limitations, as a single set of traits does not reflect trait variation observed within and between species and communities. While this simplification was necessary decades past, substantial improvement is now possible. Rather than assigning a small number of constant parameter values to all grid cells in a model, procedures will be developed that predict a frequency distribution of values for any given grid cell. Thus, the mean and variance, and how these change with time, will inform and improve model performance.\nThe trait-based approach will improve land modeling by (1) incorporating patterns and heterogeneity of traits into model parameterization, thus evolving away from a framework that considers large areas of vegetation to have near identical trait values; (2) utilizing what is know about trait-trait, -soil, and -climate relations to improve algorithms used to predict processes at multiple stages; and (3) allowing for improved treatment of physiological responses to environment (such as temperature and/or CO2 response of photosynthesis or respiration).",

While at the international level, it fosters improved guidance on MRV approaches, including consensus on principles and guidelines for MRV and training programmes. It provides guidance on how best to design and implement REDD, to ensure that forests continue to provide multiple benefits for livelihoods and biodiversity to societies while storing carbon at the same time.

In comparison to headwater streams, which encompass flow velocities of 0.1 – 1.0 + m/s, water velocity in water tracks ranges 0.001 - 0.1 m/s, suggesting the potential for significant interaction of water and solutes with transient storage zones in hillslopes compared to streams. Transient storage, the temporary retention of water and solutes in slow-flowing water, contributes to increased water residence time and thus the exposure of water and associated solutes to biochemically reactive substrates. Seasonal patterns in thaw depth of hillslope soils and discharge from hillslopes in the Arctic suggest that the relative contribution of transient storage zones might show predictable seasonal- and event-scale patterns. We conducted slug injections of a conservative solute (NaCl) in two water tracks in the Kuparuk River watershed, Alaska, during two summers to characterize how transient storage varied with thaw depth and discharge. The resulting break-through curves were separated into three dominant processes using an analytical advection-dispersion model: 1) salt mass primarily moved by advection and dispersion, 2) salt mass experiencing transient storage, and 3) a mass loss term. Across all tracer experiments, the mean percentage of total injected tracer mass associated with transient storage was 54%. This is comparable to a peat-bottomed stream but greater than a cobble-lined channel in a nearby catchment. However, transient storage was variable among experiments (1.3 – 72%). Discharge was also variable across experiments, ranging 0.05 – 3.5 L/s, and there was a negative correlation between transient storage and discharge. Thus, we expect significant interaction of solutes with soils in water tracks during inter-storm periods, when the majority of water moving through water tracks enters transient storage zones. We did not see a significant increase in transient storage over the summer season, which suggests discharge is a greater influence on transient storage in water tracks than depth to thaw. Discharge acts as a significant control on transient storage in water tracks, influencing water residence time and the export of solutes down arctic hillslopes.",

Our numerical implementation reproduces the regional coastal dynamics, characterized by an equatorward surface California Current and a subsurface poleward California Undercurrent (CU) that flowed over the continental slope with stronger velocities between the 26.3 and 26.6 isopicnals. The seasonal variability of this poleward flow was governed by an energetic semiannual component that induced stronger velocities during June-July and October-November, when the CU reached mean speeds of ~10 cm/s. The semiannual CU component dominated the main empirical mode of variability of the subsurface coastal circulation. Numerical experiments and the alongshore correlation of the subsurface coastal velocity revealed that the energetic semiannual CU variability was induced by the propagation of coastal-trapped waves generated in the Tropical Pacific.",

The model explicitly details the dynamics of three Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs) of importance for C, N, P, Si, Fe cycling and air-sea CO2 exchange in this area. These are the diatoms, the pico-nanophytoplankton and the coccolithophores whose growth regulation by light, temperature and nutrients has been obtained from phenomenological observations available for these PFTs. The performance of the SWAMCO-3 model coupled to a vertical one-dimensional physical model is assessed at the location of the time-series station KERFIX (around 51°S-68°E). The model was able to reproduce a mean seasonal cycle based on years where a maximum of chemical and biological observations are available. Ocean fCO2 in equilibrium with the atmosphere are simulated both in winter associated with surface layer replenishment in DIC due to deep vertical mixing and in late summer as a consequence of the warming effect on the carbonate system. A clear under-saturation is simulated in summer driven by primary production. Model scenarios cancelling biological activity or only coccolithophores allowed, by comparison with the standard simulation, untangling the respective role of physical and biological processes in driving the sign and magnitude of air-sea CO2 exchanges. First, we show that coccolithophores are repressing the ocean C uptake, but only marginally (5%). Second, the model highlights the role of diatoms on the presence of a CO2 sink in summer. Altogether, this results in a weak annual air-sea CO2 flux (-0.9 mol m-2 y-1 or -0.1 Pg C y-1 for the ice-free zone south of 50°S), whose variability seems more related to the thermodynamical processes. We then speculate how global warming might influence the latter mechanisms and alter air-sea CO2 exchanges in this region.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced Oil Recovery with CO2 (CO2-EOR) is perhaps the most feasible option for geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS), if only due to existing infrastructure and economic opportunities of associated oil production. Probably the most significant source of uncertainty of CO2 storage forecasts is heterogeneity of reservoir properties. Quantification of storage forecast uncertainty is critical for accurate assessment of risks associated with GCS in EOR fields. This study employs a response surface methodology (RSM) to quantify uncertainties of CO2 storage associated with oil production in an active CO2-EOR field. Specifically, the Morrow formation, a clastic reservoir within the Farnsworth EOR Unit (FWU) in Texas, was selected as a case study. Four uncertain parameters (i.e., independent variables) are reservoir permeability, anisotropy ratio of permeability, water-alternating-gas (WAG) time ratio, and initial oil saturation. Cumulative oil production and net CO2 injection are the output dependent variables. A 3-D FWU reservoir model, including a representative 5-spot well pattern, was constructed for CO2-oil-water multiphase flow analysis. A total of 25 permutations of 3-D reservoir simulations were executed using Eclipse simulator. After performing stepwise regression analysis, a series of response surface models of the output variables at each step were constructed and verified using appropriate goodness-of-fit measures. The R2 values are larger than 0.9 and NRMSE values are less than 5% between the simulated and predicted oil production and net CO2 injection, suggesting that the response surface (or proxy) models are sufficient for predicting CO2-EOR system behavior for FWU case. Given the range of uncertainties in the independent variables, the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of dependent variables were estimated using the proxy models. The predicted cumulative oil production and net CO2 injection at 95th percentile after 5 years are about 3.65 times, and 1.7 times as large as the ones at 5th percentile, respectively. These results suggest that significant uncertainties of output variables are propagated from the parameter uncertainties. While we anticipated this result in general, quantitative confirmation is probably necessary for any and all specific cases (fields or operations).",

WSN technologies can provide high resolution for spatial and temporal data which has not been possible before, opening up new opportunities. On the other hand, WSNs, particularly outdoor WSNs in harsh environments, present great challenges for scientists and engineers in terms of the network design, deployment, operation, management, and maintenance.\nSince 2010, we have been working on the deployment of an outdoor multi-hop WSN testbed for hydrological/environmental monitoring in a forested hill-sloped region at the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP), Pennsylvania, USA. The ASWP WSN testbed has continuously evolved and had more than 80 nodes by now. To our knowledge, the ASWP WSN testbed represents one of the first known long-term multi-hop WSN deployments in an outdoor environment. As simulation and laboratory methods are unable to capture the complexity of outdoor environments (e.g., forests, oceans, mountains, or glaciers), which significantly affect WSN operations and maintenance, experimental deployments are essential to investigate and understand WSN behaviors and performances as well as its maintenance characteristics under these harsh conditions.\nIn this talk, based on our empirical studies with the ASWP WSN testbed, we will present our discoveries and investigations on several important aspects including WSN energy profile, node reprogramming, network management system, and testbed maintenance. We will then provide our insight into these critical aspects of outdoor WSN deployments and operations.",

Evidence for this is provided by observations contrasted with the longer series from the GFDL CM2.1 global climate model (GCM), which shows a bimodal distribution of EN peaks, with one of the modes corresponding to extreme EN. We also show results from a low-order stable model that is able to reproduce this bimodality solely with the indicated threshold nonlinearity and that shows substantial sensitivity of the statistics of the extreme EN to the threshold value and the stochastic forcing characteristics.\nThe observational and GCM analysis indicates that positive equatorial heat content anomalies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for such events. On the other hand, the presence of strong westerly wind stress anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific in boreal summer, as seen in 1982 and 1997, appears to be both necessary and sufficient condition for triggering extreme El Niño. In 1982, external forcing of such westerly stress at that time was apparently key for kickstarting this extreme EN.\nPreliminary analysis of retrospective forecasts for the 1982- 2010 period from by the GCMs participating in the US National Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) project, which includes GFDL CM2.1, specifically looking at the onset of the observed extreme El Niño, indicates that the convective nonlinear feedbacks are strongly affected by the mean surface temperature drift in the GCMs and that nonlinear bias correction might be necessary for the operational prediction of extreme EN.",

The acetate stimulates indigenous microorganisms that catalyze metal reduction, including the conversion of aqueous U(VI) to solid-phase U(IV), which effectively removes uranium from solution. The initiation of the bicarbonate amendment prior to biostimulation was designed to promote U(VI) desorption that would increase the aqueous U(VI) available for bioreduction. The three-dimensional simulations were able to largely reproduce the timing and magnitude of the physical, chemical and biological responses to the acetate and bicarbonate amendment in the context of changing water table elevation and gradient. A time series of groundwater proteomic samples exhibited correlations between the most abundant Geobacter metallireducens proteins and the genome-scale metabolic model-predicted fluxes of intra-cellular reactions associated with each of those proteins. The desorption of U(VI) induced by the bicarbonate amendment led to initially higher rates of bioreduction compared to locations with minimal bicarbonate exposure. After bicarbonate amendment ceased, bioreduction continued at these locations whereas U(VI) sorption was the dominant removal mechanism at the bicarbonate-impacted sites.",

Concurrently, there has been rapid growth in the collection and analysis of data by non-experts. So called ‘citizen scientists’ are collecting and analyzing data at unprecedented rates on a variety of topics including plant phenology.\nThrough the development of online programs and activities, citizen science data is being collected at spatial and temporal scales that were previously not possible. Citizen science data vastly exceeds what scientists or land managers can collect or analyze on their own. As such, it provides opportunities for scaling both in terms of data collection and analysis.\nThis presentation will focus on two plant phenology projects that involve citizen scientists in the data life cycle at different scales – Project BudBurst which is based on the collection of ground observations and Season Spotter which is based on the classification of remotely sensed landscape imagery. NEON’s Project BudBurst (budburst.org) is a national citizen science program focused on the collection of observations of the timing of leafing, flowering, and fruiting in hundreds of plant species. The PhenoCam Network’s Season Spotter (seasonspotter.org) engages individuals in the classification and annotation of a variety of vegetated landscape images via a new platform on Zooniverse.\nCitizen Science contributions to plant phenology are proving to be an invaluable tool that can be used to both validate existing and support development of new methods to extract phenology information from remotely sensed imagery including PhenoCam and satellite sources. This presentation will compare and contrast the contribution made to the study of plant phenology at multiple scales – ground observation data of individual plants and classification and annotation of data collected through a network do automated digital cameras.",

            "abstract": "Abundances of siderophile elements in the primitive mantle constrain the conditions of Earth's core/mantle differentiation. Core growth occurred as Earth accreted from collisions between planetesimals and larger embryos of unknown original provenance, so geochemistry is directly related to the overall dynamics of Solar System formation. Recent studies claim that only certain conditions of equilibration (pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity) during core formation can reproduce the available data. Typical analyses, however, only consider the effects of varying a few out of tens of free parameters in continuous core formation models. Here we describe the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which simultaneously incorporates the large uncertainties on Earth's composition and the parameterizations that describe elemental partitioning between metal and silicate. This Bayesian technique is vastly more computationally efficient than a simple grid search and is well suited to models of planetary accretion that involve a plethora of variables.\nIn contrast to previous work, we find that analyses of siderophile elements alone cannot yield a unique scenario for Earth's accretion. Our models predict a wide range of possible light element contents for the core, encompassing all combinations permitted by seismology and mineral physics. Specifically, we are agnostic between silicon and oxygen as the dominant light element, and the addition of carbon or sulfur is also permissible but not well constrained. Redox conditions may have remained roughly constant during Earth's accretion or relatively oxygen-rich material could have been incorporated before reduced embryos. Pressures and temperatures of equilibration, likewise, may only increase slowly throughout accretion. Therefore, we do not necessarily expect a thick (>500 km), compositionally stratified layer that is stable against convection to develop at the top of the core of Earth (or, by analogy, Venus). A thinner stable layer might inhibit the initialization of the dynamo.",

Responding to this challenge requires an improved understanding of potential changes together with the effectiveness of management responses for reducing impacts under range of potential future climatic conditions. Traditional gray stormwater infrastructure generally uses single-purpose, hard structures including detention basins and storm sewers to dispose of rainwater. Green infrastructure (GI) uses vegetation and soil to manage rainwater where it falls. GI has been gaining in popularity, and has been shown to provide a number of benefits for adapting to climate change including effects on stormwater quantity, quality and carbon and nutrient biogeochemical cycling. Uncertainty remains, however, due to limited understanding of GI performance in different hydroclimatic and urban settings, and in response to changes in climate. In this study we use simulation modeling to assess the impacts of climate change on both gray (wet ponds) and green infrastructure practices (green roofs, swales, bioretention) in different hydroclimatic and urban settings. Simulations were conducted using RHESSYs, a mechanistic, hydrologic and biogeochemical model, for 36 characteristic urban “archetypes” (AUSs) representing different development patterns and GI practices found in typical U.S. cities. Climate change scenarios are based on dynamically and temporally downscaled, mid-21st century climate model output from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Results suggest altered mass and energy inputs will cause changes in performance of these practices for water quantity, water quality, and carbon sequestration that vary across the country. Infrastructure design should take these potential changes into consideration.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of nitrogen (N) flux from urban residential neighborhoods to water bodies is not known. We present a case study of N evolution in urban stormwater runoff from a residential neighborhood located in Florida where most runoff is generated by excess rainfall. This rainfall occurs during the 4-month wet season (June-September) that receives ~60 to 70% of 125 cm annual rainfall. The outlet pipe draining the residential neighborhood in Florida was instrumented with ISCO sampler. Stormwater runoff samples were collected every 5-minute following variable storm durations and frequencies during 2014 wet season. Mean concentration of total N in stormwater runoff ranged from 1 to 3 mg L-1; of which, nitrate-N was <25% and organic N was >60% in most storm events; suggesting different processes controlling N release and transport during variable storm events. Stormwater samples were analyzed for N and oxygen (O) isotopes of nitrate along with hydrogen (H) and O in water to understand the sources of N and water. This presentation will discuss our ongoing research aimed at better understanding the sources, processes, and unraveling the unknowns and uncertainty of N transport from urban coastal systems",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_v2.pdf\nIce particles play an important role in precipitation and radiation transfer in stratiform mixed-phase clouds. Lagrangian ice particle tracking in mixed-phase clouds is applied in both a 3-D time dependent velocity field produced by a Large Eddy Simulation cloud model and in a 2-D idealized field. It is found that more than 10% of ice particles have lifetimes longer than 1.5 hours, much longer than the large eddy turnover time or the time for a crystal to fall through the depth of a non-turbulent cloud. An analysis of trajectories in a 2-D idealized field shows that there are two types of long lifetime ice particles: quasi-steady and recycled growth. For quasi-steady growth, ice particles are suspended in the updraft velocity region for a long time. For recycled growth, ice particles are trapped in the large-eddy structures, and whether ice particles grow or evaporate depends on the ice relative humidity profile within the boundary layer. Some ice particles can grow after each cycle in the trapping region, until they are too large to be trapped, and thus have long lifetimes. The relative contribution of the recycled ice particles to the cloud mean ice water content depends on both the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the mixing layer. In particular, the total ice water content of a mixed phase cloud in a decoupled boundary layer can be much larger than that in a fully coupled boundary layer. This may help explain some of the observed variability of ice water content in mixed phase clouds with similar thermodynamic properties but different circulation structures.",

            "abstract": "This work presents direct-seismogram inversion for receiver-side structure which treats the source signal incident from below (the effective source-time function, STF) as a vector of unknown parameters in a Bayesian framework. As a result, direct-seismogram inversion does not require deconvolution by observed seismogram components as typically applied in receiver-function inversion, and avoids the problematic issue of choosing subjective tuning parameters in the deconvolution. This results in more meaningful inversion results and uncertainty estimation (compared to classic receiver function inversion). A rigorous likelihood function is derived for unbiased inversion results and the STF is efficiently inferred by a maximum-likelihood closed form expression that does not require deconvolution by noisy waveforms. Rather, deconvolution is only by predicted impulse responses for the unknown environment. For a given realization of the parameter vector which describes the medium below the station, data predictions are computed as the convolution of the impulse response and the maximum-likelihood source estimate for that medium. Therefore, the assumption of a Gaussian pulse with specified parameters, typical for the prediction of receiver functions, is not required. Directly inverting seismogram components has important consequences for the noise on the data. Since the signal processing does not require filtering and deconvolution, data errors (including measurement and theory errors) appear to be less correlated and more straightforward to model than those for receiver functions. The direct-seismogram inversion is demonstrated for simulated waveforms and applied to teleseismic data recorded for station Hyderabad on the Indian craton.",

            "abstract": "High porosity sandstone (HPS) is observed to fail, in field and laboratory settings, by the formation of localized bands. Bands perpendicular to the direction of the minimum principal stress (σIII), with pure compactant strain, are defined as compaction bands. Dilation bands form parallel to the σIII direction, with pure dilatant strain. Shear bands form at an angle to the σIII direction and have shear strain, with either compactant or dilatant strain normal to the band. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the behavior of HPS depends on the third stress invariant (J3) since it yields at a lower stress in extension, compared to loading under compression. In this work, existing constitutive models, which depend only on two stress invariants, were modified and new constitutive models, which incorporate the J3 dependence, were developed. Band orientation predictions were determined using the Rudnicki and Rice (1975) bifurcation theory. While HPS are typically tested under axisymmetric (AS) stress states in the laboratory, in the field non-AS states are more likely. The stress state is characterized by the intermediate principal stress (σII). Therefore, to investigate the influence of σIII on band orientation predictions, localization conditions were determined for non-AS stress states. The AS stress states are specialized cases where the dependence on J3 is inconsequential. Incorporating the J3 dependence significantly influenced localization conditions for stress states perturbed from AS compression, while the influence was small for stress states perturbed from AS extension. Under non-AS stress states, when a single yield surface constitutive model is appropriate, including the J3 dependence typically inhibits band formation, due to strongly negative critical hardening modulus (hcr). For load paths where a two yield surface constitutive model is applicable, with J3 dependence, shear bands were predicted. Compaction bands and dilation bands were predicted with a positive hcr, only under AS stress states. These results could be used to explain why these bands are rarely reported in the field, compared to shear bands.",

Our two-stage approach to earthquake early warning includes: (1) initial detection and characterization from PNSN strong-motion and broadband data with the ElarmS package within ShakeAlert, and then (2) modeling of GPS data from the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA). The two geodetic modeling modules are (1) a fast peak-ground-displacement magnitude and depth estimate and (2) a CMT-based finite fault inversion that utilizes coseismic offsets to compute earthquake extent, slip and magnitude. The seismic and geodetic source estimates are then combined in a decision module currently under development. In this presentation, we first report on the operational performance during the first several months that G-FAST has been live with respect to magnitude estimates, timing information, and stability. Secondly, we report on the performance of the G-FAST test system using simulated displacements from plausible Cascadian earthquake scenarios. The test system permits us to: (1) replay segments of actual seismic waveform data recorded from the PNSN and neighboring networks to investigate both earthquakes and noise conditions, and (2) broadcast synthetic data into the system to simulate signals we anticipate from earthquakes for which we have no actual ground motion recordings. The test system lets us also simulate various error conditions (latent and/or out-of-sequence data, telemetry drop-outs, etc.) in order to explore how best to mitigate them. For example, we show for a replay of the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake that telemetry drop-outs create the largest variability and biases in magnitude and depth estimates whereas latency only causes some variability towards the beginning of the recordings before quickly stabilizing towards a single solution. Each modeling module has different limitations imposed by latency, network architecture, noise, drop-outs, and earthquake size/location, and we finish by discussing how to best improve the robustness and timing of the warnings from G-FAST and challenges associated with integration into the ShakeAlert system.",

In spite of this, regional and global budget estimates leave little or no room for large emissions from these abundant landscape features, assuming that wetlands account for all biogenic CH4 released from northern boreal and arctic regions (Bruhwiler et al., 2014). Sources are partitioned into general categories using inverse (top-down) mass balance modeling of measured overall CH4 emissions and stable isotopic ratios of 13C/12C in the CH4 (δ13C-CH4). Source specific δ13C-CH4 and emission are also used in bottom-up models for comparison with atmospheric mixing and isotopic ratios (Bousquet et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2015). Here, we present a large, multiyear dataset on both δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 emitted via ebullition from three interconnected, subarctic post-glacial lakes. The isotopic signatures vary largely (-78.4 to -53.1‰ and -383.3 to -232.3, n = 171 and 251) and overlap those reported from the nearby wetland. Adding our data to the signatures of other studied lakes, we show that, overall, the δ13C-CH4 emitted from lakes range across all wetland signatures in the published literature. Based on this, we raise the question whether lake emissions are hidden isotopically and, thus, being double-counted within the estimates of other natural CH4 sources, such as wetlands.",

            "abstract": "A number of paleoisotope records from the Gulf of Alaska region attribute long-term shifts in δ18O and δ2H to changes in moisture source and air mass trajectory. However, the inability to fully quantify the modern relationship between proxy and climate has been problematic due to the paucity of modern precipitation isotopedata in this region. To provide these data, event-based sampling was used between 2005−2014 at Tideview sampling station in Anchorage, Alaska. Precipitation samples were analyzed for stable isotope ratios (δ18O, δ2H, d-excess) and examined in context of climate variables including temperature, air mass source and trajectory, precipitation amount, and relative humidity. Local surface air temperature explains a relatively small (< 30%) proportion of isotope variability, suggesting that paleoisotope archives related to precipitation might not be useful for quantitative temperature reconstructions in this area. Instead, results from a Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model demonstrate that air mass source and trajectory has the greatest influence on the isotopic composition of precipitation at our site. Specifically, lower (higher) δ18O (d-excess) values are associated with Arctic sourced moisture from the north, while Pacific marine sourced moisture from the south is characterized by the reverse (higher δ18O, lower d-excess).These findings have important implications for local and regional paleoisotope reconstructions which are often interpreted in terms of moisture source and trajectory variations, and which currently rely on a sparse network of isotope measurement sites from across NW North America. Furthermore, these new data highlight the relative importance of regional atmospheric circulation patterns and climate indices (e.g. the North Pacific Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) for determining the source, transport, and rain-out history of precipitating moisture in the Gulf of Alaska region.",

            "abstract": "Determining the presence, persistence, optical properties and variation in height and slope of surface water beneath the dense canopies of flooded forests and mangrove stands could contribute to studies of the acquisition of water and nutrients by plant roots. NASA’s airborne Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar (SIMPL) provides unique capabilities that can identify below-canopy surface water, measure its height with respect to vegetation constituents with sub-decimeter precision and quantify its slope. It also provides information on canopy structure and closure, the water column extinction profile as a proxy for turbidity and water depth, with the penetration depth constrained by turbidity. It achieves this by using four laser beams operating at two wavelengths with measurements of water surface elevation at 1064 nm (near infrared) and water column properties at 532 nm (green), analogous to a bathymetric lidar.\n Importantly the instrument adds a polarimetry function, like some atmospheric lidars, which measures the amount of depolarization determined by the degree to which the plane-parallel transmitted laser pulse energy is converted to the perpendicular state. The degree of depolarization is sensitive to the number of photon multiple-scattering events. For the water surface, which is specular consisting only of single-scattering events, the near-infrared received signal retains the parallel polarization state. Absence of the perpendicular signal uniquely identifies surface water. Penetration of green light and the depth profile of photons converted to the perpendicular state compared to those in the parallel state is a measure of water-column multiple scattering, providing a relative measure of turbidity. The amount of photons reflected from the canopy versus the water provides a wavelength-dependent measure of canopy closure. By rapidly firing laser pulses (11,400 pulses per second) with a narrow width (1 nsec) and detecting single photons with 8 cm ranging precision, the surface altimetry data is acquired with very high spatial and vertical resolution. Examples of these capabilities will be shown using data collected in 2011 along and across the flow axis of the Florida Everglades Shark River Slough, targeting the slough’s Long Term Ecology Research (LTER) field sites.",

            "abstract": "The 25 April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake occurred at the bottom edge of the locking portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), where the Indian plate under-thrusts the Himalayan wedge. The earthquake is followed by a number of large aftershocks but is not preceded by any foreshocks within ~3 weeks according to the NEIC, ISC and NSC catalog. However, a large portion of aftershocks could be missed due to either the contamination of the mainshock coda or small signal to noise ratio. It is also unclear whether there are foreshocks preceding the mainshock, the underlying physical processes of which are crucial for imminent seismic hazard assessment. Here, we employ the matched filter technique to recover the missing events from 22 April to 30 April. We collect 3-component broadband seismic waveforms recorded by one station in Nepal operated by Ev-K2-CNR, OGS Italy and eleven stations in Tibet operated by the China Earthquake Networks Center. We bandpass the seismograms to 1-6 Hz to retain high frequency energies. The template waveforms with high signal-to-noise ratios (> 5) are obtained at several closest stations. To detect and locate the events that occur around the templates, correlograms are shifted at each station with differential travel time as a function of source location based on the CRUST1.0 model. We find ~14 times more events than those listed in the ISC catalog. Some of the detected events are confirmed by visual inspections of the waveforms at the closest stations. The preliminary results show a streak of seismicity occurred around 2.5 days before the mainshock to the southeast of the mainshock hypocenter. The seismicity rate is elevated above the background level during this period of time and decayed subsequently following the Omori’s law. The foreshocks appear to migrate towards the hypocenter with logarithmic time ahead of the mainshock, which indicates possible triggering of the mainshock by the propagating afterslip of the foreshocks. Immediately after the mainshock the seismicity rate increased to the peak level during the period of observation. A large portion of aftershocks are located at ~100-150 km to the southeast of the hypocenter, where the expansion of aftershocks with logarithmic time is more prominent.",

Its main objectives, building on the heritage and experience of the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ERS and ENVISAT missions, are to measure sea-surface topography, sea- and land-surface temperature and ocean- and land-surface colour in support of ocean forecasting systems, and for environmental and climate monitoring. The series of Sentinel-3 satellites will ensure global, frequent and near-real time ocean, ice and land monitoring, with the provision of observation data in routine, long term (up to 20 years of operations) and continuous fashion, with a consistent quality and a high level of reliability and availability.\nThe Sentinel-3 missions will be jointly operated by ESA and EUMETSAT. ESA will be responsible for the operations, maintenance and evolution of the Sentinel-3 ground segment on land related products and EUMETSAT for the marine products. The Sentinel-3 ground segment systematically acquires, processes and distributes a set of pre-defined core data products. Sentinel-3A is foreseen to be launched at the beginning of November 2015.\nThe paper will give an overview on the mission, its instruments and objectives, the data products provided, the mechanisms to access the mission’s data, and if available first results.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster.pdf\nBy exploiting the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, GCM's can generate a statistical ensemble of future states in which the high frequency “weather\" is treated as a driving noise. Following Hasselman, 1976, this has lead to stochastic models that directly generate the noise, and model the low frequencies using systems of integer ordered linear ordinary differential equations, the most well known are the linear inverse models (LIM). These have been presented as a benchmark for decadal surface temperature forecast. Using the LIM, hindcast skills comparable to and sometimes even better than the skill of (coupled) Global Circulation Models (GCM's) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Nevertheless, the short range exponential temporal decorrelations implicit in the LIM models are unrealistic (the true decorrelations are closer to long range power laws), and - as a consequence - the useful limit to the forecast horizon is roughly one year: it enormously underestimates the memory of the system.\nIn presentation, we make a scaling analogue of the LIM: ScaLIng Macroweather Model (SLIMM) that exploits the power law (scaling) behavior in time of the temperature field and consequently, make use of the long history dependence of the data to improve the skill. The results predicted analytically by the model have been tested by performing actual hindcasts in different 5º x 5º regions on the planet using the Twentieth Century Reanalysis as a reference datasets. As a first step, we removed the anthropogenic component of each time series based on its sensitivity to equivalent CO2 concentration for the last 130 years, the residues are our estimates of the natural variability that SLIMM predicts. This residues were treated as fractional Gaussian noise processes with scaling exponent H between -0.5 and 0. The value of H for each grid-point can be obtained directly from the data. We report maps of theoretical skill predicted by the model and we compare it with actual skill based on hindcasts for monthly, seasonal and annual resolutions. A comparison between our results and previous results using LIM or other GCM's is also shown. The prediction skill obtained for the temperature field have been improved by incorporating some other fields and performing an analogous analysis on the generalized state-vectors.",

These factors interact with each other and non-linearly influence malaria transmission dynamics, making prediction and prevention challenging. Our work attempts to find a universality in the multi-dimensional system of malaria transmission and to develop a theory to predict emergence of malaria given a limited set of environmental and biological inputs.\nA credible malaria transmission dynamics model, HYDREMATS (Bomblies et al., 2008), was used under hypothetical settings to investigate the role of spatial and temporal distribution of vector breeding pools. HYDREMATS is a mechanistic model and capable of simulating the basic reproduction rate (Ro) without bold assumptions even under dynamic conditions. The spatial distribution of pools is mainly governed by hydrological factors; the impact of pool persistence and rainy season length on malaria transmission were investigated. Also analyzed was the impact of the temporal distribution of pools relative to human houses. We developed non-dimensional variables combining the hydrological and biological parameters. Simulated values of Ro from HYDREMATS are presented in a newly-introduced non-dimensional plane, which leads to a some-what universal theory describing the condition for sustainable malaria transmission. The findings were tested against observations both from the West Africa and the Ethiopian Highland, representing diverse hydroclimatological conditions. Predicated Ro values from the theory over the two regions are in good agreement with the observed malaria transmission data.",

            "abstract": "The Aquistore Project, located in SE Saskatchewan, Canada, is a demonstration project for CO2 storage in a deep saline aquifer. CO2 captured from a nearby coal-fired power plant is being injected into a brine-filled sandstone formation at 3100-3300 m depth. CO2 injection commenced in April, 2015, at initial rates of up to 250 tonnes per day. Seismic monitoring methods have been employed to track the subsurface CO2 plume and to record any injection-induced microseismicity. Active seismic methods utilized include 4D surface seismics using a sparse permanent array, 4D vertical seismic profiles (VSP) with both downhole geophones and a fiber optic distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) system. Pre-injection baseline seismic surveys have established very good repeatability with NRMS values as low as 0.07. 3D finite-difference seismic modelling of fluid flow simulations is used with the repeatability estimates to determine the appropriate timing for the first CO2 monitor surveys. Time-lapse logging is being conducted on a regular basis to provide in situ measurement of the change in seismic velocity associated with changes in CO2 saturation. Continuous passive seismic recording has been ongoing since the summer of 2012 to establish background local seismicity prior to the start of CO2 injection. Passive monitoring is being conducted using two, 2.5 km long, orthogonal linear arrays of surface geophones.with 3-component short-period geophones, 3 broadband surface seismometers, and an array of 3-component short-period geophones in an observation well. No significant injection-related seismicity (Mw > -1) has been detected at the surface during the first 4 months of CO2 injection. On-going analysis of the downhole passive data will provide further information as to the occurrence of lower magnitude microseismicity (Mw of -1 to -3).",

            "abstract": "Papyrus wetlands in East Africa are rapidly being converted to agricultural production in an effort to increase food security. This conversion is often seasonal, with wetlands being used for grazing and crop production of maize, sugarcane, and rice during dry seasons, and flooding occurring during wet seasons. An important question with respect to greenhouse gas production is whether wetland conversion to agriculture increases N2O fluxes. This trend has been shown in temperate regions where increased N2O fluxes are positively related to low soil C:N ratios, especially when soil moisture content remains high. In order to examine whether denitrification contributes to N2O flux, we measured potential denitrification rates (PDR by acetylene block method) in intact papyrus wetlands and agricultural converted wetlands in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda, and also performed multivariate analysis to relate soil characteristics to PDR. Agricultural land-cover types included maize, sugarcane, rice, and grazing. Results showed that intact wetlands are potentially important sources of N2O, as PDR in papyrus vegetation were consistently the highest (p<0.05; 128 - 601 μg N2O g DW-1 hour-1) while grazing sites showed the lowest (0.1 - 0.5 μg N2O g DW-1 hour-1). Rates were second highest in rice fields (2.3 - 303 μg N2O g DW-1 hour-1), and intermediate in maize and sugarcane (6.5 - 75 μmg N2O g DW-1 hour-1 and 5 - 30 μg N2O g DW-1 hour-1 respectively). PDR across all sites was inversely related to soil C:N ratio, with nitrate consistently limiting PDR in the wetland sites while soil carbon limited PDR in agricultural sites. This is seemingly in contrast with other findings that show that lower C:N ratios result in high N2O fluxes from drained wetland sites. However, flux measurements along with more realistic process-based measurements of denitrification are urgently needed to more fully understand the effect of agricultural conversion of wetlands in East Africa.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster-3.pdf\nThe region of Chiles and Cerro Negro volcanoes, located on the Colombian-Ecuadorian border, has experienced an ongoing seismic swarm beginning in Aug. 2013. Based on concern for local residents and authorities, a cooperative broadband monitoring network was installed by the Servicio Geológico Colombiano in Colombia and the Instituto Geofísico of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional in Ecuador. Since November 2013 more than 538,000 earthquakes were recorded; although since May 2015 the seismicity has decreased significantly to an average of 70 events per day.\nThree large earthquake swarms with increasing energy occurred in Aug.-Oct. 2013, March-May 2014, and Sept.-Dec. 2014. By the end of 2014, roughly 400 earthquakes greater than M 3 had occurred with a maximum rate of 8000 earthquakes per day. The largest earthquake was a 5.6 ML on Oct. 20, 2014. This event produced an InSAR coseismic deformation of ~23 cm (S. Ebmeier, personal communication). Most events are typical brittle failure volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes that are located in a cluster beneath the southern flank of Chiles volcano, with depths between 1.5 and 10 km. Although the great majority of earthquakes are VT, some low-frequency (LF, ~0.5 Hz) and very-low-frequency (VLF) events have occurred. Particle motion analysis suggests that the VLF source migrated with time. While a VLF on Oct. 15, 2014 was located south of Chiles volcano, near the InSAR source, the VLF registered on Feb. 14, 2015 was likely located very close to Chiles Volcano.\nWe infer that magma intrusion and resulting fluid exsolution at depths greater than 5 km are driving seismicity in the Chiles-Cerro Negro region. However earthquakes are failing in a manner consistent with regional tectonics. Relative relocations reveal a structure consistent with mapped regional faults. Thus seismicity is likely controlled by an interaction of magmatic and tectonic processes. Because the regional stress field is highly compressional and the volcanoes are long dormant, magma and fluids cannot easily ascend. No degassing or changes in the hydrothermal system have been detected. Based on the accumulated seismic moment and the distal VT model of White and McCausland, we estimate a volume of intruded magma close to 35 million m3.",

            "abstract": "We developed two ultra-wideband (UWB) radars for measurements over the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and sea ice. One of the UWB radars operates over a 150-600 MHz frequency range with a large, cross-track 24-element array. It is designed to sound ice, image the ice-bed interface, and map internal layers with fine resolution. The 24-element array consists of three 8-element sub-arrays. One of these sub-arrays is mounted under the fuselage of a BT-67 aircraft; the other two are mounted under the wings. The polarization of each antenna element can be individually reconfigured depending on the target of interest. The measured inflight VSWR is less than 2 over the operating range. The fuselage sub-array is used both for transmission and reception, and the wing-mounted sub-arrays are used for reception. The transmitter consists of an 8-channel digital waveform generator to synthesize chirped pulses of selectable pulse width, duration, and bandwidth. It also consists of drivers and power amplifiers to increase the power level of each individual channel to about 1 kW and a fast high-power transmit/receive switch. Each receiver consists of a limiter, switches, low-noise and driver amplifiers, and filters to shape and amplify received signals to the level required for digitization. The digital sub-section consists of timing and control sub-systems and 24 14-bit A/D converters to digitize received signals at a rate of 1.6 GSPS. The radar performance is evaluated using an optical delay line to simulate returns from about 2 km thick ice, and the measured radar loop sensitivity is about 215 dB. The other UWB microwave radar operates over a 2-18 GHz frequency range in Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FM-CW) mode. It is designed to sound more than 1 m of snow over sea ice and map internal layers to a depth about 25-40 m in polar firn and ice. We operated the microwave radar over snow-covered sea ice and mapped snow as thin as 5 cm and as thick as 60 cm. We mapped internal layers with an early version of the radar to a depth of 45 m with fine resolution in West Antarctica.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss design considerations and present laboratory results to document radar performance, including the impulse response functions. We will also show the results from a field campaign over the Greenland ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Solar UV radiation in a wavelength range between 280 to 400 nm has both positive and negative influences on human body. Surface UV radiation is the main natural source of vitamin D, providing the promotion of bone and musculoskeletal health and reducing the risk of a number of cancers and other medical conditions. However, overexposure to surface UV radiation is significantly related with the majority of skin cancer, in addition other negative health effects such as sunburn, skin aging, and some forms of eye cataracts. Therefore, it is important to estimate the optimal UV exposure time, representing a balance between reducing negative health effects and maximizing sufficient vitamin D production.\nPrevious studies calculated erythemal UV and vitamin-D UV from the measured and modelled spectral irradiances, respectively, by weighting CIE Erythema and Vitamin D3 generation functions (Kazantzidis et al., 2009; Fioletov et al., 2010). In particular, McKenzie et al. (2009) suggested the algorithm to estimate vitamin-D production UV from erythemal UV (or UV index) and determined the optimum conditions of UV exposure based on skin type Ⅱ according to the Fitzpatrick (1988). Recently, there are various demands for risks and benefits of surface UV radiation on public health over Korea, thus it is necessary to estimate optimal UV exposure time suitable to skin type of East Asians. This study examined the relationship between erythemally weighted UV (UVEry) and vitamin D weighted UV (UVVitD) over Korea during 2004-2012. The temporal variations of the ratio (UVVitD/UVEry) were also analyzed and the ratio as a function of UV index was applied in estimating the optimal UV exposure time. In summer with high surface UV radiation, short exposure time leaded to sufficient vitamin D and erythema and vice versa in winter. Thus, the balancing time in winter was enough to maximize UV benefits and minimize UV risks.",

            "abstract": "The Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogen was formed through the collision of the North and South China blocks, but the precise timing of the closure of the Paleo-Tethys ocean between the two blocks remains debated. Large volumes of Triassic granites associated with mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) were emplaced in the Qinling terrane. This paper presents field observations, petrography, geochronology and geochemistry of the MMEs and their host granites from the Dewulu pluton in West Qinling. The host rocks comprise granodiorite and granodioritic porphyry, and the The MMEs range in composition from gabbroic diorite to diorite. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages suggest that the granites and MMEs were coeval at ca. 245 Ma. The granites are relatively enriched in LILE and depleted in HFSE, and have evolved Sr-Nd-Pb and zircon Hf isotopic compositions [initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7070-0.7076, εNd(t) = -7.5 to -6.8, εHf(t) = -8.2 to -4.2], indicative of an origin from the amphibolitic lower crust. The near-primitive gabbro-dioritic MMEs bear a remarkable geochemical resemblance to the high-magnesium andesite (HMA), such as moderate SiO2 (~55 wt.%), low FeOT/MgO (~0.75), high Cr (268-308 ppm) and MgO (8.58-8.77 wt.%) with Mg# of ~70. Additionally, they exhibit lower initial 87Sr/86Sr, higher εNd(t) and εHf(t), and more radiogenic Pb isotopes than the dioritic MMEs which share similar isotopic compositions with the granites. These features, together with the presence of the specific minerals in the MMEs (e.g., felsic xenocrysts and acicular apatite), point to mixing process between the lower crust-derived magmas and the melts produced by the reaction of the subducting sediment-derived components and the overlying mantle. Taking into account the regional occurrence of synchronous plutonic-volcanic complexes (250-234 Ma) ranging from basaltic to granitic variants, we suggest that the Dewulu pluton formed in an active continental margin in response to the local extension triggered by the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys ocean, thus supporting the east-to-west diachronous collision between the North and South China blocks.\n Key words: Magma mixing; Granites; Mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs); Continental collision; West Qinling",

On classical computational platforms, the physical domain of a satellite data assimilation problem is represented by a discrete variable transform, and classical minimization algorithms are employed to find optimal solution of the analysis cost function. The computation becomes intensive and time-consuming when the problem involves large number of variables and data. The new quantum computer opens a very different approach both in conceptual programming and in hardware architecture for solving optimization problem. In order to explore if we can utilize the quantum computing machine architecture, we formulate a satellite data assimilation experimental case in the form of quadratic programming optimization problem. We find a transformation of the problem to map it into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) framework. Binary Wavelet Transform (BWT) will be applied to the data assimilation variables for its invertible decomposition and all calculations in BWT are performed by Boolean operations. The transformed problem will be experimented as to solve for a solution of QUBO instances defined on Chimera graphs of the quantum computer.",

            "abstract": "It is widely recognized that reproducibility is crucial to advance science, but at the same time it is very hard to actually achieve. This results in it being recognized but also mostly ignored by a large fraction of the community. A key ingredient towards full reproducibility is to capture and describe the history of data, an issue known as provenance. We present SEIS-PROV, a practical format and data model to store provenance information for seismological data.\nIn a seismological context, provenance can be seen as information about the processes that generated and modified a particular piece of data. For synthetic waveforms the provenance information describes which solver and settings therein were used to generate it. When looking at processed seismograms, the provenance conveys information about the different time series analysis steps that led to it. Additional uses include the description of derived data types, such as cross-correlations and adjoint sources, enabling their proper storage and exchange.\nSEIS-PROV is based on W3C PROV (http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/), a standard for generic provenance information. It then applies an additional set of constraints to make it suitable for seismology. We present a definition of the SEIS-PROV format, a way to check if any given file is a valid SEIS-PROV document, and two sample implementations: One in SPECFEM3D GLOBE (https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d_globe/) to store the provenance information of synthetic seismograms and another one as part of the ObsPy (http://obspy.org) framework enabling automatic tracking of provenance information during a series of analysis and transformation stages.\nThis, along with tools to visualize and interpret provenance graphs, offers a description of data history that can be readily tracked, stored, and exchanged.",

            "abstract": "The U. S. Geological Survey is developing a National Hydrologic Model (NHM) to support consistent hydrologic modeling across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) simulates daily hydrologic and energy processes in watersheds, and is used for the NHM application. For PRMS each watershed is divided into hydrologic response units (HRUs); by default each HRU is assumed to have a uniform hydrologic response.\nThe Geospatial Fabric (GF) is a database containing initial parameter values for input to PRMS and was created for the NHM. The parameter values in the GF were derived from datasets that characterize the physical features of the entire CONUS. The NHM application is composed of more than 100,000 HRUs from the GF. Selected parameter values commonly are adjusted by basin in PRMS using an automated calibration process based on calibration targets, such as streamflow. Providing each HRU with distinct values that captures variability within the CONUS may improve simulation performance of the NHM. During calibration of the NHM by HRU, selected parameter values are adjusted for PRMS based on calibration targets, such as streamflow, snow water equivalent (SWE) and actual evapotranspiration (AET). Simulated SWE, AET, and runoff were compared to value ranges derived from multiple sources (e.g. the Snow Data Assimilation System, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (i.e. MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration Project, the Simplified Surface Energy Balance model, and the Monthly Water Balance Model). This provides each HRU with a distinct set of parameter values that captures the variability within the CONUS, leading to improved model performance. We present simulation results from the NHM after preliminary calibration, including the results of basin-level calibration for the NHM using: 1) default initial GF parameter values, and 2) parameter values calibrated by HRU.",

Kepler space telescope discoveries of exo-planets indicate that planets of this type are among the most ubiquitous universally and therefore a future mission to explore the nature of the Ice Giants in our own solar system will provide insights into the nature of extra-solar system objects in general. Uranus has the smallest self- luminosity of all the planets, potentially related to catastrophic events early in the planet’s history, which also may explain Uranus’ large obliquity. Uranus’ atmosphere is subject to extreme seasonal forcing making it unique in the Solar System. Neptune is also unique in a number of ways, notably its large moon Triton which is likely a captured Kuiper Belt Object and one of only two moons in the solar system with a robustly collisional atmosphere. Similar to Uranus, the angle between the solar wind and the magnetic dipole axis is subject to large-amplitude variations on both diurnal and seasonal timescales, but peculiarly it has one of the quietest magnetospheres of the solar system, at least according to Voyager 2, the only spacecraft to encounter Neptune to date. A comprehensive mission, as advocated in the Decadal Survey, would provide enormous science return but is also challenging and expensive. In this presentation we will discuss mission scenarios and suggest how collaboration between disciplines and internationally can help us to pursue a mission that includes Ice Giant exploration.",

The model combines the first principles ionosphere model SAMI3/ESF and the ray trace code MoJo-15. The location of HF heating is calculated by simulating the ray path through the ionosphere and determining the average heating location. This new model has been used to successfully simulate the snapback effect discovered in a Arecibo HF heating experiment described by Bernhardt et al. [1988]. The simulations provide new insight into the physical mechanism for snapback. As Bernhardt et al. [1988] hypothesized, the heater wave is refracted by the density cavity, thus causing the location of heating to drift in longitude. The cause of snapback, however, is not that the ray snaps back to its original configuration once the density cavity has convected out of range. Instead, the density cavity convects into the path of the refracted ray such that only a small portion of the ray near the original heating location is above the threshold for HF heating. The heating location thus suddenly snaps back to the original location but the ray itself is still refracted in longitude.",

The extent of wetted channels and the magnitude of flow in these channels are rarely documented; and as yet, no general theory exists that enables the prediction of these key ecosystem properties. In the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, contrasting lithology, vegetation and aspect produce watersheds with diverse ecology and hydrology. In this study, channel surveys were conducted in five headwater drainage networks (1 to 17 km2) in Mendocino County, California in the early and late summers of 2012, 2014 and 2015. Channel width, depth, velocity, water temperature, air temperature, humidity and water isotope data were collected and revisited at all flow sources and select channel locations. In the Coastal Belt (argillite and inter-bedded sandstone) of the Franciscan Complex, springs, mostly fixed in location, controlled the extent of flow. Identical wetted channel drainage densities (or WCDDs, about 1.94 km/km2 in early summer and 1.44 km/km2 in late summer) were found in adjacent watersheds of different sizes for entire watersheds. These surveys were conducted during a period of sustained, multi-year drought, and, despite this, the drainage from groundwater, perched in the critical zone, sustained stream flow. Aspect, however, significantly influenced WCDDs within a watershed, with south-facing slope WCDDs decreasing 3-fold during the summer, and north-facing WCDDs decreasing by only 23%. Sap-flow data suggest that different tree types on the north (primarily Douglas Firs) and south-facing (hardwood evergreens) slopes likely play a role in this dichotomy. WCDDs in nearby watersheds, underlain by mélange, were much lower than in the argillite; and, by late summer the channel system was nearly entirely dry, suggesting much less seasonal groundwater storage is in this bedrock. Our data suggest that lithology can have a primary control on the extent of wetted channels, but that aspect and associated vegetation can locally strongly influence water delivery to channels.",

However, corals are known to exhibit significant “vital effects” (i.e., non-equilibrium mineral compositions) in δ18O, which complicates its application in paleoclimate studies, and may also exhibit clumped isotope disequilibrium. Here we determined mass 47 anomalies (Δ47) in CO2 derived from cultured shallow water and live-collected deep-sea coral.\nIn a species of cultured surface water coral, we find disequilibrium Δ47 and δ18O values that are consistent with a pH effect driving disequilibrium isotopic signatures. We go on to show that culturing specimens at elevated CO2 conditions drives changes in both Δ47 and δ18O that follows the same relationship defined for pH effects in inorganic carbonate precipitation experiments. This suggests that dissolved inorganic carbon speciation at the site of calcification and therefore fluid pH can effect the clumped isotope composition of biogenic minerals. In two different live-collected deep-sea coral taxa, we find distinct clumped isotope signatures and Δ47-temperature calibration relationships.",

            "abstract": "Beginning in 1978, the satellite passive microwave data record has been a mainstay of remote sensing of the cryosphere, providing twice-daily, near-global spatial coverage for monitoring changes in hydrologic and cryospheric parameters that include precipitation, soil moisture, surface water, vegetation, snow water equivalent, sea ice concentration and sea ice motion. Currently available global gridded passive microwave data sets serve a diverse community of hundreds of data users, but do not meet many requirements of modern Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) or Climate Data Records (CDRs), most notably in the areas of intersensor calibration, quality-control, provenance and consistent processing methods. The original gridding techniques were relatively primitive and were produced on 25 km grids using the original EASE-Grid definition that is not easily accommodated in modern software packages. Further, since the first Level 3 data sets were produced, the Level 2 passive microwave data on which they were based have been reprocessed as Fundamental CDRs (FCDRs) with improved calibration and documentation. We are funded by NASA MEaSUREs to reprocess the historical gridded data sets as EASE-Grid 2.0 ESDRs, using the most mature available Level 2 satellite passive microwave (SMMR, SSM/I-SSMIS, AMSR-E) records from 1978 to the present. We have produced prototype data from SSM/I and AMSR-E for the year 2003, for review and feedback from our Early Adopter user community. The prototype data set includes conventional, low-resolution (\"drop-in-the-bucket\" 25 km) grids and enhanced-resolution grids derived from the two candidate image reconstruction techniques we are evaluating: 1) Backus-Gilbert (BG) interpolation and 2) a radiometer version of Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR). We summarize our temporal subsetting technique, algorithm tuning parameters and computational costs, and include sample SSM/I images at enhanced resolutions of up to 3 km. We are actively working with our Early Adopters to finalize content and format of this new, consistently-processed high-quality satellite passive microwave ESDR.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_A_Irani_Rahaghi_poster1.pdf\nIn many lakes, surface heat flux (SHF) is the most important component controlling the lake’s energy content. Accurate methods for the determination of SHF are valuable for water management, and for use in hydrological and meteorological models. Large lakes, not surprisingly, are subject to spatially and temporally varying meteorological conditions, and hence SHF. Here, we report on an investigation for estimating the SHF of a large European lake, Lake Geneva.\nWe evaluated several bulk formulas to estimate Lake Geneva’s SHF based on different data sources. A total of 64 different surface heat flux models were realized using existing representations for different heat flux components. Data sources to run the models included meteorological data (from an operational numerical weather prediction model, COSMO-2) and lake surface water temperature (LSWT, from satellite imagery). Models were calibrated at two points in the lake for which regular depth profiles of temperature are available, and which enabled computation of the total heat content variation. The latter, computed for 03.2008-12.2012, was the metric used to rank the different models.\nThe best calibrated model was then selected to calculate the spatial distribution of SHF. Analysis of the model results shows that evaporative and convective heat fluxes are the dominant terms controlling the spatial pattern of SHF. The former is significant in all seasons while the latter plays a role only in fall and winter. Meteorological observations illustrate that wind-sheltering, and to some extent relative humidity variability, are the main reasons for the observed large-scale spatial variability. In addition, both modeling and satellite observations indicate that, on average, the eastern part of the lake is warmer than the western part, with a greater temperature contrast in spring and summer than in fall and winter whereas the SHF spatial splitting is stronger in fall and winter. This is mainly due to negative heat flux values (net cooling) and stronger wind forcing, and consequently stronger mixing, in cold seasons.",

            "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are being widely detected in wastewater and surface waters. As fresh water becomes scarcer, interests in using reclaimed water for crop irrigation is intensified. Since reclaimed waters often carry trace levels of pharmaceuticals, accumulation of pharmaceuticals in food crops could increase the risk of human exposure. This study aims to investigate uptake and accumulations of pharmaceuticals in greenhouse-grown lettuce under contrasting irrigation practices (i.e., overhead and surface irrigations). Lettuce was irrigated with water spiked with 11 commonly used pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, carbadox, trimethoprim, lincomycin hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, monensin sodium, and tylosin). Weekly sampling of lettuce roots, shoots, and soils were continued for 5 weeks, and the samples were freeze dried, extracted for pharmaceuticals and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Preliminary results indicate that higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in overhead irrigated lettuce compared to surface irrigated lettuce. For carbamezapine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, and monensin sodium, their concentrations generally increased in lettuce shoots in the overhead treatment over time. However, acetaminophen was found at higher concentrations in both shoots and roots, indicating that acetaminophen can be easily transported in the plant system. This study provides insight on developing better strategies for using reclaimed water for crop irrigations, while minimizing the potential risks of pharmaceutical contamination of vegetables.",

In addition to the mass and speed of these lofted particles, LDEX is sensitive to their charge. The resulting signatures of impact events therefore provide valuable information about not only the ambient plasma environment, but also the speed vectors of these dust grains. Here, impact events produced from LDEX’s calibration at the Dust Accelerator Laboratory are analyzed using an image charge model derived from the electrostatic simulation program, Coulomb.

The control matrix was derived from the results of Kuang (2010, 2012) who fitted a linear response function from a cloud resolving model in a state of deep convecting equilibrium. By editing this matrix in physical space and eigenspace, scaling and clipping its action, and optionally adding terms for processes that do not conserve moist statice energy (radiation, surface fluxes), we can decompose and explain the model's diverse moist process coupled variability. Recitified effects of this variability on the general circulation and climate, even in strictly zero-mean centered anomaly physic cases, also are sometimes surprising.",

Around the latitudes of stations under consideration, the geomagnetic field lines are typically connected to the outermost region of magnetosphere. Using magnetic field variations recorded at these stations, we examine characteristics of the Pc5 band (frequency ~2-10 mHz) ULF activity. We observe that Pc5 activity, in general, maximizes near magnetic noon in both the hemispheres. Its amplitude appears related with the speed of the solar wind. For the selected events when the footprints of CLUSTER satellites were close to the ground stations, strikingly similar waveforms were observed on the ground and in the magnetosphere. Possible cause for generation of Pc5 waves at very high latitudes and the ionospheric modulation have been discussed.",

One of the goals of IODP Expedition 352 was to test the supra-subduction zone ophiolite model by drilling forearc crust at the northern Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) system. IBM forearc drilling successfully cored 1.22 km of volcanic lavas and underlying dikes at four sites. A surprising observation is that basement compressional velocities measured from downhole logging average ~3.0 km/s, compared to values of 5 km/s at similar basement depths at oceanic crust sites 504B and 1256D. Typically there is an inverse relationship in extrusive lavas between velocity and porosity, but downhole logging shows similar porosities for the IBM and oceanic crust sites, despite the large difference in measured compressional velocities. These observations can be explained by a difference in crack morphologies between IBM forearc and oceanic crust, with a smaller fractional area of asperity contact across cracks at EXP 352 sites than at sites 504B and 1256D. Seismic profiles at the IBM forearc image many faults, which may be related to the crack population.",

The embedded CRMs make it possible to apply CRM-based cloud microphysics directly within a GCM. However, most such schemes have never been tested in a global environment for long-term climate simulation. The benefits of using an MMF to evaluate rigorously and improve microphysics schemes are here demonstrated. Four one-moment microphysical schemes are implemented into the Goddard MMF and their results validated against three CloudSat/CALIPSO cloud ice products, CloudSat/CALIPSO cloud fractions, and other satellite data. The new four-class (cloud ice, snow, graupel, and frozen drops/hail) ice scheme produces a better overall spatial distribution of cloud ice amount and total cloud radiative forcing than earlier three-class ice schemes, with biases within the observational uncertainties. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to examine the impact of recently upgraded microphysical processes on global hydrometeor distributions. Five processes dominate the global distributions of cloud ice and snow amount in long-term simulations: (1) allowing for ice supersaturation in the saturation adjustment, (2) three additional correction terms in the depositional growth of cloud ice to snow, (3) accounting for cloud ice fall speeds, (4) limiting cloud ice particle size, and (5) new size-mapping schemes for snow/graupel as functions of temperature and mixing ratio. Despite the cloud microphysics improvements, systematic errors associated with sub-grid processes and cyclic lateral boundaries in the embedded CRMs remain and will require future improvement.",

            "abstract": "Southern Africa is the world’s largest emitter of biomass burning aerosols. The westward transport of these wildfire aerosols over the remote southeast Atlantic collocates with the Earth’s major subtropical stratocumulus decks occurring in the marine boundary layer. Wildfire aerosols can significantly perturb the properties of marine stratocumulus through the microphysical effect (as CCN) and the radiative effect (as shortwave absorber); however, the relative importance of these two effects varies within 24 hours mainly due to the diurnal cycle of solar insolation. Given the fact that the strong diurnal cycles of stratocumulus are also largely controlled by the solar insolation, the wildfire aerosols are very likely to exert an additional significant effect on the diurnal cycles of stratocumulus.\nTo prove this hypothesis, we examine the roles of wildfire aerosols in observed diurnal cycles of stratocumulus clouds using the WRF-Chem model in conjunction with satellite observations. Wildfire aerosol emissions are generated from fire radiative power detected by SEVIRI onboard Meteosat. The wildfire aerosols are treated as the internal mixture of OC, BC, and other inorganic components, and coupled with the microphysics and radiation schemes in WRF-Chem. We thoroughly compare the diurnal variations in modeled cloud properties, such as LWP and cloud fraction among 1) the case with both microphysical and radiative effects of wildfire aerosols (the reference case), 2) the case with only microphysical effect, and 3) the case with no wildfire aerosols. The differences in cloud properties are interpreted as the effects of wildfire aerosol. The wildfire aerosol, cloud, and radiation fields modeled by the reference case are validated against satellite observations, including MODIS aerosol optical depth, cloud fraction/LWP, CALIPSO aerosol-cloud overlapping frequency, and CERES radiative fluxes. The modeling results show that the microphysical effect of wildfire aerosols significantly increases cloud fraction and LWP during the night and morning. From noon to afternoon, the positive changes in cloud fraction and LWP decrease due to a stronger entrainment process. Meanwhile, the radiative effect of wildfire aerosols can slightly mitigate the decreases in cloud fraction and LWP near the coast region.",

Despite the success of this technology, uncertainties associated with basic transport processes require understanding in order to improve efficiency and minimize environmental impacts. The hydraulic fracturing process introduces large volumes of water into shale gas reservoirs. Most of the fracturing water remains in reservoirs to interfere with gas production. The quantification of the amount of water retained in shale gas reservoirs is crucial for predicting gas shale formation productivity and for optimizing extraction conditions. In this study, water vapor adsorption isotherms were gravimetrically measured on granular fractions of Woodford formation shales sieved after crushing. The isotherms were obtained at 30℃ and 50℃, for relative humidities from 11.1% to 97.0%. Water adsorption in these shale grains conformed to the typeⅡisotherm, and were nearly identical for the two experimental temperatures. In order to better understand the isotherms, a computational model based on the Maxwell-Stefan Diffusion equations (MSDM) was constructed to analyze the water adsorption and gas diffusion in shale grains. Based on the experimental results, the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) isotherm model for gas adsorption was included in the model.",

            "abstract": "Primary metrics for measuring earthquake early warning (EEW) system and algorithm performance are the rate of false alarms and the uncertainty in earthquake parameters. The Onsite algorithm, currently one of three EEW algorithms implemented in ShakeAlert, uses the ground-motion period parameter (τc) and peak initial displacement parameter (Pd) to estimate the magnitude and expected ground shaking of an ongoing earthquake. It is the only algorithm originally designed to issue single station alerts, necessitating that results from individual stations be as reliable and accurate as possible.\nThe ShakeAlert system has been undergoing testing on continuous real-time data in California for several years, and the latest version of the Onsite algorithm for several months. This permits analysis of the response to a range of signals, from environmental noise to hardware testing and maintenance procedures to moderate or large earthquake signals at varying distances from the networks. We find that our existing discriminator, relying only on τc and Pd, while performing well to exclude large teleseismic events, is less effective for moderate regional events and can also incorrectly exclude data from local events. Motivated by these experiences, we use a collection of waveforms from potentially problematic 'noise' events and real earthquakes to explore methods to discriminate real and false events, using the ground motion and period parameters available in Onsite's processing methodology.\nOnce an event is correctly identified, a magnitude and location estimate is critical to determining the expected ground shaking. Scatter in the measured parameters translates to higher than desired uncertainty in Onsite's current calculations We present an overview of alternative methods, including incorporation of polarization information, to improve parameter determination for a test suite including both large (M4 to M7) events and three years of small to moderate events across California.",

            "abstract": "We examined the effect of capillary action and lubrication of grains on bulk friction angles through tilting chute experiments. In each experiment, we screed a bed of 5mm gravels in 65cm long x 18cm wide tilting chute with fixed roughness and slowly tilted the chute until a granular avalanche occurred. We performed these experiments under three conditions: with dry grains, with a bed that had been submerged and subsequently drained such that no water occupied the pore space, and with the entire apparatus submerged under water such that the bed is saturated. In addition, for each of these cases, we performed experiments with 5, 10, and 15cm bed thicknesses. In the dry case, the bed failed at ~ 41º, and bed thickness did not have a significant effect on failure angle. In the drained case, friction angles increased from 46.5º to 50.9º with increasing bed thickness. In the submerged case, the bed failed at angles not significantly different than those from the dry case, and they did not vary with bed thickness. The increase in friction angles between the dry and drained cases suggests that addition of the water induces a cohesive effect on the grains. Because the pore pressure from the saturated bed removes capillary effects but retains lubrication effects, the submerged case data suggest that capillary action is primarily responsible for the observed increases in friction angle and effects from grain lubrication are negligible. Further study is ongoing to fully understand the effect of capillary action on bulk friction angles in unsaturated gravel and why it appears to increase with bed thickness.",

The project’s goal was to prepare precise maps at large scales of selected small glaciers to form a permanent record of the condition of these glaciers so that at a future date they could be resurveyed and compared. Continued surveys would give the history of wastage and accumulation, and more accurate interpretation of the response of these glaciers to meteorological and other factors. The resulting maps and a descriptive summary brochure were published in 1960 by the American Geographical Society. The USGS Global Fiducials Program (GFP) began to systematically image the same nine glaciers approximately half-century after its IGY mapping. The results of the GFP analyses would permit the types of comparisons that were envisioned by the IGY project. Imagery of each of these nine glaciers has been collected from multiple sources, including Next View licensed commercial imagery, vertical and oblique aerial photography, Landsat, and US National Imagery Systems. Exploitation of the imagery has resulted in the production of new 21st century maps that can be compared and contrasted with the vintage AGS map set. Comparison will permit the calculation of a number of parameters which will provide a direct insight into the changes that northwestern North American glaciers have been experiencing during the past half century. Specifically, these comparisons will permit the calculation of changes in glacier length, area, thickness, and volume; computation of rates of glacier advance and/or retreat, rates of glacier thickening and/or thinning, and rates of volume change; production of digital elevation models (DEMs); and generation of velocity fields from crevasse migration. The subsequent re-mapping and comparison to the 1950s maps will provide a unique survey of glacier change across western North America from Alaska to northwestern Washington. Each pair of glacier maps will be accompanied with a summary document describing the changes that have occurred at that glacier. From north to south, the nine IGY glaciers span a distance of more than 2,600 km.",

            "abstract": "Despite evidence of rapid shrub expansion at many Arctic sites and the profound effects this has on ecosystem structure, biogeochemical cycling, and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Arctic, the drivers of shrub growth remain poorly understood.\nThe compilation of 41,576 annual shrub growth measurements made around the Arctic, allowed for the first systematic evaluation of the climate sensitivity of Arctic shrub growth, i.e. the strength of the relationship between annual shrub growth and monthly climate variables. The growth measurements were taken on 1821 plants of 25 species at 37 arctic and alpine sites, either as annual ring widths or as stem increments. We evaluated climate sensitivity of shrub growth for each genus-by-site combination in this data set based on the performance and parameters of linear mixed models that used CRU TS3.21 climate data as predictors of shrub growth between 1950 and 2010.\n76% of genus-by-site combinations showed climate sensitive growth, but climate-growth relationships varied with soil moisture, species canopy height, and geographic position within the species ranges. Shrubs growing at sites with more soil moisture showed greater climate sensitivity, suggesting that water availability might limit shrub growth if continued warming isn’t matched by a steady increase in soil moisture. Tall shrub species growing at their northern range limit were particularly climate sensitive causing climate sensitivity of shrubs to peak at the transition between Low and High Arctic, where carbon storage in permafrost is greatest.\nLocal and regional studies have documented matching spatial and temporal patterns in dendrochronological measurements and satellite observations of vegetation indices both in boreal and Arctic regions. Yet the circumarctic comparison of patterns in dendrochronological and remote sensing data sets yielded poor levels of agreement. In much of the Arctic, steep environmental gradients generate fine spatial patterns of vegetation composition and climate sensitivity, making it particularly difficult to reconcile observations of vegetation at disparate scales. We show how the systematic analysis of higher resolution remote sensing data sets, such as the Sentinel mission and the legacy Landsat data, provide opportunities to bridge this scale gap.",

These dynamics are seen in higher gradient portions of Arctic rivers where surface heat fluxes can dominates river energy balances and low hillslope storage produce rapidly varying hydrographs. Additionally, arctic river geometry can be highly dynamic in the face of thermal erosion of permafrost landscape. While direct in-situ measurements of channel cross sectional geometry are accurate, they are limited in spatial resolution and coverage, and can be access limited in remote areas. Remote sensing can help gather data at high spatial resolutions and large areas, however techniques for extracting channel geometry is often limited to the banks and flood plains adjacent to river, as the water column inhibits sensing of the river bed itself. Green light LiDAR can be used to map bathymetry, however this is expensive, difficult to obtain at large spatial scales, and dependent on water quality. Alternatively, 3D photogrammetry from aerial imagery can be used to analyze the non-wetted portion of the river channel, but extracting full cross sections requires extrapolation into the wetted portion of the river. To bridge these gaps, an approach for using repeat aerial imagery surveys with visual (RGB) and near infrared (NIR) to extract high resolution channel geometry for the Kuparuk River in the Alaskan Arctic was developed. Aerial imagery surveys were conducted under multiple flow conditions and water surface geometry (elevation and width) were extracted through photogrammetry. Channel geometry was extracted by combining water surface widths and elevations from multiple flights. The accuracy of these results were compared against field surveyed cross sections at many locations throughout the study reach and a digital elevation model created under extremely low flow conditions. These extrapolation methods have shown to be promising for estimating detailed channel geometry at large scales.",

The ZS rocks preserve a dominant HP to UHP metamorphic imprint overprinted by greenschist facies metamorphism. The age of the oceanic protoliths is considered to be middle to upper Jurassic whereas the HP metamorphism is mostly considered to be Eocene.\nIn upper Valtournanche ZS ophiolites, the dominant regional S2 foliation is mapped with spatial continuity in serpentinite, metarodingite and eclogite and is defined by HP/UHP parageneses in all lithotypes. It developed at 2.5 ± 0.3 GPa and 600 ± 20°C during Alpine subduction. S2 foliation of serpentinites wraps rare clinopyroxene and zircon relics. Trace element composition of clinopyroxene suggests that they crystallised from a melt in equilibrium with plagioclase: they most likely represent relicts of gabbroic assemblages. The clinopyroxene porphyroclasts have rims indented within S2 and compositions similar to fine-grained clinopyroxeneII defining S2, suggesting that they recrystallised during Alpine subduction.\nZircon cores show, under CL, sector zoning typical of magmatic growth. U-Pb dates suggest their crystallisation during Middle Jurassic. Magmatic cores have thin fringe overgrowths parallel to the S2 foliation. U-Pb concordant analyses on these domains reveal an Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene crystallization most likely representing the HP to UHP Alpine re-equilibration.\nThis suggests that some sections of the ZS have experienced HP to UHP metamorphism earlier than previously thought, opening new interpretative geodynamic scenarios. Remarkably, these new dates are similar to those recorded for the HP re-equilibration in the continental crust of the adjacent Austroalpine units (upper plate of the Alpine subduction system) and to those recorded for prograde metamorphism in other parts of the ZS ophiolites.",

In particular, we focus on the spectral properties of nonlinear transfer and dissipation of energy, and their effect on the resulting magnetic and electric field spectra. For typical solar wind parameters at 1 AU, it is found that about 30% of the nonlinear energy transfer occurring close to the electron gyroradius scale is in fact mediated by modes in the tail of the MHD cascade at k ⊥ ρ i ≲ 1 . Collisional dissipation is consistent with electron Landau damping and ion nonlinear phase mixing, resulting in significant dissipation at all scales in the kinetic range k ⊥ ρ i ≳ 1 . Both transfer and dissipation thus occur on multiple coupled scales, which have to be retained for a comprehensive picture of the dissipation range in Alfvénic turbulence.",

            "abstract": "Determining the time of the onset of plate tectonics is critical to understanding the geodynamic processes that controlled the evolution of the early Earth. The near absence of Archean ophiolites, as defined by the presence of a residual ultramafic section, has been considered to be one of the primary arguments against Archean plate tectonics. The Andriamena greenstone belt of Madagascar contains massive chromitite bodies consisting of about 90% chromite and about 10% gangue minerals, mostly secondary (talc, green amphibole, orthopyroxene, Ca and Mg carbonate). Numerous observations argue in favor of an ophiolitic origin for these chromitites, including the high Cr# (0.67-0.74), coupled with relatively high Mg# (0.6-0.78) of the constituent chromite. In addition, these phases display extremely low TiO2 contents (<0.25%), which are also characteristic of ophiolites and possibly suggestive of an arc environment. Though in many places the chromitite is in tectonic contact with a variety of unrelated igneous lithologies, remnants of apparently cogenetic ultramafic rock types, including dunites, harzburgites, and some pyroxenites are sometimes immediately juxtaposed with the chromitite. The very high Fo content of the olivine in the associated dunite, as high as 0.95, also attests to an ophiolitic provenance.\nPlatinum group element (PGE) and 187Os/188Os analyses were performed on several chromitite samples. Chondrite normalized PGE spectra display marked depletions in PPGE relative to IPGE, with (Pt/Ir)N ranging from ~0 to 0.09, though Pd contents are somewhat less depleted than those of Pt. The observed PPGE depletion is another feature characteristic of ophiolitic chromitites. The IPGE enrichment is consistent with the presence of laurite microinclusions in the chromite revealed by SEM. Os isotopic compositions are tightly clustered, with 187Os/188Os ranging from 0.1057 to 0.1059, corresponding to TRD model ages of ~ 3.2 Ga, assuming primitive upper mantle parameters. 186Os/188Os measurements are in progress.\nIf the ophiolitic nature of the chromitites is confirmed, our results might imply that geodynamic mechanisms similar to present-day plate tectonic processes may already have been active in the mid-Archean Earth.",

Over the last few years, a sustained set of airborne (NOAA-PFA, NOAA-ACG, and CARVE) and satellite (OCO-2 and GOSAT) atmospheric CO2 mole fraction measurements have provided unprecedented space and time scale sampling density across Alaska, making it possible to study the Arctic carbon cycle in more detail than ever before. Here, we use a synthesis of airborne and satellite CO2 over the 2009-2013 period with simulated concentrations from CLM4.5 and GEOS-Chem to examine the extent to which regional-scale carbon cycle changes in Alaska can be distinguished from interannual variability and long-range transport. We show that observational strategies focused on sustained profile measurements spanning continental interiors provide key insights into magnitude, duration, and variability of Summer sink activity, but that cold season sources are currently poorly resolved due to lack of sustained spatial sampling. Consequently, although future CO2 budgets dominated by enhanced cold season emission sources under climate warming and permafrost thaw scenarios are likely to produce substantial changes to near-surface CO2 gradients and seasonal cycle amplitude, they are unlikely to be detected by current observational strategies. We conclude that airborne and ground-based networks that provide more spatial coverage in year round profiles will help compensate for systematic sampling gaps in NIR passive satellite systems and provide essential constraints for Arctic carbon cycle changes.",

The presence of free fluids is thought to be one of the primary controls on ETS behavior within the Cascadia margin. Since the bulk electrical conductivity in the crust and mantle can be greatly increased by fluids, magnetotelluric(MT) observations can offer unique insights on the fluid distribution and its relation to observed ETS behavior. Here we present preliminary results from the 146 MT stations collected for the MOCHA project. MOCHA is unique in that it is the first amphibious array of MT stations occupied to provide for 3-D interpretation of conductivity structure of a subduction zone.\nThe MOCHA data set comprises 75 onshore stations and 71 offshore stations, accumulated over a two-year period, and located on an approximate 25km grid, spanning from the trench to the Eastern Willamette Valley, and from central Oregon into middle Washington.\nWe present the results of a series of east-west (cross-strike) oriented, two-dimensional inversions created using the MARE2DEM software that provide an initial picture of the conductivity structure of the locked and ETS zones and its along strike variations. Our models can be used to identify correlations between ETS occurrence rates and inferred fluid concentrations. Our modeling explores the impact of various parameterizations on 2-D inversion results, including inclusion of a smoothness penalty reduction along the inferred slab interface. This series of 2-D inversions can then be used collectively to help make and guide an a priori 3-D inversion. In addition we will present a preliminary 3-D inversion of the onshore stations created using the ModEM software. We are currently working on modifying ModEM to support inversion of offshore data. The more computationally intensive 3-D inversion of the full amphibious data set will address questions regarding along-strike heterogeneity in fluid distributions within the locked and ETS-originating zones.",

Utility-scale solar energy (USSE; i.e., ≥ 1 megawatt [MW]) development requires large quantities of space and land; however, studies quantifying the effect of USSE on land-cover change and protected areas are limited. We assessed siting impacts of >160 USSE installations by technology type (photovoltaic [PV] vs. concentrating solar power [CSP]), area (km2), and capacity (MW) within the global solar hotspot of the state of California (USA). Additionally, we utilized the Carnegie Energy and Environmental Compatibility Model, a multiple criteria model, to quantify each installation according to environmental and technical compatibility. Lastly, we evaluated installations according to their proximity to protected areas, including inventoried roadless areas, endangered and threatened species habitat, and federally protected areas. We found the plurality of USSE (6,995 MW) in California is sited in shrub- and scrublands, comprising 375 km2 of land-cover change. Twenty-eight percent of USSE installations are located in croplands and pastures, comprising 155 km2 of change. Less than 15% of USSE installations are sited in compatible areas. The majority of incompatible USSE power plants are sited far from existing transmission infrastructure and all USSE installations average at most seven and five km from protected areas, for PV and CSP, respectively. Where energy, food, and conservation goals intersect, environmental compatibility can be achieved when resource opportunities, constraints, and trade-offs are integrated into siting decisions.",

A network of four local broadband seismometers deployed within a day of the Mw 4.4 event, along with six Oklahoma netquake stations, recorded more than 500 aftershocks in the two weeks following the Luther earthquake. Here we use HypoDD (Waldhauser & Ellsworth, 2000) and waveform cross-correlation to obtain precise aftershock locations. The location uncertainty, calculated using the SVD method in HypoDD, is ~15 m horizontally and ~ 35 m vertically. The earthquakes define a near vertical, NE-SW striking fault plane. Events occur at depths from 2 km to 3.5 km within the granitic basement, with a small fraction of events shallower, near the sediment-basement interface. Earthquakes occur within a zone of ~200 meters thickness on either side of the best-fitting fault surface. We use an equivalency class algorithm to identity clusters of repeating events, defined as event pairs with median three-component correlation > 0.97 across common stations (Aster & Scott, 1993). Repeating events occur as doublets of only two events in over 50% of cases; overall, 41% of earthquakes recorded occur as repeating events. The recurrence intervals for the repeating events range from minutes to days, with common recurrence intervals of less than two minutes. While clusters occur in tight dimensions, commonly of 80 m x 200 m, aftershocks occur in 3 distinct ~2km x 2km-sized patches along the fault. Our analysis suggests that with rapidly deployed local arrays, the plethora of ~Mw 4 earthquakes occurring in Oklahoma and Southern Kansas can be used to investigate the earthquake rupture process and the role of damage zones.",

We also determined the vulnerability of SOC and SIC to the disturbance caused land-use change (conversion of old fields to short-rotation woody crop plantations).\nThe experimental network consists of seven bioenergy plantations established in 2009-2010 in idled grass fields using herbicide and tillage. These study sites exhibit differences in soil texture (controlled largely by the type of glacial overlay) and geochemistry (controlled by the regional lithology including shale, basalt, limestone, sandstone and calcareous sandstone), providing the opportunity to gain insight into regional physical and chemical determinants of soil C storage. We conducted intensive soil sampling campaigns to a depth of 1 m prior to land conversion and at 4 years post-disturbance, to determine the depth profile and response of soil C storage as a function of land use and regional edaphic attributes.\nThe proportion of subsoil SOC (stored at a depth greater than 25 cm) ranged from 33 to 50% of whole-profile SOC (to 1 m) prior to land conversion. Soils developed from calcareous parent materials also had significant SIC stocks despite the humid climate promoting carbonate weathering. The SIC stocks made up to half of the total soil C to a depth of 1 m. Measurable carbonates occurred throughout the profile, possibly due to upwards biological translocation mechanisms, but were most abundant at depths greater than 50 cm. Preliminary analyses indicate that SOC decreased in the topsoil following land-use change. These topsoil losses were offset by subsoil gains at sites with reactive mineralogy. The SIC stocks showed re-distribution following disturbance and were likely subject to accelerated weathering. Taken together, these results indicate that the subsoil C pool is substantial and reactive, and point to the control of regional geochemistry on the response of soil C storage following disturbance.",

The ion drift perturbations induced by the zonal and meridional wind perturbations of W2 are nearly in-phase with each other, whereas the phase discrepancies of the ion drift induced by the individual wind component of W3 are much larger.

The 7 February 2010 3He-rich event was observed by spacecraft spread over 136 degrees, extending far beyond the expected longitudinal extent of such events whose origins are compact flaring regions on the Sun. Intensities of 25 MeV protons from the 3 November 2011 SEP event increased abruptly at all three spacecraft with onsets occurring within 30 minutes of each other even though the spacecraft were roughly equally distributed in longitude around the Sun. These types of observations challenge our understanding of the transport of SEPs. As many transport mechanisms are governed by a particle’s rigidity, it is useful to examine the SEP longitude distribution as a function of particles’ charge-to-mass ratios.

            "abstract": "In the context of complex environmental problems facing societies, environmental education is becoming an integral part of curriculum all levels of education, including teacher education. Traditional teaching methodology is often criticized for being reductionist and empirical and thus not optimal for training next generation of students who are expected to formulate solutions to complex, interdisciplinary environmental issues. This study will report on the use of mobile application, based on the Open Data Kit (ODK), along with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to implement a better approach, namely experiential learning, for teacher education in Kerala, India. The specific topic considered is land use and land cover change due to human activity. The experiential learning approach implemented will involve students using Android mobile application to collect a sample of geo-locations for different land cover types. This data will be used to classify satellite imagery within Google Earth Engine and used to understand how their neighborhoods have changed over the years. Rather than being passive information recipients, the students will develop understanding based on their own analysis of how urban regions grow, crop lands shrink and forests disappear.\nThis study will report on the implementation of experiential learning approach through the use of ODK and GEE, and on the ongoing evaluation of effectiveness of experiential learning approach for environmental education. A Pretest-Posttest study design will be used for evaluation. Change in environmental consciousness, as characterized by a well-designed and validated Environmental Consciousness Scale will be determined for a study group of 300 Pre-service teachers of Kerala, India. The significance between the mean scores of the data collected during pretest and posttest will be analyzed using paired t tests. Qualitative feedback about the Mobile Application through focus group interviews will also collected and analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The Northern and Central Andes have experienced greater anthropogenic land use/land-cover (LULC) change than nearly any other high mountain system on Earth. In particular, páramo ecosystems, high elevation grasslands of the tropical Andes of Colombia, are undergoing rapid conversion to cropland and pasture. These systems have strong hydrologic buffering capacity and have historically provided consistent freshwater flows to downstream communities. Therefore, loss of these systems could threaten the viability of freshwater resources in the region. While this region has some of the highest runoff ratios, precipitation, and largest river flows in the world, the resiliency of these hydrologic systems and the influence LULC change may have on them remains poorly understood. Here we seek to develop a deeper understanding of these relationships through quantitative analyses of LULC change and impacts on the quantity and quality of water exported from páramo landscapes of Colombia. Our results indicate the intensity and spatial distribution of LULC change, build upon past remote sensing studies of the region, and aid in prioritizing areas of concern for hydrologic research on the ground. This information provides an initial framework for characterizing the degree of modification and impact to water quantity/quality, as well as the long-term sustainability of water resources in the region. We highlight the complexities of watershed management practices in the Colombian páramo and the need to account for the impact of human activity on changes in water quantity and quality in the region.",

            "abstract": "In-situ sorbent amendments are a low-impact approach for remediation of contaminants in sediments, particular in habitats like wetlands that provide important ecosystem services. Laboratory microcosm trials (Gilmour et al. 2013) and early field trials show that activated carbon (AC) can effectively increase partitioning of both inorganic Hg and methylmercury to the solid phase. Sediment-water partitioning can serve as a proxy for Hg and MeHg bioavailability in soils.\nOne consideration in using AC in remediation is its potential impact on organisms. For mercury, a critical consideration is the potential impact on net MeHg accumulation and bioavailability. In this study, we specifically evaluated the impact of AC on rates of methylmercury production and degradation, and on overall microbial activity, in 4 different Hg-contaminated salt marsh soils. The study was done over 28 days in anaerobic, sulfate-reducing slurries. A double label of enriched mercury isotopes (Me199Hg and inorganic 201Hg) was used to separately follow de novo Me201Hg production and Me199Hg degradation. AC amendments decreased both methylation and demethylation rate constants relative to un-amended controls, but the impact on demethylation was stronger. The addition of 5% (dry weight) regenerated AC to soil slurries drove demethylation rate constants to nearly zero; i.e. MeHg sorption to AC almost totally blocked its degradation. The net impact was increased solid phase MeHg concentrations in some of the soil slurries with the highest methylation rate constants. However, the net impact of AC amendments was to increase MeHg (and inorganic Hg) partitioning to the soil phase and decrease concentrations in the aqueous phase. AC significantly decreased aqueous phase inorganic Hg and MeHg concentrations after 28 days. Overall, the efficacy of AC in reducing aqueous MeHg was highest in the soils with the highest MeHg concentrations. The AC addition did not significantly impact microbial activity, as assessed by CO2 production and sulfate depletion, in two of the four soils, but resulted in a up to a 40% decrease in two other soils. AC amendment has little effect on slurry pH, but decreased aqueous Fe, sulfide and DOC concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Cyanobacterial carbon excretion is crucial to carbon cycling in many microbial communities, but the nature and bioavailability of the carbon excreted is dependent on physiological function, which is often unknown. Cyanobacteria are the dominant primary producers in hypersaline mats and there is large reservoir of carbon in the extracellular matrix, but the nature and flux is understudied. In a previous study, we examined the macromolecular composition of the matrix of microbial mats from Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay, California and a unicyanobacterial culture, ESFC-1, isolated from the those mats, and found evidence for cyanobacterial degradation and re-uptake of extracellular organic matter. In this work, we further explore mechanisms of this degradation and re-uptake by examining effects of light using a combination of high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and metaproteomics of extracellular proteins. Based on these findings, we propose that mat Cyanobacteria store and recycle organic material from the mat extracellular matrix. Cyanobacteria can account for 70-90% of the biomass in the upper phototrophic layer of the mats, so their re-uptake of organic carbon and nitrogen has the potential to re-define organic matter availability in these systems. This work has implications for cyanobacterial adaptation to dynamic environments like microbial mats, where uptake of carbon and nitrogen in variable forms may be necessary to persist.\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Genomic Science program under FWP SCW1039.

            "abstract": "Arsenic 33As, one of the major groundwater contaminants, occurs in both natural and anthropogenic forms. Arsenic inhibits cellular respiration and the production of ATP in human body. Prolonged intake of non-lethal quantities of arsenic can cause cancer and diseases in vital organs such as the heart, liver, skin, and kidney. Each year, millions of people in the rural areas of Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries in South Asia are exposed to arsenic-poisoned groundwater. According to the World Health Organization, arsenic levels in drinking water should not exceed 10 parts per billion; however, the levels of arsenic found in groundwater in the heavily contaminated regions are often more than ten times of the recommended limit. Nepal is one of these regions. In most of the rural areas in Nepal, there is no infrastructure to produce clean filtered water, and wells thus became the major source. However, most of these wells were dug without testing for groundwater safety, because the test commands resources that the rural communities do not have access to. This is also limited data published on Nepal’s groundwater contaminant levels. The scarcity of information prohibits the international community from recognizing the severity of arsenic poisoning in Nepal and coming up with the most efficient measures to help. With this project, we will present a method to determine groundwater safety by analyzing geologic data and using remote sensing. The original source of arsenic is the arsenic-bearing minerals in the sediments. Some geological formations have higher arsenic levels than others due to their depositional environments. Therefore, by using existing geologic data from Nepal and countries with similar types of arsenic contamination, we hope to determine correlations between areas where there are reports of high concentrations of arsenic in groundwater to the environmental factors that may cause a particular concentration of arsenic. Furthermore, with deeper understanding of the correlations, we can predict whether an area is suffering from arsenic laden groundwater without actual field testing. We use R and ArcGIS to conduct the statistical and geographical analysis in this project.",

Here we explored the law of cobble transport and the effect of cobble existence on gravel bed material transport, using flume experiments with a steep slope (4.9%) and water and sediment constantly supplying. The experiments were conducted in an 8 m long and 0.6 m wide circulating flume with the maximal size up to 90 mm and cobble concentrations in the sediment bed ranging from 22 percent to 6 percent. The sediment transport rate is on the order of 1000 g/m/s, which could be taken as high rate transport compared with existing researches. Bed load transport rate and flow variables were measured after the flume reached an equilibrium state. Bed surface topography was also measured by applying Kinect range camera before and after each run in order to analyze the fractal characteristics of the bed surface under different flow conditions. Critical shear stress of each size friction was estimated from the reference transport method (RTM) and a new hiding function was recommended. Preliminary results show that the bed was nearly in an equal mobility transport regime. We then plot dimensionless fractional transport rate versus dimensionless shear stress and assess the existing bed load transport formulas of non-uniform sediments for their applicability at high sediment transport capacity. This study contributes to the comprehension of high rate sediment transport on steep slopes.",

We examined projections of climate change effects on discharge and inundation within the Amazon River basin. We used the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH coupled with a 1D river hydrodynamic model simulating water storage over the floodplains. The model’s capability to represent physical processes over the Amazon was demonstrated in previous validation against multi in situ and remotely sensed observations. Future climate projections for the 2070 to 2099 time period were obtained by selecting five climate models from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), based on their ability to represent the main aspects of recent Amazon climate. The climate projections present large uncertainty and results from different climate models do not agree on the sign of changes in total Amazon flood extent or discharge along the main stem of the Amazon River. However, model projections generally show better agreement with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) portions of the Amazon basin. Results indicate increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in northwestern Amazon, with increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solimões River in western and central Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mainly in the dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water period in the central and lower Amazon.",

Unlike commonly used techniques such as shear wave splitting, anisotropic receiver function analysis yields both precise depth constraints on the source of anisotropy and can constrain non-horizontal axes of symmetry. Despite this, receiver functions are underutilized when it comes to examining sharp gradients in anisotropy. Here, we highlight recent methodological advances and results from using receiver functions to interrogate mantle anisotropy in different tectonic settings, with a specific focus on using anisotropic receiver function analysis to interrogate frozen-in anisotropy in the mantle lithosphere beneath continental North America. Previous receiver function results have revealed multiple mid-lithospheric discontinuities that correspond to sharp gradients in anisotropy, with a consistent N- to NW- orientation of anisotropy in the upper mantle lithosphere within the Granite-Rhyolite province. We expand upon this work by examining variations in frozen-in anisotropy across terrane boundaries, and utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to model the orientation of anisotropy in the lithospheric mantle beneath long-running seismic stations. Ultimately, anisotropic receiver function analysis is an excellent tool for estimating the orientation of anisotropy at depth, and in this example, provides clues into the formation and evolution of cratonic North America.",

Common techniques include interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical photogrammetric methods. Each technique can measure ground motion when data over the same region are acquired through multiple acquisitions, with typical data outputs displayed in spatial form (e.g., displacement/velocity maps or two- and three-dimensional change detection models) or in temporal form (e.g., displacement time series).\nThe authors apply a multi-sensor approach - combining satellite-based InSAR, terrestrial LiDAR, and aerial optical photogrammetry - in order to optimize these remote sensing techniques based on their advantages and limitations. This application is conducted over a railroad corridor in southeastern Nevada. InSAR results include the calculation of displacement rates across many slopes over a long period of time. Two slopes, identified as potentially hazardous, are further analyzed in greater detail using LiDAR and optical photogrammetry. Slope displacements are measured using a point-cloud change detection analysis; the potential for stacking acquisitions to create displacement time-series is also explored. Overall, the goal is to illustrate the benefits of using a multi-sensor, remote sensing approach towards the monitoring of slope instability.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the prominence mass has been an open question since this cool plasma suspended in the hot corona was first discovered. We have known for a long time that the mass must come from the chromosphere, but it is unclear whether this mass is lifted bodily through magnetic levitation, injected by reconnection-driven upflows, or driven from the chromosphere by evaporation and then condensed. One evaporation-condensation scenario, the thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) model, is the most fully developed, quantitative model for the prominence plasma to date. In the TNE scenario, localized heating concentrated at the coronal loop footpoints produces chromospheric evaporation, filling the flux tube with hot, dense plasma that subsequently collapses radiatively to form cool condensations. Thus far this model has been successful in explaining the key properties of the long, persistent threads and small, highly dynamic, transient blobs in prominences, the damping of large-amplitude field-aligned prominence oscillations, the appearance of horn-shaped features above the cool prominence in EUV images of coronal cavities, and coronal rain in the ambient corona. To date, all studies of TNE have assumed that the plasma is fully ionized, which is appropriate for the hot coronal gas but unrealistic for the cool plasma below ~30,000 K. The energetics, dynamics, and evolutionary time scales of the TNE process are expected to be altered when the effects of ionization and recombination are considered. We have modified ARGOS, our 1D hydrodynamic code with adaptive mesh refinement, to include an equation of state that accounts for the effects of partial ionization of the plasma over a wide range of temperatures and densities. We will discuss the results of these simulations and their comparison with our previous studies of TNE in typical filament-supporting flux tubes.\nThis work was partially supported by NASA’s LWS Strategic Capability program.",

There will be a focused consideration of source, mobilization, delivery and eventual impact on water bodies as a focus for understanding opportunities for mitigating transfers from land to water.

Since the close of construction in September 2008 various enhancements have been implemented through additional funding by the NSF, NOAA, and NASA and in collaboration with stakeholders such as Caltrans, Scripps, and the USGS.\nInitially, the majority of stations used first generation IP based cellular modems and radios capable of ~10KB/s data rates. The bandwidth limitation was a challenge for regional high-rate data downloads for GPS-seismology and airborne LiDAR surveys, and real-time data flow. Today, only 13 of the original cell modems remain with 297 upgraded cell modems providing 3G/4G/LTE data communications with transfer rates ranging from 80-400 KB/s. Ongoing radio network expansion and upgrades continue to harden communications. 32 VSAT and one manual download site remain. In CA, the network capabilities for 1Hz and 5Hz downloads or real-time streaming are ~95%, ~80% and ~65%, respectively.\nDuring the past year, uptime ranged from 94-99% with data return for 15 s data exceeding 99%. Real-time (1 Hz) data from 204 sites are distributed in BINEX and RTCM 2.3/3.1 formats with an average latency of 0.5 s and completion of 86%. A variety of geophysical sensors are co-located with the GPS stations and include: 21 MEMS accelerometers, 31 strong motion and broadband seismometers, 9 borehole strainmeters and 1 long baseline strainmeter. Vaisala meteorological instruments are located at 60 sites of which 38 stream GPS/Met data.\nIn an effort to modernize the network, Trimble NetRS receivers are gradually being replaced with GNSS-capable/enabled receivers and antennas.

            "abstract": "Early-stage continental rift zones provide important insights into the deformation behavior of crust and mantle lithosphere, and its modification by the migration of magma and volatiles. In East Africa, lower crustal earthquakes provide opportunities to probe the deformation behavior of the entire crust. We use a catalogue of 3068 earthquakes of 1 < ML < 4.5 recorded on a 39-station seismic array spanning three 3 rift segments ( Magadi-Natron-Manyara) of the Eastern rift, Africa to determine kinematics of large offset border faults, their along-strike linkage, and their possible interactions with tomographically imaged magma conduits and reservoirs beneath active and dormant volcanoes. Earthquake focal mechanisms are predominantly NS-striking normal faults with steep dips from near surface to 25 km in the Natron and Magadi basins, whereas the strike of normal faults locally rotates to N60E at the northern tip of the Manyara border fault. This rift-oblique structure links the Manyara border fault to Gelai shield volcano via Oldoinyo Lengai volcano, and may be a zone of magma transfer. Crustal anisotropy measurements from lower crustal earthquakes provide information on the orientation of fluid-filled cracks and any strain fabric. We compare our new crustal splitting observations with the rift parallel anisotropy determined by ambient noise tomography, and with mantle anisotropy patterns determined from SKS-splitting. Initial results of SKS-splitting (> 1 s) show both the NS and NE fast directions at different stations, suggesting that aligned melt-filled cracks contribute to the observed patterns, as in more evolved rift sectors, like the Ethiopian and Afar rifts.

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic trends are difficult to separate from natural variability in the tropical Pacific, where instrumental data coverage is sparse. Of particular interest are variations of climate in the pre-industrial era, but instrumental data from this time period is virtually nonexistent. Corals allow for the investigation of pre-industrial climate variability, but most living coral colonies rarely span more than a century. Fossil corals provide a valuable archive of climate variability over the past millennia [Cobb et al., 2013] and are best suited to the reconstruction of ENSO. For the reconstruction of mean climate, systematic offsets between proxy records from contemporaneous corals translates to large error bars on the resulting reconstructions [e.g. Felis et al., 2003; Pfeiffer et al., 2009]. By building composite paleoclimate records using multiple corals from the Line Islands (2°N – 6°N, 157°W – 162°W), we quantify mean climate state and climate variability in the central tropical Pacific (CTP) during the Little Ice Age (LIA). We compare paired d18O and Sr/Ca records from Line Island fossil corals to a large collection of modern coral d18O and Sr/Ca records from the same islands to estimate SST and salinity changes from the LIA to the late 20th century. Taken together, Sr/Ca records from three Palmyra Atoll fossil corals spanning 1630-1703CE suggest CTP temperatures may have been 1.7±0.9˚C cooler during much of the 17th century. Reconstructed seawater d18O values are indicative of drier conditions at Palmyra, consistent with a southward shift of the ITCZ during the LIA documented in sediments from the Line Islands [Sachs et al., 2009]. We compare the results from seven LIA-dated fossil corals from nearby Christmas Island (Kiritimati; 2˚N, 157˚W) to the results obtained from Palmyra, enabling us to resolve potential shifts in the meridional gradients of SST and hydrology in this region during the LIA.\n",

            "abstract": "The Central Florida Remote Sensing Laboratory has analyzed Aquarius (AQ) sea surface salinity (SSS) and ESA’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) retrievals in the presence of rain and has developed a Rain Impact Model (RIM V2.0) that predicts transient near-surface salinity stratification based upon the corresponding rain accumulation over the previous 24 hours and the effect of the wind speed.\nFor both of the satellite SSS measurements, a common reference for comparison is the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) for ocean salinity, but there is a significant mismatch between the remote sensing sampling depth of approximately 0.01 m and the typical range of 5 m to 10 m of in situ instruments. Under normal ocean conditions the upper layer of the ocean is well mixed and there is an approximately uniform salinity for the first 10 m depth; therefore satellite measurements are good estimates of the bulk salinity. Conversely, under rainy conditions, there is a dilution of the near-surface salinity that mixed downward by diffusion and mechanical mixing of gravity waves, where the wind speed information play a significant role in the model. This transient phenomena, known as salinity stratification, significantly modifies the salinity gradient in the upper 1 m of the ocean; and therefore invalidates the usual assumption of well-mixed salinity. Generally, these salinity stratifications dissipate in less than a couple of hours and the upper layer becomes well mixed at a slightly fresher salinity.\nThe Rain Impact Model V2.0 is based on the RIM V1.0, previously published, which includes the rain accumulation effect but ignores the variations on wind speed using a constant vertical diffusivity value. This research addresses the effects of rainfall on the AQ and SMOS SSS retrieval using a macro-scale Rain Impact Model (RIM) in regions of high convective rain. This model, based on the superposition of a one-dimension eddy diffusion (turbulent diffusion) model, relates sea surface salinity to depth, rain accumulation, time since rainfall, and wind speed. Comparisons among 2-D rain patterns, SMOS SSS, AQ SSS and RIM SSS will be shown in this analysis.",

The BBP scientific software modules implement kinematic rupture generation, low and high-frequency seismogram synthesis using wave propagation through 1D layered velocity structures, seismogram ground motion amplitude calculations, and goodness of fit measurements. These modules are integrated into a software system that provides user-defined, repeatable, calculation of ground motion seismograms, using multiple alternative ground motion simulation methods, and software utilities that can generate plots, charts, and maps. The BBP has been developed over the last five years in a collaborative scientific, engineering, and software development project involving geoscientists, earthquake engineers, graduate students, and SCEC scientific software developers.\nThe BBP can run earthquake rupture and wave propagation modeling software to simulate ground motions for well-observed historical earthquakes and to quantify how well the simulated broadband seismograms match the observed seismograms. The BBP can also run simulations for hypothetical earthquakes. In this case, users input an earthquake location and magnitude description, a list of station locations, and a 1D velocity model for the region of interest, and the BBP software then calculates ground motions for the specified stations.\nThe SCEC BBP software released in 2015 can be compiled and run on recent Linux systems with GNU compilers. It includes 5 simulation methods, 7 simulation regions covering California, Japan, and Eastern North America, the ability to compare simulation results against GMPEs, updated ground motion simulation methods, and a simplified command line user interface.",

            "abstract": "Water resources in the tropical regions are under pressure from human appropriation and climate change. Current understanding of interactions between hydrology and climate in the tropical regions is inadequate. This is particularly true for the Congo River Basin (CRB), which also lacks hydroclimate data. Global climate models (GCM) show limited skills in simulating CRB’s climate, and their future projections vary widely. Yet, GCMs provide the most credible scenarios of future climate, based upon which changes in water resources can be predicted with coupled hydrological models.\nThe objectives of my work are to i) elucidate the spatial and temporal variability of water resources by developing a spatially explicit hydrological model suitable for describing key processes and fluxes, ii) evaluate the performance of GCMs in simulating precipitation and temperature and iii) develop a set of climate change scenarios for the basin. In addition, I also quantify the risks and reliabilities in smallholder rain-fed agriculture and demonstrates how available water resources can be utilized to increase crop yields.\nKey processes and fluxes of CRB’s hydrological cycle are amply characterized by the hydrology model. Climate change projections are evaluated using a multi-model ensemble approach under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The near-term projections of climate and hydrological fluxes are not affected by emission scenarios. However, towards the mid-21st century, projections are emission scenario dependent. Available freshwater resources are projected to increase in the CRB, except in the semiarid southeast. These increases present new opportunities and challenges for augmenting human appropriation of water resources.\nBy evaluating agricultural water requirements, and timing and availability of precipitation, I challenge the conventional wisdom that low agriculture productivities in the CRB are primarily attributable to nutrient limitation. Results show that doubling crop yields cannot be achieved without reallocation of available water resources.\nThe findings have wider implications for climate change assessment and water resource management, because the region, with high population growth and limited capacity to adapt, are the primary targets of land and water grabs.",

            "abstract": "Forecasts at lead times greater than three days, and any regional climate simulation, require a correct and consistent simulation of the large-scale flow to be able to properly represent the small-scale phenomena desired from expensive, high-resolution models. Further, representing both the large and small scales must be done efficiently enough so as to meet an operational forecast requirement or so that multi-year climate simulations can be performed. To this end, two-way global-to-regional grid nesting has been implemented in the GFDL finite-volume cubed-sphere (FV3) dynamical core to consistently and efficiently represent the global large-scale circulation and the convection-permitting or convection-resolving scales. We demonstrate recent applications of grid nesting in the global GFDL High-Resolution Atmosphere Model (HiRAM), including simulations using nonhydrostatic dynamics. In present-day climate simulations, an 8-km nested grid over the continental US permits explicitly-resolved propagating convective systems, greatly improving the diurnal cycle of warm-season precipitation. A similar 8-km nest over the tropical Atlantic permits resolution of eyewalls and rainbands within tropical cyclones, opening the way for efficient seasonal and sub-seasonal prediction of intense hurricanes. On smaller scales, a 1.5-km nest over the central US allows simulation of intense supercell thunderstorms with realistic convective and boundary-layer structures.",

The size of the voltage pulse is proportional to the mass of the impacting dust particle times the impact speed to the power of ~4.6. The dust density can be calculated based on counting individual dust impacts in the waveform snapshots. In this study, we show RPWS measurements of dust particles in Saturn's dusty rings. The differential size distribution of the dust particles can be characterized as a power law dn/dr ≈ rμ where μ ~ -4 and r is the particle radius. Dust density profiles of the dusty rings are derived from the RPWS wideband receiver data, which revealed interesting structures. The vertical scale height of the dusty rings varies with the radial distance from Saturn with local minima at the G-ring and Enceladus' orbit. The vertical profiles show a dip at the equatorial plane near Enceladus' orbit and vertical offsets of the peak locations away from Enceladus' orbit. These observations are compared with the modeling studies and measurements by other instruments onboard Cassini.",

In the case of volcanic risk, long term hazard maps are generally developed on a basis of the most probable scenarios (likelihood of occurrence) or worst cases. However, in the short-term, expected scenarios may vary substantially depending on the monitoring data or new knowledge. In this context, the time required to obtain and process data is critical for optimum decision making.\nAvailability of up-to-date volcanic scenarios is as crucial as it is to have this data accompanied by efficient estimations of their impact among populations and infrastructure. To address this impact estimation during volcanic crises, or other natural hazards, a web interface has been developed to execute an ANSI C application. This application allows one to compute – in a matter of seconds – the demographic and infrastructure impact that any natural hazard may cause employing an overlay-layer approach. The web interface is tailored to users involved in the volcanic crises management of Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador). The population data base and the cartographic basis used are of public domain, published by the National Office of Statistics of Ecuador (INEC, by its Spanish acronym).\nTo run the application and obtain results the user is expected to upload a raster file containing information related to the volcanic hazard or any other natural hazard, and determine categories to group population or infrastructure potentially affected. The results are displayed in a user-friendly report.",

However, few investigations have quantified or characterized oceanic INP emissions. In conjunction with the Center for Aerosol Impacts on the Climate and the Environment, we have directly measured changes in INP emissions and properties of INPs from nascent sea spray aerosol (SSA) through the evolution of phytoplankton blooms.\nMultiple offline and online instruments were used to monitor aerosol chemistry and size, and bulk water characteristics during two phytoplankton bloom experiments. Two methods were utilized to monitor the number concentrations of INPs from 0 to -34 °C: The online CSU continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) and collections processed offline using the CSU ice spectrometer. Single particle analyses were performed on ice crystal residuals downstream of the CFDC, presumed to be INPs, via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Raman microspectroscopy.\nPreliminary results indicate that laboratory-generated nascent SSA corresponds to number concentrations of INPs that are generally consistent with open ocean regions, based on current knowledge. STEM analyses revealed that the sizes of ice crystal residuals that were associated with nascent SSA ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 μm. Raman microspectroscopy analysis of 1 μm sized residuals found a variety of INP identities, including long chain organics, diatom fragments and polysaccharides. Our data suggest that biological processes play a significant role in ocean INP emissions by generating the species and compounds that were identified during these studies.",

The comprehensive instrument suite aboard MAVEN has busied itself in mapping the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, magnetotail, and extended atmospheric corona in near-Mars space. MAVEN carries two magnetic field sensors (fluxgate magnetometers) as part of the particles and fields package (PFP); they sample the ambient magnetic field from a vantage point on at the outer edge of each solar array. We characterized relatively minor spacecraft-generated magnetic fields using a series of in-flight subsystem tests and spacecraft maneuvers. Dynamic spacecraft fields (≤ 1 nT) associated with the operation of specific solar array circuits are compensated for using spacecraft engineering telemetry to identify active circuits and monitor their electrical current production. Static spacecraft magnetic fields are monitored using spacecraft roll maneuvers. Accuracy of measurement of the environmental magnetic field is demonstrated by comparison with field directions deduced from the symmetry properties of the electron distribution function measured by the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA). We compile magnetometer observations to characterize intense crustal magnetic fields, the solar wind interaction with Mars, and ubiquitous proton cyclotron and 1-Hz waves in the upstream solar wind (ion foreshock region). The figure below compiles observations of magnetic fluctuations obtained by MAVEN in near-Mars space. The map of magnetic fluctuations reveals the statistical extent of the magnetosheath, confined between the bow shock and the magnetic pile-up region.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat islands (UHIs) occur when urban and suburban areas experience temperatures that are elevated relative to their rural surroundings because of differences in the fraction of gray and green infrastructure. Studies have shown that communities most at risk for impacts from climate-related disasters (i.e., lower median incomes, higher poverty, lower education, and minorities) tend to live in the hottest areas of cities. Development of adequate climate adaptation tools for cities relies on knowledge of how temperature varies across space and time. Traditionally, a city's urban heat island has been quantified using near-surface air temperature measurements from a few sites. This methodology assumes (1) that the UHI can be characterized by the difference in air temperature from a small number of points, and (2) that these few points represent the urban and rural signatures of the region. This methodology ignores the rich information that could be gained from measurements across the urban to rural transect. This transect could traverse elevations, water bodies, vegetation fraction, and other land surface properties.\nTwo temperature sensor networks were designed and implemented in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN and Madison, WI metropolitan areas beginning in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Both networks use the same model sensor and record temperature every 15 minutes from ~150 sensors. Data from each network has produced new knowledge of how temperature varies diurnally and seasonally across the cities and how the UHI magnitude is influenced by weather phenomena (e.g., wind, snow cover, heat waves) and land surface characteristics such as proximity to inland lakes. However, the two metropolitan areas differ in size, population, structure, and orientation to water bodies. In addition, the sensor networks were established in very different manners. We describe these differences and present lessons learned from the design and ongoing efforts of these two dense networks located in the Midwest USA.",

Satellite data from SNPP/VIIRS (Suomi-National Polar-orbit Partnership/Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite) instead have shown great advantages in supra-snow/ice flood detection due to its large swath coverage, multiple daily observations in high latitude areas and moderate spatial resolution. Thus, methods for supra-snow/ice water detection were developed to detect near real-time supra-snow/ice floods automatically using SNPP/VIIRS imagery. The methods were mainly based on spectral features of supra-snow/ice floodwater, assisting by geometry-based algorithm and object-based algorithm to remove cloud shadows and terrain shadows over snow/ice surface. The detected supra-snow/ice floodwater was further applied in water fraction retrieval for better representation of flood extent using a modified histogram method based on linear combination model. The developed methods were successfully applied in dynamic monitoring of 2015’s supra-snow/ice flood along Sag River in Alaska, which was claimed as a state disaster by Alaska state government, and further tested with more than 1000 VIIRS granules year around. Analyses through visual inspection with VIIRS false-color composite images and quantitative comparison with Landsat-8 OLI images show promising and robust performance in detection of supra-snow/ice floodwater, indicating a high feasibility for the method to be applied in operations for near real-time supra-snow/ice flood detection.",

Since the hydrogen in the n-alkanes is derived from the hydrogen in plants’ water sources and is non-exchangeable, the stable hydrogen isotopic composition (δD) of the n-alkanes provides information about the δD of environmental water. At present, it is unclear whether a single biosynthetic fractionation factor can be used to reconstruct the δD of environmental water from the δD of n-alkanes derived from different plant species. To address this question, we studied the translation of the δD signal from environmental water into n-alkanes in a diverse plant community at Tumamoc Hill, Arizona, USA. Over the course of one annual cycle, we monitored δD of atmospheric water vapor, precipitation, soil water, xylem water, leaf water, and n-alkanes. We found that n-alkane δD varied substantially between species that were sampled concurrently, but that the observed range of variation was quantitatively consistent with the predictions of a Craig-Gordon-type model parameterized with a single biosynthetic fractionation factor. These findings indicate that the variability of n-alkane δD between co-occurring species could be primarily attributable to interspecific differences in water sources, rather than interspecific differences in the biosynthetic fractionation factor. Controlled experiments are needed to evaluate whether n-alkane biosynthesis is in fact adequately described by a single biosynthetic fractionation factor across species.",

However, the contribution from the ionospheric currents can interfere with that from FACs on the dayside where ionospheric conductivity is higher and not concentrated along the auroral oval. We present the results of the comparison of the contribution from the large-scale FAC system with the observations at the mid-latitude observatories during 12 geomagnetic storms. The contribution from the FAC system is estimated using the 10 min resolution data of AMPERE system which provides 2D map of the FAC flowing in and out of the ionosphere reconstructed from the measurements onboard of ~70 Irridium satellites . To estimate the magnetic effect of FAC system, we performed Biot-Savart integration of these currents along IGRF field from the equator to the earth center. Although in reality the FACs close via ionosphere, we generally obtain a good quantitative agreement with observations at the ground observatories on the nighside. On the other hand the agreement is much worse on the dayside. The correlation coefficient between the D-component of the magnetic field measured on the ground and that computed using Biot-Savart integration varies between ~0.65 (21-03h MLT) and < 0.1 (12-18h MLT). In addition, we discuss the closure paths of the large scale FACs during storm periods and the sources of the north-south asymmetry of the ground magnetic field at mid-latitudes.",

To monitor this long-lasting afterslip, we use new SAR data, GPS and terrestrial LIDAR measurements along the fault. InSAR time series are calculated using 32 TerraSAR-X radar images acquired between 2011 and 2015 with the small baseline InSAR (SBAS) approach using the Supersites Istanbul archive provided by the German Aerospace Center, DLR (project HAZ2584_Marmara) (Hooper, 2008). The results show that the Izmit fault still creeps, but in an episodic manner. Two creep events are detected in the beginning and at end of 2013, each with an offset of ~20 mm between Izmit and Lake Sapanca. Campaign GPS measurements on a recently established network with 35 benchmarks and LIDAR measurements on three sites confirm the ongoing aseismic activity along the fault (TÜBİTAK project no: 113Y102).",

            "abstract": "Tidal wetlands and shallow water habitats can be sites of high aquatic productivity, and they have the potential of exchanging this newly produced organic carbon with adjacent deeper habitats. Indeed, export of organic carbon from wetlands and shallow water habitats to pelagic food webs is one of the primary ecosystem functions targeted in tidal wetland restorations. Alternatively, wetlands and shallow water habitats can function as retention areas for nutrients due to the nutrient demand of emergent macrophytes and denitrification in anoxic zones. They can also remove phytoplankton and non-algal particles from the aquatic food webs because the shallower waters can result in higher rates of benthic grazing and higher settling due to lower water velocities.\nWe conducted studies in wetland and channel sites in the San Francisco estuary (USA) to investigate the dynamics of nutrients and carbon production at a variety of temporal scales. We collected continuous time series of nutrients, oxygen, chlorophyll and pH in conjunction with continuous acoustic measurement of water velocity and discharge to provide mass controls and used simple biogeochemical models to assess rates.\nWe found a high degree of temporal variability in individual systems, corresponding to, for example, changes in nutrient supply, water level, light level, wind, wind direction, and other physical factors. There was also large variability among the different systems, probably due to differences in flows and geomorphic features. We compare the aquatic productivity of theses environments and speculate as to the formative elements of each. Our findings demonstrate the complex interaction between physical, chemical, and biological factors that determine the type of production and degree of export from tidal wetlands and shallow water habitats, suggesting that a clearer picture of these processes is important for guiding future large scale restoration efforts.",

            "abstract": "Membrane lipids of marine Archaea – known as GDGTs – are the basis of the TEX86 sea surface temperature (SST) paleoproxy. GDGTs are ubiquitous in marine sediments, and their broad distribution and high preservation potential have led to an ever-increasing use of TEX86. The planktonic Thaumarchaeota that are believed to be the major sources of GDGTs to marine sediments are autotrophic nitrifiers, assimilating carbon directly from dissolved CO2. Therefore the δ13C values of GDGTs additionally provide information about the DIC system and paleoproductivity. However, as for all biological proxies, understanding the physiology and biochemistry of the responsible organisms is essential to understanding how the proxies work. From this perspective, the TEX86-SST proxy is uniquely perplexing: How is it possible that multiple approaches to calibration show a good correlation between TEX86 and SSTs, when maximum activity of Thaumarchaeota is near and below the base of the photic zone? Here we show data from two studies that help address this question. Analyses of GDGT δ13C values show that the dominant GDGT flux to sediments is not from the sea surface. The data are measured on intact GDGTs purified by orthogonal dimensions of HPLC, followed by measurement of δ13C values on a Spooling Wire Microcombustion (SWiM)-IRMS with 1σ precision of ±0.2‰ and accuracy of ±0.3‰. Using this approach, we confirm that GDGTs, generally around ‑19.0‰ to ‑18.5‰, are isotopically “heavy” compared to other marine lipids, and that crenarchaeol in particular is a good tracer of water column GDGT export. In parallel, we investigated the mechanistic underpinning of the TEX86 proxy using isothermal culture studies of the ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 to explore the relationship between TEX86 and growth conditions. Evidence suggests that growth rate and electron donor supply are important controls on GDGT ratios and that TEX86 scales with the in-situ rate of nitrification. Constraining the physiological basis of the TEX86 proxy and the mechanism by which this signal is transported to the sedimentary record is crucial to the proxy’s application to ancient environments.",

Understanding the physical origin of these giant magnetic explosions is absolutely essential for any first-principles based space weather forecasting and, consequently, is a core focus of the NASA LWS Program. We describe how magnetic reconnection is responsible for the energy buildup that leads to SEEs, how it drives the explosive energy release, and how it controls the propagation of the event. Reconnection turns out to be especially important for understanding the escape of high-energy particles into the heliosphere. A key issue for numerical simulation of SEEs is the effect of the resistivity model used by the simulation, because the onset and subsequent development of reconnection inherently dependent on the effective resistivity. We present the latest ultra-high numerical resolution 2.5D simulations quantifying how the reconnection dynamics scale with effective resistivity. We also present 3D simulations demonstrating the complexities introduced by reconnection in a realistic 3D system. The implications of our results for interpreting observations and for developing space weather capabilities will be described.\nThis work was supported by the NASA LWS Strategic Capability Program.",

It is observed that plant biomes and biodiversity vary systematically with slope and aspect, from shrublands in low desert elevations, to mixed grass/shrublands in mid elevations, and forests at high elevations. In this study, we investigate the role of elevation dependent climatology on vegetation organization in a semiarid New Mexico catchment where elevation and hillslope aspect play a defining role on plant types. An ecohydrologic cellular automaton model developed within Landlab (component based modeling framework) is used. The model couples local vegetation dynamics (that simulate biomass production based on local soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration) and plant establishment and mortality based on competition for resources and space. This model is driven by elevation dependent rainfall pulses and solar radiation. The domain is initialized with randomly assigned plant types and the model parameters that couple plant response with soil moisture are systematically changed. Climate perturbation experiments are conducted to examine spatial vegetation organization and associated timescales. Model results reproduce elevation and aspect controls on observed vegetation patterns indicating that this model captures necessary and sufficient conditions that explain these observed ecohydrological patterns.",

            "abstract": "This research sought to understand how tree wood density and taxonomic diversity relate to topography and three-dimensional vegetation structure in the tropical montane forest of Braulio Carrillo National Park in Costa Rica. The study utilized forest inventory and botanical data from twenty 1-ha plots ranging from 55 m to 2800 m above sea level and remote sensing data from an airborne lidar sensor (NASA’s Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor [LVIS]) to quantify variations in forest structure. There is growing evidence that ecosystem structure may help to control the functional variations across landscapes. This study relates patterns of tree functional wood density and alpha diversity to three-dimensional structure using remote sensing observations of forest structure. We were able to test the effect of the gradient on wood density measured from collected tree cores and on the subsequent aboveground biomass estimations. We sought to determine if there was a significant pattern of wood density across the altitudinal gradient, which has implications for conservation of both ecosystem services and biodiversity. We also wanted to determine how many random individuals could be sampled to accurately estimate aboveground biomass in a one-hectare plot.\nOur results indicate that there is a strong relationship between LVIS-derived forest 3D-structure and alpha diversity, likely controlled by variations in abiotic factors and topography along the elevation. Using spatial analysis with the aid of remote sensing data, we found patterns along the environmental gradients defining species composition and forest structure. Wood density values were found to vary significantly from database values for the same species. This variation in tree growth has repercussions on overall forest structure, and subsequent carbon estimates extrapolated from field measurements. Because these wood density values are directly tied to biomass estimates, it is possible that carbon storage has been overestimated along this gradient using prior methods. Wood density exhibited a non-linear pattern with increasing elevation, analogous to a similar study in Peru. We also determined that sampling the wood density of just ten percent of random individuals has the potential to reasonably estimate aboveground biomass at the one-hectare scale.",

            "abstract": "The Pamir-Hindu Kush orogenic belt is the result of the indentation of the western corner of the India plate into Eurasia. It has accommodated the highest strain over the shortest meridional distance of the India-Eurasia collision zone. Recent high-resolution seismic tomographic and receiver function studies confirm the presence of a south-dipping continental lithosphere, which has been traced to the depth of more than 200-300 km beneath the northern Pamir (Pamir slab). Balanced cross-section document crustal shortening associated with the corresponding frontal thrust system of a few tens of km, which is much less than the expected (>200-300 km) for intra-continental subduction zone, based on the seismically imaged length of the Pamir slab. Another unique feature of Pamir is the presence of large gneiss domes with the exhumation reaching a depth of 30-40 km.\nWe employ the finite-element thermomechanical modelling technique SLIM3D to simulate the evolution of the Pamir orogeny during the last 25 Myr. The technique is using advanced non-linear elasto-visco-plastic rheology with parameters based on laboratory experiments. Our 3D model extends 1100 km N-S, 800 km E-W, and 300 km deep, and replicates indentation of the western half of India promontory into Eurasia. The moving modelling-window technique allows focusing at the most extensively deforming domains, and a 3D model setup and boundary conditions allow lateral material flow to the west, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of tectonic shortening.\nThe model replicates major features of the lithospheric structure and geological history. For instance, we demonstrate that large part of the roll back of the Pamir slab may be caused by the delamination of the mantle lithosphere together with the lower crust, rather than classical intra-continental subduction involving thrust-imbrication of the uppermost crust. The resulting shortening at the Pamir frontal thrust system appears to be lower than 50 km in accord with geological observations. The model also replicates evolution of surface topography including the collapse of high Pamir Plateau in N-S and E-W directions, resulting in exhumation of gneiss domes. We demonstrate that extensive westward outflow of material and the relatively small initial width of Pamir are the key factors that controlled its evolution.",

            "abstract": "A significant component of the Greenland ice sheet's mass wasteage to sea level rise is attributed to the acceleration and dynamic thinning at its tidewater margins. To improve understanding of the rapid mass loss processes occurring at large tidewater glaciers, we conducted a suite of daily repeat aerial surveys across the terminus of Store Glacier, a large outlet draining the western Greenland Ice Sheet, from May to July 2014 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8kauAVAfE). A suite flock of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were equipped with digital cameras, which, in combination with onboard GPS, enabled production of high spatial resolution orthophotos and digital elevation models (DEMs) using standard structure-from-motion techniques. These data provide insight into the short-term dynamics of Store Glacier surrounding the break-up of the sea-ice mélange that occurred between 4 and 7 June. Feature tracking of the orthophotos reveals that mean speed of the terminus is 16 – 18 md-1, which was independently verified against a high temporal resolution time-series derived from an expendable/telemetric GPS deployed at the terminus. Differencing the surface area of successive orthophotos enable quantification of daily calving rates, which significantly increase just after melange break-up. Likewise, by differencing bulk freeboard volume of icebergs through time we could also constrain the magnitude and variation of submarine melt. We calculate a mean submarine melt rate of 0.18 md-1 throughout the spring period with relatively little supraglacial runoff and no active meltwater plumes to stimulate fjord circulation and upwelling of deeper, warmer water masses. Finally, we relate calving rates to the zonation and depth of water-filled crevasses, which were prominent across parts of the terminus from June onwards.",

One approach for adapting to drought is to improve moisture retention through soil management practices. Recent efforts at the FSCRU to develop on-farm power have produced a biochar from gasification of seed mill waste that may prove useful as a tool for drought adaption. Testing of this biochar revealed that it contains no toxic elements, making it suitable as a soil amendment, and additions of 20 tonnes ha-1 in dryland wheat system showed improved soil moisture and yield increases of 250%. Persistent but weaker impacts were observed in growing years 2 and 3 following the biochar amendments. Here we present results from a series of laboratory and field studies characterizing how grass seed screening biochar, which is produced from a regionally abundant feedstock, impacted soil hydraulic and thermal properties, soil chemistry, and plant growth. Because of the liming qualities of gasified biochar, the greatest growth benefits are likely to be realized in acidified soils, a growing problem in the PNW. Although the persistence of biochar impacts in soil is still unknown, our results indicate that gasified biochar, particularly when utilized as part of a system of on-farm power production, waste reduction, and nutrient recycling, can improve agricultural sustainability in the context of climate change.",

In particular, we are investigating Li intra-melt and melt-vapor diffusion and Li isotope fractionation, which have the potential to record short-lived magmatic processes (seconds to hours) in the shallow crust, especially during decompression-induced magma degassing.\nHydrated intra-melt Li diffusion-couple experiments on Los Posos rhyolite glass [1] were performed in a piston cylinder at 300 MPa and 1050 °C. The polished interfaces between the diffusion couples were marked by addition of Pt powder for post-run detection. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses indicate that lithium diffuses extremely fast in the presence of water. Re-equilibration of a hydrated ~2.5 mm long diffusion-couple experiment was observed during the heating period from room temperature to the final temperature of 1050 °C at a rate of ~32 °C/min. Fractionation of ~40‰ δ7Li was also detected in this zero-time experiment. The 0.5h and 3h runs show progressively higher degrees of re-equilibration, while the isotope fractionation becomes imperceptible. Li contamination was observed in some experiments when flakes filed off Pt tubing were used to mark the diffusion couple boundary, while the use of high purity Pt powder produced better results and allowed easier detection of the diffusion-couple boundary. The preliminary lithium isotope fractionation results (δ7Li vs. distance) support findings from [2] that 6Li diffuses substantially faster than 7Li. Further experimental sets are in progress, including lower run temperatures (e.g. 900 °C), faster heating procedure (~100 °C/min), shorter run durations and the extension to mafic systems.\n[1] Stanton (1990) Ph.D. thesis, Arizona State Univ., [2] Richter et al.

            "abstract": "The influence of climate on the growth and development of ancient civilizations throughout the Holocene remains a topic of heated debate. The 4.2 ka BP global-scale mid-to-low latitude aridification event (Walker et al., 2012) in particular has incited various correlation proposals. Some authors suggest that this event may have led to the collapse of the Akkadian empire in Mesopotamia, one of the first empires in human history, as well as to changes among other Early Bronze Age societies dependent on cereal agriculture (eg. Staubwasser and Weiss, 2006). Other authors remain doubtful of the impact of environmental factors on the collapse of past societies (eg. Middleton, 2012). While coincident timing of an environmental event with archeological evidence does not necessitate a causation, a comprehensive understanding of climate variability in the ancient Near East is nonetheless an essential component to resolving the full history of early human settlements. Paleoclimate data on the Central Iranian Plateau, a region rich with ancient history, is exceptionally sparse compared to other areas. Many karst locations are found throughout the region, however, setting the stage for the development of several high-resolution, accurate and precisely-dated climate proxy records if a correlation between the chemistry of semi-arid speleothem samples and climate is resolved.\nHere we present a 5.1-3.7 ka BP record of decadal-scale stalagmite stable isotope and trace metal variability. The stalagmite was collected in Gol-e zard cave (35.8oN, 52.0oE), ~100 km NE of Tehran on the southern flank of the Alborz mountain range (2530masl). The area currently receives ~270mm mean annual precipitation, with more than 90% of precipitation falling within the wet season (November-May). We use GNIP data from Tehran and local and regional meteorological data to resolve the large-scale mechanisms forcing isotopic variations in rainwater over Gol-e zard cave. We discuss possible transformation of water isotopes during transition through the karst aquifer based on site properties and simple model experiments. Finally, we discuss the timing and magnitude of significant events in the stable isotope and trace metal records, particularly in relation to the 4.2 ka BP drought event apparent in certain other regional climate records.",

Geodetic crustal deformation studies require accurate estimate of the parameters which demands realistic estimate of the uncertainties in order to constrain the signal. GPS based crustal deformation studies in tectonically active region, such as Central and Eastern Himalaya have been carried out by several groups however, proper noise characteristics of GPS time series of this study region are unknown. In this work, we attempt to address the noise characteristics of GPS position time series by analysing the GPS time series of 22 stations from North-East India, Bhutan and Nepal Himalaya spanning 2002-2013. We have employed Spectral analysis and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to study the noise characteristics. Power spectrum obtained by using Lomb-Scargle method reveals characteristics of white noise at the high frequencies and power law noise at lower frequencies. Estimation of the spectral index by finding the slope of the spectral curve suggests fractal white noise with overall index of -0.61. MLE was performed in two ways. First, by assuming the time series to be composed of (a) white (WN), (b) white plus flicker (FL) and (c) white plus random walk noise (WRN) and then by estimating spectral index assuming the noise to be composition of white and power law noise (WPN). The comparison of MLE values of three noise model suggest that white plus flicker noise model (FL) is the most preferred noise model. Comparison of velocity uncertainties between white noise and white plus flicker noise, obtained from MLE, suggest that velocity uncertainty is under estimated by factor of ~8 when simple white noise model is used. The spectral index estimated using MLE is -1.1 (~1) which suggests that flicker noise is the main power law noise in time series of all 22 GPS stations. A slight difference of noise amplitudes of two different monument types (Concrete Pillar and Shallow drilled braced monuments) is also observed which rules out the preference of one over the another.",

In the Western Alps, available results of anisotropy investigations (SKS splitting) show clear belt-parallel anisotropy. In the Eastern Alps this pattern not only is broken but also does not follow the strike of Carpathians and Dinarides. In this study, we characterize upper mantle anisotropic structure and deep deformation pattern for the Carpathian-Pannonian region. We reprocess the SKS splitting parameters from the teleseismic events recorded by the Carpathian Basin Project (CBP) stations. We investigate these measurements together with the petrologic indicator of deformation in basalt-hosted upper mantle xenoliths from the Pannonian basin in terms of deformation geometry and its responsible tectonics. The observed anisotropy is referred to an asthenospheric origin and is interpreted as the flow/alignments within the upper mantle. We consider the models which have been suggested so far to explain the evolution and current stage tectonics of the Pannonian basin according to the deformation pattern observed from the SKS splitting results. This is followed by discussion about the (in)consistency between these models and our results. We present here the most plausible model of interaction between asthenospheric mantle with overlying and surrounding lithosphere which may possibly explain the deep deformation pattern in relation with the present-day tectonics of the CPR.",

            "abstract": "Fine-grained sedimentary rocks (shale, mudstone) play important roles in global CO2 abatement efforts through their importance in carbon capture and storage (CCS), radioactive waste storage, and shale gas extraction. These different technologies rely on seemingly conflicting premises regarding the sealing properties of shale and mudstone, suggesting that fine-grained rocks that lend themselves to hydrocarbon extraction may not be optimal seals for CCS or radioactive waste storage, and vice versa. In this paper, a compilation of experimental data on the properties of well-characterized shale and mudstone formations is used to demonstrate that clay mineral mass fraction, Xclay, is a master variable that controls key material properties of these formations and that a remarkably sharp threshold at Xclay ~ 1/3 separates fine-grained rocks with very different properties. This threshold coincides with the predictions of a simple conceptual model of the microstructure of sedimentary rocks and is reflected in the applications of shale and mudstone formations for CCS, radioactive waste storage, and shale gas extraction.",

            "abstract": "The third zone of our solar system, including the Pluto system, has a unique illumination environment at UV wavelengths. While direct solar Lyman-α emissions dominate the signal at 121.6 nm at classical solar system distances, the contribution of illumination by Interplanetary Medium (IPM) Lyman-α sky-glow is roughly on par at Pluto (Gladstone et al. 2015). The Pluto-Alice UV imaging spectrograph on New Horizons conducted several dedicated sky scans to measure the IPM Lyman-α both en route to and while at Pluto. These scans provide 6° by 360° great-circle swaths while spinning the spacecraft. Three sets of scans conducted en route are reported in Gladstone et al. (2012). During the Pluto encounter, sets of scans with six such swaths evenly spaced ~30° apart for all-sky coverage were obtained just before closest approach and again just after. These measurements agree well with brightness variations expected for IPM brightnesses peaking in the sunward direction and interspersed with detections of UV bright stars and other sky features. Previous studies estimated contributions of ~2/3rds direct solar Lyα and 1/3rd IPM Lyα. Our early results suggest that these model predictions need revision. These findings have important implications for determining the rates of photochemical reactions within Pluto's atmosphere that are driven by UV photons at 121.6 nm. Similarly, new constraints are provided to the rates of photolysis on Charon's polar winter nightside. These constraints are useful for understanding the volatile transport and long-term stability of the dark red region near Charon's pole discovered by New Horizons.",

            "abstract": "High-magnitude (>105 m3/s) outburst floods have the potential to dramatically alter landscapes and greatly impact human lives and infrastructure. Numerical modeling can help us understand the hydraulics of these infrequent and difficult to observe floods, but their scale makes simulation challenging and computationally expensive, particularly where rugged mountain topography produces complex flow hydraulics. Here we simulate the second largest historical outburst flood on record using GeoClaw open source software for modeling geophysical flows, and ground-truth the results of these simulations using observations and geomorphic evidence of the event. This landslide-dam outburst flood was sourced in Tibet on the Yigong River in June 2000, scouring vegetation, triggering landslides and depositing flood sands in hydraulically sheltered areas downstream. We mapped these features in the field and remotely using Google Earth and Landsat-7 imagery, and simulated the flood with a reconstructed 2 Gm3 impounded lake using instantaneous dam failure. Simulated inundation and the arrival-time of the flood wave downstream are relatively insensitive to the Manning bed-roughness parameter implemented in GeoClaw, but are very sensitive to grid-resolution and the chosen Adaptive Mesh Refinement scheme. High-resolution simulations produce estimates of discharge and the arrival-time for the initial flood wave that compare favorably to observations of the event recorded at locations up to 450 km downstream, and inundation maps that match the mapped distribution of high water marks. GeoClaw simulations (1) show inundation and decreasing bed shear stresses during the waning stage of the flood in the areas that contain observed slackwater deposits and (2) produce sustained deep flows in regions where landslides were observed directly after the event, showing a clear link between flood hydraulics and geomorphic change due to erosion/deposition. Results suggest that GeoClaw can accurately simulate high-magnitude outburst flood events through mountainous topography, showing the potential of this modeling approach to improve hazard predictions and our understanding of the geomorphic impact of outburst floods.",

            "abstract": "Changes in stratospheric composition can affect tropospheric composition and vice versa. Of particular interest are trace gas concentrations at the interface between these two atmospheric layers in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This is due to the crucial importance of composition changes in the UTLS for the global energy budget. In a recent study (Nowack et al., 2015), we provided further evidence that composition changes in the tropical UTLS can significantly affect global warming projections. Using a state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model, we found a ~20% smaller global warming in response to an abrupt 4xCO2 forcing if composition feedbacks were included in the calculations as compared to simulations in which composition feedbacks were not considered. We attributed this large difference in surface warming mainly to circulation-driven decreases in tropical UTLS ozone and related changes in stratospheric water vapor, partly counteracted by simultaneous changes in ice clouds. Here, we explain why this result is expected to differ between models and how, inter alia, tropospheric chemical mechanisms can contribute to this uncertainty. We highlight that improving our understanding of processes in the tropical UTLS and their representation in Earth system models remains a key challenge in climate research.\nFinally, taking geoengineering as a new example, we show that changes in the stratosphere can have an impact on air quality in the troposphere. In particular, we explain for a simple solar radiation management scenario how changes in surface ozone can be linked to changes in meteorology and composition in the troposphere and stratosphere. In conclusion, we highlight the importance of considering air quality impacts when evaluating a variety of geoengineering scenarios.\n",

Since the early part of the last decade, pupillometry, the study of pupils in response to cognitive tasks, have gained traction in psychophysiological studies. Muscles of the iris work in tandem with the autonomic nervous system in response to light condition to either dilate or contract the pupil, usually between 2 to 7 mm. Along with this response to light conditions, the pupils also contract or dilate in response to emotional or mental response. Therefore, for a cognitive task, if the ambient brightness is controlled, pupil dilation reflects the cognitive load associated with the task. Simple tasks such as counting, memorizing, multiplying and visual searching have been found to have pupillometry profiles reflective of the cognitive load involved with such tasks. In this study, we investigate whether pupil diameter can be used for education research where tasks can be more complex. In particular, we look at two specific types of tasks common in geoscience and several other STEM fields: graph reading and spatial problem solving. ",

It is the oldest in a series of three so-called “monotonous intermediate” ignimbrites from the Indian Peak-Caliente volcanic field in southern Utah and Nevada. A crystal-rich (~50% Pl + Qz + Hbl + Bt + Mag + Ilm + Cpx + Zrn + Ap + Po) dacite (62 – 69 wt% SiO2), the Cottonwood Wash Tuff is similar in age, volume, mineralogy, crystallinity, and elemental composition to the 28.0 Ma, ~5000 km3 Fish Canyon Tuff (~45% Pl + Kfs + Qz + Hbl + Bt + Ttn + Mag + Ilm + Ap + Zrn + Po, 66 – 68 wt% SiO2), used as the basis of the rejuvenation model. The Cottonwood Wash magma chamber was compositionally varied as shown by mineral and juvenile clast compositions. Whole-rock compositional variations are likely due to the variation of mineral proportions induced by shear in the magma chamber. Mineral compositions and experimental phase relationships show the pre-eruption magma crystallized at 800°C, 2.5 kb under water-undersaturated but oxidized conditions (delta QFM = 2.1). The majority of plagioclase and amphibole grains exhibit small-scale oscillatory zonation; where systematic compositional zonation exists, normal and reverse zonation are equally present. Cathodoluminescence of quartz reveals typically normally zoned phenocrysts with late resorption, considered to be the result of eruptive decompression. Many of the characteristics used to identify the rejuvenation of a near-solidus mush for the Fish Canyon Tuff are not present in the Cottonwood Wash Tuff [i.e., reversely zoned hornblende or plagioclase, partially remelted mineral aggregates, evidence of fluid saturation, resorption textures not related to decompression, rapakivi mantles, and hybrid andesite inclusions.] The Cottonwood Wash magma system did not undergo rejuvenation from a near-solidus state. Instead, the magma was apparently cooling and crystallizing just prior to eruption.",

The Yanhe River is the main river that causes floods and damages to the Yanan city. The YRB contributes significantly to the total sediment yield in the Yellow River. A great number of water and soil conservation measures including terracing, afforestation, and construction of sediment-trapping dams have been implemented since the 1960s. It is important to investigate the contributions of climate change and human activities affecting the changes of flood-season streamflow and to provide a scientific basis for future flood prevention. The data from six hydrological stations and 22 meteorological stations of YRB are used in this study. Two nonparametric methods, the Mann-Kendall test and the Pettitt test, are used to detect change trend and change point in the flood-season streamflow for the period of 1952 to 2003. The lumped conceptual daily hydrological model SIMHYD and one kind of sensitivity-based method are used to assess the impact of climate change and human activities to flood-season streamflow. The results show that the change point in flood-season streamflow occurred in 1972. The flood-season streamflow has decreased by 34.2% from 1972 to 2003 compared with the period from 1952 to 1971. The flood-season streamflow becomes more sensitive to change in precipitation than change in potential evapotranspiration (PET) in 1972-2003. The impact of human activities is greater than climate change after 1972. The effects of climate change and human activities on flood-season streamflow account for about 36% and 64% respectively.",

            "abstract": "The evolution and speciation of plants is directly tied to the environment as the constrained stages of dispersal creates strong genetic differentiation among populations. This can result in differing genetic patterns between nuclear and chloroplast loci, where genes are inherited differently and dispersed via separate vectors. By developing distribution models based on genetic patterns found within a species, it is possible to begin understanding the influence of historic geomorphic and/or climatic processes on population evolution. If genetic patterns of the current range correlate with specific patterns of climate variability within the Pleistocene, it is possible that future shifts in species distribution in response to climate change can be more accurately modelled due to the historic signature that is found within inherited genes. Preliminary genetic analyses of Linanthus dichotomus, an annual herb distributed across California, suggests that the current taxonomic treatment does not accurately depict how this species is evolving. Genetic patterns of chloroplast genes suggest that populations are more correlated with biogeography than what the current nomenclature states. Additionally, chloroplast and nuclear genes show discrepancies in the dispersal across the landscape, suggesting pollinator driven gene flow overcoming seed dispersal boundaries. By comparing discrepancies between pollinator and seed induced gene flow we may be able to gain insight into historical pollinator communities within the Pleistocene. This information can then be applied to projected climate models to more accurately understand how species and/or communities will respond to a changing environment.",

The surface-atmosphere interaction to produce Martian perchlorate involves the injection of chlorine oxides into the atmosphere through surface radiolysis and the subsequent chemical conversion to perchloric acid (HClO4), followed by surface deposition and mineralization to perchlorate. Considering the chlorine oxide, OClO, we find an effective mechanism for forming perchloric acid, bypassing the efficient Cl/HCl recycling mechanism that characterizes HClO4 formation mechanisms proposed for the Earth. Through this mechanism, an OClO surface flux as low as 3.2*107 molecules cm–2 s–1 could produce enough HClO4 to explain the perchlorate concentration observed on Mars. These results could have wide-ranging implications in our understanding of chlorine chemistry on both Earth and Mars.",

            "abstract": "The Stochastic Total Tendency Perturbation (STTP) scheme was designed to represent the model related uncertainties not considered in the numerical model itself and the physics based stochastic schemes. It has been applied in NCEP’s Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) since 2010, showing significant positive impacts on the forecast with improved spread-error ratio and probabilistic forecast skills. The scheme is robust and it went well with the resolution increases and model improvements in 2012 and 2015 with minimum changes.\nRecently, a set of stochastic physics schemes are coded in the Global Forecast System model and tested in the GEFS package. With these schemes turned on and STTP off, the forecast performance is comparable or even superior to the operational GEFS, in which STTP is the only contributor to the model related uncertainties. This is true especially in week one. However, over the second week and beyond, both the experimental and the operational GEFS has insufficient spread, especially over the warmer seasons. This is a major challenge when the GEFS is extended to sub-seasonal (week 4-6) time scales.\nThe impact of STTP on the GEFS forecast in the presence of stochastic physics is investigated by turning both the stochastic physics schemes and STTP on and carefully tuning their amplitudes. Analysis will be focused on the forecast of extended range, especially week 2. Its impacts on week 3-4 will also be addressed.",

            "abstract": "A major issue for CO2 storage security is the efficiency and long-term reliability of the trapping mechanisms occurring in the reservoir where CO2 is injected. Residual trapping is one of the key processes for storage security beyond the primary stratigraphic seal. Although classical conceptual models of residual fluid trapping assume that disconnected ganglia are permanently immobilized, multiple mechanisms exist which could allow the remobilization of residually trapped CO2.\nThe aim of this study is to quantify fluid phases saturation, connectivity and morphology after imbibition using x-ray microtomography in order to evaluate potential changes in droplets organization due to differences in capillary pressure between disconnected ganglia. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of image resolution.\nSynchrotron-based x-ray microtomographic datasets of air-water spontaneous imbibition were acquired in sintered glass beads and sandstone samples with voxel sizes varying from 0.64 to 4.44 µm. The results show that for both sandstones the residual air phase is homogeneously distributed within the entire pore space and consists of disconnected clusters of multiple sizes and morphologies. The multi-scale analysis of subsamples of few pores and throats imaged at the same location of the sample reveals significant variations in the estimation of connectivity, size and shape of the fluid phases. This is particularly noticeable when comparing the results from the images with voxel sizes above 1 µm with the results from the images acquired with voxel sizes below 1 µm.",

Such events tend to be highly localized and thus yield local energy and momentum deposition and efficient secondary gravity wave generation expected to have strong influences at higher altitudes [e.g., Fritts et al., 2013; Baumgarten and Fritts, 2014]. Lidars, radars, and airglow imagers typically cannot achieve the spatial resolution needed to fully quantify these small-scale instability dynamics. Hence, we employ high-resolution modeling to explore these dynamics in representative environments. Specifically, we describe numerical studies of gravity wave packets impinging on a sheet of high stratification and shear and the resulting instabilities and impacts on the gravity wave amplitude and momentum flux for various flow and gravity wave parameters.\n",

This is commonly referred to as the exposure model or dataset. When modelling large areas, developing exposure datasets with the relevant information about every individual building is not practicable. Thus, census data at coarse spatial resolutions are often used as the starting point for the creation of such datasets, after which disaggregation to finer resolutions is carried out using different methods, based on proxies such as the population distribution. While these methods can produce acceptable results, they cannot be considered ideal. Nowadays, the availability of open data is increasing and it is possible to obtain information about buildings for some regions. Although this type of information is usually limited and, therefore, insufficient to generate an exposure dataset, it can still be very useful in its elaboration. In this paper, we focus on how open building data can be used to develop a gridded exposure model by disaggregating existing census data at coarser resolutions. Furthermore, we analyse how the selection of the level of spatial resolution can impact the accuracy and precision of the model, and compare the results in terms of affected residential building areas, due to a flood event, between different models.",

Using single-column simulations at the Southern Great Plains site, we found that the underestimated nighttime rainfall of diurnal cycle can be greatly improved when two convective triggering designs from the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert scheme (SAS) are implemented into the default Zhang-Mcfarlane (ZM) scheme. We further conducted AMIP-type climate simulations with this modified ZM scheme (ZMMOD), and found that improvements can also be seen for the diurnally propagating convection over topographical regions, such as Maritime Continent and the western coast of Columbia. We further examined the rainfall variability from synoptic to intraseasonal scales, and found that using ZMMOD scheme increases rainfall variability of 2-10-day over South America and Africa land regions. However, this improvement does not seem to transfer to the intraseasonal convective organization (20-100 days), such as the MJO. This study demonstrates the importance of convective triggering and its impacts on convective variability. This work is still on-going to understand the physical processes of such impacts and how they might affect climate systems through multiscale interactions.",

            "abstract": "Marine stratus clouds are an important feature of the global climate system. Drizzle plays an important role in the determining cloud lifetime. Drizzle not only removes water from the cloud but evaporation of the falling droplets cools the sub-cloud layer acting to suppress convection. Drizzle rates are often very small and difficult to measure.\nThe ratio of millimeter radar and High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) backscatter is used to determine drizzle rates and these are compared to conventional ground based measurements. The robustly calibrated HSRL backscatter cross section provides advantages over measurements made with traditional lidars.\nSeveral investigators have used simultaneous lidar and radar observations to determine particle size. However, measurements made with conventional lidar are hampered by: 1) changes in the transmission of the output window caused by water accumulation, 2) the difficulty of correcting the backscatter signal for atmospheric extinction, 3) the effects of multiple scattering, and 4) the need to convert backscatter measurements to extinction. The use of High Spectral Resolution Lidar(HSRL) data avoids many of these problems. HSRL backscatter measurements are referenced to the known molecular scattering cross-section at each point in the profile and are thus independent of changes in window and atmospheric transmission.\nThis study uses data collected during the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Sciences program MAGIC campaign. Instruments including a suite of conventional precipitation gages, a High Spectral Resolution Lidar, along with 3.2 mm wavelength WACR and a 8.6 mm wavelength KAZR radars, were installed on the container ship Horizon Spirit as it made repeated trips between Long Beach, CA and Honolulu, HI.",

Data will be used to support model development and identification of improved land management strategies that have global applications. By applying standard methods, the Network will overcome the common challenge of synthesizing independent studies to assess local-to-national scale wind erosion and dust emission. Twelve intensively instrumented Network sites will be operational by spring 2016, providing high-resolution measurements of aeolian sediment transport rates, meteorological conditions and soil and vegetation properties. These initial sites are located across rangelands and croplands in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Idaho and Washington. A primary objective of the Network is to facilitate collaboration among Network sites and the wider research community to address basic research questions about aeolian processes, model development, and evaluate practical management options. In support of Network activities, winderosionnetwork.org was developed to serve as a Network data portal, and provide online information about the National Wind Erosion Research Network including protocols and results. The website provides a comprehensive resource for scientists and managers interested in engaging with the Network and accessing Network products. The Network provides exciting opportunities to engage in a national long-term wind erosion research program that promises significant impact for our understanding and ability to predict and evaluate aeolian processes across land cover types and land use systems.",

            "abstract": "Alaska's over 50 historically active volcanoes span 2,500 kilometers, and their eruptions pose great threats to the aviation industry. This makes both prompt observations of explosion onsets and changes in intensity a necessity. Due to their expansive range and remoteness, these volcanoes are predominantly monitored by local seismic networks, remote observations including satellite imagery and infrasound sensors. Infrasound is an especially crucial tool in this area because infrasound data collection is not obstructed by frequent cloud cover (as in satellite imagery) and infrasound waves can travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers. However, infrasound station coverage is relatively sparse and strong wind and temperature gradients in the atmosphere create multiple waveguides and shadow zones where the propagation of infrasound is enhanced and diminished, respectively. To accurately constrain volcanic source information and the long-range propagation of infrasound waves, a detailed characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of the atmosphere is vital. These properties can be constrained using a ground-to-space model similar to that of Drob et al. (2003) based upon varied meteorological observations and applied to infrasound waves to model the propagation of infrasound. Here we present the first results of a re-analysis system constructed by the Alaska Volcano Observatory to accurately characterize and model long-range infrasound propagation from volcanic eruptions. We select a number of case studies to examine infrasound detections (or lack thereof) from recent eruptions of Alaskan volcanoes, including the November 2014 eruption of Pavlof Volcano and July 2015 eruption of Cleveland Volcano. Detailed examination of the acoustic propagation conditions will provide additional insight into detection capability and eruption dynamics with future work aiming to implement real-time long-range infrasound propagation modeling.\n\nDrob, Douglas P., J.

Field observations of paleo-sea level indicators must be adjusted for local tectonic deformation, subsequent sediment loading, dynamic topography (DT), and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Dynamic topography is often the most difficult of these corrections to determine, especially on million year timescales, but is essential when providing constraints on sea level and ice volume changes. GIA effects from high latitude ice sheets minimally impact northwestern Australia, making this region well suited for observing surface displacement due to mantle and tectonic processes. This study presents centimeter accuracy paleo-shoreline data from four distinct marine terraces in the Cape Range National Park, Australia, which document vertical displacement history along 100 kilometers of coastline. The mapped region has an anticlinal structure in the center that has been slowly uplifting the three older reef complexes over the Neogene, constraining the timing of deformation. These neotectonics are probably caused by reactivation of ancient fault zones normal to the principal horizontal compressive stress, resulting in the warping of overlaying units. The elevation data also suggests minimal vertical displacement since the last interglacial highstand. Well-preserved fossil coral were collected from each terrace and will be geochemically dated using Sr isotope and U-series dating methods. This dataset provides a better understanding of DT and neotectonic deformation in this region (useful for improving mantle viscosity models), and offers a means for improving past sea level reconstructions in northwestern Australia.",

            "abstract": "Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM’s) are flexible regression models that are increasingly used in ecological and environmental studies to assess spatial and temporal trends in complex monitoring data. GAMM’s hold promise for analysis of spatially and temporally correlated hydrogeologic data, but have been used only sparingly. Here we employed GAMM’s to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of pathogen indicators (E. coli and total coliform [TC]) and nitrate in the vulnerable Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer (ASA), and to explore potential relationships with hydrologic and climatic drivers, such as precipitation, streamflow, and groundwater level and temperature. A total of 46 wells sampled over a one year period showed more than 50% of samples exceeded 10 mg-N/L for nitrate. E. coli detections in groundwater were infrequent (4 of 385 total samples) and attributed mainly to surface water-groundwater connections. TC was detected frequently in groundwater (70% of samples) and the widespread TC distribution across the ASA could not be attributed solely to surface water connectivity. GAMM’s showed that increased TC values in the wet season were most strongly related to groundwater temperatures and levels, while precipitation and well location were weaker (but still significant) predictors. In contrast, seasonal trends in nitrate were not significantly related to hydrologic forcings. Instead, nitrate concentrations across the aquifer were controlled by well location and depth, likely due to spatially variable nitrogen loading and localized geochemical attenuation. Major differences in nitrate and bacterial loading to the ASA were apparent in this study, and management strategies specific to each nonpoint source contaminant are recommended for improved source water protection.",

            "abstract": "Microbes drive processes in the Earth system far exceeding their physical scale, mediating significant fluxes in the global C and N cycles. The tools of synthetic biology have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of microbes’ role in the Earth system; however, these tools have not yet seen wide laboratory use because synthetically “programmed” microbes typically report by fluorescing (expressing green fluorescent protein), making them challenging to deploy into many Earth materials, the majority of which are not transparent and are heterogeneous (soils, sediments, and biomass). We are developing a new suite of biosensors that report instead by releasing gases.\nWe will provide an overview of the use of gas-reporting biosensors in biogeochemistry and will report the development of the systematics of these sensors. These sensors will make tractable the testing of gene expression hypotheses derived from metagenomics data. Examples of processes that could be tracked non-invasively with gas sensors include coordination of biofilm formation, nitrification, rhizobial infection of plant roots, and at least some forms of methanogenesis, all of which are managed by an easily-engineered cell-cell communication system. Another relatively simple process to track with gas sensors is horizontal gene transfer.\nSuccessful development of gas biosensors for Earth science applications will require addressing issues including: engineering the intensity and selectivity of microbial gas production to maximize the signal to noise using the tools of synthetic biology; normalizing the gas reporter signal to cell population size, since the number of cells and gene expression both contribute to gas production; managing gas diffusion effects on signal shape; and developing multiple gases that can be used in parallel to report on multiple biological processes in parallel. We will report on progress addressing each of these issues.",

            "abstract": "Because of high canopy interception in tropical forests, evaporation from wet canopy surfaces makes up a sizeable portion of the total water vapor flux. The modeling complexities presented by changing canopy wetness, along with a scarcity of land-atmosphere flux exchange data from tropical forests, means evapotranspiration (ET) processes have been poorly represented in the tropics in land-surface modeling schemes. To better understand tropical forest ET, we will evaluate the influence of canopy wetness and various micrometeorological data on ET partitioning and total ET flux.\nWe have collected flux data from a lower montane forest in Costa Rica at a newly established AmeriFlux site, which notably has the highest mean annual precipitation of any site in the network. The site features a 39-m canopy tower, equipped with two eddy covariance systems (LI-7200, LI-COR), a CO2/H2O atmospheric profile system (AP200, Campbell Scientific), leaf wetness sensors (LWS, Decagon Devices), sap flow sensors, and a soil respiration chamber (LI-8100A, LI-COR) as well as an array of other micrometeorological sensors.\nAt the site, total ET is driven primarily by available energy, and to a lesser extent, by vapor pressure deficit. Average daily latent energy fluxes peak at values of 160, 75, and 35 W m-2 for dry, partially wet, and wet canopy conditions respectively. Correlations between latent energy flux and all other variables are strongest for drier canopy conditions. Complex relationships between canopy wetness and tropical forest ET cause the environmental controls on these fluxes to be significantly different from those in other biomes. As a result, a new modeling paradigm is needed to more accurately model ET differences between tropical forests and other vegetation types.",

In the summer of 2014, in the Lake Erie Western Basin, an HAB of the cyanobacteria Microsystis was so severe that a water-use ban was in effect for the greater Toledo area, Ohio. This shut off the water supply to over 400,000 people from a single water intake. We investigated bloom intensity, composition, and spatial variability by comparing hyperspectral data from NASA's HICO, multispectral data from MODIS spaceborne imagers and NASA GRC's HSI imagers to on-lake ASD radiometer measurements using in situ water quality testing as ground reference data, all acquired on a single day during the bloom in 2014. HICO imagery acquired on Aug 15, 2014 was spatially georeferenced and atmospherically corrected using empirical line method utilizing on-lake ASD spectra. HSI imagery were processed in a similar way. Cyanobacteria Index (CI) images were created from processed images using the Wynne (2010) algorithm, previously used for MODIS and MERIS imagery. This algorithm-generated CI images provide reliable results for both ground level (R²=0.7784), and satellite imagery (R²=0.7794) for seven sampling points in Lake Erie’s western basin. Spatial variability in the bloom was high, and was not completely characterized by the lower spatial resolution MODIS data. The ability to robustly atmospherically correct and generate useful CI maps from airborne and satellite sensors can provide a time- and cost-effective method for HABs analysis. Timely processing of these high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data can aid in management of water intake resources.",

            "abstract": "The annual cycle of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is a key tracer of net community production and carbon export in the upper ocean. In particular, the DIC concentration is much less sensitive to air-sea gas exchange, when compared to oxygen, another key tracer of upper ocean metabolism. However, the annual DIC cycle is observed with a seasonal resolution at only a few time-series stations in the open ocean. Here, we consider the annual carbon cycle that has been observed using profiling floats equipped with pH sensors. Deep-Sea DuraFET pH sensors have been deployed on profiling floats for over three years and they can provide temporal and spatial resolution of 5 to 10 days and 5 to 10 m in the upper ocean over multi-year periods. In addition to pH, a second carbon system parameter is required to compute DIC. Total alkalinity can be derived from the float observations of temperature, salinity and oxygen using equations in these variables that are fitted to shipboard observations of alkalinity obtained in the global repeat hydrography programs (e.g., Juranek et al., GRL, doi:10.1029/2011GL048580, 2011), as the relationships should be stable in time in the open ocean. Profiling floats with pH have been deployed from Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) cruises since late 2012 and an array of floats with pH have been deployed since early 2014 in the Southern Ocean as part of the SOCCOM program. The SOCCOM array should grow to nearly 200 floats over the next 5 years. The sensor data was quality controlled and adjusted by comparing observations at 1500 m depth to the deep climatology of pH (derived from DIC and alkalinity) computed with the GLODAP data set. After adjustment, the surface DIC concentrations were calculated from pH and alkalinity. This yields a data set that is used to examine annual net community production in the oligotrophic North Pacific and in the South Pacific near 150 West from 40 South to 65 South.",

Remote sensing can effectively contribute to the surveillance of conservation measurements and laws through the monitoring of natural protected areas, at the required temporal and spatial scales. CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and hyperspectral spectroscopy. These two characteristics permit the study of structural and compositional traces of successional stages within the tropical dry forest. The current study presents the results of mapping the succession of tropical dry forest in the Parque Estadual de la Mata-Seca, in Minas Gerais, Brazil, using a temporal analysis of CHRIS/PROBA images in a time frame of 7 years, between 2008 and 2014. For the purpose the -55° angle of observation has been used, which enhances spectral differences between successional stages. Spectral Angle Mapper has been used for mapping succession of tropical dry forest and afterwards Change Detection Analysis has been performed. Based on our observations, the tropical dry forest in the Parque Estadual de la Mataseca recovers at a fast rate, for the observed period (2008-2014). More than the 50% of the early and intermediate forests has been recovered to a mature forest. Significantly, around a 12% of old pastures have been converted into forest. The spatial analysis also reveals that the areas that recover most rapidly are located in the east of the Park, close to mature forests. The provision of seeds from these forests might be the cause for the fast recovery.",

Inventories were calculated using emission factors from the IPCC, so the uncertainty in calculation is high. In 2014 the first laboratory equipped to measure CH4 started operations at the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán. The second laboratory was built at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México and it began operations in June 2015. The first laboratory consists of two open-circuit respiration chambers, which are currently used to measure CH4 emissions by cattle in Mexico’s tropical regions. Chamber dimensions are: 3.0 x 2.14 x 1.44 m (DxHxW). Air exiting the chambers is drawn by a mass flowmeter (Flowkit 500) at a rate of 500 L/min. The air sample is passed through a multiplexer and then through a chemical desiccant before entering the methane infrared analyzer (MA-10). All the instruments were fabricated by Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, USA. The average CH4 emission factor for Nelore bulls of 350 kg live weight fed with a tropical grass was 117.3 L/day and it increased to 198.6 L/day when 3 kg of concentrate feed were supplemented. For adult crossbred cows also fed with a tropical grass CH4 emission ranged from 92.7 to 137.3 L/day. The second laboratory consist of a respiration chamber of the head box type. It consists of a head box of 1.05 x 0.8 x 1.80 m (WxDxH) made of 3.5 x 3.5 cm stainless steel angle, and on the bottom, top, sides, back and front of the head box, 0.6 cm clear acrylic sheeting was used to provide comfortable vision to the animal, and a metabolic cage of 1.08 x 2.92 x 1.8 m (WxDxH) made of iron tubes with steel sheeting floor adapted for feces and urine collection. The methane analyzer and the mass flowmeter were of the same model as in the first laboratory. Once calibrated, in vivo measurements were performed using high yielding adult Holstein cows with an average live weight of 573 ±71 kg and milk yield of 30kg/day. The cows were fed maize silage, alfalfa hay and 4 kg concentrate feed. The average CH4 production was 484 ± 132 L/day. Emission factors obtained from both laboratories differed substantially from those used previously for inventories calculation in Mexico. IPCC factors are higher than those observed in our work particularly for cattle in the tropical regions of the country.",

Cloud cover-fire variations were assessed using the CERES SSF1Deg and MODIS active fire (MCD14ML) products in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Twelve years (2003-2014) of data have been analyzed spatially and temporally at four spatial scales: a) country level; b). 1x1 degree scale; c). land cover type; d). regions. Country-level results suggested Vietnam having the highest monthly cloud cover (72.37%) followed by Cambodia (69.69%), Laos (67.64%), Thailand (67.58%), and Myanmar (59.90%). Strong negative correlation between cloud cover and MODIS active fires has been observed during the biomass burning months (Jan–Apr). Of the different countries, Vietnam also had the lowest monthly fire detections. Pixel by pixel spatial correlation at 1x1 degree suggested negative fire-cloud relationships over the Red River Delta of Vietnam, the forests of northern Laos, and agriculture-dominated peninsulas of Thailand and Myanmar. Among the different land cover types, the average monthly cloud cover varied between 64% - 66%. Further, results from daily data showed the Red River Delta to have consistently more cloud cover (20–40% more) than the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, with fewer fire detections in the former than the latter. The study highlights potential fire under-detection due to clouds. Our results highlight spatial and temporal variations in cloud-fire relationships and the difficulty of using optical data for fire detection and characterization in persistently cloudy regions.",

These path-like features roughly perpendicular to the slope are frequently traversed by grazing animals on steep hillslopes. The soil properties and hydrologic function, however, are virtually unknown. This research aimed to identify differences in soil properties between terracette bench and riser features, and their influence on soil water content for two terracetted sites and two non-terracetted control sites (grazed and ungrazed) in Eastern Washington State. Measurements of volumetric water content (\nθ\nv\n), bulk density, soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, pH, and EC\na\nwere collected along with compaction, vegetative cover and cattle density throughout the 2013 and 2014 field seasons. Results show small but significant volumetric water content differences between terracette benches and risers in the upper 10 cm with benches exhibiting higher mean\nθ\nv\n than risers throughout the year. Soil bulk density on benches (1600 kg m\n−3\n) was significantly higher than that of risers (1300 kg m\n−3\n) with no differences in soil texture. The saturated hydraulic conductivity on benches was roughly half of that for risers. No significant soil differences were noted below 20 cm depth. Terracetted sites showed greater field-averaged\nθ\nv\n compared to non-terracetted sites suggesting a positive trend with animal stocking rates. Higher water content on terracette benches is attributed to shifts in pore size distribution with compaction, and a reduction in root-water uptake due to plant-root impedance. This increased soil water does not however increase forage production as it is not accessible to plants.",

            "abstract": "The offset of faults and related topographic relief varies hugely at both continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges (MORs). In some areas fault offset is measured in 10s of meters while in places marked by core complexes it is measured in 10s of kilometers. Variation in the magma supply is thought to control much of these differences. Magma supply is most usefully described by the ratio (M) between rates of lithospheric extension accommodated by magmatic dike intrusion and that occurring via faulting. 2D models with different values of M successfully explain much of the observed cross-sectional structure seen at rifts and ridges. However, magma supply varies along the axis of extension and the interactions between the tectonics and magmatism are inevitably three-dimensional. We investigate the consequences of this along-axis variation in diking in terms of faulting patterns and the associated structures using a 3D parallel geodynamic modeling code, SNAC. Many observed 3D structural features are reproduced: e.g., abyssal hill, oceanic core complex (OCC), inward fault jump, mass wasting, hourglass-shaped median valley, corrugation and mullion structure. An estimated average value of M = 0.65 is suggested as a boundary value for separating abyssal hills and OCCs formation. Previous inconsistency in the M range for OCC formation between 2D model results (M = 0.3∼0.5) and field observations (M < 0.3 or M > 0.5) is reconciled by the along-ridge coupling between different faulting regimes. We also propose asynchronous faulting-induced tensile failure as a new possibility for explaining corrugations seen on the surface of core complexes.\nFor continental rifts, we will describe a suite of 2D and 3D model calculations with a range of initial lithospheric structures and values of M. In one set of the 2D models we limit the extensional tectonic force and show how this affects the maximum topographic relief produced across the rift. We are also interested in comparing models in which the value of M varies as the rift evolves with observations from real rifts and continental margins. Finally, we plan to show how the faulting pattern in 3D can depend on the distribution of dike opening rate along segments for incipient continental rifts.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) emitted from natural (e.g. wetland) and anthropogenic (e.g. oil and gas industry, and waste management) sources contribute to Alberta’s GHG emission. The focus of this study is to examine the spatio-temporal variation of total column CH4 over Alberta, using data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS/Aqua satellite from 2003 to 2013. Spaceborne measurements by AIRS provide a global view of CH4 distribution in the mid-upper troposphere. This study demonstrates a significant rise of CH4 levels in Alberta in the last ten years. This ascending trend is consistent with the increase of global methane levels in the same time period. Monthly variations indicate a significant increase of CH4 levels in summer with maximum in August, which is probably driven by enhanced convection. Spatial distributions of CH4 reveal a strong west-east gradient with maximum levels in northern regions (55-65 N). The enhanced summer levels over northern and eastern regions suggest possible pathways for CH4 emitted from natural sources (wetlands, lakes and permafrost) in high northern latitude regions and Canadian wetlands (e.g. Hudson Bay wetland). However, the abrupt increase of CH4 concentration coincides with significant change in economic activities during that time period. Since some of the wetland CH4 fluxes are collocated with large anthropogenic source, it is difficult to account for different source contribution. Thus, further studies about CH4 emission and transport over Alberta are recommended to reduce the uncertainties about the natural and anthropogenic contributions of Alberta to Canada’s CH4 emissions.",

            "abstract": "Gravity waves (GWs) play an important role in transferring energy and momentum from the troposphere to the middle atmosphere. However, shorter period GWs are generally not explicitly resolved in general circulation models but need to be parameterized instead. Super pressure balloons, which float on the isopycnal surfaces, provide a direct access to measure GW characteristics as a function of wave intrinsic frequency that are needed for these parameterizations. The 30 s sampling rate of the GPS receivers carried on the balloons deployed in 2010 Concordiasi campaign in the Antarctic region is much higher compared to the previous campaigns and can cover the full range of the GW spectrum. Two among 19 balloons in the Concordiasi campaign are also equipped with the high-accuracy dual-frequency GPS receivers initially developed for GPS radio occultation research in addition to the regular single-frequency receivers, which enables us to expect a better accuracy of balloon positions for the purpose of GW momentum flux estimates. The positions are estimated using the Precise Point Positioning with Ambiguity Resolution (PPPAR) method based on the GPS data. Improvements of the positions are significant, from ~3-10 m to ~0.1-0.2 m in 3-D positions, which makes it possible to resolve the Eulerian pressure independently of height for the estimation of the intrinsic phase speed. The impacts of the position improvements on the final GW parameters (momentum flux and intrinsic phase speed) retrievals are highlighted, with ~0.54 mPa difference of the mean absolute momentum flux in Antarctic region and considerable difference in the distribution of the intrinsic phase speed.",

Concealed Uranium deposits under sedimentary cover, with poor surface indications calls for reorientation of survey with large inputs involving integrated geophysical approach. Sand Box experiments have been carried out over Uraninite ore. The tank is a glass fish tank (height 39 cm, length 75 cm, width 30 cm). It was filled with sand up to 35 cm high. The sand was saturated from below to minimize the entrapment of the gas bubbles. The average size for sand grains is ~ 0.295mm. The formation factor of the sand is 3.5, with a negligible surface conductivity because of the coarse nature of the sand grains. The dimension of considered Uraninite ore sample is 4cm⨯4cm⨯4cm. The depth of top of the ore sample is kept at 3cm. In this paper both resistivity and self-potential measurements were carried out for possible detection of Uraninite. The resistivity measurements were made with 64 non-polarizable electrodes using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) equipment of FlashRes Universal developed by ZZ Resistivity Imaging Pty. Ltd. We have used screws of length 3cm as electrodes. The separation between these electrodes are ~ 1cm. The resistivity tomography results clearly outlines the target Uraninite body. The resistivity tomography results also detects small heterogeneities associated with air bubbles possibly due to unsaturated pore spaces. SP measurements were made using two non-polarizing Pb∕PbCl2 electrodes and a Fluke 289 voltmeter (sensitivity 0.001 mV, internal impedance 100 MOhm). The reference electrode was located on the corner of the sandbox. The other electrode was used to scan the electrical potential at the surface of the sand. SP measurements were made with a spacing of 3 cm over the same ERT profile. The SP results also shows a dip (or a low SP anomaly) over the target ore body sample. Thus, both SP and ERT results show the presence of Uraninite and could be used on the routine basis for possible detection of Uraninite.",

            "abstract": "High-silica (74-77 wt% SiO2) rhyolites are the most evolved magmas on Earth and constitute some of the largest eruptions (1000s of km3). Of these, one classic example is the Bishop Tuff, a 760 ka eruption of >670 km3 of high-silica rhyolite erupted from Long Valley caldera, CA. Documenting dissolved H2O contents is crucial for understanding its origin and evolution. Analyses of water contents measured in quartz-hosted melt inclusions from the Bishop Tuff (Wallace et al. 1999; Anderson et al. 2000) show that the Early and Middle Bishop Tuff (Ig1Eb, Ig2Ea) have higher water contents (≤ 6.3 wt% H2O) than the Late Bishop Tuff (Ig2NWa; ≤ 5.2 wt%). Our work utilizes the revised plagioclase-liquid hygrometer (Waters & Lange, 2015), which is applicable to rhyolite, to evaluate internal consistency between Fe-Ti oxide temperatures, the plagioclase hygrometer, and melt inclusion H2O analyses. Two-oxide thermometry (Ghiorso & Evans, 2008), using all possible Fe-Ti oxide pairs (between 56 and 1500 pairs for individual samples), was carried out on 2-3 pumice clasts for each sampled eruptive unit. Resulting temperatures (°C ± 1σ) for individual clasts are: 705 ± 12, 728 ± 10 for unit Ig1Eb; 710 ± 12, 728 ± 11 for unit Ig2Ea; 752 ±10, 776 ± 8, 778 ± 7 for unit Ig2NWa; 791 ± 7, 795 ± 8 for unit Ig2Nb. The compositions of the most calcic plagioclase phenocrysts in the Early and Middle units are An17-19, whereas in the Late units they are An29-30. When the Fe-Ti oxide temperatures, whole rock analyses, and plagioclase compositions are incorporated into the plagioclase hygrometer, they give water contents at the onset of plagioclase crystallization of 6.6-6.9 wt% for the Early and Middle units and 4.8-4.9 wt % for the Late units. These results show internal consistency between melt inclusion analyses of water, Fe-Ti oxide thermometry, and the plagioclase-liquid hygrometer; they further support a temperature gradient across the Early, Middle, and Late Bishop Tuff units.",

Modern engineering works such as building embankment have enabled people to live even in flood prone areas, and over time population and economic assets have concentrated in these areas. In developing countries also, rapid land use change alters exposure and vulnerability to floods and consequently increases disaster risk.\nFlood hazard mapping is an essential step for any counter measures. It has various objectives including raising awareness of residents, finding effective evacuation routes and estimating potential damages through flood risk mapping. Depending on the objectives and data availability, there are also many possible approaches for hazard mapping including simulation basis, community basis and remote sensing basis. In addition to traditional paper-based hazard maps, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) promotes more interactive hazard mapping such as movable hazard map to demonstrate scenario simulations for risk communications and real-time hazard mapping for effective disaster responses and safe evacuations.\nThis presentation first summarizes recent advancement of flood hazard mapping by focusing on Japanese experiences and other examples from Asian countries. Then it introduces a flood simulation tool suitable for hazard mapping at the river basin scale even in data limited regions. In the past few years, the tool has been practiced by local officers responsible for disaster management in Asian countries. Through the training activities of hazard mapping and risk assessment, we conduct comparative analysis to identify similarity and uniqueness of estimated economic damages depending on topographic and land use conditions.",

            "abstract": "Capacity of carbon dioxide storage aquifers depends on a variety of factors including geologic properties and operational designs. The injection well numbers, well spacing and location, open versus closed boundary conditions, and injection with or without extraction of brine are of the parameters that impact the capacity of a storage site. Brine extraction from storage formations has been introduced as an effective strategy for enhancing the storage capacity and mitigating the risk of rapid pressure buildup. It is proposed that extracted brine can be disposed within an overlying formation or will be desalinated at surface facilities. Optimal well placement and rate of CO2 injection/brine extraction control achieving a predefined pressure constraint at the end of a specific period of storage operation. Reservoir simulation study is required to solve the two-phase flow of gas/brine and pressure buildup in the aquifer. Numerical simulation of geological storage using multiple injectors and extractors is costly and time consuming. Instead, analytical simulation can provide the results with a very good accuracy in a fraction of time compared to the numerical simulation. In this study, an analytical solution was implemented for pressure buildup calculation. The analytical model includes the effects of two-phase relative permeability, CO2 dissolution into reservoir brine and formation of a dry-out zone around the wellbore. Through the optimization algorithm coupled with analytical model, the optimal rates and locations of CO2 injectors and brine extractors were estimated, while simultaneously satisfying the pressure constraint to avoid fracture pressure in all injectors. The optimized results of analytical model was verified with a numerical simulator for several reservoir conditions, well configurations and operating constraints. The comparison of the results shows that the analytical model is a reliable tool for preliminary capacity estimation of saline aquifers and brine extraction can significantly increase the storage capacity.",

The goal of this study is to constrain velocity variations resulting from possible serpentinization of the incoming plate and the forearc mantle, and thus better understand the water budget of subduction zones. We use an ambient noise analysis method to reveal surface wave phase velocities at short period (8-30 s). Vertical component cross correlations show distinct fundamental and 1st higher-mode Rayleigh wave signals, especially between station pairs in the incoming plate. The 1st higher-mode Rayleigh wave is of significant importance for resolving crustal and shallowest upper mantle structure in regions covered by deep water. A multichannel cross correlation method (Eikonal tomography) is applied to Rayleigh waves from teleseismic earthquakes to obtain phase velocity at 25-80 s period. Finally the combined phase velocity curve from noise and teleseismic earthquakes is inverted at each point to determine the shear velocity structure. Preliminary inversion results for the incoming plate indicate slightly thickened crust that may be caused by a large Cretaceous igneous event associated with nearby seamounts. A high velocity anomaly emerges at around 20 km depth in the same region. We will present the entire 3-D shear wave velocity model across the trench during the AGU fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "Introduction\nIn magnetotelluric sounding data processing, the static shift correction is one of the most important steps. Due to the complexity of near-surface inhomogeneous bodies distribution, it is difficult to estimate the static shift of measured data. For this problem, we put forward on the basis of the inversion model for static shift estimation, and reconstructed the initial model with using the original data for 2D or 3D inversion.\nEstimation and Inversion method\nThe magnetotelluric impedance phase has the characteristics of not influenced by the static shift in Two-dimensional electrical structure. The objective function for static shift estimation can be constructed based on impedance phase data. On the basis of normal inversion, utilizing one-dimensional linear search algorithm, combined with the forward modeling, the MT static shift can be estimated.\nUsing estimation results for translation of anomaly measured curve. According to the inversion(1-D) of these translated curve, the initial model for two-dimensional or two-dimensional inversion can be reconstructed. On this basis, we do inversion for the original data, which not only can effectively eliminate the influence of static shift on the deep structure of inversion model, but also can get the right shallow electrical structure in the inversion\nConclusion\nThe estimation value of static shift based on impedance phase can be close to the true value. This estimation results can be used to modify the initial model, which makes the deep electric structure of the model more reasonable. On this basis, the inversion of the original data can ensure the correctness of the final inversion results (including shallow and deep).\nAcknowledgement\nThis paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation (41274078) and National 863 High Technology Research and Development Program (2014AA06A612).\n",

            "abstract": "Anaerobic bioremediation typically relies on electron donor addition, which supports reductively dechlorinating bacteria, but also stimulates other microbial groups including methanogens, and sulfate- and metal-reducers. This microbial activity can impact groundwater geochemistry and hydrology. For example, ferric iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria generate ferrous iron and hydrogen sulfide, respectively, causing iron(II) monosulfide (FeS) mineralization that can restrict or block pore throats. The impacts of potential FeS precipitation, and subsequent oxidation caused by infiltration of oxic groundwater, on porous media permeability of were investigated through a series of column and aquifer cell studies. FeS precipitation-caused permeability and porosity losses ranged from 0 – 73% and 1.2 – 7.2%, respectively, and this impact was most apparent in soils with high organic carbon content. In aquifer cell studies, FeS precipitation caused local reductions in permeability, which led to zones of hydraulic isolation and preferential flow paths. Further, microbial activity following biostimulation can also lower groundwater pH through the formation of organic acids and CO2, and the release of hydrochloric acid during dechlorination reactions. An obvious concern is activity loss of chlorinated ethene-detoxifying Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) strains, which are active at circumneutral pH, but show reduced dechlorination activity below pH 6.5. A series of batch reactors were established to explore the consequences of pH reduction on dechlorinating isolates and a Dhc-containing consortium. No tetrachloroethene (PCE) dechlorination occurred at pH 5.5 unless solids were added, suggesting that certain solids enable Dhc activity in low pH groundwater. The consortium exposed to pH 5.5 dechlorinated PCE-to-vinyl chloride (VC) upon transfer to pH 7; however, VC-to-ethene dechlorination activity did not recover, suggesting that VC-dechlorinating Dhc strains are particularly susceptible to low pH inhibition.",

            "abstract": "Many big science issues span large areas and require data from multiple heterogeneous sources, for example climate change, resource management, and hazard mitigation. Solutions to these issues can significantly benefit from access to a consistent and integrated geological model that would serve as a framework. However, such a model is absent for most large countries including Canada, due to the size of the landmass and the fragmentation of the source data into institutional and disciplinary silos. To overcome these barriers, the “Canada in 3D” (C3D) pilot project was recently launched by the Geological Survey of Canada. C3D is designed to be evergreen, multi-resolution, and inter-disciplinary: (a) it is to be updated regularly upon acquisition of new data; (b) portions vary in resolution and will initially consist of four layers (surficial, sedimentary, crystalline, and mantle) with intermediary patches of higher-resolution fill; and (c) a variety of independently managed data sources are providing inputs, such as geophysical, 3D and 2D geological models, drill logs, and others. Notably, scalability concerns dictate a decentralized and interoperable approach, such that only key control objects, denoting anchors for the modeling process, are imported into the C3D database while retaining provenance links to original sources. The resultant model is managed in the database, contains full modeling provenance as well as links to detailed information on rock units, and is to be visualized in desktop and online environments. It is anticipated that C3D will become the authoritative state of knowledge for the geology of Canada at a national scale.",

Solar eclipses offer a way to study the dependence of the ionospheric density and morphology on incident solar radiation. There are significant differences between the conditions during a solar eclipse and the conditions normally experienced at sunset and sunrise, including the east-west motion of the eclipse terminator, the speed of the transition, and the continued visibility of the corona throughout the eclipse interval. Taken together, these factors imply that unique ionospheric responses may be witnessed during eclipses. These include changes in the ionospheric electric fields, changes in the Total Electron Content (TEC) along paths through the eclipsed region, and variations in the density and altitude of the F2 peak. Several studies over the past century investigated these effects; however, some of the results from these studies are contradictory. These contradictions and the studies’ limited spatial resolution leave many fundamental questions unanswered.

            "abstract": "How do clouds and their effect on the surface radiation budget respond to variations in sea ice? The answer to this question depends significantly on the characteristics of the Arctic circulation. Sea ice-cloud interactions are important for modeling the Arctic climate. Specifically, understanding the cloud response to sea ice change is necessary for understanding the Arctic surface radiation budget, interannual variability in sea ice, and future changes in sea ice. Previous work has primarily addressed this problem from the interannual variability perspective. A novel perspective of sea ice-cloud interactions in the Arctic is provided here through a satellite footprint-level quantification of the covariance between sea ice and Arctic low cloud properties from NASA A-Train active remote sensing satellite data. The influence of atmospheric state on the cloud field must be considered. The covariance between Arctic low cloud properties and sea ice concentration is quantified by first partitioning each footprint into one of four atmospheric regimes defined by thresholds of lower tropospheric stability and mid-tropospheric vertical velocity. Regional variability is found in the cloud properties within each of these atmosphere state regimes indicating that the atmospheric state regimes do not account for the total influence of meteorological conditions on Arctic clouds. After removing the regional variability, a statistically significant covariance between cloud fraction and cloud total water is found within several atmospheric regimes. The covariance between clouds and sea ice is strongest in autumn and not statistically significant in winter and summer. The results indicate, however, that magnitude of any cloud response to changes in sea ice concentration is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the response of clouds to a change in the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic state. The atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic environment is the most important factor determining how clouds influence the surface radiation budget and therefore recent and future changes in sea ice.",

Signatures of flux ropes are spikes of magnetic field strength and magnetic field rotations. Using a minimum variance analysis of the MAVEN magnetometer data, we identify cases of large magnetic flux ropes downstream of crustal fields in the dayside Martian ionosphere. We also analyse concurrent plasma observations inside these structures performed with STATIC, SWEA, SWIA and LPW. A question of interest is the pressure balance across the flux ropes: if the increased magnetic pressure inside these structures is not associated with a thermal pressure decrease, then they are force-free. We use the MAVEN measurements to investigate the force-free or non force-free state of a number of flux ropes, and any dependence of such state on various parameters. The results are analysed in the light of previous studies made with measurements of small flux ropes in the Venusian ionosphere by Pioneer Venus Orbiter.",

From improving search results to enabling data mashups and other forms of interoperability, semantic technologies have proven themselves. But creating semantic resources, especially re-usable semantic resources, is extremely time consuming and labor intensive. Why? Because it is not just a matter of technology but also of obtaining rough consensus if not full agreement amongst community members on the meaning and order of things. One way to develop these resources in a more automated way would be to use NLP/ML techniques to extract the required resources from large corpora of subject-specific text such as peer-reviewed papers where presumably a rough consensus has been achieved at least about the basics of the particular discipline involved. While not generally applied to Earth Sciences, considerable resources have been spent in other fields such as medicine on these types of techniques with some success. The NSF-funded ClearEarth project is applying the techniques developed for biomedicine to the cryosphere, geology, and biology in order to spur faster development of the semantic resources needed in these fields. The first area being addressed by the project is the cryosphere, specifically sea ice nomenclature where an existing set of sea ice ontologies are being used as the “Gold Standard” against which to test and validate the NLP/ML techniques. The processes being used, lessons learned and early results will be described.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Subglacial Access and Fast Ice Research Experiment (SAFIRE) pressurised hot water was used to drill four 603-616 m-long boreholes to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet at a site located 30 km from the calving front of fast-flowing, marine-terminating Store Glacier (70° N, ~1000 m elevation). Despite the boreholes freezing within hours, 4 wired sensor strings were successfully deployed in three of the boreholes. These included a thermistor string to obtain the englacial temperature profile installed in the same borehole as a string of tilt sensors to measure borehole deformation, and two sets of water pressure, electrical conductivity and turbidity sensors installed just above the bed in separate, adjacent boreholes. The boreholes made a strong hydrological connection to the bed during drilling, draining rapidly to ~80 m below the ice surface. The connection of subsequent boreholes was observed as a perturbation in water pressure and temperature recorded in neighbouring boreholes, indicating an effective hydrological sub- or en-glacial connection between them. The sensors, which were all connected to loggers at the surface by cables, operated for between ~30 and 80+ days before indications suggest that the cables stretched and then snapped – with the lowermost sensors failing first. The records obtained from these sensors reveal (i) high and increasing water pressure varying diurnally close to overburden albeit of a small magnitude (~ 0.3 m H2O), (ii) a minimum extrapolated englacial temperature of -21°C with above-freezing temperatures at the bed, and (iv) high rates of internal deformation and strain increasing towards the bed as evinced by increasing tilt with depth. These borehole observations are complemented by GPS measurements of ice motion, meteorological data, and seismic and radar surveys.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonic reconstructions are estimates of the surface history of mantle circulation. Combining this information with a physical model of mantle convection allows to infer the history of the whole mantle circulation for the last hundreds of million of years. So far, the reconstructions of mantle circulation have been done by imposing plate reconstructions as surface conditions on numerical mantle convection models. This technique does not allow any dynamical feedback of mantle dynamics on surface tectonics. Mantle convection models are now able to generate plate-like tectonics self-consistently: they describe both the effect of plates on mantle convection, and the effect of mantle convection on the surface tectonics. We propose to use these convection models in combination with plate reconstructions to produce a new generation of mantle circulation models. For this purpose, we use the ensemble Kalman filter. This method has been developped and successfully applied to meteorology, oceanography and even more recently outer core dynamics. It consists in integrating sequentially a time series of data into a numerical model, starting from an ensemble of possible initial states. The initial ensemble of states is designed to represent an approximation of the probability density function (pdf) of the a priori state of the system. Whenever new observations are available, each member of the ensemble states is corrected considering both the aproximated pdf of the state, and the pdf of the new data. Between two observation times, each ensemble member evolution is computed independently, using the convection model. This technique provides at each time an approximation of the pdf of the state of the system, in the form of a finite ensemble of states. We perform synthetic experiments to assess the efficiency of this method for the reconstruction of mantle circulation.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - FF Poster Peroxy_12_14_2015.pdf\nHow did Earth get the water to fill its oceans? Upper mantle minerals, in particular olivine, pyroxenes and others, retrieved at the Earth’s surface, have consistently been found to contain low hydroxyl concentrations, indicative of a low to very low solute H2O contents. This has been interpreted for decades to mean that the upper mantle of the early Earth may not have had enough water to fill the oceans through volcanic and other degassing. To overcome this dilemma, large-scale cometary impacts are thought to have been necessary to supply the missing water. This interpretation is based on a misinterpretation of laboratory data obtained primarily by infrared absorption but also SIMS and related techniques. This interpretation disregards a pervasive redox conversion that takes place in the solid state, during cooling, changing pairs of solute hydroxyls into peroxy plus H2. This redox conversion simply rearranges electrons within hydroxyl pairs. It takes place under thermodynamic non-equilibrium conditions, at temperatures so low that diffusional processes in the mineral matrix are already frozen. As a result every mineral and rock brought to the surface of the Earth and retrievable for analysis has undergone this redox conversion. Its importance is that it produces molecular H2, interstitial in the matrix of minerals, difficult to assess analytically. It produces peroxy defects, which have been overlooked for a long time. H2 molecules may diffuse out of mineral grains, leaving behind the peroxy as a memory of the former solute water content. In order to fully assess the true solute H2O content in the Earth’s upper mantle it is necessary to take the peroxy contents into consideration.",

Water isotopologues record these shifts, but the interpretation is complicated because multiple factors – including temperature changes, precipitation changes, humidity changes, and vapor source distribution changes – influence the final composition.\nHere we utilize the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model (GISS-E2) to simulate deglacial changes in water isotopes (Ullman et al, 2014). We then utilize boundary conditions from the coupled model to drive atmospheric-only simulations that incorporate a separate and complementary suite of tracers called vapor source distribution tracers to identify shifts in moisture sources at key locations for paleoclimate archives.\nWe find large modulations in moisture convergences, vapor source distributions, as well as temperature and precipitation happening in parallel with the water isotopologue changes.

            "abstract": "The 25th of April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal affected a large area of central Nepal and adjacent parts of India and Tibet. It was followed by a number of large aftershocks, with the largest so far an Mw 7.3 aftershock on the 12th of May 2015. We integrate geodetic measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images to image the three-dimensional vector field of coseismic surface deformation for these two large events. We analyze SAR data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite operated by the European Space Agency; the RADARSAT-2 satellite operated by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA); and the Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) satellite operated by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. We combine less precise analysis of large scale displacements from the SAR images of the three satellites by pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation, including the along-track component of surface motion, with the more precise SAR interferometry (InSAR) measurements in the radar line-of-sight direction to estimate all three components of the surface displacement for the mainshock and large aftershock. A large area of central Nepal was pushed southward, due to thrust slip on the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) at depth extending about 170 km along-strike. The InSAR measurements show that there was no detectable slip on the shallower part of the MHT up-dip from the large coseismic slip or on other thrust faults in the Himalayas, except for one area of very shallow triggered slip of up to 5 cm on a thrust to the north of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust, during the two event. We also image postseismic deformation after these earthquakes with ongoing continuous GPS measurements and InSAR analysis of the SAR satellite data. Initial analysis of the GPS measurements indicates the most likely process in the first months is afterslip down-dip from the main coseismic slip. Large atmospheric effects in the InSAR measurements make it challenging to image deep afterslip, but the early interferograms appear to rule out any shallow afterslip up-dip from the mainshock and aftershock ruptures at the time of this writing. Preliminary modeling suggests that viscoelastic relaxation may not be measurable until we have 6-12 months of GPS and InSAR data.",

            "abstract": "The use of hydraulic fracturing of tight shales to produce oil and natural gas has grown significantly in recent years, yet it remains relatively inefficient, recovering only an estimated 5% and 25% of the oil and gas present, respectively. The need to improve efficiency and diminish environmental impact has prompted research into fundamental geochemical reactions occurring in shales. In particular, reactions between kerogen and fracture fluid components are poorly understood. Kerogen is the precursor of these hydrocarbons and contains metals in addition to organic material; it is also electron rich and therefore susceptible to oxidation and release of a variety of elements. Although some mineral phases in the shales are expected to undergo dissolution-precipitation reactions, kerogen is generally considered to be relatively unreactive [1]. Here we have investigated reactions between isolated kerogen and a hydraulic fracturing fluid typical of that used in the Marcellus shale. These experiments show that kerogen, as well as redox-sensitive minerals within shales, react with fracture fluid. In particular, kerogen exhibited more extensive release of certain metals (e.g. Al, Ba, Cu, among others) than was observed for bulk shale under the same experimental conditions. This evidence suggests that kerogen may be far more reactive to fracture fluids than previously thought. In particular, these results suggest that kerogen may significantly impact the compositions of produced waters, which have previously been attributed solely to mineral reactions. They also emphasize the need for further characterization of kerogen and its reactions with complex hydraulic fracturing fluids.\n[1] Vandenbroucke and Largeau (2007) Org. Geochem.",

            "abstract": "Citizen-led movements producing scientific environmental information are increasingly common during hazards. After the Japanese earthquake-triggered tsunami in 2011, the government produced airborne remote sensing data of the radiation levels after the Fukushima nuclear reactor failures. Advances in technology enabled citizens to monitor radiation by innovative mobile devices built from components bought on the Internet. The citizen-led Safecast project measured on-ground levels of radiation in the Fukushima prefecture which total 14 million entries to date in Japan. This non-authoritative citizen science collection recorded radiation levels at specific coordinates and times is available online, yet the reliability and validity of the data had not been assessed. The nuclear incident provided a case for assessment with comparable dimensions of citizen science and authoritative data. To perform a comparison of the datasets, standardization was required. The sensors were calibrated scientifically but collected using different units of measure. Radiation decays over time so temporal interpolation was necessary for comparison of measurements as being the same time frame. Finally, the GPS located points were selected within the overlapping spatial extent of 500 meters. This study spatially analyzes and statistically compares citizen-volunteered and government-generated radiation data. Quantitative measures are used to assess the similarity and difference in the datasets. Radiation measurements from the same geographic extents show similar spatial variations which suggests that citizen science data can be comparable with government-generated measurements. Validation of Safecast demonstrates that we can infer scientific data from unstructured and not vested data. Citizen science can provide real-time data for situational awareness which is crucial for decision making during disasters. This project provides a methodology for comparing datasets of radiological measurements over time and space. Integrating data for assessment from different earth sensing systems is an essential step to address the big data challenges of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity.",

            "abstract": "The Nankai Trough in southwest Japan is one of most active subduction zone in the world. Great mega-thrust earthquakes repeatedly occurred every 100 to 150 years in this area, it’s anticipated to occur in the not distant future. For the purpose of elucidation of the history of mega-splay fault activity, the physical properties of the geological strata and the internal structure of the accretionary prism, and monitoring of diastrophism in this area, we have a plan, Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiments (NanTroSEIZE), as a part of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).\nWe have a plan to install the borehole observation system in a few locations by the NanTroSEIZE. This system is called Long-Term Borehole Monitoring System, it consists of various sensors in the borehole such as a broadband seismometer, a tiltmeter, a strainmeter, geophones and accelerometer, thermometer array as well as pressure ports for pore-fluid pressure monitoring. The signal from sensors is transmitted to DONET (Dense Ocean-floor Network System for Earthquake and Tsunamis) in real-time. During IODP Exp. 332 in December 2010, the first Long-Term Borehole Monitoring System was installed into the C0002 borehole site located 80 km off the Kii Peninsula, 1938 m water depth in the Nankai Trough.\nWe have developed a web application system for data download, Long-Term Borehole Monitoring Data Site　(*1). Based on a term and sensors which user selected on this site, user can download monitoring waveform data (e.g. broadband seismometer data, accelerometer data, strainmeter data, tiltmeter data) in near real-time. This system can make the arbitrary data which user selected a term and sensors, and download it simply. Downloadable continuous data is provided in seed format, which includes sensor information. In addition, before data download, user can check that data is available or not by data check function.\nIn this presentation, we briefly introduce NanTroSEIZE and then show our web　application system. We also discuss our future plans for developments of monitoring data download system.\n*1 Long-Term Borehole Monitoring Data Site\n  http://join-web.jamstec.go.jp/borehole/borehole_top_e.html",

            "abstract": "Fluvial networks represent a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Recent evidence has highlighted the ubiquity of CO2 supersaturation in streams, rivers, and lakes worldwide, yet our understanding of how the source of this CO2 flux (e.g. in situ aquatic production versus soil and groundwater sources within the catchment) varies in time and across different aquatic systems remains limited. In this study we used continuous, high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) and CO2 to model stream metabolism and CO2 emissions for five stream sites across New Hampshire that vary in size, nutrient loading, and landscape context, with the goal of quantitatively partitioning the aquatic CO2 flux into catchment and aquatic sources, respectively. Spectral analysis of the DO and CO2 time series indicates that these gases often deviated from the pure inverse behavior that would be expected if CO2 flux originated solely from in-stream biological activity. Across all streams, the estimated contribution of aquatic net ecosystem production (NEP) to stream CO2 flux varied from approximately 0% to 50%. For each site, the proportion of CO2 flux supported by aquatic NEP was lower at higher discharge, perhaps due to increased CO2 transport from soils to streams during wetter periods, and/or due to effects of scouring flows and carbon removal on stream metabolism. Our data provides evidence that catchment sources represent substantial contributions to aquatic CO2 flux across temperate streams, but that the proportion of CO2 flux originating from net in situ production and carbon transformation is variable throughout the growing season.",

Here we report results from high resolution, fully kinetic simulations of plasmas turbulence in both two and three dimensions. The simulations show development of turbulent coherent structures, characterized by sheet-like current density structures spanning a range of scales. Results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are also compared with MHD simulations in terms of coherent structures, dissipation and intermittency. An important conclusion, for all simulations examined, is that the dissipation is concentrated in very small volumes, reminiscent of the scenario that motivates the Kolmogorov refined similarity hypothesis in hydrodynamic turbulence. Extrapolated to large heliospheric system sizes, this leads to the expectation of significant departures from heating processes that operate uniformly in space. Results from latest 3D driven PIC simulations, as well as the connection to solar wind observations, will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Plucking in bedrock channels can be the dominant erosional mechanism but is difficult to predict numerically due to variation in block shape and orientation in the flow, and the general lack of experimental data compared to alluvial sediments. In a 250 cm-long, 14 cm-wide flume, we modeled bedrock channels using a bedrock test zone consisting of < 1 cm-thick, fractured slabs of Plaster of Paris and sediment-free flow over an upstream step of 0 to 1.6 cm, a bed slope of 0.5 to1.24%, and a changing downstream backwater control on the location of a hydraulic jump. With flow velocity from 50 to 100 cm/s and depth from 3 to 10 cm, the low-density bedrock may well characterize natural bedrock plucking events in larger rivers in flood. Plucking initiated in critical to supercritical flow near hydraulic jumps. The first blocks to move lift from both the upstream and downstream sides and then other blocks slide both up- and downstream or laterally once neighbors are removed. Initiation of motion from each new bedrock slab began with different size and shape of blocks exhibiting no protrusion relative to the surrounding bed. Block erodibility increased with step height and channel slope and following the removal of the first block. A pressure gradient within the block mass near the jump and velocity differential within the channel margin set the stage for block uplift, but flow structures likely provide the variability that initiates lift. Preliminary flow visualization using Particle Image Velocimetry aids the understanding of flow structures contributing to blocks lift. Negative and positive feedback to further plucking was observed by erosion and deposition of plucked blocks. After their initial removal, blocks can accumulate downstream and slow the flow over the eroded reach or the position of jumps and jets shift with block removal to promote further plucking.",

In this paper, we propose a methodology for large-scale analysis of flood vulnerability. The methodology is based on a GIS-based index, which considers local topography, terrain roughness and basic information about the flood scenario to reproduce the diffusive behaviour of floodplain flow. The methodology synthetizes the spatial distribution of index values into maps and curves, used to represent the vulnerability in the area of interest. Its application allows for considering different levels of complexity of flood scenarios, from localized flood defence failures to complex hazard scenarios involving river reaches. The components of the methodology are applied and tested in two floodplain areas in Northern Italy recently affected by floods. The results show that the methodology can provide an original and valuable insight of flood vulnerability variables and processes.",

            "abstract": "Citizen science has emerged a means for augmenting the scope of research while educating the community. Environmental research has a particularly strong motivation for engagement, given its often-local context. We implemented a citizen science campaign to investigate relationships between land use and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface water environments proximal to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Citizen science was intended to increase sampling breadth, and engage the community about human activities and water quality effects. Participants were given a sample kit and a simple sampling protocol; we then used fast and economic absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry to determine DOM concentration and composition. Participants, including individuals from over 10 municipalities and community organizations, submitted over 200 samples; these were compared to investigator-led sampling, as well as data mining existing sources, to verify results. Analyzing the fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) with a five-component parallel factor (PARAFAC) model showed that samples from watersheds with increased urbanization had unique microbial-like peaks, suggesting variances in DOM lability and origins compared to more pristine watersheds. Community engagement was extended by making data available online in an interactive map, as well as by presenting the project to the public. Despite this, engagement occurred most with community organizations; these participants tended to have scientific training, with a higher knowledge baseline regarding their specific watershed and water quality issues generally. While this served scientific goals, our campaign was less successful at engaging citizens with less-developed scientific backgrounds. In this presentation we will discuss the merits and scientific milestones enabled by citizen science, and lessons learned about how to get beyond ‘preaching to the choir’ in crafting and implementing such projects.",

To apply Kaula’s rule to other bodies, the simple scaling based on the relative gravity of each body is used - (gEarth/gPlanet)2. This scaling was successfully used even for Vesta, where K = 0.011. However, if Kaula’s rule is applied to very small bodies, such as the OSIRIS-REx target asteroid Bennu, the scaling results in un-useable bounds. In this case, K ~ 105.

However, it is shown here that at the local spatial scale, warm unforced Tlocal anomalies tend to be associated with anomalously positive Nlocal imbalances over most of the surface of the planet. It is revealed that this occurs mainly because warm Tlocal anomalies are accompanied by anomalously low surface albedo near sea ice margins and over high altitudes, anomalously low cloud albedo over much of the mid/low-latitudes and an anomalously large water-vapor greenhouse effect over the deep tropical ocean. During warm Tglobal years, the largest negative Nlocal anomalies primarily occur over regions of cool or near-neutral Tlocal anomalies. These results help explain how TOA energy imbalances can act to damp unforced Tglobal anomalies while simultaneously amplifying unforced Tlocal anomalies.",

            "abstract": "One of the great unknowns in mountain hydrology is how much water is stored within a seasonal snowpack at the basin scale. Quantifying mountain water resources is critical for assisting with water resource management, but has proven elusive due to high spatial and temporal variability of mountain snow cover, complex terrain, accessibility constraints and limited in-situ networks. The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO, aso.jpl.nasa.gov) uses coupled airborne LiDAR and spectrometer instruments for high resolution snow depth retrievals which are used to derive unprecedented basin-wide estimates of snow water mass (snow water equivalent, SWE). ASO has been operational over key basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California since 2013. Each operational year has been very dry, with precipitation in 2013 at 75% of average, 2014 at 50% of average and 2015 – the lowest snow year on record for the region. With vastly improved estimates of the snowpack water content from ASO, we can now for the first time conduct observation-based mass balance accounting of surface water in snow-dominated basins, and reconcile these estimates with observed reservoir inflows. In this study we use ASO SWE data to constrain mass balance accounting of basin annual water storages to quantify the water contained within the snowpack above the Hetch Hetchy water supply reservoir (Tuolumne River basin, California). The analysis compares and contrasts annual snow water volumes from observed reservoir inflows, snow water volume estimates from ASO, a physically based model that simulates the snowpack from meteorological inputs and a semi-distributed hydrological model. The study provides invaluable insight to the overall volume of water contained within a seasonal snowpack during a severe drought and how these quantities are simulated in our modelling systems. We envisage that this research will be of great interest to snowpack modellers, hydrologists, dam operators and water managers worldwide.",

The weakly stable regime (WSBL) which occurs in the presence of moderate to strong pressure gradients or cloudy skies and is characterized by continuous turbulent mixing, and the very stable regime (VSBL) which occurs in the presence of weak pressure gradients or clear skies and turbulence weakens to the point of collapse. Modelling and observational results indicate that transitions from the WSBL to the VSBL occur when the maximum sustainable heat flux (or shear capacity) is exceeded. However, transitions from the VSBL to the WSBL are still not well understood. In this study we use an idealized model to explore transitions from the VSBL to the WSBL. In particular, we examine the influence of time-varying boundary conditions including changes in the longwave radiation and pressure gradient force. This analysis demonstrates how the idealized energy/momentum budget model with parameterized turbulence can reproduce the regime transitions present in atmospheric data.",

The mantle is modeled with viscous glucose syrup with an Arrhenius type temperature dependent viscosity. To characterize diapir evolution we experiment with a variety of fluids injected from multiple point sources. Diapirs interact with kinematically induced flow fields forced by subducting plate motions replicating a range of styles observed in dynamic subduction models (e.g., rollback, steepening, gaps). Data is collected using high definition timelapse photography and quantified using image velocimetry techniques.\nWhile many studies assume direct vertical connections between the volcanic arc and the deeper mantle source region, our experiments demonstrate the difficulty of creating near vertical conduits. Results highlight extreme curvature of diapir rise paths. Trench-normal deflection occurs as diapirs are advected downward away from the trench before ascending into wedge apex directed return flow. Trench parallel deflections up to 75% of trench length are seen in all cases, exacerbated by complex geometry and rollback motion. Interdiapir interaction is also important; upwellings with similar trajectory coalesce and rapidly accelerate. Moreover, we observe a new mode of interaction whereby recycled diapir material is drawn down along the slab surface and then initiates rapid fluid migration updip along the slab-wedge interface.\nVariability in trajectory and residence time leads to complex petrologic inferences. Material from disparate source regions can surface at the same location, mix in the wedge, or become fully entrained in creeping flow adding heterogeneity to the mantle. Active diapirism or any other vertical fluid flux mechanism employing rheological weakening lowers viscosity in the recycling mantle wedge affecting both solid and fluid flow characteristics. Many interesting and insightful results have been presented based upon 2-D, steady-state thermal and flow regimes. We reiterate the importance of 4-D time evolution in subduction models. Analogue experiments allow added feedbacks and complexity improving intuition and providing insight for further investigation.",

More than 300 farmers in Hokkaido, Japan, are participating on this development and they are utilizing our services for optimizing their daily agricultural practices. FieldTouch integrates multi-scale sensor data for field monitoring, provides functionality for recording agricultural practices, then supports farmers in decision making. The platform has two layers. The base layer is interoperable geospatial data infrastructure for sensor networks, that provides updated sensor data to upper application layer via OGC( Open Geospatial Consortium) standard API. We are updating RapidEye satellite images every two weeks, and field sensor data from 50 nodes. Agro-Weather data generated by NIAES using national weather observation network; AMeDAS is also a data source at daily basis. We use \"cloudSense\" sensor backend service as the infrastructure that serves meta-data and data to the application layer via standard web service; SOS (Sensor Observation Service). SOS provides unified procedure to applications when they access different type of sensor platform, which brought us a great flexibility and automation in operating the system. We developed a crop simulation application in FieldTouch so that farmers are able to see the impact of different planting data on yield. Cultivar data of local wheat variety for DSSAT crop model was calibrated by data assimilation. We generate 100 of weather scenario by a weather generator to present the obtain distribution of yield in different planting options. We update the weather scenario day by day in order to reduce the uncertain of the prediction towards harvesting. Visualizing expected yield as distributions help farmers to understand the risks by weather variability as well as to optimize their works and investment.",

We use the X-ray spectrum to analyze the electron beam characteristics and describe flare evolution . In this study we discuss the relationship between thermal and non-thermal emissions, we note that that the photon flux is dependent on both the spectral index of the electron distribution and the beam's thermal energy confirming previous observations (Reep et al. 2013) and we consider if the thin target model is an appropriate approximation of thick target bremsstrahlung.",

            "abstract": "In zones of distributed continental faulting, it is critical to understand how slip is partitioned onto brittle structures over both long-term millennial time scales and shorter-term individual earthquake cycles. The comparison of slip distributions on different timescales is challenging due to earthquake repeat-times being longer or similar to historical earthquake records, and a paucity of data on fault activity covering millennial to Quaternary scales in detail. Cosmogenic isotope analyses from bedrock fault scarps have the potential to bridge the gap, as these datasets track the exposure of fault planes due to earthquakes with better-than-millennial resolution. In this presentation, we will use an extensive 36Cl dataset to characterise late Holocene activity across a complicated network of normal faults in Abruzzo, Italy, comparing the most recent fault behaviour with the historical earthquake record in the region.\nExtensional faulting in Abruzzo has produced scarps of exposed bedrock limestone fault planes that have been preserved since the last glacial maximum (LGM). 36Cl accumulates in bedrock fault scarps as the plane is progressively exhumed by earthquakes and thus the concentration of 36Cl measured up the fault plane reflects the rate and patterns of slip. In this presentation, we will focus on the most recent record, revealed at the base of the fault. Utilising new Bayesian modelling techniques on new and previously collected data, we compare evidence for this most recent period of slip (over the last several thousands of years) across 5-6 fault zones located across strike from each other. Each sampling site is carefully characterised using LiDAR and GPR. We demonstrate that the rate of slip on individual fault strands varies significantly, between having periods of accelerated slip to relative quiescence. Where data is compared between across-strike fault zones and with the historical catalogue, it appears that slip is partitioned such that one fault zone takes up a significant portion of strain across the region for hundreds to thousands of years.",

            "abstract": "How does plastic response during the earthquake cycle affect nucleation and propagation during individual events and the recurrence intervals between events? How do damage zones evolve with increasing cumulative slip and how do they affect subsequent rupture? To explore these questions we are developing a robust, physics-based earthquake cycle model accounting for off-fault yielding over multiple event sequences. The method is developed for the anti-plane framework where interseismic loading is imposed at the remote boundary. Spontaneous, quasi-dynamic events nucleate at the fault governed by rate-and-state friction.\nThe off-fault volume is discretized with finite difference methods and time-dependent boundary conditions impose the free surface, remote loading and friction law at the fault. Stresses in the domain are limited by a Drucker-Prager yield condition, with depth-dependent normal stresses that remain constant in time during antiplane shear deformation. The constitutive theory furnishes a nonlinear equilibrium equation that makes use of an elastoplastic tangent stiffness tensor. One of the difficulties arising in our application problems is that plasticity reduces the effective shear modulus to values approaching zero and the equilibrium equations undergo a loss of solvability. One possible solution to this is through the incorporation of hardening which can provide a lower bound (away from zero) of the shear modulus.\nWe assume zero initial plastic strain prior to the first event which nucleates down dip near a locking depth of 12 km. Plastic flow ensues when stresses exceed the yield condition. The event ruptures up dip with reduced rupture speed and slip velocity compared to its elastic counterpart, generating a flowerlike plastic strain distribution corresponding to greater damage near Earth's free surface. Our preliminary exploration of parameter space show that once the first event terminates, an interseismic loading period follows during which no further plastic strain occurs. The incorporation of hardening causes the yield surface to expand during plastic response, thus subsequent ruptures generate a decreasing amount of additional plastic strain. It is likely that this behavior will change if the off-fault material softens, instead of hardens, during plastic straining.",

            "abstract": "Caribbean fish communities in shallow waters have been well studied along the Greater and Lesser Antilles for decades; however, the deep (>200 m) assemblages remain poorly known due to the technical challenges associated with focused surveys at these greater depths. The numerous geological features (e.g., seamounts, island ridges, banks) that punctuate the insular margins increase habitat heterogeneity, which may lead to enhanced diversity of the deep demersal fish community in the region. Recent (2013-2014) expeditions in the area using the E/V Nautilus and the ROV Hercules surveyed fish communities during 17 dives across different seafloor features at depths ranging from 64 to 2944 m. These surveys enabled us to investigate whether demersal fish assemblages differed among these seafloor features and/or in response to other environmental factors. Preliminary analyses suggested that assemblage differences are influenced by depth, dissolved oxygen, and differences in benthic microhabitat (i.e., soft substrate, rock outcrop, slope angle). Notably, both abundance and diversity of fishes was low at depths >700 m on seamounts in the Anegada Passage. This pattern is likely due to limited food supply in the region. ROV surveys further elucidated the biogeography of numerous species, as several range and depth extensions were documented. For instance, the morid Lepidion sp., previously known only from the eastern Atlantic and the western North Atlantic, was documented on Norrôit Seamount. A new species, Polylepion sp. A, known only from Curacao, was documented on Conrad Seamount. Also, many common, mesophotic reef species were observed deeper than previously known, including the butterflyfishes Chaetodon sedentarius and Prognathodes aculeatus. This study further supports the importance of environmental conditions influencing local-scale distribution of deep-sea fishes, while demonstrating how little is still known about the biogeography of numerous deep-sea and mesophotic fish species.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_2015_humayun.pdf\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It occupies a major part of the Bengal Basin, which contains the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD), the largest and one of the most active of world deltas, and is located along the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt. As such it is vulnerable to many natural hazards, especially earthquakes. The country sits at the junction of three tectonic plates - Indian, Eurasian, and the Burma ‘sliver’ of the Sunda plate. These form two boundaries where plates converge– the India-Eurasia plate boundary to the north forming the Himalaya Arc and the India-Burma plate boundary to the east forming the Indo-Burma Arc. The India-Burma plate boundary is exceptionally wide because collision with the GBD feeds an exception amount of sediment into the subduction zone. Thus the Himalayan continent collision orogeny along with its syntaxes to the N and NE of Bangladesh and the Burma Arc subduction boundary surround Bangladesh on two sides with active faults of regional scale, raising the potential for high-magnitude earthquakes. In recent years Bangladesh has experienced minor to moderate earthquakes. Historical records show that major and great earthquakes have ravaged the country and the neighboring region several times over the last 450 years.\nField observations of Tertiary structures along the Chittagong-Teknaf coast reveal that the rupture of 1762 Arakan megathrust earthquake extended as far north as the Sitakund anticline to the north of the city of Chittagong. This earthquake brought changes to the landscape, uplifting the Teknaf peninsula and St. Martin’s Island by about 2-2.5 m, and activated two mud volcanos along the axis of the Sitakund anticline, where large tabular blocks of exotic crystalline limestone, were tectonically transported from a deep-seated formation along with the eruptive mud. Vast area of the coast including inland areas east of the lower Meghna River were inundated. More than 500 peoples died near Dhaka as the tsunami or a seiche destroyed mud bamboo houses and capsized boats. The St. Martin’s Island is believed to have been an unpopulated shoal before the 1762 earthquake. The presence of three uplifted terraces in the Teknaf coast suggest similar earthquakes of great magnitude have ruptured the Chittagong-Arakan coast in the historic past.",

The overall model performance indicates that applying ozone monitoring data in 266 counties with complete records to the model, 83.8% (or 223 counties) of the model predictions matches the actual observed rate of exceedances of the current 75 ppb ozone NAAQS in 2000-2009. A 2010-2020 model forecast was then made to predict the areas where surface ozone conditions could potentially exceed the current 75 ppb National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).",

            "abstract": "ePoster - VanceAGU2015_V2.pdf\nExtending thermodynamics of aqueous solutions to elevated salinity and pressure is key to understanding icy moon oceans. Such a project is intrinsically linked to future seismic investigations, which would offer the most comprehensive views into the deep interiors of planetary bodies. The InSight Mars mission and Europa Lander mission concept both identify seismology as a critical measurement to constrain interior structure and thermal state of astrobiological targets.\nBy pinpointing the radial depths of compositional interfaces, seismology in a broad frequency range can address uncertainty in interior structures inferred from gravity and magnetometry studies, such as those planned for the NASA’s Europa and ESA’s JUICE missions. Seismology also offers information about fluid motions within or beneath ice, which complement magnetic studies; and can record the dynamics of ice layers, which would reveal mechanisms and spatiotemporal occurrence of crack formation and propagation. Investigating these in the future calls for detailed modeling of seismic sources and signatures.\nThermodynamic measurements of sound velocities and elastic moduli can provide needed seismic model inputs, as well as associated densities, thermal expansion, heat capacities, and chemical potentials for modeling interior structure. Sound speed profiles built from our internal structure models for Ganymede (Vance et al. 2014), using thermodynamically consistent data (Shaw 1986, Vance and Brown 2013) point to needed research, both in developing thermodynamic data from new laboratory measurements and applying them to problems in planetary geophysics. Comparing these profiles with simulated electrical conductivities of MgSO4 along the geotherms illustrates how dual seismology-magnetometry investigations can infer ocean density structure and salinity. Electrical conductivities are based on measurements by Larionov (1984) and Huang and Papangelakis (2006), and extrapolation to 273 K by Hand and Chyba (2007). Accurate interpretation of future sounding measurements for ocean worlds would benefit from extending the theory of electrical conductivity for multi-component systems through measurements at salinities exceeding 0.01 moles/kgH2O at elevated pressures from 0.03-1.6 GPa relevant to ocean worlds.",

Because of large sensitivity and scale dependence of rainfall–runoff models to errors in quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE), it is important that the accuracy of QPE be improved to the greatest extent possible. In this presentation, we describe the ongoing efforts in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area to provide location- and time-specific flash flooding warnings in real-time. The hydrologic modeling system used is the National Weather Service (NWS) Hydrology Laboratory's Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HLRDHM) applied at spatiotemporal resolutions ranging from 250 m to 2 km and from 1 min to 1 hour. The high-resolution precipitation input is from the DFW Demonstration Network of the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) radars, the Next Generation QPE (Q2), and the NWS Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE). Also described are the assessment of sensitivity of streamflow simulation to the spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation input and hydrologic modeling, the needs for high-quality high-resolution precipitation data sets for hydro-meteorological and -climatological applications particularly in large urban areas, and possible approaches to realize them.",

Up to this point over 700 sites have been occupied (each for ~3-4 weeks) covering almost half the continental US. Seven “backbone” EarthScope MT sites were deployed (but did not fully operate) continuously from 2008-2011. At the same time, continuous high-quality 1 hz vector magnetic field data are available from eight geomagnetic observatories spread over the continental US/southern Canada since 2007. These data can be supplemented with long term (but again not always continuous) magnetometer deployments used for space physics research—e.g., up to 25 sites are available from the Themis project. I will discuss application of multivariate array processing methods to these datasets, with the goal of merge the large scale synoptic observatory, with the other sites, including the spatially dense, but short duration, partially overlapping EarthScope arrays. The merged array can be used to create true hypothetical events -- maps of the electromagnetic that would be observed for highly idealized sources—both plane wave and gradient. These maps can provide a unique perspective on the internal induced fields within the Earth, and suggest novel strategies for extracting reliable information about crust and mantle conductivity. The synthesis may also provide new insights into external source characteristics, and their interaction with the conducting Earth. Application of these results to development and validation of methods for modeling and predicting geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Many regulated rivers now receive coarse sediment augmentation below hydraulic structures that interrupt natural alluvial transport. Because of limited accessibility, mountain rivers are often not amenable to sediment contouring using large machinery to create precise process-habitat feedbacks. One solution is to simplify the approach by focusing on water and sediment input requirements through direct intervention to obtain short-term habitat benefits that sustain existing populations, while also promoting long-term passive restoration driven by natural floods to recover historic population sizes. The question arises as to how introduced coarse sediment moves through a mountain river in response to floods and to what extent high-quality habitat is produced and used by fishes at injection locations and downstream where sediment deposits. In this study, gravel and cobble sluicing was designed, implemented and monitored from 2010-2014 with four injections of ~ 4,500 tonnes each into the Englebright Dam Reach of the lower Yuba River in semiarid north-central California. This is ~ 8% of the sediment deficit. A flood of ~ 7x bankfull discharge occurred after the first two injections. Morphodynamic change and habitat utilization were monitored and a bioverified 2D microhabitat model was used to evaluate the value of constructed and self-formed morphological units. Before the flood, 80% of habitat utilization observations occurred in spots predicted to be high-quality microhabitat. The flood redistributed sediment throughout the reach, exhibiting 5 mechanisms of topographic change. Downstream deposits formed high-quality habitat where it backed up against large bedrock outcrops and boulders, though much of the material simply filled in the moderately deep canyon; more of the sediment deficit will need to be met before widespread high-quality habitat will be available. Overall, sluicing is working to produce habitat through time in a challenging setting.",

Regional food yield estimates and water resource accounting are dependent upon accurate agricultural records. Crop mapping provides farmers, managers, and policymakers the information necessary to anticipate annual food supplies and water demands by better understanding the distribution of species. While on the ground crop accounting usually happens yearly at the county level and requires significant time and labor inputs, remote sensing has the potential to map crops and monitor their health over a greater spatial area with more frequent time intervals. Specifically, imaging spectrometers have the capability to produce imagery at high spectral and spatial resolutions, which may allow for differentiation of crops at the field-level scale. In this research 14 crop species and soil were classified in Kern County, California using canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) on airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery from June 2013. Imagery was then degraded to Landsat spectral resolution and reclassified for comparison. Results with the AVIRIS imagery show an overall accuracy of 69.0% using MESMA and 89.4% using CDA with nine out of fourteen crop species showing user and producer errors under ten percent. Lower accuracy was found for OLI data. This research illustrates great potential for field-level crop mapping with imaging spectrometry.",

This requires assimilating large sets of waveform data, keeping track of vast amounts of metadata, using validated standards for quality control, and automating the workflow in a careful and efficient manner. In addition, there is a growing gap between CPU/GPU speeds and disk access speeds that leads to an I/O bottleneck in seismic workflows. This is made even worse by existing seismic data formats that were not designed for performance and are limited to a few fixed headers for storing metadata.\nThe Adaptable Seismic Data Format (ASDF) is a new data format for seismology that solves the problems with existing seismic data formats and integrates full provenance into the definition. ASDF is a self-describing format that features parallel I/O using the parallel HDF5 library. This makes it a great choice for use on HPC clusters. The format integrates the standards QuakeML for seismic sources and StationXML for receivers. ASDF is suitable for storing earthquake data sets, where all waveforms for a single earthquake are stored in a one file, ambient noise cross-correlations, and adjoint sources. The format comes with a user-friendly Python reader and writer that gives seismologists access to a full set of Python tools for seismology. There is also a faster C/Fortran library for integrating ASDF into performance-focused numerical wave solvers, such as SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. Finally, a GUI tool designed for visually exploring the format exists that provides a flexible interface for both research and educational applications. ASDF is a new seismic data format that offers seismologists high-performance parallel processing, organized and validated contents, and full provenance tracking for automated seismological workflows.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, hydrologists considered the hypothesis of self-similarity to perform frequency analysis of extreme hydrologic events (e.g., extreme rainfall, floods) for arriving at estimates of the events at ungauged/sparsely gauged sites. The hypothesis states that the estimates of an extreme hydrologic event at a specified space scale are related to estimates of the event at another space scale through scaling relationship. Shortcomings associated with conventionally used simple- and multi-scaling approaches based on the hypothesis would be discussed. Following this, a new scaling approach developed based on the self-similarity hypothesis (referred to as Recursive Multi-scaling (RMS) approach) would be presented. Its advantages over the conventional simple- and multi-scaling approaches would be demonstrated in the context of regional flood frequency analysis. The RMS approach involves (i) identification of a separate set of attributes corresponding to each of the sites (being considered in the study area/region) in a recursive manner according to their importance, (ii) utilizing the identified attributes to construct effective regional regression relationships to estimate statistical moments (SMs) of peak flows, and (iii) using the SMs as the basis to estimate parameters of flood frequency distribution, and flood quantiles corresponding to different return periods. Effectiveness of the RMS approach in arriving at flood quantile estimates for ungauged sites would be demonstrated in the conventional and L-moment frameworks through leave-one-out cross-validation experiment on watersheds in Indiana State, USA. Error in quantile estimates is quantified in terms of various performance measures such as relative-bias (R-bias) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The results indicate that the proposed RMS approach outperforms index-flood based Region-of-Influence approach, simple- and multi-scaling approaches and a multiple linear regression method in yielding quantile estimates with significantly low errors.",

In addition, the wildfire increase projected in Southern Europe due to climate change (CC) and concurrent exacerbation of extreme weather conditions could also lead to a significant rise in GHG. Recently, in the context of the Italian National Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change (SNAC), several approaches were identified as valuable tools to adapt and mitigate the impacts of CC on wildfires, in order to reduce landscape susceptibility and to contribute to the efforts of carbon emission mitigation proposed within the Kyoto protocol. Active forest and fuel management (such as prescribed burning, fuel reduction and removal, weed and flammable shrub control, creation of fuel discontinuity) is recognised to be a key element to adapt and mitigate the impacts of CC on wildfires. Despite this, overall there is a lack of studies about the effectiveness of fire emission mitigation strategies.\nThe current work aims to analyse the potential of a combination of fuel management practices in mitigating emissions from forest fires and evaluate valuable and viable options across Central and Southern Italy. These objectives were achieved throughout a retrospective application of an integrated approach combining a fire emission model (FOFEM - First Order Fire Effect Model) with spatially explicit, comprehensive, and accurate fire, vegetation and weather data for the period 2004-2012. Furthermore, a number of silvicultural techniques were combined to develop several fuel management scenarios and then tested to evaluate their potential in mitigating fire emissions.\nThe preliminary results showed the crucial role of appropriate fuel, fire behavior, and weather data to reduce bias in quantifying the source and the composition of fire emissions and to attain reasonable estimations. Also, the current study highlighted that balanced combination of fuel management techniques could not only be a viable mean to reduce fire emissions but at the same time prevent future wildfires and the related threat to human lives and activities.",

Piqued interest arises from the understanding that the persistence of all known life depends on the presence of liquid water. As in situ investigation is currently infeasible, accurate numerical modeling is the best technique to demystify these environments. We will discuss an evolving model of ice-ocean interaction aimed at realistically describing the behavior of the ice-ocean interface by treating basal ice as a porous media, and its possible implications on the formation of astrobiological niches.\nTreating ice as a porous media drastically affects the thermodynamic properties it exhibits. Thus inclusion of this phenomenon is critical in accurately representing the dynamics and evolution of all ice-ocean environments. This model utilizes equations that describe the dynamics of sea ice when it is treated as a porous media (Hunke et. al. 2011), coupled with a basal melt and accretion model (Holland and Jenkins 1999). Combined, these two models produce the most accurate description of the processes occurring at the base of terrestrial sea ice and ice shelves, capable of resolving variations within the ice due to environmental pressures. While these models were designed for application to terrestrial environments, the physics occurring at any ice-water interface is identical, and these models can be used to represent the evolution of a variety of icy astronomical bodies. As terrestrial ice shelves provide a close analog to planetary ice-ocean environments, we truth test the models validity against observations of ice shelves.\nWe apply this model to the ice-ocean interface of the icy Galilean moon Europa. We include profiles of temperature, salinity, solid fraction, and Darcy velocity, as well as temporally and spatially varying melt and accretion rates. A porous medium is an ideal place for the coalescence of nutrients and the formation of energy gradients, key controllers of biological activity. Understanding the physics that influence ice-ocean exchange is thus essential in assessing the habitability of Europa and its contemporaries.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how convection couples with large-scale circulation over the tropical Atlantic is key to reducing persistent model biases in this region. Characteristic biases such as the reversed SST gradient and weak surface easterlies originate from the erroneous Atlantic ITCZ in the atmospheric component of models. While observations show a central Atlantic ITCZ maximum in the mean state, models rain excessively either over the West or over the East Atlantic coast. In this study, factors controlling the Atlantic ITCZ and its accompanying circulation are investigated. Focus is set on two aspects: model resolution and convection scheme. First, we study the effect of horizontal resolution on the Atlantic ITCZ. It is found that atmospheric models which rain excessively at the western basin tend to have low resolution, whereas models which rain more over the east have high resolution. Sensitivity experiments with ECHAM designed to identify the relative contributions of a high resolution orography, atmosphere, and surface are performed. Results show that a high resolution orography induces a stronger westerly monsoon circulation, contributing to more rainfall on the east coast. A high resolution atmosphere triggers convection more easily, leading to more rain over the east and less rain downstream over the west coast. A high resolution surface alone has a minimal effect. In the second part of this study, we look at how spatiotemporal patterns of convection impact the circulation over the Atlantic and examine to what extent the convection scheme controls such patterns. A suite of experiments where convection is artificially strengthened over certain areas and seasons is performed. These experiments are designed such that the convection perturbation is initially decoupled from the circulation. Key areas of convection which strongly influence the large-scale circulation and the Atlantic ITCZ during boreal spring and summer are identified.",

            "abstract": "Equatorial waves have been studied extensively due to their importance to the tropical climate and weather systems. Historically, their activity is diagnosed mainly in the wavenumber-frequency domain. Recently, many studies have projected observational data onto parabolic cylinder functions (PCF), which represent the meridional structure of individual wave modes, to attain time-dependent spatial wave structures.\nIn this study, we propose a methodology that seeks to identify individual wave modes in instantaneous fields of observations by determining their projections on PCF modes according to the equatorial wave theory. The new method has the benefit of yielding a closed system with a unique solution for all waves’ spatial structures, including IG waves, for a given instantaneous observed field. We have applied our method to the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset in the tropical stratosphere where the wave-mean flow interaction mechanism for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is well-understood. We have confirmed the continuous evolution of the selection mechanism for equatorial waves in the stratosphere from observations as predicted by the theory for the QBO. This also validates the proposed method for decomposition of observed tropical wave fields into non-orthogonal equatorial wave modes.",

To determine if Mars has a similar enhanced He ‘bulge’ in the same region, we compared several periapsis passes from night to dayside. The first six weeks of the MAVEN prime mission had periapsis at high latitudes on the night-side, followed by the next three months at mid latitudes on the dayside moving to low latitudes on the night-side. In addition to its normal orbit, which has a periapsis of approximately 150 km, MAVEN conducts a few deep dip orbits where the spacecraft has a periapsis closer to 125km. The first deep dip was at dusk at mid latitudes, the second at noon at the equator, with the third going from dawn to night in the southern hemisphere. Initial analysis of the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) closed source data from all orbits with good pointing revealed an enhanced He density on the night-side orbits and a decreased He density on the dayside. This enhancement of He demonstrates a bulge at Mars that will continue to be explored over the course of the mission.",

            "abstract": "As the Arctic warms and shifts from icy white to watery blue and resource-rich, tension is arising between the desire to restore and sustain an ice-covered Arctic and stakeholder communities that hope to benefit from an open Arctic Ocean. If emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere continue on their present trend, most of the summer sea ice cover is projected to be gone by mid-century, i.e., by the time that few if any interventions could be in place to restore it. There are many local as well as global reasons for ice restoration, including for example, preserving the Arctic’s reflectivity, sustaining critical habitat, and maintaining cultural traditions. However, due to challenges in implementing interventions, it may take decades before summer sea ice would begin to return. This means that future generations would be faced with bringing sea ice back into regions where they have not experienced it before. While there is likely to be interest in taking action to restore ice for the local, regional, and global services it provides, there is also interest in the economic advancement that open access brings. Dealing with these emerging issues and new combinations of stakeholders needs new approaches – yet environmental change in the Arctic is proceeding quickly and will force the issues sooner rather than later.\nIn this contribution we examine challenges, opportunities, and responsibilities related to exploring options for restoring Arctic sea ice and potential pathways for their implementation. Negotiating responses involves international strategic considerations including security and governance, meaning that along with local communities, state decision-makers, and commercial interests, national governments will have to play central roles. While these issues are currently playing out in the Arctic, similar tensions are also emerging in other regions.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater peatlands can be dense carbon stores and are ecologically diverse with many specialised organisms. Climate-related threats to carbon storage include increases in rates of oxidation and methanogenesis, increases in drainage and dissolved organic carbon export from run off. Due to their lowland locations, coastal freshwater peatlands are at increasing risk from sea level rise and is expected to result in ecosystem shifts with impacts on carbon stores and species diversity. Fed by a network of rivers and lakes in close proximity to the coast, the Broads, UK, is a series of freshwater peatlands at risk of increased incursion of saline water coupled with increased frequency and intensity of flooding events due to an anticipated sea level rise of 3–5 cm decade-1 compounded by a predicted isotactic sinking of 0.055 cm yr-1. This study attempts to unravel the risks posed by sea level rise to carbon stored in coastal freshwater peatlands. Near surface cores (~50 cm long) collected from three sites were analysed for bulk density and carbon content, and dated radiometrically (lead-210, cesium-137) to ascertain carbon accumulation. To understand loss by leaching and microbial decomposition, mass loss from litterbags was measured over one year. Results indicated that recent carbon accumulation rate (since 1964) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) at the site inundated for the longest period throughout the year (94 ± 0.17 g C m-2 yr-1) and lowest at the least inundated site (79 ± 0.17 g C m-2 yr-1). Accretion rates over the last two years were highest in the site with the most fluctuating water table (0.55 ± 0.13 cm yr-1) and lowest at the driest site (0.25 ± 0.04 cm yr-1). Proportion of mass loss was significantly different between sites for both leaves (p < 0.001) and stems (p < 0.001). Overall, this research has shown that extent of inundation can influence recent accumulation rate and proportion of mass loss.",

The correlation is often considered as an indication of anthropogenic emissions. In this study, a Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM) was used to study the correlation between boundary layer O3 and CO. The observed correlation during the DISCOVER-AQ 2011 campaign was reproduced in the model and revealed that biogenic emissions made a significant contribution to the observed correlation and slope between O3 and CO in that experiment. In order to quantify source contributions to the observed linear correlation of O3 and CO in the continental boundary layer, CO sources were separated into four different categories: anthropogenic emission, chemical production from anthropogenic VOC oxidation, production of biogenic isoprene oxidation, and transport from lateral boundaries. The tagged tracer simulations reveal that biogenic isoprene is the main factor determining the correlation and slope between O3 and CO and those between O3 and CH2O near the surface and in the continental boundary layer. In the outflow region (western North Atlantic), both biogenic isoprene and anthropogenic emissions are significant factors. This finding implies that estimate of continental O3 export on the basis of O3 and CO correlation must account for the biogenic contribution and that satellite observations of CH2O and CO can be applied to provide observational constraints on the distribution of surface O3.

The purpose of this project is to incorporate both physical and chemical modeling techniques to better understand the effect of aquifer heterogeneities on autotrophic denitrification. We will investigate the link between heterogeneous hydraulic properties, transport, and the rate of autotrophic denitrification.

The PEIP is dominated by tholeiitic basalts to basaltic andesites, with subordinate silicic rocks spanning the dacite-trachyte-rhyolite fields, which occur as lava flows, sills and dike swarms as well as intrusive complexes closely related to the eruptive rocks. The PEIP has long been subject of 40Ar/39Ar geochronologic and paleomagnetic studies which led to conclude its rapid formation near the Hauterivian stage (~133 Ma) with onward progression to Barremian from the intrusive equivalents exposed northwards. Two decades after publication of the first 40Ar/39Ar ages for the Paraná flood basalts (Renne et al., 1992) we report here an updated study of the age and duration of this magmatic event. We calibrated a set of sixty published and new results to the calibration of Renne et al. (2011), which indicates an inception age of the volcanism now estimated at 135 ± 1 Ma, before the initiation of sea floor spreading. Lava extrusion progressed over ~2 Ma from south to north. A protracted duration of ~10 Ma inferred by Stewart et al. (1996) for PEIP volcanism is clearly incorrect, as also concluded by Thiede and Vasconcelos (2010). Low-Ti mafic magmas prevailed during the earlier stages followed over time by enhanced dominance of their silicic equivalents. Eruption of the high-Ti (mafic and silicic) magmas initiated simultaneously ~0.5 m.y. later, continuing up to ~133 Ma with injection of the Ponta Grossa dyke swarm. Despite several paleomagnetic polarity intervals recorded by the lava piles in the southern (> 27°S) and central (latitudes of ~24-27°S) domains of the Brazilian PEIP, the paleomagnetic data show small dispersion in agreement with the short time intervals indicated by the 40Ar/39Ar ages.",

Although rhombohedral carbonates (e.g., calcite, magnesite, and siderite) have been proposed as a major carbon carrier in the Earth’s crust and upper mantle, several distinct scenarios have been proposed for these carbonates at deep-mantle conditions including chemical dissociation and various structural transitions. Recently, carbonate melts have been reported to be highly mobile at high pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions, which may have significant impact on magmatic processes in Earth’s upper mantle. However, the high P-T behaviors of carbonate minerals and melts are still not well understood, in terms of their structural stability and mobility in the Earth’s lower mantle. Combining in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), and Raman spectroscopy experiments in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell with complementary theoretical calculations, we investigate the phase stability of carbonates, the equation of state (EoS) of carbonatic glasses, as well as the distribution of carbonate melts in a silicate matrix up to lower-mantle conditions.",

            "abstract": "Over half of temperate forest area globally has been fragmented or deforested by human activities. Our objective was to gain insight into the combination of climatic, ecological, and social factors that control complex spatial patterns of forest cover and fragmentation at the regional scale. Our study area was the US portion of the land area of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin (USGL basin) of the Upper Midwest, USA, covering ca. 300,000 km2 and home to 25 million people. While this region was historically forested, today there are regional gradients in forest cover as well as complex spatial patterns of agriculture, human settlements, and tree cover. This includes large expanses of fragmented forests in the wildland-urban interface or the forest transition zone.\nWe used structural equation modeling to test models of social and climatic-ecological factors to explain spatial patterns of forest cover and fragmentation. This is a model-driven approach to statistical analysis that is used to test proposed causal “structures” of direct and indirect relationships among variables. It is an innovative approach that makes use of large spatial datasets to test understanding. We assembled numerous spatial data layers at 1 km2 resolution across the USGL basin. We found that 64% to 75% of variance in tree cover and forest connectivity was explained through a relatively simple model combining climatic gradients and human development pressure. Human development pressure was best represented as a measurement model that explained 45% of variance in road density and 87% of housing unit density, while significantly explaining patterns of forest fragmentation. Climate could be represented by a single variable, temperature: where temperature was higher, tree cover and forest connectivity was lower due to human land use. Temperatures did not help to explain patterns of human development as roads and housing, but did affect forest fragmentation through land use as cropland. This suggests that with climate change, cropland is likely to expand and cause future loss of tree cover in the USGL basin.",

            "abstract": "The reconstruction of the kinematic evolution of the northern Andes in Eastern Colombia reveals two main stages of orogenic development, each one displaying a different dominant factor controlling mountain building. In a context of oblique arc-continent convergence associated to dextral shearing along the Caribbean-South American plate boundary, the Late Cretaceous to late Miocene growth of the Andes in eastern Colombia was mainly modulated by the location of inherited basement anisotropies that constituted normal faults in the early Mesozoic. Shortening budget reconstructions show that the main exogenous driver for this first stage of Cenozoic deformation is the Oligocene increase in westward drift of the South American Plate. A second stage is characterized by thick-skinned basement uplift occurring at peak rates in the last ~5 Ma. This rapid uplift has led to the main topographic construction and the ensuing orographic precipitation favoring enhanced erosion in the eastern Andean watersheds, which in turn has potentially triggered positive tectonic-climate feedbacks. Thermokinematic modeling of detrital apatite fission track and apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He data suggest that up to 50% of the shortening along the main frontal reverse fault that bounds the Eastern Cordillera to the east occurred in the last ~2 My. This Cenozoic portrait of orogen evolution results from the detailed reconstruction of the upper crustal architecture and deformation kinematics enabled by the integration of (1) surface mapping and subsurface geology based interpretation of industry seismic reflection data, (2) a new detailed biostratrigraphically constrained chronology of foreland basin sediment accumulation, (3) the evolution of sediment source areas based on the quantitative comparison of various sedimentary provenance proxies, mainly detrital zircon U-Pb, and (4) thermokinematic modeling of a multi-method thermochronometric extensive database using our own software development.",

            "abstract": "Advances in computing resources are gradually moving regional as well as global numerical forecasting simulations towards high resolutions. However, long-term simulations at global high resolutions remain a challenge. The recently developed variable-resolution global modeling framework, Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), provides an opportunity to mitigate some computational limitations by using regional grid refinement. For effective use of such a modeling framework in climate studies, the impacts of resolution-dependent physics and dynamics on climate simulations should be thoroughly examined and alleviated. This study assesses the dependence of model sensitivity to resolution on the choice of model physics packages. To this end, several three-year numerical simulations are performed with the non-hydrostatic MPAS coupled to the CAM4 and CAM5 physics at multiple global quasi-uniform resolutions of 240 km, 120 km, 60 km, and 30 km and a global variable resolution configuration at 120 km resolution with a regional mesh refinement at 30km resolution over the tropics. While MPAS-CAM4 appears less sensitive to resolution than MPAS-CAM5 for individual components of precipitation, both exhibit similar increase in total precipitation with increased resolution. The simulations also exhibit sensitivity of the subtropical jet position that affects the sensitivity of atmospheric river (AR) frequency to resolutions. Hence model sensitivity to resolution depends on the physics parameterizations used. The simulations with regional mesh refinement also demonstrate significant impacts of resolution-dependent physics.",

Velocity or shear reversal is subsumed within several of these mechanisms, however a growing body of work suggests that (1) flow convergence into pools, (2) structuring of riffle crest sediments, and (3) local feedbacks between flood stage bedform evolution and hydrodynamics may be disproportionately important. We additionally propose that temporal and spatial patterns of sediment sorting across pool-riffles may also provide some level of bedform maintenance. A comprehensive understanding of these maintenance mechanisms is needed.\nWe will report results of several flume experiments for autogenic pool-riffles. The experiments examined pool-riffle maintenance processes under variable flood and sediment supply conditions. A focus of our work is to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of pool-riffle sediment sorting, and to examine this in relation to temporal patterns of bedform evolution.

            "abstract": "This study aims to examine the potential use of microwave emissivity (in lieu of brightness temperatures observations) from satellite observations in freeze/thaw prediction studies. Monitoring freeze-thaw transitions in high latitude regions are critical to enhancing our knowledge about the prediction of biogeochemical transitions, carbon dynamics, climate change, and impacts on boreal-arctic ecosystems. Current, freeze/thaw products mainly use direct measurements of microwave brightness temperatures. Since land surface emissivity, which will not be affected by temperature and atmosphere interferance, depends primarily on the surface characteristics, it would contains valuable information about the surface, especially regarding freeze and thaw states. The surface characteristics in terms of microwave emission changes whenever water undergoes phase changes at constant temperature. Transition between freeze and thaw states depends on the amount of heat energy the surface receives or releases and on the corresponding change in seasonal and diurnal temperature. Emissivity estimates from various microwave sensors (such as SSM/I, AMSR2, WindSat) on board available satellites can help to construct diurnal estimates in order to accurately predicting the exact time of the freeze-thaw transition for each land cover type and region. The diurnal cycle of the microwave brightness temperature will be constructed over the globe for different frequencies/polarizations using a multi-sensor / multi-platform data fusion. Emissivities are retrieved and freeze/ thaw state investigation is performed by examining the different thresholds on emissivity estimates that may define these states. The results reveal that microwave emissivity potentially can provide a better understanding about freeze/thaw states since they are not affected by temperature and atmosphere and represent the state of the surface in terms of moisture and their states. Moreover, the data fusion helps to provide more accurate timley estimates of the surface state especially in transition season. Results of this study improve the temporal frequency and the accuracy of the estimates which are necessary for many climate, environmental and hydrological studies.",

Many geophysical, petrological and geological evidence suggest that orogenic plateaus such the Andes, Tibet and the Anatolian plateaus has experienced post-orogenic lithospheric removal and this removal event has a distinct spatial and temporal effect in the crust resulting in plateau uplift as well as distinct zones of shortening and extension. In this work, we use thermomechanical numerical experiments of Rayleigh-Taylor type convective instability models that are designed to investigate quantitatively the surface and crustal evolution of the removal process. Experimental results are presented for a range of models where the role of rheological characteristics of the lithosphere, imposed plate convergence velocity, pre-existing thicker crust/collapsing orogen and the strain weakening are tested to explore the transient surface tectonics. Our numerical results suggest that the initial phase of instability promotes local isostatic thickening of the crust and dynamic surface subsidence due to the downward forcing of the downwelling mantle lithosphere. Following this initial stage of instability, the sinking root thins and detaches while hot mantle lithosphere flows into the region vacated by the dripping mantle litosphere. This results in topographic inflection with surface uplift ( >1.5 km) mainly controlled by flow-induced dynamic topography and local crustal thickening above the drip. As the hot mantle ascends and comes into contact with the overlying crust, it creates significant crustal extension. Mantle dynamics can play a major role in the evolution of surface tectonics, such as shift from subsidence to uplift that develops in conjunction with the change in the tectonic style from contraction to extension. The crustal extension still occurs even with the imposed plate convergence and with previously thickened crust but such extension does not take place in the piecemeal-partial lithospheric removal models. The outcome of this work may have implications on the neotectonic evolution of the Central Anatolia and the Southern Puna plateaus.",

Despite its close proximity to densely populated coastal regions of Southern California, the NIRC fault geometry and expected earthquake behavior are poorly constrained. As a result of these uncertainties, current hazard models lack critical information regarding potential earthquake magnitudes and ground shaking caused by rupture on the offshore portion of the fault.\nHere, we present an improved characterization of the NIRC fault zone’s architecture and segmentation. We employ nested marine seismic reflection data of varying vertical resolutions to map the NIRC location, strike, dip, and stepovers based on subsurface observations. These reflection data were collected in 1979, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2013. We identify four main geometrical fault segments separated along strike by three stepovers between 0.5 and 3 km in width, whereby width is measured as the horizontal distance between fault strands or termini. Empirical studies of rupture propagation show that past earthquake ruptures in other regions have propagated across discontinuities of this width. We additionally employ a quantitative approach to constrain the potential earthquake magnitude for the NIRC fault zone by modeling the coulomb stress changes that result from possible rupture initiation scenarios. Earthquakes initiated on the central fault strand by Carlsbad Canyon favor through-going rupture across the entire length of the NIRC fault zone. Additionally, the modeling results suggest that the southernmost stepover by La Jolla may act as an inhibitor to through-going rupture due to the strike and dip of the adjacent fault despite the stepover’s short width. Finally, our stress modeling results suggest that the maximum potential magnitude of an earthquake rupturing all of the mapped offshore segments of the NIRC fault zone is Mw 7.5.",

As a result of the drought, there has been a notable increase in forest mortality throughout the state. In this presentation Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired for the HyspIRI Preparatory Mission over the western Sierra Nevada Range in 2013 and 2014 was used to quantify the mortality of conifers in 2014. Data products provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (NASA-JPL) were re-sampled to a common 15meter pixel resolution, co-registered, and geo-referenced. Ecological cover type was first assessed using the random forest machine learning technique with training data produced from AVIRIS summer 2013 imagery and comparison with high-spatial resolution World View-2 imagery. Then, in areas identified as being primarily composed of needle-leaf tree cover, the change in fractional change in green vegetation cover was assessed using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) in fall 2013 and fall 2014 AVIRIS images. The source spectral library for the MESMA endmembers was created from AVIRIS-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) images taken over Sierra National Forest in 2014. False positives were further reduced using a spatio-temporal filtering approach. Final accuracy of the modeled areas of conifer mortality were assessed by comparison with 2015 WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 imagery over the study area, as well as with recently acquired field data within the southern Sierra Nevada. Early results support the need for increased fidelity data for providing timely information on ecosystem dynamics to land management agencies.",

            "abstract": "More than three million abandoned oil and gas wells exist in the U.S., and information on many of these wells are lost. Recent measurements of 93 abandoned wells in Pennsylvania show that they may be a significant source of methane emissions to the atmosphere. Data such as depth and producing formation of 98% of these measured wells are unavailable. Information on the likely depth of the well and the formation, from which the well likely produced from, is important when evaluating the wells’ potential to emit methane and/or to contaminate overlying aquifers, and when developing mitigation strategies. We use geospatial analysis that combines available public databases from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and historic documents to determine the likely depth and formation from which the measured abandoned wells produced. We develop a framework to systematically evaluate the nearest well, pool, and field attributes and assign depth and producing formation to the measured wells based on how well these attributes match. We then use this information to perform a cost analysis for plugging based on well depth for Pennsylvania. The geospatial analysis framework presented here for determining abandoned well properties can be valuable for future field measurement designs, upscaling methane emissions, and mitigating abandoned wells in Pennsylvania but also the many other states with a long history of oil and gas production.",

Recent analogue experiments using a unimodal grain size of 22 ± 6 µm (Andrews & Manga, 2012) have established that plume generation is aided by PDC interaction with a topographic barrier. Here, we have simulated the onset of co-PDC plumes from the collapse of concentrated particle-gas mixtures comprised of unimodal or bimodal grain size distributions (GSD) of glass beads, using combinations of lognormal populations with modes of 35, 195 and 590 µm. The collapse of a mixture, with constant mass 2950 ± 150 g, induced the propagation of a gravity current channelized down a 13° sloping tank; a barrier in the tank caused the gravity current to produce a plume of particles. Experiments were recorded with high speed visible and thermal-infrared cameras. Initial GSD and temperature of the mixture were varied to assess the effects of the addition of a coarser component on plume generation.\nAnalogue co-PDC plumes were only produced when a proportion of fine grains (35 µm) was present in the initial granular mixture. Sampling of the particles entrained in the co-PDC plumes revealed that fine grains (35 µm) are preferentially lofted, although a few coarser particles (195 or 590 µm) are also entrained in the co-PDC plumes and settle closer to the area of uplift. Increasing the initial temperature of the mixture increases plume height measured at 1 and 2s after onset; this is supported by repeat experiments at specific conditions. Bimodal mixtures containing both fine (35 µm) and coarser (195 or 590 µm) grains result in plume heights and initial flow velocities higher than observed in unimodal fine-grained experiments of the same total mass of particles. Repeat experiments identify the natural variability in plume generation under the same nominal conditions, which is likely due to the combined variations of momentum during flow propagation and heat-driven buoyancy, as well as the homogeneity of the initial particle mixture.

Plant litter decomposition recycles nutrients to the soil, and in turn, assists plant growth. However the rate at which these nutrients become available to the soil is poorly understood. Thus, a six month field experiment that encompassed the wet and dry seasons was conducted to assess how different quantities of litter inputs affect nutrient (P, N, C, K, Ca, and Mg) availability. It was hypothesized that nutrient mineralization would be significantly influenced by manipulation of the surface litter and that there would be a positive correlation between soil moisture and nutrient mineralization. Initial results indicate that there were significant differences in mineralization over time for all nutrients, except P, supporting our hypothesis of changes in mineralization with soil moisture. However, there were no significant differences between litter treatments and net mineralization rates for all the nutrients tested. Our results indicate that litterpool size has little effect on short-term nutrient mineralization dynamics.",

However, as it well\nknown, fluid models require a closure approximation to yield a closed set of equations. Designing closures that capture correct\nkinetic behavior in asymptotic regimes, specially in the presence of weak guide fields, remains a challenge. We present an\napproach to developing such closures in the context of multi-fluid moment models. In these, each fluid is treated independently, with higher-order moments (pressure tensor, heat-flux tensor) evolved self-consistently with time-dependent equations. Electromagnetic fields are evolved with Maxwell equations, retaining displacement currents. The validity of these closures is determined by comparison with PIC simulations. A brief overview of the numerical schemes, implemented in the open-source computational framework Gkeyll, will also be presented.",

Regional and limited global mapping of Mercury has already yielded valuable science results, elucidating the history and distribution of several types of units and features, such as regional plains, tectonic structures, and pyroclastic deposits. To date, however, no global geological map of Mercury exists, and there is currently no commonly accepted set of standardized unit descriptions and nomenclature. With MESSENGER monochrome image data, we are undertaking the global geological mapping of Mercury at the 1:15M scale applying standard U.S. Geological Survey mapping guidelines. This map will enable the development of the first global stratigraphic column of Mercury, will facilitate comparisons among surface units distributed discontinuously across the planet, and will provide guidelines for mappers so that future mapping efforts will be consistent and broadly interpretable by the scientific community.\nTo date we have incorporated three major datasets into the global geological map: smooth plains units, tectonic structures, and impact craters and basins >20 km in diameter. We have classified most of these craters by relative age on the basis of the state of preservation of morphological features and standard classification schemes first applied to Mercury by the Mariner 10 imaging team. Additional datasets to be incorporated include intercrater plains units and crater ejecta deposits. In some regions MESSENGER color data is used to supplement the monochrome data, to help elucidate different plains units. The final map will be published online, together with a peer-reviewed publication. Further, a digital version of the map, containing individual map layers, will be made publicly available for use within geographic information systems (GISs).",

            "abstract": "The Bero Volcanic Group, an extension of the Etendeka-Paraná Igneous Province into SW Angola, forms the eroded basement to the on-shore Namibe Basin, an Early Cretaceous-Cenozoic terrestrial and marine sedimentary sequence. The igneous suite outcrops between latitudes 14.68o and 15.25o S and comprises quartz latite rheoignimbrites/lavas, tholeiitic basaltic lavas, pyroclastic/volcaniclastic deposits, minor aeolian sandstones, and mafic tholeiitic dykes and gabbroic sheets. Quartz latite lithologies dominate. In the Rio Bero area in the S quartz latites are underlain by several thin flows of basalt interbedded with, and underlain by, thin discontinuous lenses of aeolian sandstone. This sequence is consistent with the general stratigraphic sequence in the northern Etendeka of Namibia. To the N basalts and aeolian sandstones are absent and the quartz latites lie directly on Precambrian basement rocks in places. To date, data for a quartz latite correlated with a Chapecó rhyolites of the Paraná are available from only one locality in Angola. This study’s wider sampling and major and trace element and radiogenic isotope analysis reveals the following: (1) all mafic rocks are high-Ti, the lavas being equivalent to the Khumiba/Urubici type; (2) mafic dykes cutting the quartz latites having affinities to the Paranapanema-Ribeira mafic lavas; (3) five quartz latite geochemical types are present, three of which are known from Etendeka/Paraná (Sarusas/Guarapuava, Khoraseb/Ourinhos and Ventura) and their stratigraphic relationships in Angola are consistent with those in the Etendeka and Paraná; (4) their Angolan occurrence significantly extends the area covered by, and potential eruptive volumes of, these silicic types; (5) two other quartz latite types are unknown in the Etendeka and Paraná and are probably products of low-volume, local eruptions. The Chinguau type is geochemically similar to the low-Ti quartz lalites of the southern Etendeka but has lower Epsilon Nd (< -9.0). The other type is distinguished by high Nb (≈ 100 ppm), about twice the Nb concentration of the high-Ti quartz latites. Implications of these new discoveries will be discussed.",

In contrast to critical zone evolution in systems dominated by siliciclastic rocks, our conceptual model for this and other carbonate landscapes highlights the importance of congruent mineral weathering, which alters both the depth and geometry of the critical zone, and invokes metabolism as a core control on landscape morphology via impacts to CO2 acidity. In the case of BICY, our motivation is to understand the origins of visually compelling, and geostatistically regular, landscape patterning. Using preliminary evidence from archival data synthesis, lidar-derived elevations, field surveys of sediment thickness and vegetation biomass, characterization of deep sediment cores, and high temporal resolution measurements of water levels, solute concentrations, and gas fluxes we offer support for a conceptual model that invokes critical zone processes as the basis for Holocene pattern emergence. Of particular interest is our invocation of episodic landscape hydrologic connectivity as integral to pattern emergence. While our findings are specific to the unique features of this extremely flat eogenetic karst landscape where a clay confining unit precludes deep drainage feature evolution, we posit that the feedbacks between hydrology, ecosystem metabolism and carbonate weathering are general to critical zone processes in karst areas globally.",

Recently, we have shown that Easterly Wind Surges are also a prominent component of equatorial Pacific zonal wind stress variability, and that they play a role in La Nina development akin to that of Westerly Wind Events in El Nino. Here we examine how well the (partial) El Nino SSTA development observed in 2012 and 2014 can be understood in terms of sub seasonal wind events. We find that the observed 2012 and 2014 El Nino development can be accurately diagnosed by forcing a classic ocean general circulation model with a zonal wind stress field that we reconstruct based just on the application of wind events. The applied wind stress field is consistent with the available wind stress estimates to within the associated uncertainties, which are unfortunately larger than normal due to the collapse of the TAO buoy array over this period. These results suggest that improving our ability to predict ENSO SSTA development in years like 2012 and 2014 will require learning how to predict sub seasonal wind events",

            "abstract": "To understand the relationship between geophysical measurements and chemical weathering at Earth’s surface, we combine comprehensive chemical and physical analyses of a 70-m granite weathering profile in the Southern Piedmont in the southeastern United States. The research site is in the uplands of the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory and is similar to many geomorphically stable, ancient, and highly-weathered Ultisol soils of the region. Surface and downhole geophysical analyses suggest significant physical changes to depths of about 40 m, where geophysical properties are consistent with competent and unweathered granite. At this depth, surface refraction velocities increase to >4.5 km/s; variations in downhole sonic velocities decrease by more than two-fold; and deviations in the downhole caliper log sharply decrease as well. Forty meters depth is also the depth of initiation of plagioclase feldspar weathering, as inferred from bulk geochemical measurement of the full 70-m deep core. Specifically, element-depth profiles, cast as mass transfer coefficient profiles using Ti and Zr as immobile elements, document inferred loss of plagioclase in the depth interval between 15 and 40-m depth. Plagioclase feldspar is the most abundant of the highly reactive minerals in the granite. Such a wide reaction front is characteristic of weathering granites. Some loss of K is observed at these depths but most K loss, as well as Mg loss, occurs at shallower depths. Nearby geophysical profiles and 3D stress models have been interpreted as showing that seismic velocities decrease at 40 m depth due to opening of fractures as rock is exhumed toward the surface. Given our interpretations of both the geochemical and geophysical data, we infer that the onset of chemical weathering of feldspar coincides with the opening of these fractures. The data highlight the ability of geochemistry and geophysics to complement each other and enrich our understanding of Earth’s Critical Zone.",

            "abstract": "As part of a recent assessment of well stimulation in California, we analyzed the hazards and potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing (the primary form of well stimulation in California) on water resources, which included an analysis of the quantity and quality of flowback/produced water generated, current management and disposal practices, associated potential release mechanisms and transport pathways that can lead to contaminants being released into the environment, and practices to mitigate or avoid impacts from produced water on water resources.\nThe wastewater returned after stimulation includes “recovered fluids” (flowback fluids collected into tanks following stimulation, but before the start of production) and “produced water” (water extracted with oil and gas during production). In contrast to hydraulic fracturing in regions with primarily gas production, the quantities of recovered fluids from hydraulically fractured wells in California are small in comparison to the fluids injected (typically <5%), and large quantities of produced water are generated. Our analysis indicates some fraction of returning fracturing fluids is likely present in produced water from wells that have been hydraulically fractured. Chemical measurements of recovered fluids show that some samples can contain high levels of some contaminants, including total carbohydrates (indicating the presence of guar, a component of fracturing fluid), total dissolved solids (TDS), trace elements and naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). Data on produced water chemistry are more limited.\nIn California, produced water is typically managed via pipelines and disposed or reused in many ways. A majority of produced water from hydraulically fractured wells in California is disposed in percolation pits, many of which may lie in areas with good groundwater quality. Some of the remaining produced water is injected into Class II wells; although a few of the wells are under review or have been shut down since they were injecting into aquifers. Other methods of management of produced water include reuse for irrigation and discharge into sewer systems. Each of these disposal and reuse methods presents its own unique set of concerns that need to be considered together, in designing a produced water management plan.",

Poor mixing (or the partner process of upscaling over heterogeneous concentrations) renders the process non-Markovian because of memory of the chemical structure. In other words, a particle takes some time to reach a suitable reaction site. The time depends on structure, and the structure changes over time. For purely diffusive transport, a calculation of the random time to reach the edges of ``islands’’ allows a solution of the non-Markovian reaction rates that evolve (decrease) over time. This randomization of the active (operational) reaction time leads to non-Markovian reactions and an integro-differential governing equation of chemical evolution. Implications for more complex (advection/diffusion) environments are discussed.",

Approximately 28 bistatic observations, covering a variety of terrains on the lunar nearside, have been made using this mode of operation. Laboratory data and analog experiments, at optical wavelengths, have shown that the scattering properties of lunar materials (e.g., the roughness) can be sensitive to variations in bistatic angle. This sensitivity manifests as an opposition effect and likely involves contributions from shadow hiding at low angles and coherent backscatter near 0°. Analog experiments and theoretical work have shown that water ice is also sensitive to variations in bistatic angle. Differences in the character of the opposition response of these materials offer an opportunity to differentiate between them, an issue that has been problematic for previous radar studies of the Moon.\nObservations that include mare materials, highland materials, and pyroclastic deposits have not shown an opposition response over for bistatic angles of ~0.1° to 30°. Observations of the ejecta blankets of young, fresh craters have shown an opposition response for the same range of bistatic angles. The character of the response varies for each crater and is likely related to differences in target properties of the surface and exposure age of the blanket. Observations of portions of the floor of the south polar crater Cabeus have also been acquired for the same range of bistatic angles. The character of the radar response from the crater, as a function of bistatic angle, appears unique with respect to all other lunar terrains observed.",

            "abstract": "Understanding tropical rainforest response to heat and drought is critical for quantifying the effects of climate change on tropical ecosystems, including global climate-carbon feedbacks. Of particular importance for the global carbon budget is net ecosystem exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere (NEE), a metric that represents the total integrated signal of carbon fluxes into and out of ecosystems. Sub-annual and sub-basin NEE estimates have previously been derived from process-based biosphere models, despite often disagreeing with plot-scale observations. Our analysis of airborne CO2 and CO measurements reveals monthly, sub-Basin scale (~106 km2) NEE variations in a framework that is largely independent of bottom-up estimates. As such, our approach provides new insights about tropical forest response to climate. We find acute sensitivity of NEE to daily and monthly climate extremes. In particular, increased central-Amazon NEE was associated with wet-season heat and dry-season drought in 2010. We analyze satellite proxies for photosynthesis and find that suppression of photosynthesis may have contributed to increased carbon loss in the 2010 drought, consistent with recent analysis of plot-scale measurements. In the eastern Amazon, pulses of increased NEE (i.e. net respiration) persisted through 2011, suggesting legacy effects of the drought that occurred in 2010. Regional differences in post-drought recovery in 2011 and 2012 appear related to long-term water availability. These results provide novel evidence of the vulnerability of Amazon carbon stocks to short-term temperature and moisture extremes.",

We cross-correlate continuous data of the installed station recorded from May 2014 to April 2015 with a comb-like waveform observed regularly. The comb-like waveform with length of 30 to 60 minutes is a signal train composed of a blast every 30 seconds. We consider the comb-like signal related directly to mining activity from the fact that the signal train appears averagely four times a day on weekdays with its monotonic amplitude. Besides the comb-like signal, events with an irregular occurrence time and amplitude is detected from the one-year continuous record of the installed station.

LEND has been designed and manufactured to investigate presence and determine average amount of hydrogen in upper (~1 m depth) subsurface layer of the Lunar regolith with spatial resolution ~10 km from 50 km orbit and to check the hypothesis what the permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) at circumpolar regions are the main reservoirs of a large deposition of water ice on the Moon.\nOne of most interesting and surprising LEND observations that not all large PSRs regions contain a detectable amount of hydrogen but there are neutron suppression regions (NSRs) with statistically significant suppression of neutron flux. The NSRs partially overlap or include PSRs in Cabeus, Shoemaker, Haworth (on South) and Rozhdestvensky U (on North) but significant part of their area spread out at sunlit territory. This means that hydrogen may be preserved for a long time or even accumulated at ~1 m layer of regolith illuminated by Sun. The majority of PSRs do not show statistically significant suppressions of neutron flux in comparison with neighbor sunlit areas. This implies a hypothesis what a permanent shadow is not only necessary condition for the hydrogen hydrogen accumulation and preservation in the lunar subsurface. It is supported by analysis of poleward-facing and equatorial-facing slopes of craters. This analysis shows a statistically significant increasing of hydrogen concentration at poleward-facing slopes in comparison to equatorial-facing slopes. Moreover, it was found evidence that hydrogen-bearing volatiles are being diurnally cycled at the top meter of the Moon’s high-latitude surfaces, above ±75°.",

It has been conjectured that roughness plays a role in surface nucleation, the tendency for freezing to begin preferentially at the liquid-gas interface. Using high speed imaging, we sought evidence for freezing at the contact line on catalyst substrates with imposed characteristic length scales (texture). It is found that nano-scale texture causes a shift in the nucleation of ice in super-cooled water to the three-phase contact line, while micro-scale texture does not. The reduction in the Gibbs barrier for nucleation at the droplet triple line suggests that a line tension, inversely proportional to the surface feature length scale, may be the relevant physical mechanism. A survey of line tension values in literature supports this hypothesis. This work suggests that the physical morphology of a particle, and not just its chemical composition, is important for characterizing a nucleation catalyst.",

Based on the stochastic differential equation method, the Radbelt Electron Model (REM) simulation code allows us to solve such a fully three-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, and to elucidate the sources and transport mechanisms behind the phase space density variations. REM has been used to perform simulations with an empirical initial phase space density followed by a seed electron injection, with a Tsyganenko 1989 magnetic field model, and with chorus wave and ULF wave diffusion models. Our simulation results show that adding drift shell splitting changes the phase space location of the source to smaller L shells, which typically reduces local electron energization (compared to neglecting drift-shell splitting effects). Simulation results with and without drift-shell splitting effects are compared with Van Allen Probe measurements.",

            "abstract": "Crystal-orientation fabrics in polar ice sheets have a strong influence on ice flow due to the plastic anisotropy of ice. Crystal orientations evolve primarily in response to applied strain, but are also affected by temperature, impurities, interactions with neighbors, and other factors. While the evolution of each ice crystal is physically deterministic, in limited samples, such as those from ice-core thin sections, measured samples are stochastic due to sampling error. Even in continuum representations from models, crystal ODFs can be treated as stochastic due to uncertainties in how they developed. Here, we present results on the statistics of crystal orientation fabrics. We show a first-order estimate of the sampling distribution of fabric eigenvalues and fabric eigenvectors from ice-core thin sections. In addition, the strain histories of fabrics are generally poorly constrained, and may have varied in unknown ways through time. Nearby layers in ice sheets can also experience different strain histories due to inherent variabilities such as transient flow, or differences in impurities. This means that the continuum ODF itself can be treated as stochastic, because it depends on an effectively-stochastic unknown strain-history. To explore this, we analyze the effects of strain and vorticity variability on the evolution of the continuum ice-crystal ODF. We recast Jeffery's equation for the evolution of the ODF as a stochastic differential equation, with vorticity and strain perturbed by Gaussian processes. From this, we run a Monte-Carlo ensemble to determine likely bounds of true continuum ODF variability in response to random perturbations of strain and vorticity.",

The research ranch was established in 1969 as an ecological research preserve and it is now one of the largest ungrazed, privately managed grassland sites in Arizona. A wild fire occurred in April - May 2002, and burned all the standing vegetation and litter on in research ranch (~38,000 acres) including 500 acres of grassland. The mean annual temperature and precipitation (P) at this site were ~16 deg C and ~370 mm, respectively. More than 60% of the annual P was received during the North American monsoon period (July-September) with the lowest annual P in the drought years of 2004 and 2009. Drastic changes in albedo, vegetation growth and evapotranspiration occurred following the onset of the monsoon season in July. The ecosystem was mostly a carbon sink during monsoon period. Daily total evapotranspiration during July-August increased from 2 mm d-1 in 2002 to >3 mm d-1 in 2007. The mean annual E over the site was during 2003 -2009 was 352 ±75 mm. With the onset of monsoon the ecosystem turned to carbon sink in 2002, with daily total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) varying up to ~<-2 g C m-2, by mid-July to August 2002. It was followed by one of the driest monsoon period on the record (2003) with <50% of normal July-September P. Because of this, the recovery of the ecosystem was delayed. During 2002-2009, the ecosystem was mostly a carbon source except in 2006 an year with high growing season Normalized-difference vegetation index, longest monsoon growing season and the highest annual and July–September P. The interannual variations in annual E and NEE were mostly controlled by annual P, July–September NDVI and growing season length during 2002-2009.",

In September 2013, ground-based air samplers were placed selectively to represent the city of Houston: Moody Tower (downtown; urban) and Manvel Croix (southern; suburb), Conroe (far north; suburb) and La Porte (east; urban industrial), with the goal of understanding particulate matter sources and composition and exposure in urban communities. Radiocarbon analysis was conducted on TSP (total suspended particulate matter) and PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter) from ground-based samplers. Radiocarbon is used to determine the contributions of contemporary and fossil sources to carbonaceous aerosol in Houston. Contemporary sources of atmospheric carbon in TSP and PM2.5 include primary biogenic emissions, biomass combustion and SOA produced in the atmosphere from biogenic- and biomass combustion-derived volatile organic carbon. Fossil sources of atmospheric carbon in PM2.5 and TSP include all types of primary fossil fuel combustion and SOA produced in the atmosphere from fossil-derived volatile organic carbon. Results from the last week of the campaign, September 21-28th, displayed a PM2.5 contemporary carbon fraction of 48-78% for Moody Tower, 59-86% for Manvel Croix, 66-89% for Conroe. Ambient TSP had contemporary carbon fractions of 51-65% for Moody Tower and 51-83% for La Porte.",

            "abstract": "Failure of crystals under some external loads often exploit cleavage planes as planes of weakness. The nucleation and extension of “defects” in most cases results in emission of acoustic (phonon) excitations. While X-ray diffraction methods describe the structure of crystals well, the relationship between cleavage planes and unstable failure during cracking of crystals is less well established. In this study, we analyze the polarization patterns of multiple acoustic excitations using functional acoustic network theory. The experiment involves fracturing a small sample placed on a thick aluminum plate using a sharp tip. A load is slowly applied to the testing material until failure inducing the propagation of elastic waves through the aluminum plate. Once the defects’ disturbances have traveled to the opposite side of the plate, they are recorded by a symmetric array of 15 Panametrics V103 sensors. The V103 sensors were calibrated in-situ and showed a roughly flat displacement sensitivity of 73 mV/nm between 20 kHz and 1 MHz. We characterize the emitted noises from Graphite, Gypsum, and Halite and show that microscopic cracking noises carry a signature of plasticity (dislocation growth). We describe the analysis of defects’ slip-direction and growth, inferred from polarization patterns in the weakening phase, and we relate these patterns to individual cleavage plane(s). Further, using multiplex complex networks, we explore the angular tendency of micro-cracking, and estimate the anisotropic nature of micro-defects. Next, we use elasto-dynamic and linear-time-invariant (LTI) systems theory to deconvolve the instrument response and wave propagation functions from the recorded waveform leaving only the source term. Finally, we compare the results from both methods, drawing conclusions about the relationship between crackling noises and plasticity.",

We present detailed results on three terraces that we dated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and cosmogenic 10Be techniques. Quartz OSL dating of two different grain sizes (4-11 and 90-180 μm) revealed the fine-grain quartz fraction overestimates the terrace ages by up to an order of magnitude. Two-mm, small-aliquot, coarse-grain quartz OSL ages, calculated using the finite mixture model, yielded stratigraphically consistent ages within error and dated times of terrace deposition to ~15 ka, ~18.5 ka, and ~75 ka. We speculate the observed grain-size dependence of OSL ages is likely related to the mode of transport of the grains in the fluvial system, with coarser grains sizes spending more time on sand bars where they are more thoroughly bleached than grains in the turbid, commonly episodic flows that carry the silt fraction. Our study suggests that, in flashy, turbid fluvial systems, coarse-grain OSL samples are likely to yield more reliable depositional ages than will fine-grain samples. Cosmogenic 10Be depth profiles date the times of terrace abandonment to ~8 ka, ~15 ka, and ~75 ka, yielding ages in overall agreement with the coarse-grain OSL ages. These ages are generally consistent with other dated terraces in the region that place their deposition and subsequent abandonment during the last deglaciation (13-18 ka) and suggest the formation of these terraces on the margins of the Tarim Basin and along the flanks of the Tian Shan is climatically controlled.",

            "abstract": "Boundaries between pyrogenic and adjacent pyrophobic vegetation communities are created and maintained by positive feedbacks between fire, vegetation, and microclimate. These feedbacks either promote or hinder fire and the boundary is situated at the transition from flammable to non-flammable. Consequently, vegetation is only directly influenced by fire if it is burned. Therefore, revealing where fire stops between communities is important for understanding their capacity to withstand change. We identified vegetation structure and microclimate components as predictors of fire spread along a (pyrogenic) savanna – (pyrophobic) wetland ecotonal gradient in North Carolina, USA. The ability of the fire feedback to maintain the transition from flammable to non-flammable conditions under potential global change is not known. We built a cellular automaton which employed Markov transition probabilities and associated fire spread probabilities to simulate the conditions of the ecotonal gradient under differing fire frequencies. Changes to the gradient boundaries were estimated from the location of the flammable to non-flammable transition. Our simulations produced movement of the boundary under certain fire return intervals. In general, more frequent fires resulted in fire failure deeper into wetland, and less frequent fires resulted in fire failure nearer savanna. Our simulations indicate that fire feedbacks are capable of controlling boundary locations up to a perturbation threshold, but that this control is not absolute. The transition from flammable to non-flammable within these pyrogenic-pyrophobic ecotones is essential to distinct communities. The management and conservation of these systems is fire-focused and, therefore, improving predictions about where fire stops under global change is important for those objectives.",

            "abstract": "Among the planet’s most abundant photosynthetic groups, the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus contributes nearly a quarter of our global oxygen supply. Urea, from both natural and anthropogenic sources, is an important alternative to the preferred yet limited sources of reduced nitrogen for cyanobacteria in the marine environment. While urea uptake activity has been observed during nitrogen (N) limitation, this stress adaptation is not well-studied in natural habitats. We propose the urtAgene, which encodes the substrate-binding subunit of the urea-uptake ABC transporter, as a molecular marker to profile cell abundance and stress response in relation to N fluctuation.\nStrains prevalent in temperate waters of the California Current System – Synechococcus CC9311 (clade I), CC9605 (clade II) and CC9902/BL107 (clade IV) – were targeted by clade-specific qPCR assays to measure urtA gene copy abundance in samples from different geographical stations and a time-series. Spatial and seasonal patterns in clade abundance resembled those previously reported by studies using other Synechococcus marker genes, thus validating urtA as a strong marker. Synechococcus clades I and IV were most abundant in coastal and transitional stations, while the more oligotrophic clade II was detected near open waters. Synechococcus abundances were highest before and after the annual upwelling season, as supported by a non clade-specific rbcL-qPCR assay. A lack of correlation between abundance and nitrate availability indicated utilization of alternative nitrogen sources like urea, which was further evidenced by the detection of clade IV urtA transcripts at the station closest to shore.\nUrea concentrations tend to be highest in coastal environments due to fertilizer runoff, which can stimulate phytoplankton blooms including harmful algal blooms. This study adds to insight on how such environmental factors are related to N-cycling and patterns of urea-assimilating microbial populations like Synechococcus subgroups in the California Current waters of the Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "During its evolution the Oldoinyo Lengai volcano (northern Tanzania) has erupted magmas with a compositional range from nephelinites to phonolites and carbonatites. Intrusive, metasomatic and cumulate enclaves are commonly found in all silicate products of the volcano. New and detailed geochemical and mineralogical study of 132 samples of fresh volcanic silicate material from four debris avalanches, and the volcanic edifice, indicates that phonolites and nephelinites associated with carbonatites were generated via different evolutionary paths. Temporally, the first stage of evolution included the phonolitic path, whereas the second, modern stage includes the production of combeite-wollastonite-bearing nephelinites, associated with carbonatites. Our data supports the two-stage evolutionary model previously presented by Klaudius and Keller (2006). The modern stage is characterised by the mildly explosive natrocarbonatitic activity, which is alternating with highly explosive, nephelinitic eruptions. Distal products of these nephelinitic eruptions cover a wide area around the volcano, however only the recent eruptions have been documented. In this context, special emphasis was paid to the origin of the Lake Natron Footprint Tuff which has preserved hominid footprints that received considerable interest within the anthropological community in recent years. The so-called Footprint tuff is the most significant volcaniclastic horizon in the area around Oldoinyo Lengai. Based on the geochemical, mineralogical and magnetic data we collected from this site, we can deduce that the footprint-bearing horizon was deposited during one or several big eruptions of the Oldoinyo Lengai volcano (corresponding to the late nephelinitic stage of volcanism) and was slightly reworked by water. The material that comprises the upper horizon, which covers the footprints, was derived as aeolian sediments from the Lake Natron – Engaruka Monogenetic Volcanic Field (i.e., melilititic in composition). Based on the petrology in combination with field observations and climatological data from the region we further conclude that the age of the Footprint tuff must be less than 11 ka.\nKlaudius, J. and J.

It is likewise important for models attempting to quantify cloud-aerosol feedbacks to realistically account for this pervasive pathway. Representing these phenomena accurately in models requires in-depth knowledge of the chemical interactions that lead to new particle formation as well as the availability of condensable species to sustain a growth event. Further, models must represent the numerical aspects of particle growth reasonably well in order to preserve the essential characteristics of the aerosol size distribution (e.g. unimodal vs. bimodal, peak diameter, etc). Such characteristics are critical for calculating the number of particles participating as nuclei for liquid and solid hydrometeors.\nWe implement into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model a new aerosol processing module designed for robust prediction of particle number concentrations, sources and sinks. The new module leverages the speed and flexibility of modal aerosol techniques with state-of-the-art, schemes for treating new particle formation, coagulation, and intermodal transference. Moreover, we incorporate an updated treatment of organic aerosol (OA) formation and explore the sensitivity of growth rates predicted by the CMAQ model to the uncertain OA formation parameters. We apply the new model to observations made during the CalNex 2010 campaign and evaluate model performance against observed number concentrations, time-dependent growth rates, and size distributions.",

These electrons are confined to move along magnetic field lines and, when those field lines intersect the atmosphere, the electrons collide with atmospheric neutral particles, resulting in heating, dissociation, ionization and excitation of those neutrals. Electron precipitation is an important source of energy input to the Mars upper atmosphere, and is typically the dominant source on the nightside. Past observations from Mars Global Surveyor have characterized patterns of electron precipitation, but only at ~400 km and ~2 AM local time. The MAVEN mission and in particular the SWEA instrument, provides an opportunity to study the distribution of suprathermal electrons in near-Mars space, over a range of altitudes from 120-6000 km and at a range of local times.

Equally important is the role of the voting public in understanding STEM-related issues that impact public policy debates such as the potential impacts of climate change, hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas exploration, mining impacts on water quality, and science funding. Since voted officials have a major impact on the future of these policies, it is imperative that the general public have an understanding of the basic science behind these issues. By engaging with the public in a more fundamental way, university students can play an important role in educating the public while at the same time enhancing their communication skills and gaining valuable teaching experience. I will talk about my own experiences in (1) evaluating and publishing water chemistry and hazardous waste cleanup curriculum on the K-12 engineering platform TeachEngineering.org, (2) organizing public tours of water and energy sites (e.g., abandoned mine sites, coal power plants, wastewater treatment plants, hazardous waste treatment facilities), and (3) other outreach and communication activities including public education of environmental issues through consultations with customers of a landscaping/lawn mowing company. The main focus of this presentation will be the role that graduate students can play in engaging and educating their local community and lessons learned from community projects (Dittrich, 2014; 2012; 2011).\n",

            "abstract": "Aqueous fluids released from the down-going slab in subduction zones are generally thought to be the cause of arc volcanism. However there is a significant discrepancy between the consistent location of the volcanic front with respect to intermediate depth earthquakes (e.g. 100+/-40 km; England et al., GJI, 2004, Syracuse & Abers, G-cubed, 2006) and the large depth range over which dehydration reactions are predicted to occur in the slab (e.g. 80-250 km; van Keken et al., JGR, 2011).\nBy coupling the fluid flow to the solid rheology through compaction pressure, recent numerical models (Wilson et al., EPSL, 2014) demonstrated a number of focusing mechanisms that can be invoked to explain this apparent discrepancy. Most notable among these were permeability channels within the slab. These were shown to be highly effective in transporting fluid from deeper fluid sources along the slab towards the shallowest source. In the presence of these channels the majority of the fluid is released into the mantle wedge far shallower and closer to the arc than it was originally generated.\nWhile observations consistent with free fluids in the slab have been reported (e.g. Shiina et al., GRL, 2013), it is possible that changing the reactivity and rheology of the slab can change the efficiency of in-slab transport (e.g. Wada et al., EPSL, 2012, Faccenda et al., G3, 2012). We present a series of simplified model problems of fluid flow within the slab and mantle wedge demonstrating the potential effect of these processes on fluid flux. In particular, pseudo-1D models show that if fluids can efficiently rehydrate slab minerals, then these reactions can shut down fluid pathways within the slab, resulting in deeper release of fluid into the mantle wedge. We will expand these results to consider the effects of rehydration in 2-D calculations. In addition, our previous models have considered only the simplest rheologies and geometries for the slab. We will also discuss new results that investigate simple visco-plastic models for the slab that limit the stresses and maximum viscosities in the slab for more realistic slab geometries. Despite these additional complexities, the robust observation of the location of the volcanic front with respect to intermediate depth earthquakes provides a clear test for evaluating subduction zone models.",

Chemicals within snow and ice are found in three different compartments: distributed in the bulk ice, concentrated in liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice matrix (such as at grain boundaries), or present in quasi-liquid layers (QLLs) at the air-ice interface. While some previous work suggested reaction rates may vary in these different compartments, our preliminary experiments found similar reaction rates in all three compartments, as well as in aqueous solution. Previous work also suggested reaction rate constants may be independent of photon flux under certain illumination conditions. Here, we extend our investigations to measure reaction rate constants in ice samples with different orientations to the illumination source, which our work thus far suggests may impact the measured rate constants.\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common pollutants in snow and ice. We first prepared aqueous solutions of a single PAH. We then froze these samples using various methods previously shown to segregate the solute into known locations in the ice matrix. With simulated polar sunlight, we illuminated these samples and measured photon flux (using 2-nitrobenzaldehyde as a chemical actinometer) and photodecay of the PAH. Using this information, we normalized the rate of PAH loss to the photon flux and calculated the rate constants for PAH photodegradation under various freezing conditions, photon fluxes, and sample orientations. We will report on the impact of these variables on PAH photodegradation as well as the effect of varying the photon flux.",

The new results come from stations in northern Namibia and Botswana, which help to fill in large gaps in data coverage. Our preliminary results show that fast polarization directions overall trend in a NE orientation. The most noticeable measurements that deviate from this pattern are located around the Archean Tanzania Craton in eastern Africa. The general NE pattern of fast polarization directions is attributed to mantle flow linked to the African superplume. Smaller scale variations from this general direction can be explained by shape anisotropy in the lithosphere in magmatic regions in the East African rift system and to fossil anisotropy in the Precambrian lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 354 drilled sites in the Bay of Bengal to improve our understanding of the links between tectonics, monsoon strength, and oceanographic conditions. The Bengal Fan contains complex depositional environments, which vary from thick sequences of turbidites and levee sediments that reflects channel activity, to intervals of hemipelagic calcareous clay. Foraminifera are commonly used to reconstruct past oceanographic conditions, but the complex depositional environments raises the possibility that foraminifera in the cores were transported from the northern Bay of Bengal through turbidity currents, rather than settling out from the overlying water column. The goal of the project is to determine if foraminifera in the modern sediments at IODP Exp 354 sites record the overlying water column conditions or water conditions of the northern Bay of Bengal.\nToday sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) has a larger seasonal range in the northern bay (3.0 psu and 5ᵒC, respectively) compared to Exp 354 core sites at 8ᵒN (0.7 psu and 1.4ᵒC, respectively). We present Mg/Ca and d18O data of individual Globigerinoides ruber or sacculifer in the mud-line samples of site U1454 (8.4ᵒN, 85.5ᵒE, 3721 m water depth), which is near the modern active channel, and site U1449 (8.4ᵒN, 88.7ᵒE, 3653 m water depth), which is farthest from the active channel. Because foraminifera live ~2-4 weeks, each analysis reflects a short period of time. Taken together, the distribution of 75 to 100 data points will reflect the seasonal SST and SSS range where the foraminifera calcified. Given the spatial variability of seasonality in the Bay of Bengal, a broader distribution of the data would reflect the larger SSS and SST range of the northern bay, while a narrower data distribution would reflect the much smaller SSS and SST range at the Exp 354 location. If foraminifera at both sites reflect local surface water conditions we can be more confident in applying foraminifera proxies down-core.",

            "abstract": "Craters of explosive volcanic eruptions are products of many explosions. Such craters are different than products of single events such as meteorite impacts or those produced by military testing because they typically result from multiple, rather than single, explosions. We analyzed the evolution of experimental craters that were created by several detonations of chemical explosives in layered aggregates. A method to calculate an effective explosion depth for non-flat topography (e.g. for explosions below existing craters) is derived, showing how multi-blast crater sizes differ from the single blast case. It is shown that sizes of natural caters (radii, volumes) are not characteristic of the number of explosions, and therefore not characteristic for the total acting energy, that formed a crater. Also the crater size is not simply related to the largest explosion in a sequence, but depends upon that explosion and the energy of that single blast and on the cumulative energy of all blasts that formed the crater. The two energies can be combined to form an effective number of explosions that is characteristic for the crater evolution. The multi-blast crater size evolution implies that it is not correct to estimate explosion energy of volcanic events from crater size using previously published relationships that were derived for single blast cases.",

Such observations provide an opportunity to visualize mechanisms, determine closure relations needed for existing and evolving models, and provide a means to validate theoretical predictions. We use a 500-micron cell with a circular solid phase to study two-fluid-phase displacement, including a dense pattern of drainage, imbibition, and scanning curves at very high spatial and temporal distribution. Viscous fingering, Haines jumps, and snap-off processes are visualized. A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to model the experimental data and shows excellent agreement for equilibrium states and certain aspects of the dynamics. Pressure dynamics, displacement processes, and interface curvature change time scales are shown. The fluid pressure, saturation, curvature, and interfacial area data is used to demonstrate that a unique, non-hysteretic closure relation exists. Further, the data is compared to mechanistic predictions based upon the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT), validating key aspects of the theory.",

            "abstract": "During solar cycle 24, thanks largely to the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), many solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed at widely separate locations in the heliosphere, even including impulsive events that are usually assumed to reflect localized acceleration and injection. It is found that many of these wide SEP events accompany coronal waves that typically appear in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images. The EUV wave phenomenon has been observed much more closely than before by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory that continuously produces full-disk EUV images with unprecedentedly fast cadence and high sensitivity in multiple wavelength bands covering a broad temperature range. This is complemented by the EUV Imager on STEREO that traces the wave front into regions inaccessible from Earth. Several authors have attempted to explain wide SEP events in terms of EUV waves, especially comparing the SEP release times with how and when the EUV wave fronts traverse the magnetic footprints of the locations of SEPs. They have come to mixed results. The primary reason for the mixed results may be that they tend to overlook or underestimate the uncertainties inherent in the works. For example, how well do we model magnetic field connection in the corona and heliosphere? Do we adequately take into account the evolving solar wind conditions? Here we study a number of SEP events with various angular spreads in comparison with newly analyzed EUV waves. We discuss the importance of including the above-mentioned uncertainties as well as understanding EUV waves as part of the 3d propagation of CME-driven shock waves into the coronagraph fields of view. Without these approaches, it may remain ambiguous how much of the angular spread of SEP events is attributable to coronal shock waves.",

            "abstract": "There forms a tenuous region behind the Moon in the solar wind, as the lunar dayside surface adsorbs most of the incident solar wind plasma. Entry processes of solar wind plasma into this tenuous region, which is called the lunar wake, have been widely studied. In addition to gradual refilling of the wake by the ambient solar wind, it has been known that a portion of solar wind protons that are scattered at the dayside surface or deflected by crustal magnetic fields can enter the wake (i.e. type-2 entry). However, proton entry into the deepest lunar wake (i.e. anti-subsolar region at low altitude) by the type-2 process needs specific solar wind conditions. Here we report, using data from Kaguya spacecraft in orbit around the Moon, that solar wind ions reflected at the terrestrial bow shock easily access the deepest lunar wake, when the Moon is located in the foreshock. In one case, when the spacecraft location is magnetically connected to the lunar night-side surface, the kinetic energy of upward-going field-aligned electron beams decreases or electron beams disappear during the reflected-ion events. This shows that the intrusion of the shock-reflected ions and electrons into the wake changes the electrostatic potential of the lunar night-side surface.",

The sedimentary succession of the continental shelf is divided into nine sequences (S1-S9). The sedimentary succession is consists of the lower pro-graded sequences (from S2 to S6; 16.5-8.2 Ma) and upper channelized depositional sequences (S7 and S8; 8.2-5.5 Ma) in the Miocene. It progressively thickens northeast ward, suggesting a significant contribution of sediments into the basin margin. The channelized depositional system of S7 is divided into two subunits in which lower boundaries of each subunit are indicated by erosional truncation and channel incision. The underlying subunit 1 has two main streams; the progressive directions are to the NNE (a) and ENE (b). The main stream of subunit 2, developed after giving rise to the low-relief topography of the subunit 1, is only overlapping main stream (a) of subunit 1. The gentle sloped proximal-middle zone has different internal reflector, subunit 1 is characterized by parallel to chaotic reflections, whereas the subunit 2 is dominated by continuous and inclined reflectors, which can be interpreted that sediments supply is increase in subunit 2 than subunit 1. The steep sloped distal zone of channelized depositional systems connected the shelf break. The slope gradient is more slanted subunit 2 than 1. The internal structures are dis-continuous and inclined chaotic internal reflectors, which is interpreted mass transport deposits (MTDs). The slope failures commonly start near the shelf break, but some others are connected perpendicular to the main stream. The upper boundary of subunit 2 is truncated by transgressive surface. The stacking pattern of sequence 7 suggests the type-1 sequence controlled by sea level change, and the internal erosional surface in the channelized depositional systems can be interpreted that formed by tectonic or relative sea level flocculation during late Miocene in East Sea.",

Whist VT events are known to be associated with material fracturing, LP events are usually directly associated with the presence fluids. In the top few kilometres of the edifice, populations of LP and VT events usually separate in space. VTs are typically deeper than LPs. This observation leads us to investigate the effects that mechanical stratification of the edifice has on both seismicity distribution and type. Using field data, numerical simulations and physical laboratory experiments here we demonstrate that deformation in a weak dry compliant upper edifice is sufficient to explain a broad range of LP observations. Hence the presence of fluids is not a necessary condition for LP generation and LPs may not be a reliable indicator of fluid driven processes in the upper edifice.",

Although most focus is on air temperature, the radiative or skin temperature of plants is more relevant. Canopy skin temperature dynamics reflect biophysical, physiological, and anatomical characteristics and interactions with environmental drivers, and can be used to examine forest responses to stresses like droughts and heat waves. Direct measurements of plant canopy temperatures using thermocouple sensors have been challenging and offer limited information. Such measurements are usually conducted over short periods of time and a limited spatial extent of the canopy. By contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imaging allows for extensive temporal and spatial measurement of canopy temperature regimes. We present results of TIR imaging of forest canopies at a range of well-studied forest sites in the United States and Panama. These forest types include temperate rainforests, a semi­arid pine forest, and a semi­deciduous tropical forest. Canopy temperature regimes at these sites are highly variable spatially and temporally and display frequent departures from air temperature, particularly during clear sky conditions. Canopy tissue temperatures are often warmer (daytime) and colder (nighttime) than air temperature, and canopy structure seems to have a large influence on the thermal regime. Additionally, comparison of canopy temperatures to eddy covariance fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy reveals relationships not apparent using air temperature. Initial comparisons between our forest canopy temperatures and remotely sensed skin temperature using Landsat and MODIS data show reasonably good agreement. We conclude that temporal and spatial changes in canopy temperature and its relationship to biological and environmental factors can improve our understanding of how climate change is affecting forest function, and argue for wider deployment of thermal cameras in other ecosystems.",

However, it does posses scaling symmetries that have been more and more used to define stochastic processes representing rainfall.\nThe interest of high resolution rainfall measurements for a better modeling of urban and peri-urban catchments’ responses is investigated with the help of multifractals applied to two types of rainfall data: C-band radar data provided by Météo-France at a resolution of 1 Km in space and 5 min in time and data from a newly installed X-band radar operated by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and providing data with a resolution of 100 m in space and 2.5 min in time. Multifractal downscaled C-band radar data are first compared with X-band data at the resolution of the latter to validate this downscaling. This multifractal downscaling is then used to generate an ensemble of high resolution rainfalls that can be thereafter input into a validated hydrological model to obtain an ensemble of hydrographs.\nThe variability observed within the simulated ensemble corresponds to the uncertainty associated with the small scale rainfall variability that is not measured by the C-band radar. Finally the response with the X-band radar data is simulated, which enables to discuss the added value of the improved rainfall data.",

            "abstract": "The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) form a “network of networks,” each defined by the characteristics of its ecoregion and its unique community of conservation managers, practitioners, and scientists. As self-directed partnerships, LCCs are strongly influenced not only by the landscape but by the evolving cultures and values that define the multi-faceted relationships between people and place. LCCs maintain an ecologically connected network across these diverse landscapes by transcending borders and leveraging resources. Natural resource managers are challenged to make decisions in the face of multiple uncertainties, and several partners across the network have recognized that climate change is one important uncertainty that spans boundaries – both across the conservation community and beyond. The impacts of climate change across the LCC Network are likely to be as diverse as the network itself – manifesting as, for example, sea level rise, ocean acidification, loss of sea ice, and shifts in climate patterns and timing – but synergies are being leveraged within and between LCCs and national climate-focused programs to systematically address the needs of the network to support a collaborative conservation vision that addresses multiple landscape-scale stressors in the face of climate uncertainties. This vision is being achieved by leveraging the convening power of the LCCs and collaborating with DOI Climate Science Centers and others. Selected case studies will demonstrate how the network finds strength in its differences, but also reveals powerful collaborative opportunities through integrated science, shared conservation strategies, and strategic approaches for translating targeted science to conservation action. These examples exemplify past successes as well as ongoing efforts as the network continues to bring about effective application of climate science to achieve conservation outcomes across the LCC Network in an uncertain future climate.",

Gas trapped in sediment is a example of these media. Seismic images of geological structures underneath shallow gas often suffer from resolution degradation and effect of amplitude dimming, making their identification and interpretation difficult. This affects the ability to accurately predict reservoir properties. Thus, there is a need to compensate the attenuation due to Q, to be estimated using tomography seismic.\nThis work takes place in a viscoelastic medium in the frequency domain, where is incorporated the attenuation to replace the elastic real parameters by parameters visco-elastic complex frequency dependent, consequently the equations must work complex and thus solution should be sought in the complex space. Complex eikonal equation is obtained from the equation of motion in a viscoelastic medium in the frequency domain.\nThe objective is to apply a tomography method to estimate a model of complex velocity and Q model to achieve an improvement in seismic imaging in areas where there are strong attenuation factors or fractured media.\nTo achieve calculating Q, first complex eikonal equation is solved in a medium viscoelastic using ray tracing. The resulting travel time is complex; its real part describes the wave propagation and its imaginary part describes the effects of attenuation. A process of tomography is then performed, the initial models of complex velocity and Q are determined; the models are smoothly inhomogeneous, with a constant gradient of the square of slowness. For such models, an exact solution of the complex eikonal equation can be found analytically by using complex ray tracing. given the initial complex velocity models and Q, calculate theoretical travel times and and finally making the inversion using the Gauss-Newton method, fit the initial velocity model and Q to get the difference between the observed data and theoretical data is minimal.\nThe codes for the initial models of complex velocity and Q and codes of inversion develop in Python.\nKeywords: Viscoelastic, complex eikonal equation, ray tracing, quality factor, tomography.",

However, there are cases of impulsive SEPs where in-situ observations showed a clear deviation from the source region. A possible explanation of such events is that the field lines are non-Parker, and they meander in the interplanetary space. In this work, we examine particle transport in a non-Parker field. In particular, we consider field line's random walk caused by the foot point motion. We generate random δφ and δθ and calculate both Parker and stochastic fields numerically in all space. We follow the particle's motion by solving the Lorentz force directly. We explicitly examine how much deviation the in-situ observation can be from the source region.",

The emitted gases are often known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which, beside nitrogen oxides (NOX), are major precursors for ozone formation in the near-surface layer. Field measurement campaigns using the flux-chamber technique have been performed to measure VOC emissions from a limited number of produced water ponds in the Uintah Basin of eastern Utah. Although the flux chamber provides accurate measurements at the point of sampling, it covers just a limited area of the ponds and is prone to altering environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure). This fact raises the need to validate flux chamber measurements.\nIn this study, we apply an inverse-dispersion modeling technique with evacuated canister sampling to validate the flux-chamber measurements. This modeling technique applies an initial and arbitrary emission rate to estimate pollutant concentrations at pre-defined receptors, and adjusts the emission rate until the estimated pollutant concentrations approximates measured concentrations at the receptors. The derived emission rates are then compared with flux-chamber measurements and differences are analyzed. Additionally, we investigate the applicability of the WATER9 wastewater emission model for the estimation of VOC emissions from produced-water ponds in the Uintah Basin. WATER9 estimates the emission of each gas based on properties of the gas, its concentration in the waste water, and the characteristics of the influent and treatment units. Results of VOC emission estimations using inverse-dispersion and WATER9 modeling techniques will be reported.",

            "abstract": "Models of episodic or cyclic behavior in Mesozoic Cordilleran continental arcs often examine broad patterns based on a single event or cycle. However, our comparison of multiple events/cycles both in single arc segments and in multiple, along-strike segments over ~15,000 km indicate that significant variations occur. For example during the three flare-ups peaking at ~225, ~161, and ~98 Ma in the Sierran segment, magma addition rates (MARs) indicate that the Triassic flare-up produced 3 times and the Cretaceous ~7 times as much magma as the Jurassic and 100 to 1000 times more magma than during lulls. Isostatic modeling combining arc shortening + MARs thus results in small roots/surface elevations in the Jurassic and Triassic and a large root/surface elevation during the Cretaceous. Age-constrained geochemical data in the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada show both general and specific flare-up versus lull trends. General trends during flare-ups include decrease in εNdi median values, and an increase to higher median values of SiO2, 87Sr/86Sri, Sr/Y, and (Sm/Yb)n. However these median values vary dramatically from one flare-up/lull episode to the next. For example the change in 87Sr/86Sri, Sr/Y, (Sm/Yb)n during flare-ups and lulls is not as pronounced for the Triassic and Jurassic events compared to the Cretaceous. And the Early Cretaceous displays unusually high median values in Sr/Y and (Sm/Yb)n. These patterns draw attention to a potential correlation between MARs and geochemical patterns. Although MARs are largely unavailable for other arc segments, along-strike, arc segment comparisons of zircon age spectra indicate flare-up periodicity of ~60-80 Ma over variable spatial scales ranging up to ~6000 km. Variations occur in all of the above geochemical measurements in both general and specific flare-up trends. Our results suggest that driving mechanisms for flare-ups/lulls vary along this Mesozoic arc and that second order effects vary between flare-ups and arc segments.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the complexity and stability of ecological systems has long been a focus of theoretical ecology. As the concepts of complexity and stability have been enriched and extended, the debate over the relationship between complexity and stability has also continued. One recent and important development was the incorporation of interaction types as an important factor; another has been the recognition that ecological stability can be defined in different ways, and the connection between these has been a focus of recent effort.\nWe establish a general dynamic model for hybrid ecological communities, based on an intuitive concept of consumer-resource interaction (a fundamental aspect of ecological communities). Different interaction types such as antagonism and mutualism, emerge naturally according to the choice of consumer-side and resource-side conversion rates (two important parameters of the consumer-resource interaction). The general consumer-resource dynamic model also involves the ‘handling time’ of resource species by consumer species, which provides a nonlinear functional response among species. We define three different aspects of ecosystem stability for comparison: ‘persistence’ as the fraction of surviving species at equilibrium, ‘resilience’ as the rate at which the system returns to equilibrium after a small pulse perturbation, and ‘fragility’ as the probability of sudden shifts as continuous external pressures are applied.\nWe found explicit correlations among fragility, persistence and resilience conditioned by interaction types and strengths, and the handling time:\n(i) while increasing the strength and proportion of mutualistic interactions leads to a sharp (step-like) increase of fragility, it also results in more persistent and resilient communities (and vise versa); (ii) Increases in the handling time of species has a negative overall effect on fragility but a positive effect on persistence; these relationships are weakened with decreasing strength and proportion of mutualistic interactions.\nFinally, we have used multi-objective optimization to compute the optimized proportion of interaction types, values of interaction strengths and handling times which results in optimized stability, as a trade-off between fragility, persistence and resilience.",

            "abstract": "Endophytic microorganisms – bacteria and fungi that live inside healthy plant tissue – are a relatively unexplored source of functional diversity in natural ecosystems. Prior to modern sequencing technology, detecting uncultured endophytic bacteria and assessing their putative functions was challenging. However, recent work has revealed a remarkable diversity of as yet non-culturable endophytic taxa and is beginning to identify functional roles within plant microbiomes. We recently examined bacterial communities in the foliage of a long-lived, high-elevation conifer species, limber pine (Pinus flexilis), and discovered a community strongly dominated by acetic acid bacteria (Acetobacteraceae), with several taxa closely related to known nitrogen fixers. Given limber pine's status as a pioneer species that is able to grow in low fertility soils, we hypothesized that this bacterial community has a potential functional role in fixing atmospheric nitrogen, providing a source of this limiting nutrient to the host tree. We used the radioisotope 13N2 to confirm that N2 rapidly diffuses into pine needles, where it could potentially be fixed. With an acetylene reduction assay we confirmed nitrogenase enzyme activity inside excised twigs 4 times over a growing season, and estimate potential rates of N2 fixation at 0.1 nmol N2 g needle-1 hr-1. Scaled to the stand level, this N input could be on the order of ~20 mg N m-2 d-1 over a growing season. While these rates are low, the long lifespan of individual trees (~1000 years) makes them biologically meaningful. Still, measured rates of acetylene reduction and bulk 15N2 incorporation are quite variable in space and time. Much work remains to better characterize the plant-microbial interactions in this system, including the rates of nitrogen fixation and their variability over the growing season, across edaphic conditions, among host species, and through plant development; and to determine which community members are responsible for this novel nitrogen transformation pathway in high elevation forests.",

Examples of supported hydrologic data resources include: geographic rasters, NetCDF multi-dimensional data, time series, model programs, and model instances. To support web-based visualization and analysis of these digital objects, we have deployed an instance of the open source Tethys Platform web app hosting system at\nhttp://apps.hydroshare.org/\n. Tethys is a web development platform that provides web application developers with a Python-based programming environment for building and hosting hydrologic “web apps” – loosely defined as single purpose, task-oriented, user-friendly, web-accessible applications. Tethys Platform includes an open source GIS software suite comprised of GeoServer, PostGIS, 52-North, GRASS, R, OpenLayers, HighCharts, and other useful tools to support custom web app development. This presentation will introduce the Web App resource type in HydroShare and its custom metadata elements – illustrating how we used HydroShare itself as a catalog for web apps. The approach uses loose coupling and web services to link HydroShare resources with web apps in a scalable way that can expand to third party web apps.

Since the successful deployment of all 8 magnetometers on 17 March 2015, the effort to confirm and update the ground calibrations has been underway during the MMS commissioning phase. The in-flight calibration processes evaluate twelve parameters that determine the alignment, orthogonalization, offsets, and gains for all 8 magnetometers using algorithms originally developed by UCLA and the Technical University of Braunschweig and tailored to MMS by IWF, UCLA, and GSFC. We focus on the processes run at GSFC to determine the eight parameters associated with spin tones and harmonics. We will also discuss the processing flow and interchange of parameters between GSFC, IWF, and UCLA. IWF determines the low range spin axis offsets using the Electron Drift Instrument (EDI). UCLA determines the absolute gains and sensor azimuth orientation using Earth field comparisons. We evaluate the performance achieved for MMS and give examples of the quality of the resulting calibrations.",

            "abstract": "Resolving and projecting the water budget of the North American Great Lakes basin (Earth's largest lake system) requires aggregation of data from a complex array of in situ monitoring and remote sensing products that cross an international border (leading to potential sources of bias and other inconsistencies), and are relatively sparse over the surfaces of the lakes themselves. Data scarcity over the surfaces of the lakes is a particularly significant problem because, unlike Earth's other large freshwater basins, the Great Lakes basin water budget is (on annual scales) comprised of relatively equal contributions from runoff, over-lake precipitation, and over-lake evaporation. Consequently, understanding drivers behind changes in regional water storage and water levels requires a data management framework that can reconcile uncertainties associated with data scarcity and bias, and propagate those uncertainties into regional water budget projections and historical records. Here, we assess the development of a historical hydrometeorological database for the entire Great Lakes basin with records dating back to the late 1800s, and describe improvements that are specifically intended to differentiate hydrological, climatological, and anthropogenic drivers behind recent extreme changes in Great Lakes water levels. Our assessment includes a detailed analysis of the extent to which extreme cold winters in central North America in 2013-2014 (caused by the anomalous meridional upper air flow - commonly referred to in the public media as the \"polar vortex\" phenomenon) altered the thermal and hydrologic regimes of the Great Lakes and led to a record setting surge in water levels between January 2014 and December 2015.",

For these reasons it is important to understand the main causes and sources of windblown dust in the southwestern border region of the US. To help us understand the causes of the dust storms in our region, we are attempting to determine the synoptic scale meteorological conditions present at the time of approximately 60 dust storm events (from about 600 dust events over a 15 year period). From that, we will develop a \"synoptic scale climatology\" for dust events in the border region. To develop this climatology, we are using the NARR 500mb geopotential height patterns at 18GMT (approximate time of initial dust emission) to investigate whether our \"observational\" experience agrees with our hypothesis that a 500mb geopotential height low pressure pattern exists in the vicinity of the NM/CO border (latitudinal extent) and, depending on the timing of the event and other influences, somewhere from UT to TX (longitudinal extent). In our analysis we are comparing individual 500mb geopotential height patterns to a mean 500mb geopotential height pattern. Our preliminary results indicate that our observations are valid. Our goal is to develop a tool for forecasting these types of events.",

            "abstract": "The viscosity structure of Earth's deep mantle affects the thermal evolution of Earth, the ascent of mantle plumes, settling of subducted oceanic lithosphere, and the mixing of compositional heterogeneities in the mantle. Modeling the long wavelength non-hydrostatic geoid provides a constraint on the radial viscosity structure of Earth’s mantle. We carried out inversions for the radial mantle viscosity structure using a transdimensional, hierarchical Bayesian technique that allows us to obtain solutions without specifying at the outset the number or locations of viscosity changes within the mantle. We obtained a posterior probability distribution of mantle viscosity structures, which allowed us to assess our confidence in our inferences of the viscosity structure. We find robust evidence for an increase in viscosity at 800-1200 km depth, significantly deeper than the mineral phase transformations which define the mantle transition zone. The viscosity increase is coincident in depth with regions where tomographic models image slab stagnation, plume deflection, and changes in large-scale structure, manifested in the mantle radial correlation function for the lowest spherical harmonic degrees. Here, we present new results from 3D, spherical-shell geometry thermal and thermochemical mantle convection simulations with prescribed plate motions based on paleogeographic reconstructions. These simulations employ a range of admissible mantle viscosity structures from our geoid inversions. We find that by including the inferred increase in viscosity at 1000 km depth, we can better reproduce the long wavelength mantle radial correlation function observed in the latest tomographic models GAP-P4 and SEMUCB-WM1. The similarity of the modeled and observed radial correlation functions is sensitive to the choice of lower mantle viscosity and the inclusion of phase changes in the transition zone and the mid-mantle. We will also discuss the effect of these viscosity structures on predictions of evolving long-wavelength thermochemical structures as well as the core-mantle boundary heat flow.",

Based on direct experience with over 25 and review of over 10 additional eruption sequences at 24 volcanoes, we have identified 4 phases of precursory seismicity.\n1) Deep (>20 km) low frequency (DLF) earthquakes occur near the base of the crust as magma rises toward crustal reservoirs. This seismicity is the most difficult to observe, owing to generally small magnitudes (M<2.5) the significant depth.\n2) Distal volcano-tectonic (DVT) earthquakes occur on tectonic faults from a 2 to 30+ km distance laterally from (not beneath) the eventual eruption site as magma intrudes into and rises out of upper crustal reservoirs to depths of 2-3 km. A survey of 111 eruptions of 83 previously dormant volcanoes, (including all eruptions of VEI >4 since 1955) shows they were all preceded by significant DVT seismicity, usually felt. This DVT seismicity is easily observed owing to magnitudes generally reaching M>3.5. The cumulative DVT energy correlates to the intruding magma volume.\n3) Low frequency (LF) earthquakes, LF tremor and contained explosions occur as magma interacts with the shallow hydrothermal system (<2 km depth), while the distal seismicity dies off.4) Shortly after this, repetitive self-similar proximal seismicity may occur and may dominate the seismic records as magma rises to the surface.\nWe present some examples of this seismic progression to demonstrate that data from a single short-period vertical station are often sufficient to forecast eruption onsets.",

Further, we use the method to also estimate analog ensembles for a high-resolution reanalysis (at 2km) from the coarser grids.

            "abstract": "Early cloud-scale modeling work on effects of solar-absorbing aerosol layers focused on the desiccation of shallow cumulus clouds embedded with such layers, resulting from the reduction in relative humidity induced by solar heating, as well as reduced vertical mixing from stabilization of the boundary layer. Such a cloud response serves as a positive radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere, tending to warm the climate system. Subsequent work has largely targeted the impact of overlying solar-absorbing aerosol layers on stratiform clouds in the marine boundary layer, in which the solar heating increases the strength of the temperature inversion capping the boundary layer, which reduces entrainment of overlying air into the boundary layer. Because entrainment typically (but not always) reduces the average relative humidity of the boundary layer and thereby leads to a thinner cloud layer, a reduction in entrainment induced by an absorbing aerosol layer leads to a thicker cloud layer and a negative radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere, tending to cool the climate system. Here we use large-eddy simulations to assess the effects of overlying solar-absorbing aerosol layers on the transition of stratocumulus to trade cumulus clouds. Beyond the impact on the inversion strength, we also consider the changes induced by microphysical response to entrained aerosol that serve as cloud condensation nuclei, as well as reduction in solar heating of the cloud induced by the overlying aerosol layer. Observationally-based transition cases used in a recent large-eddy simulation intercomparison will be used as a starting point for the model setup, along with idealized aerosol layer properties based on remote sensing and in situ observations. We will also use the same simulation setups to evaluate and compare the response of the single column model version of the GISS climate model (with two-moment microphysics).",

However, there is a limited understanding of contaminant transport and treatment in fen peatlands, particularly in sub-arctic Canada. To better characterize wastewater contaminant transport and treatment in these systems, approximately 44 m3 day-1 of simulated wastewater, concentrated custom-blend fertilizer (NO3-, PO33-, and SO42-) and Cl- diluted with water, was pumped into a small 0.5 ha sub-arctic ribbed fen continuously for 47 days (July 15th –August 31st 2014). Contaminant concentration of 3 similar ribbed fens varied between 0.0-3.0 mg L-1 over the study period (May – September 2014). An exponential increase in transmissivity (2.4 to 16.8 m2 day-1) as the water table rose (~0.16 m) increased the average linear groundwater velocity (0.5 to 3.4 m day-1) and resulted in rapid SO42- (0.8 m day-1) and Cl- (1.9 m day-1) transport. Notwithstanding the rapid transport of Cl-, diffusion into inactive pores still retarded Cl- transport by a factor of 1.8. Contrary to the rapid transport of SO42- and Cl-, the other contaminants were rapidly removed from the pore water (likely through biological uptake or adsorption) and minimal transport was observed (0.29 and 0.04 m day-1 for PO33- and NO3-, respectively). Northern ribbed fens have a large capacity to detain certain wastewater contaminants (e.g., NO3- and PO33-), yet allow rapid transport of others (e.g., SO42- and Cl-). Thus, these peatlands have the potential to significantly decrease wastewater contamination in northern aquatic environment by both biogeochemical and physical processes but careful management of the hydrology is required to prevent the release of mobile contaminants.",

            "abstract": "Changes in glacier velocity, thickness, and terminus position have been used to infer the dynamic response of tidewater glaciers to environmental perturbations, yet few analyses have attempted to quantify the associated variations in the glacier force balance. Where repeat high-resolution ice thickness and velocity estimates are available, force balance time series can be constructed to investigate the redistribution of driving and resistive forces associated with changes in terminus position. Comparative force balance analyses may, therefore, help us understand the variable dynamic response observed for glaciers in close proximity to each other.\nHere we construct force balance time series for Helheim Glacier, SE Greenland, and Columbia Glacier, SE Alaska, to investigate differences in dynamic sensitivity to terminus position change. The analysis relies on in situ and remotely sensed observations of ice thickness, velocity, and terminus position. Ice thickness time series are obtained from stereo satellite image-derived surface elevation and continuity-derived bed elevations that are constrained by airborne radar observations. Surface velocity time series are obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations. Approximately daily terminus positions are from a combination of satellite images and terrestrial time-lapse photographs. Helheim and Columbia glaciers are two of the best-studied Arctic tidewater glaciers with comprehensive high-resolution observational time series, yet we find that bed elevation uncertainties and poorly-constrained stress-coupling length estimates still hinder the analysis of spatial and temporal force balance variations. Here we use a new observationally-based method to estimate the stress-coupling length which successfully reduces noise in the derived force balance but preserves spatial variations that can be over-smoothed when estimating the stress-coupling length as a scalar function of the ice thickness. Further, we show that while systematic uncertainty in bed elevations will bias force balance estimates for each individual observational epoch (i.e., snapshot estimates), its effect mostly cancels when calculating force balance anomalies and does not prevent the analysis of dynamic change.",

Ambient and triggered tectonic tremor can be useful in the estimation of friction and stress parameters at large crustal depths. Seismic waves can trigger tremor in tectonic environments, specifically in the San Andreas Fault. A large number of ambient and triggered tremors have been reported near the creeping to locking transition zone along the Parkfield-Cholame section of the San Andreas Fault as well as in the San Jacinto and Calaveras Faults, both triggered by the 2002 Denali Fault earthquake. Ambient and triggered tremor along California is well located and documents well due to the large number of seismic stations in the region. We use recorded seismic signal from magnitude > 7.5 earthquakes to calculate the dynamic stresses capable to trigger tremor in these regions; this is integrated with local tectonic stress models with the objective to estimate the spatial variability of frictional and stress parameters along the areas where tremor are triggered. Integrating static and dynamic stress for San Andreas Fault will allow us to better understand the stress and frictional conditions necessary for tremor occurrence.",

            "abstract": "Assessing changes in vegetation is increasingly important for conservation planning in the face of climate change. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are important tools for assessing such changes. DGVMs have been applied at regional scales to create projections of range expansions and contractions of plant functional types. Many DGVMs use a number of algorithms to determine the biogeography of plant functional types. One such DGVM, MC2, uses a series of decision trees based on bioclimatic thresholds while others, such as LPJ, use constraining emergent properties with a limited set of bioclimatic threshold-based rules. Although both approaches have been used widely, we demonstrate that these biogeography outputs perform poorly at continental scales when compared to existing potential vegetation maps. Specifically, we found that with MC2, the algorithm for determining leaf physiognomy is too simplistic to capture arid and semi-arid vegetation in much of the western U.S., as well as is the algorithm for determining the broadleaf and needleleaf mix in the Southeast. With LPJ, we found that the bioclimatic thresholds used to allow seedling establishment are too broad and fail to capture regional-scale biogeography of the plant functional types. In response, we demonstrate a new approach to determining the biogeography of plant functional types by integrating the climatic thresholds produced for individual tree species by a series of climate envelope models with the biogeography algorithms of MC2 and LPJ. Using this approach, we find that MC2 and LPJ perform considerably better when compared to potential vegetation maps.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice undergoes a seasonal evolution from cold snow-covered ice to melting snow to bare ice with melt ponds. Associated with this physical evolution is a decrease in the albedo of the ice cover. While the change in albedo is often considered as a steady seasonal decrease, weather events during melt, such as rain or snow, can impact the albedo evolution. Measurements on first year ice in the Chukchi Sea showed a decrease in visible albedo to 0.77 during the onset of melt. New snow from 4 – 6 June halted melting and increased the visible albedo to 0.87. It took 12 days for the albedo to decrease to levels prior to the snowfall. Incident solar radiation is large in June and thus a change in albedo has a large impact on the surface heat budget. The snowfall increased the albedo by 0.1 and reduced the absorbed sunlight from 5 June to 17 June by approximately 32 MJ m-2. The total impact of the snowfall will be even greater, since the delay in albedo reduction will be propagated throughout the entire summer. A rain event would have the opposite impact, increasing solar heat input and accelerating melting. Snow or rain in May or June can impact the summer melt cycle of Arctic sea ice.",

The first phase applied a surface warming of 2K for each of three cloud regimes: coastal stratus, decoupled stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus. The regimes cover the transition from overcast conditions near subtropical west coasts to the broken, fair-weather trade-wind conditions through the subtropical stratocumulus decks. The LES results generally support a positive cloud feedback in cumulus and stratocumulus conditions and negative feedback for coastal stratus. The SCMs, on the other hand, showed both positive and negative responses in all regimes, controlled by subtle balances among processes within each model's parameterized physics. Here we present the SCM results from the second phase of CGILS, which investigates the cloud response to a change in atmospheric carbon dioxide (in the absence of surface warming) as a parallel to similar experiments with global models in CMIP5. The LES results have been previously reported, and are largely consistent across models, showing a lower inversion and less cloud in all regimes. In the SCMs, a robust decrease in cloud cover is found for the coastal stratus regime, in agreement with the LES results. As was the case for the warming experiments, however, the SCMs show more diversity than the LES in the other regimes, exhibiting both positive and negative cloud responses. We present these results along with additional sensitivity experiments with the SCMs that remove cloud radiative effects or turn off parameterized convection help to understand the mechanisms controlling the different cloud responses.",

From my personal and professional experience engaging with both groups, I find there is much common ground for increasing understanding and communicating the societal relevance of earth science. Fruitful discussions can arise from shared values and principles, and common approaches to understanding the world. For example, scientists and Christians are engaged in the pursuit of truth, and they value moral/ethical decision-making based on established principles. Scientists emphasize the benefits of research “for the common good” while Christians emphasize the value of doing “good works”. Both groups maintain a longterm perspective: Christians talk about “the eternal” and geologists discuss “deep time”. Both groups understand the importance of placing new observations in context of prior understanding: scientists diligently reference “the literature” while Christians quote “chapter and verse”. And members of each group engage with each other in “fellowship” or “meetings” to create a sense of community and reinforce shared values. From my perspective, earth scientists can learn to communicate the importance and relevance of science more effectively by engaging with Christians in areas of common ground, rather than by trying to win arguments or debates.",

Lunar calibration has been successfully applied to many imagers in orbit, including both MODIS instruments and NPP-VIIRS, using the USGS ROLO model to predict the reference exoatmospheric lunar irradiance. Sensor response trending was developed for SeaWIFS with a relative accuracy better than 0.1 % per year with lunar calibration techniques. However, the Moon rarely is used as an absolute reference for on-orbit calibration, primarily due to uncertainties in the ROLO model absolute scale of 5%-10%. But this limitation lies only with the models - the Moon itself is radiometrically stable, and development of a high-accuracy absolute lunar reference is inherently feasible. A program has been undertaken by NIST to collect absolute measurements of the lunar spectral irradiance with absolute accuracy <1 % (k=2), traceable to SI radiometric units. Initial Moon observations were acquired from the Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, elevation 2367 meters, with continuous spectral coverage from 380 nm to 1040 nm at ~3 nm resolution. The lunar spectrometer acquired calibration measurements several times each observing night by pointing to a calibrated integrating sphere source. The lunar spectral irradiance at the top of the atmosphere was derived from a time series of ground-based measurements by a Langley analysis that incorporated measured atmospheric conditions and ROLO model predictions for the change in irradiance resulting from the changing Sun-Moon-Observer geometry throughout each night. Two nights were selected for further study. An extensive error analysis, which includes instrument calibration and atmospheric correction terms, shows a combined standard uncertainty under 1 % over most of the spectral range. Comparison of these two nights' spectral irradiance measurements with predictions from the ROLO model shows wavelength-dependent differences of up to several percent. We will report on these ongoing measurement and comparison efforts.",

This variability offers a unique opportunity to link our understanding of tectonic and terrestrial processes with climate and oceanography. With the exception the westernmost Site U1454, all sites show a several meter thick, hemipelagic top layer, usually representing Late Quaternary sediment. We present physical, geochemical and stable isotopic properties of this interval to establish a time frame and assess the paleoceanographic development of the region during the last glacial cycle. We sampled Site U1452C-1H continuously for the uppermost 480 cm of hemipelagic sediment in 2-cm increments.\nPreliminary results indicate the Toba Ash 1 (0.74 ka) is a distinct time marker in all physical properties. Furthermore, wet-bulk density as well as color reflectance b* (the red-green component) and L* (the lightness) show a dominant precession cyclicity. Hence, we are able to provide an insolation-tuned chronology for the last 200 ka (MIS1 – 7) as a preliminary age model. These records agree well with d18O records retrieved from Chinese caves.\nWe will present a preliminary paleoceanographic proxy data to reconstruct sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), ice volume, marine biological productivity, nutrient supply, and deep-water circulation. These oceanographic and climate conditions are linked to changes in monsoonal strength and terrestrial input using sedimentary proxies to reconstruct chemical weathering and sediment sources and transport time.

Currently, the processes operating at these scales are difficult to identify and characterize, but are crucial for enabling magnetic fields to reconnect. However, the recently launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is specifically designed to investigate these electron scale processes. We use MMS data to investigate the type of electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities present in the diffusion region and separatrices of asymmetric reconnection at the magnetopause. The waves are characterized using polarization analyses and interferometry techniques. Of particular interest are whistler waves and electrostatic solitary waves, which have a large range of observed properties. We investigate the generation mechanisms of the waves as well as their role in plasma heating and anomalous resistivity, using high time resolution wave and particle measurements.",

            "abstract": "High latitude continents have warmed much more rapidly in recent decades than the rest of the globe, especially in winter, and the maintenance of warm, frost-free conditions in continental interiors in winter has been a long-standing problem of past equable climates. It has also been found that the high-latitude lapse rate feedback plays an important role in Arctic amplification of climate change in climate model simulations, but we have little understanding of why lapse rates at high latitudes change so strongly with warming. To better understand these problems, we study Arctic air formation – the process by which a high-latitude maritime air mass is advected over a continent during polar night, cooled at the surface by radiation, and transformed into a much colder continental polar air mass – and its sensitivity to climate warming. We use a single-column version of the WRF model to conduct two-week simulations of the cooling process across a wide range of initial temperature profiles and microphysics schemes, and find that a low cloud feedback suppresses Arctic air formation in warmer climates. This cloud feedback consists of an increase in low cloud amount with warming, which shields the surface from radiative cooling, and increases the continental surface air temperature by roughly two degrees for each degree increase of the initial maritime surface air temperature. The time it takes for the surface air temperature to drop below freezing increases nonlinearly to ~10 days for initial maritime surface air temperatures of 20 oC. Given that this is about the time it takes an air mass starting over the Pacific to traverse the north American continent, this suggests that optically thick stratus cloud decks could help to maintain frost-free winter continental interiors in equable climates. We find that CMIP5 climate model runs show large increases in cloud water path and surface cloud longwave forcing in warmer climates, consistent with the proposed low-cloud feedback. The suppression of Arctic air formation with warming may act as a significant amplifier of climate change at high latitudes, and offers a mechanistic perspective on the high-latitude \"lapse rate feedback\" diagnosed in climate models.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice forms a permeable boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere, mediating chemical, physical, and transport processes that can have large impacts on a changing climate. It is a complex media composed of ice, brine, air pockets, and salt precipitates whose fine microstructure is constantly evolving with time and temperature. To gain insight of the processes occurring within the sea ice, it is key to have an understanding of how the different phases interact. Using synchrotron x-ray micro-fluorescence (XRF) at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source (APS), we examined the microstructural location of different salts and metals in Antarctic sea ice. In particular, we sought to determine whether these elements are found solely in brine channels and at grain boundaries or exist ubiquitously throughout the crystal lattice of ice. Further, we also investigated the spatial distribution of each impurity to determine how microstructure may vary within the sea ice column.\nAlthough it is well known that salts are expelled from the ice matrix during the freezing process and the bulk of impurities lies in brine inclusions and channels, providing quantitative and visual evidence with high resolution remains an ongoing process. XRF enables us to detect and map the precise microstructural and stratigraphic location of the constituent salts in sea ice. Cores were cut into 0.5 cm-thick slices every ten cm along the length of the core. At APS, a 2 mm x 2 mm region of each sample was scanned by an 18 kV X-ray beam and the resulting fluorescence signal detected using a silicon drift detector. By integrating the detected signal for the respective characteristic energy, we were able to obtain two-dimensional elemental maps with ten micron resolution for bromide, chloride, potassium, calcium, strontium, iron, copper, and zinc. Maps were compared to thin sections obtained under cross-polarizing lenses to identify particular features. We were able to show that salts exist exclusively at grain boundaries and in brine channels/layers. In addition, we were able to quantify the detected signal for bromide and found it to be up to thirty times the bulk concentration. By increasing our knowledge of the brine network microstructure, we yield a better understanding of the transport of heat, gases, and chemical species through sea ice.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural fields in Vermont's Lake Champlain Basin have problems with the loss of nutrients due to runoff which creates eutrophic conditions in the lakes, ponds and rivers. In efforts to retain nitrogen and other nutrients in the soil farmers have started to inject manure rather than spraying it. Our understanding of the effects this might have on the volatilization of nitrogen into nitrous oxide is limited. Already, agriculture produces 69% of the total nitrous oxide emissions in the US.\nUnderstanding that climate change will affect the future of agriculture in Vermont, we set up a soil core incubation test to monitor the emissions of CO₂ and N₂O using a Photoacoustic Gas Sensor (PAS). Four 10 cm soil cores were taken from nine different fertilizer management plots in a No Till corn field; Three Injected plots, three Broadcast plots, and three Plow plots. Frozen soil cores were extracted in early April, and remained frozen before beginning the incubation experiment to most closely emulate three potential spring environmental conditions. The headspace was monitored over one week to get emission rates.\n\nThis study shows that environmental and fertilizer treatments together do not have a direct correlation to the amount of CO₂ and N₂O emissions from agricultural soil. However, production of CO₂ was 26% more in warmer environmental conditions than in variable(freeze/thaw) environmental conditions. The injected fertilizer produced the most emissions, both CO₂ and N₂O. The total N₂O emissions from Injected soil cores were 2.2x more than from traditional broadcast manure cores. We believe this is likely due to the addition of rich organic matter under anaerobic soil conditions. Although, injected fertilizer is a better application method for reducing nutrient runoff, the global warming potential of N₂O is 298 times that of CO₂. With climate change imminent, assessing the harmful effects and benefits of injected fertilizer is a crucial next step in agricultural management.",

Existing popular drought indices—such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index that informs much of the US Drought Monitor (USDM)—have primarily relyied on precipitation and temperature (T) to represent hydroclimatic anomalies, leaving evaporative demand (E0) most often derived from poorly performing T-based parameterizations then used to derive actual evapotranspiration (ET) from LSMs.\nInstead, EDDI leverages the inter-relations of E0 and ET, measuring E0’s physical response to surface drying anomalies due to two distinct land surface/atmosphere interactions: (i) in sustained drought, limited moisture availability forces E0 and ET into a complementary relation, whereby ET declines as E0 increases; and (ii) in “flash” droughts, E0 increases due to increasing advection or radiation. E0's rise in response to both drought types suggests EDDI’s robustness as a monitor and leading indicator of drought.\nTo drive EDDI, we use for E0 daily reference ET from the ASCE Standardized ",

            "abstract": "Internal gravity waves in the ocean are primarily generated due to tidal flow over topography that generates internal tides, or internal waves of tidal frequency. As they propagate, internal tides steepen into trains of internal solitary waves that eventually break upon interacting with shallow coastal topography. Modeling internal solitary waves is difficult because they have length scales that are short relative to the internal tide, and so many grid points in three dimensions are needed to accurately resolve their evolution. Because internal solitary waves arise from a balance between nonlinear advection of momentum and nonhydrostatic dispersion, they must be simulated with nonhydrostatic ocean models. Such models are expensive because computation of the nonhydrostatic pressure requires solution of a three-dimensional Poisson equation that can incur an order of magnitude increase in the computational cost. Finally, because internal solitary waves can propagate over long distances with little to no dissipation or mixing of the thermocline upon which they propagate, the numerical model must minimize spurious vertical numerical diffusion of the density field.\nWe will discuss development of a new ocean model designed to accurately simulate internal solitary waves. Horizontally unstructured, finite-volume grids are employed to enable resolution of the multiscale nature of internal solitary waves by refining the grid where they are likely to form. To resolve the nonlinear-nonhydrostatic balance in the waves, the model computes the nonhydrostatic pressure, but with a preconditioner that ensures minimal overhead where the nonhydrotatic pressure is not needed. Finally, to minimize spurious numerical diffusion, we employ an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE), or hybrid, vertical coordinate system in which the vertical direction is discretized with boundary-following (sigma or s), Cartesian (z), or density-following (isopycnal) coordinates. Because isopycnal coordinates follow lines of constant density, they ensure no spurious vertical numerical diffusion of density. We will discuss numerical discretization issues and present test cases that highlight the unique features of the model.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, is widespread in the Arctic and contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere in the form of frozen organic matter. This carbon may be vulnerable to thaw and release to the atmosphere as methane under a warming climate, making permafrost thaw one of the potentially most significant amplifying feedbacks to anthropogenic warming. Nonetheless, permafrost can be slow to respond to warming, the short instrumental record may not adequately capture long-term trends, and the modest temperature changes of the past few millennia provide poor analogues to understand the possibility of crossing climate thresholds in the next century or beyond. One way to address this problem is to assess the stability of permafrost during previous interglacial periods of varying levels of warmth, which provide natural experiments to examine the Arctic’s sensitivity to warming.\nCave speleothems in the Arctic are relics of past periods of thaw that enabled meteoric water to seep into caves and deposit calcite. We employed uranium-thorium (U-Th) dating to constrain the chronology and extent of permafrost thaw in the North American Arctic during the past 600,000 years. We sampled caves from a range of permafrost zones and latitudes, including the Fishing Branch Territorial Park, Yukon (66.5°N, continuous permafrost), White Mountains National Recreation Area, Alaska (65°N, discontinuous permafrost), Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Alaska (64.5°N, discontinuous permafrost), and Nahanni National Park Reserve, Northwest Territories (62°N, discontinuous permafrost). Thirty-five samples from 30 speleothems have been analyzed at this point, with 23 samples lying beyond the U-Th dating range, and finite ages tending to cluster near Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11) within uncertainty, as well as perhaps MIS 9, 13, and 15. This preliminary dataset, coupled with a similar study in Siberia (Vaks et al., 2013), is thus suggestive of an episode of widespread thaw during the MIS 11 interglacial about 400,000 years ago when global temperature was only ~1°C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. We anticipate dating more speleothems in the months prior to AGU, and exploring the use of U-Pb for older samples.",

            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the rapid increase in data availability and computational power significantly increased the number of data and model parameters that can be investigated in seismic tomography problems. Often, the model space consists of 105-106 unknown parameters and there are comparable numbers of observations, making direct computational methods such as the singular value decomposition prohibitively expensive or impossible, leaving iterative solvers as the only alternative option. Among the disadvantages of the iterative algorithms is that the inverse of the matrix that defines the system is not explicitly formed. As a consequence, the model resolution and covariance matrices, that are crucial for the quantitative assessment of the uncertainty of the tomographic models, cannot be computed. Despite efforts in finding computationally affordable approximations of these matrices, challenges remain, and approaches such as the checkerboard resolution tests continue to be used. Based upon recent developments in sparse algorithms and high performance computing resources, we demonstrate that direct methods are becoming feasible for large seismic tomography problems, and apply the technique to obtain a regional P-wave tomography model and its full resolution matrix with 267,520 parameters. Furthermore, we show that the structural analysis of the forward operators of the seismic tomography problems can provide insights into the inverse problem, and allows us to determine and exploit approximations that yield accurate solutions.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of paleoclimate reconstructions rely on the isotopic variability of precipitation or seawater as a proxy for past hydrological variability, even though modern-day water isotope variability is poorly constrained by observations. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the tropical Pacific, where paleo-water isotope reconstructions imply that anthropogenic climate change has driven dramatic shifts in the isotopic composition of surface waters (Nurhati et al., 2009), yet water isotope observations in this region are virtually non-existent. Here we present a new set of weekly seawater and daily precipitation isotope observations along a meridional gradient in the tropical Pacific, spanning from Hawaii (21N, 158W) to Palmyra Island (6N, 162W) to Christmas Island (2N, 157W), that spans the development and growth of the current ENSO cycle that began in 2014. We use a suite of high-quality in situ observations of ocean conditions (salinity, temperature) as well as surface meteorological measurements (relative humidity, precipitation amount, wind speed and direction) to provide an interpretive framework for the observed isotopic variations, with a focus on the expression of seasonal to interannual features in the dataset. A complementary dataset of precipitation and seawater isotopes from across the equator in the tropical Pacific basin provides additional diagnostic context. We also compare our observed isotopic variations to output from numerical simulations of precipitation and seawater isotopes in the tropical Pacific. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of long-term monitoring programs in the tropical Pacific, as well as the interpretation of proxy-based reconstructions of seawater and precipitation water isotopes.",

The fundation of this flexible regional-global modeling system is the non-hydrostatic extension of the vertically Lagrangian dynamical core (Lin 2004, Monthly Weather Review) known in the community as FV3 (finite-volume on the cubed-sphere). Because of its flexability and computational efficiency, the FV3 is one of the final candidates of NOAA's Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS). We have built into the modeling system a stretched (single) grid capability, a two-way (regional-global) multiple nested grid capability, and the combination of the stretched and two-way nests, so as to make convection-resolving regional climate simulation within a consistent global modeling system feasible using today's High Performance Computing System.\nOne of our main scientific goals is to enable simulations of high impact weather phenomena (such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, category-5 hurricanes) within an IPCC-class climate modeling system previously regarded as impossible. In this presentation I will demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to simulate not only super-cell thunderstorms, but also the subsequent genesis of tornadoes using a global model that was originally designed for century long climate simulations. As a unified weather-climate modeling system, we evaluated the performance of the model with horizontal resolution ranging from 1 km to as low as 200 km. In particular, for downscaling studies, we have developed various tests to ensure that the large-scale circulation within the global varaible resolution system is well simulated while at the same time the small-scale can be accurately captured within the targeted high resolution region.",

As a result, any tidal heating in these bodies will occur as a result of finite obliquity. While Pluto and Charon’s obliquities have yet to be measured, theoretical models assuming the spin poles of the bodies are in Cassini states predict observable obliquity values.\nWe present a new tidal heating model for synchronously rotating bodies. As a major result of this formulation, we show how tidal heating is quadratically dependent on the h and l Love numbers, in contrast with classic models which assume homogeneous interior structure and find a linear dependence on the k Love number. Furthermore, we show how the spatial patterns of tidal heating depend on obliquity as well as eccentricity.\nBy applying theoretical predictions of Pluto and Charon’s spin pole orientations we examine the radially integrated spatial pattern of tidal heating at these bodies. At degree two, these patterns on Pluto predict equal heating at the sub- and anti-Charon points. Recent observations, however, show a clear dichotomy at these locations. Degree three tidal heating patterns, though reduced in magnitude, break the spatial symmetry and represent a positive indicator that tidal heating is active at Pluto and may be a source of the geologic activity at Tombaugh Regio.",

In particular, absolutely-dated speleothems from across the tropics have documented systematic shifts in convective activity that occured in response to abrupt climate change and orbital forcing over the last several glacial-interglacial cycles. In Northern Borneo, overlapping decadally- to centennially-resolved stalagmite oxygen isotopic (d18O) records spanning the last 500,000 years reveal that regional convective activity in this region is dominated by fall precessional insolation forcing, with a significant contribution from abrupt climate change events whose signature is particularly pronounced immediately preceding glacial terminations (Partin et al., 2007; Meckler et al., 2012; Carolin et al., 2013; Carolin et al., in prep). High-resolution (sub-annual) oxygen isotope sampling of select intervals of the Holocene reveals that interannual variability is most reduced at ~5.2kybp, with relatively higher variance observed in the early and late Holocene (Chen et al., in prep). The fact that boreal fall insolation at the equator peaks at ~5kybp during the Holocene implies that the strong fall insolation signal in the longer Borneo stalagmite records may reflect the modulation of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by fall insolation, given the sensitivity of modern-day rainfall and dripwater d18O to ENSO variability (Moerman et al., 2013; Moerman et al., 2014).",

As for all NASA missions, Children and teenagers will be associated to the mission in the framework of the K12 InSight program, part of it being associated to the SEIS instrument.\nThe two faces of the InSight/SEIS Education program are directed toward the promotion of Space Technologies and of Space Science.\nFor Space technologies, this has already started with the InSight Elysium Educational project. The goal of the project, supported by CNES and performed by Technical High School near Toulouse, was the fabrication of a full scale mockup of the lander (see more at https://jeunes.cnes.fr/fr/elysium-le-jumeau-terrestre-dinsight ). The mockup was exhibited during the June, 2015 Paris air show. More than 300 students participated to the Elysium project.\nFor Space Science, this will be made with the SEIS@Mars Educational project. Its plan is to transmit the SEIS data to a network of several hundred of middle and high schools worldwide, associated to existing “seismo(graph) at school” programs in the United States (https://www.iris.edu/hq/sis), France (www.edusismo.org) Switzerland (www.seismoatschool.ethz.ch) and United Kingdom (http://www.bgs.ac.uk/schoolseismology/). If the transmission of these data to the SEIS@school network will be automatic after their release by the NASA Planetary Data System, an earlier transmission will be made, especially after mid 2017, but also before through the integration of selected Schools to the project activities: the selected classrooms will perform the same activities as the project scientists. They will have to process rapidly the proprietary data in order to identify MarsQuake(s) and will be allowed to perform Event requests to the lander in order to get the associated high frequencies of these events. These school will therefore be fully associated to the InSight/SEIS discoveries. The SEIS@Mars project will therefore allow the students to perform scientific analysis almost at the same time as the International \"professional\" seismologists.",

For such an analysis, however, real landscape observations are limited. To this end, a series of controlled laboratory experiments on evolving landscape were conducted at the St. Anthony Falls laboratory at the University of Minnesota. High resolution elevation data at a temporal resolution of 5 mins and spatial resolution of 0.5 mm were collected as the landscape approached steady state (constant uplift and precipitation rate) and in the transient state (under the same uplift and 5 times precipitation rate). Our results reveal rapid topographic re-organization under a five-fold increase in precipitation with the fluvial regime encroaching into the previously debris dominated regime, widening and aggradation of channels and valleys, and accelerated erosion happening at hillslope scales. To better understand the initiation of the observed reorganization, we perform a connectivity and clustering analysis of the erosional and depositional events, showing strikingly different spatial patterns on landscape evolution under steady-state (SS) and transient-state (TS), even when the time under SS is renormalized to match the total volume of eroded and deposited sediment in TS. Our results suggest a regime shift in the behavior of transport processes on the landscape at the intermediate scales i.e., from supply-limited to transport-limited.",

The northern GOM is the northernmost summer extent of the western hemisphere warm pool (WHWP) that drives oceanic moisture flux and precipitation into the Americas. Decadally-resolved foraminifera reconstructions from the northern GOM indicates SST was 2 to 4ºC colder on average than today during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ~1850), whereas a subannually-resolved coral reconstruction from the southeastern GOM find 1.5 to 2ºC colder intervals and reduced areal extent of the WHWP on interannual time scales during some intervals of the LIA. However, records capable of resolving annual and subannual SST variability from the northern GOM, necessary for investigating WHWP northern extent, are still lacking. Here we present a new temperature reconstruction for the northern GOM derived from strontium-to-calcium (Sr/Ca) ratios of approximately monthly samples milled from a Siderastrea siderea coral core collected from the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS; 27° 52.5’N, 93° 49’W) growing at a water depth of 20 m. Coral Sr/Ca is calibrated to reef temperature data from FGBNMS Hobotemp data loggers near the reef cap in ~22 m water depth (1986–2004) and to NOAA OISST (1981–2004), which co-varies with the reef temperature (r=0.95, p<0.05, n=146) and consistently captures winter values in reef temperature with slightly warmer summers (0.9ºC on average). The Sr/Ca-SST calibration slope (–0.043, r=–0.89, n=136, p<0.01 for reef temperature; –0.039, r=–0.94, n=275, p<0.01 for OISST) agrees well with published coral Sr/Ca-SST calibrations for S. siderea in the southeastern GOM from shallower water depths.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and their partners developed and demonstrated the effectiveness and value of space-based lightning observations as a remote sensing tool for Earth science research and applications, and, in the process, established a robust global lightning climatology. The observations included measurements from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) that acquired global observations of total lightning (i.e., intracloud and cloud-to-ground discharges) from November 1997 to April 2015 between 38° N/S latitudes, and its Optical Transient Detector predecessor that acquired observation from May 1995 to April 2000 over 75° N/S latitudes. In February 2016, as an exciting follow-on to these prior missions, a space-qualified LIS built as a flight-spare for TRMM will be delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) for a 2 year or longer mission, flown as a hosted payload on the Department of Defense Space Test Program-Houston 5 (STP-H5) mission. The LIS on ISS will continue observations of the amount, rate, and radiant energy of total lightning over the Earth. More specifically, LIS measures lightning during both day and night, with storm scale resolution (~4 km), millisecond timing, and high, uniform detection efficiency, without any land-ocean bias. Lightning is a direct and most impressive response to intense atmospheric convection. ISS LIS lightning observations will continue to provide important gap-filling inputs to pressing Earth system science issues across a broad range of disciplines. This mission will also extend TRMM time series observations, expand the latitudinal coverage to 54° latitude, provide real-time lightning data to operational users, espically over data sparse oceanic regions, and enable cross-sensor observations and calibrations that includes the new GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and the Meteosat Third Generation Lightning Imager (MTG LI). The ISS platform will also uniquely enable LIS to provide simultaneous and complementary observations with other ISS payloads such as the European Space Agency’s Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM) exploring the connection between lightning and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs).",

            "abstract": "Maize is the most important food staple in sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change and rainfall variability pose great risks on maize production in this region. Intra-seasonal adaptive management combined with more skillful weather forecasts has the potential to improve the resilience of agricultural systems. Our aim is to understand the extent to which within-season agricultural management decisions can mitigate weather risks to maize production, and the degree to which this mitigation varies as a function of when the decision is made and the trajectory of weather. Using Zambia as a test case, we conducted crop-modeling experiments to determine which crop and water management decisions (typical of smallholder farmers) are most effective in mitigating rainfall-driven yield reductions under three precipitation scenarios (below normal, normal, and above normal). Yields were simulated using the DSSAT CERES-Maize model driven by an ensemble of historical weather data. Potential maize yields under different management options were simulated from different forecast points during the growing season, starting at planting and then in successive two-week intervals through the grain-filling period. The yield distributions were constructed as a function of the weather conditions and the management options, with results indicating which decision options provide the most mitigation in relation to a) the particular point in the growing season at which they are made, and b) the potential rainfall scenario. This study will help to understand how smallholder farmers in semi-arid systems may increase their resilience to highly variable weather by using typical within-season management options, and which decisions are most robust to forecast uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "We report on recent diagnostic (constrained by observations) model simulations of atmospheric CO2 flux and transport using a newly developed facility in the NASA Unified-Weather Research and Forecast (NU-WRF) model. The results are compared to CO2 data (ground-based, airborne, and GOSAT) and to corresponding simulations from a global model that uses meteorology from the NASA GEOS-5 Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). The objective of these intercomparisons is to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the respective models in pursuit of an overall carbon process improvement at both regional and global scales. Our guiding hypothesis is that the finer resolution and improved land surface representation in NU-WRF will lead to better comparisons with CO2 data than those using global MERRA, which will, in turn, inform process model development in global prognostic models. Initial intercomparison results, however, have generally been mixed: NU-WRF is better at some sites and times but not uniformly. We are examining the model transport processes in detail to diagnose differences in the CO2 behavior. These comparisons are done in the context of a long history of simulations from the Parameterized Chemistry and Transport Model, based on GEOS-5 meteorology and Carnegie Ames-Stanford Approach-Global Fire Emissions Database (CASA-GFED) fluxes, that capture much of the CO2 variation from synoptic to seasonal to global scales. We have run the NU-WRF model using unconstrained, internally generated meteorology within the North American domain, and with meteorological ‘nudging’ from Global Forecast System and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) in an effort to optimize the CO2 simulations. Output results constrained by NARR show the best comparisons to data. Discrepancies, of course, may arise either from flux or transport errors and compensating errors are possible. Resolving their interplay is also important to using the data in inverse models. Recent analysis is focused on planetary boundary depth, which can be significantly different between MERRA and NU-WRF, along with subgrid transport differences. Characterization of transport differences between the models will allow us to better constrain the CO2 fluxes, which is the major objective of this work.",

            "abstract": "The 11 April 2012 M8.6 Sumatran earthquake off the northwestern coast of Sumatra is the largest recorded strike-slip earthquake and is thought to be associated with complex oblique subduction of the Sumatra subduction system. The 2012 M8.6 earthquake was predominantly a right-lateral strike-slip earthquake within the subducting Indo-Australian oceanic plate and the mainshock consisted of two noticeable subevents: Subevent 1 had its strike roughly in the northeast direction and the northern end of its seismicity zone approached the Sumatra trench; Subevent 2 was located at the southern end of Subevent 1, had a strike roughly in the northeast direction, and its seismicity zone extended westward reaching the Ninetyeast Ridge. In this study we investigate the co-seismic and post-seismic stress interaction between the 2012 M8.6 Sumatran strike-slip quake and the 2004 M9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake on the Sumatra subduction zone. We first calculated co-seismic coulomb stress change on the rupture planes of the 2012 earthquake caused by the 2004 M9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. The calculated Coulomb stress increase is largest (~9 bar) on the northern end of the rupture plane of the 2012 Subevent 1 approaching the the Sumatra subduction zone. The calculated Coulomb stress was positive on most of the Subevent 1 rupture plane but with values decreasing significantly towards the southwestern end of the rupture zone. The rupture plane of Subevent 2 is roughly parallel to the Sumatra subduction zone; the 2004 M9.2 earthquake was calculated to have decreased confining normal stresses on much of the rupture plane of Subevent 2. We also modeled the oblique subduction of the Sumatra subduction system and calculated time-dependent post-seismic viscoelastic stress transfer after the 2004 M9.2 quake. Overall, the modeling results suggest multiple-scales of stress interaction between the 2012 M8.6 Sumatran earthquake and the 2004 M9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in a complex oblique subduction system.",

Laguna Cerritos Blancos (LCB), the lake cored, is located at approximately 30° S latitude and 3844 m asl. This lake is fed by a stream that cut through a terminal moraine and is damned by an older moraine/rock glacier complex. This site sits at the boundary between important circulation features of the southern hemisphere, including the Southeast Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone and the Westerly winds. Any major movements of these circulation features should be reflected in the climate record of the study area (Garreaud, 2009). The Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) recorded in the sediments exhibits demagnetization behavior dominated by a single component of magnetization and shows a paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) signal similar to that of a marine core (ODP Leg 202, Site 1233) from offshore Valparaíso (Lund et al., 2006) suggesting that the 1.5 m of lake record represents the past ~5,000 years. The continuous nature of the PSV record and a lack of sedimentary features, indicating a lack of unconformities, suggests that the current low lake levels are anomalous for the late Holocene. However, gradually decreasing clay percent up section shows a coarsening upward trend suggesting gradual shallowing of the lake over the past ~5,000 yrs. Over this time period LCB has been characterized by stable conditions and gradual shallowing with few disruptions to this trend. These initial paleoclimate hypotheses are currently being tested with the acquisition of additional paleoclimate proxies on these core sediments including C/N ratios, total inorganic carbon, palynology, and additional measurements of sediment magnetism.",

Some of the challenges we currently face, however—including complex questions associated with climate change—present unique challenges because of their scale and scope. Focused research on the intersections between environment and society has provided substantial insight into dynamics of large-scale environmental change and the related impacts on people, natural resources, and ecosystems, yet our ability to connect this research to real-world decision making remains limited. Addressing these complex environmental problems requires broad cooperation between scientists and those who may apply research results in decision making, but there are few templates for guiding the growing number of scientists and practitioners now engaging in this kind of cooperative work. This presentation will offer a set of heuristics for carrying out collaborative work between scientists and practitioners. These heuristics were derived from research that examined the direct experiences of water resources professionals and climate researchers who have been working to integrate science and practice.",

            "abstract": "Mountain ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climatic change, given the reduced potential of species to disperse uphill. Studies have been concentrated at higher latitudes, and relatively little is known about montane vegetation and ecosystem dynamics in tropical mountains. We assessed climatic, latitudinal and altitudinal effects on leafing phenology for the Espinhaço Range, a South American tropical mountain landscape comprised of a mosaic of savannas, grasslands, rock outcrops, cloud forests, and semi-deciduous to deciduous forests. We assessed a time series of 884 MODIS/NDVI images acquired between 2002 and 2015, at 7-day intervals. We classified broad vegetation types based on elevation (SRTM) and the mean and variance of each pixel in the entire series. We then extracted the phenological indicators of start, end and length of the growing season, green-up and brown-down rates, NDVI peak, and integral of the growing curve, using the TIMESAT algorithm. We also obtained precipitation data from the TRMM dataset, and calculated the Topographic Wetness Index and clear-sky radiation budgets based on the SRTM dataset. Our results show that the start of the growing season was noticeably more variable than the end date, suggesting that season length is an important factor for tropical montane vegetation. The start of the growing season decreased linearly with altitude, with vegetation at higher elevations having a later start, while no clear relation was found for the end of season. For montane vegetation above 800m, we observed shorter season lengths. Green-up rates were higher in woody seasonal formations, and became progressively slower with increasing altitudes. Higher green-up rates were also associated with rainfall patterns, where dry seasons are longer. Brown-down rates had the opposite trend, with rapid brown-down at higher altitudes. Our results quantify previously unreported seasonal, latitudinal and altitudinal variations in vegetation phenology for a large tropical mountain range, and emphasize the high variability of phenological responses in the tropics. Understanding this variability is key to assess the impacts imposed by present and future climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic signals such as responses to the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations have been robustly detected in temperature data at global and sub-continental regional scales. Observed changes in several large-scale hydro-climatic quantities such as precipitation and snow cover extent are also attributable to human influence but with somewhat lower confidence. However, the hydrologic impacts of climate change are often most acutely felt at regional and local scales. Detection and attribution studies of regional hydrologic quantities are challenging for a number of reasons including sparse observational records, low signal-to-noise ratios, and additional uncertainties associated with hydrologic modeling. Here, we use the VIC hydrologic model to study stream flow changes over the period 1951-2005 in four river basins in British Columbia with a total area of approximately 420,000 km**2. For each basin, we drive VIC with multiple ensembles of statistically downscaled CMIP5 simulations, including 40 simulations with natural external forcing only (NAT), a further 40 simulations with all anthropogenic and natural forcings combined (ALL) and ~5000 years of preindustrial control simulations. Detection and attribution is separately performed to analyze regional maximum and minimum temperature, normalized snow water equivalent, seasonal river flow changes as well as flow timing. Results show that the anthropogenic signals are detected in minimum temperature, normalized snow water equivalent, and summer runoff. Changes in other hydro-climatic variables are found to be consistent with the responses to ALL forcings but inconsistent with NAT.",

Large volumes of hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected during fracking. Incidents of stray gas occurrence in shallow aquifers overlying shale gas reservoirs have been reported; whether these are in any way related to fracking continues to be debated. Computational models serve as useful tools for evaluating potential environmental impacts. We present modeling studies of hydraulic fracturing fluid and gas migration during the various stages of well operation, production, and subsequent plugging. The fluid migration models account for overpressure in the gas reservoir, density contrast between injected fluids and brine, imbibition into partially saturated shale, and well operations. Our results highlight the importance of representing the different stages of well operation consistently. Most importantly, well suction and imbibition both play a significant role in limiting upward migration of injected fluids, even in the presence of permeable connecting pathways. In an overall assessment, our fluid migration simulations suggest very low risk to groundwater aquifers when the vertical separation from a shale gas reservoir is of the order of 1000' or more. Multi-phase models of gas migration were developed to couple flow and transport in compromised wellbores and subsurface formations. These models are useful for evaluating both short-term and long-term scenarios of stray methane release. We present simulation results to evaluate mechanisms controlling stray gas migration, and explore relationships between bradenhead pressures and the likelihood of methane release and transport.",

            "abstract": "Semi-arid biomes in many parts of the Southwestern U.S. have experienced a range of precipitation over the last decade, ranging from wetter than average years 2006-2010 (relative to the 40-year PRISM mean), extreme drought years (2010-2011) and slightly dry-average precipitation years (2013-2015). While annual carbon uptake in semi-arid biomes of the Southwestern US is relatively low, compared to more temperate ecosystems, collectively these biomes store a significant amount of carbon on a regional scale. It is therefore of great interest to understand what impact this range in precipitation variability has on inter- and intra- annual variability in regional carbon dynamics. We use an 9 year record from 2007-2015 of continuous measurements of net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) and its components (gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re), made across a network of flux towers along an elevation/aridity gradient in New Mexico, the New Mexico Elevation Gradient (NMEG), to quantify biome-specific responses of carbon dynamics to climate variability over this time period. Biomes include a desert grassland, creosote shrubland, juniper savanna, piñon-juniper woodland, and ponderosa pine and subalpine mixed conifer forests. We compared daily, seasonal and annual NEP, GPP and Re means between pre-drought (2007-2010), drought (2011-2012), and post-drought years (2013-2015). All biomes sequestered less carbon in the drought years, compared to the pre-drought years (~30-40, 270 and 60 g C/m2 less in low and middle elevation biomes, ponderosa pine, and mixed conifer forest, respectively), as GPP in all biomes was more sensitive to the drought than Re. In the post-drought years, GPP was still only 80-90% what it was in the pre-drought years. Re, however, in all biomes except for the creosote shrubland, was 5-15% higher in the post-drought years compared to pre-drought. As a result, carbon sequestration in these biomes was 20-75% lower in the post-drought years compared to what we observed before the drought, suggesting, even 3 years post-drought, none of these biomes has recovered from the extreme drought. The large implications of this lack of resilience for the carbon sink strength in this region are discussed.",

Given the large land area occupied by semi-arid biomes in the U.S., the ability to quantify how climate extremes alter ecosystem function, in addition to being able to use satellites to remotely detect when these climate extremes occur, is crucial to scale the impact of these events on regional carbon dynamics. In an effort to understand how well commonly employed remote sensing platforms capture the impact of extreme events on semi-arid biomes, we coupled a 9-year record of eddy-covariance measurements made across an elevation/aridity gradient in NM with remote sensing data sets from tower-based phenocams, MODIS and Landsat 7 ETM+. We compared anomalies in air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation, to the degree in variability of remote sensing vegetation indices (e.g, NDVI, EVI, 2G-Rbi, LST, etc.), and tower-derived gross primary productivity (GPP), across a range of temporal lags to quantify : 1) how sensitive vegetation indices from various platforms, LST, and carbon uptake are to climate disturbances, and the extremity of the disturbance; 2) how well correlated vegetation indices and tower fluxes are on monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, and if the degree to which they are correlated is related to the extent of climate anomalies during that period; and 3) the lags in the response of both GPP and vegetation indices to climate-anomalies and how well correlated these were on various time scales. Our initial results show differential sensitivities across a range of semi-arid ecosystems to drought and vapor pressure deficit. We see the strongest sensitivity of vegetation indices, and correlations between vegetation indices and tower GPP in the low and high elevation biomes that have a more distinct seasonality in ecosystem function than the middle elevation biomes. We discuss the implications of these results for the future of using empirical-based models that use vegetation indices to estimate terrestrial uptake in semi-arid biomes.",

            "abstract": "There are large uncertainties regarding the response of tropical forest carbon cycling to expected global changes over the 21st Century. Whether tropical forests continue to act as large carbon sinks, or shift to become significant carbon sources, plays a major role in determining the rate and intensity of climate change impacts. Most terrestrial models predict a large current tropical forest carbon sink due to the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on plant productivity. Yet the strength of this sink is likely limited by multiple factors, and the magnitudes of these constraints remain in question. As atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, nutrient limitations are likely to become more prominent, yet the current suite of Earth system models (ESMs) have inadequate representations of nutrient constraints on tropical forest productivity. Concurrently, the negative effects of rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns on plant production are expected to become more pronounced, likely driving reductions in tropical forest carbon assimilation and storage. In addition to these carbon-climate feedbacks, human land-use activities in the tropics result in both carbon sources from deforestation, and carbon sinks in secondary forests, both of which are also inadequately represented in ESMs. This talk will focus on recent advances in our understanding of these key carbon cycle processes, and explore several field research activities needed to advance ESM treatment of the underlying mechanisms.",

This capability is an implementation of our Lifting Entry Atmospheric Flight (LEAF) system concept, and the Venus implementation is called the Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform (VAMP). The VAMP concept utilizes an ultra-low ballistic coefficient (< 50 Pa), semi-buoyant aircraft that deploys prior to entering the Venus atmosphere, enters without an aeroshell, and provides a long-lived (months to a year) maneuverable vehicle capable of carrying science instruments to explore the Venus upper atmosphere.\nIn this presentation we provide an update on the air vehicle design and a low cost pathfinder mission concept that can be implemented in the near-term. The presentation also provides an overview of our plans for future trade studies, analyses, and prototyping to advance and refine the concept. We will discuss the air vehicle’s entry concepts of operations (CONOPs) and atmospheric science operations. We will present a strawman concept of a VAMP pathfinder, including ballistic coefficient, planform area, percent buoyancy, wing span, vehicle mass, power supply, propulsion, materials considerations, structural elements, and instruments accommodation. In this context, we will discuss the following key factors impacting the design and performance of VAMP:\nEntry into the Venus atmosphere, including descent profile, heating rate, total heat load, stagnation, and acreage temperatures\nImpact of maximum altitude on air vehicle design and entry heating\nCandidate thermal protection system (TPS) requirements\nWe will discuss the interdependencies of the above factors and the manner in which the VAMP pathfinder concept’s characteristics affect the CONOPs and the science objectives.\nWe will show how the these factors provide constraints as well as enable opportunities for novel long duration scientific studies of the Venus upper atmosphere that support Venus science goals.

            "abstract": "NH3 is an important component of the bio-atmospheric N cycle with implications for regional air quality, human and ecosystem health degradation, and global climate change. However, measuring NH3 flux is challenging, requiring a sensor with high sensitivity (sub-ppbv), fast response time and the capability to account for NH3 adsorption effects. In this study, we address these issues with an open-path quantum-cascade-based sensor for eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Previously, our EC NH3 sensor was deployed over a feedlot in Colorado in 2013 and 2014, and the results showed the potential of the sensor to measure NH3 emissions from agricultural sources. In the summer of 2015, the sensor was installed at a remote monitoring site in Rocky Mountain National Park to measure NH3 flux over a natural grass land. During the deployment, the precision of the sensor was about 0.15 ppbv at 10 Hz, and the detection limit of the flux was estimated to be 0.7±0.5 ng NH3/s/m2. The cospectra of the NH3 flux closely resembled those of CO2 flux and sensible heat flux measured by a LI-7500 CO2 analyzer and a CSAT3 sonic anemometer. The ogive analyses indicated that the loss of NH3 fluxes due to various damping effects was about 15%. Examining initial results from a few days of measurement, the measured NH3 fluxes appear to have a strong diurnal pattern with local emissions during afternoon, a pattern not previously reported for remote grass land. The pattern is consistent with background NH3 concentration measured by PICARRO NH3 analyzer, although summertime afternoon concentration increases at the site have previously been associated with upslope transport from urban and agricultural regions to the east. The results demonstrate the sensor’s capability to measure NH3 flux in low NH3 conditions and also show that more measurements are needed to investigate spatial and temporal variability of NH3 flux.",

Further, understanding and modeling this relationship is over emphasized in arid to semi-arid areas such as the Middle East where limited natural resources have proven record of correlation with conflict (e.g.Kelley et al., 2015). This work reports on the response of a forest stand of Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) from north Jordan to variability in precipitation using instrumental and satellite derived data. The site is located in north Jordan on the transitional zones from forest to steppe of the eastern Mediterranean as classified by the European Forest Genetic Resources Programme (EUFORGEN, 2015). The aim is to model the relationship between annual earlywood, latewood and tree-ring width indices with instrumental data, reanalysis data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the period from 1976-2012 for a possible use of tree-ring widths as vegetation greenness proxy. The highest significant correlation (p< 0.005, α =0.05) is between current year's growth and prior spring precipitation (instrumental and reanalysis) and NDVI. Reanalysis data correlates significantly (p<0.005, α =0.05, r: 0.85) with instrumental data (1976-2012) but is limited by the records’ length. There is definitely a proven correlation between seasonal tree-ring widths and vegetation index that offers the potential for reconstruction of vegetation index if applied at the regional level and could be extrapolated to desert areas that lacks proxy data with annually resolved resolution such as tree-rings.",

            "abstract": "By examining coastal deposits from modern inundation events, a number of criteria have been developed to help distinguish between onshore storm and tsunami deposits. The presence of sedimentary structures such as planar lamination and foreset beds in storm deposits suggest a dominance of bedload transport, although some tsunami deposits also contain these structures. The presence of normally graded beds in many tsunami deposits is indicative of the dominance of suspended load transport. Understanding how the stratigraphy in modern event deposits develops during inundation and post-deposition modification improves our ability to differentiate between tsunami and storm deposits in the geologic record. We investigated Hurricane Sandy washover deposits on Fire Island, NY a year after the storm in order to describe deposit stratigraphy on sandy barrier islands. Stratigraphic descriptions from trenches, bulk sediment samples, and push cores were collected. So far, grain size and microtextural analyses have been performed on bulk sediment samples. Deposits ranged from 1-100 cm thick and consist of very well-sorted, fine to coarse sand. Elevation profiles of washover features were measured using Differential GPS. Comparisons of GPS elevations to Lidar data from pre- and post-Sandy surveys show that at some locations, the upper 10-40 cm of the deposit had been reworked in the year following Hurricane Sandy. However, there were still areas where the deposit was almost entirely intact, consisting of massive sand layers near the base, overlain by laminated layers. We hypothesize that the lower sand layers represent deposition from overwash carrying sand in suspension that may have occurred during dune breaching. The upper laminated layers are indicative of deposition from bedload transport by successive storm waves. Detailed analyses of vertical grainsize trends will help determine if the lower unstratified sand layers were deposited by one or multiple flows.",

The version of the TLP model we use includes the simulation of long-lived trace gases, such as SF6 and CO2, as well as photochemically active trace gases such as CFC-11, CFC-12 and N2O. The TLP model was found to accurately replicate trace gas output from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) for time-averaged profiles in the tropics and each extratropical region. With confidence that the TLP model could represent the basic transport features in CMAM we then used the TLP model to interpret differences between ACE satellite and balloon measurements and CMAM output. The TLP model is shown to uniquely determine mean circulation and recirculation (mixing between the extratropics and tropics) changes necessary for CMAM to more accurately simulate the measurements. This guidance on transport changes is novel, and cannot readily be obtained from direct comparison of CCM output with measurements. The TLP model can thus be used as a bridge between measurements and CCMs to allow more targeted modification of the CCMs than would otherwise be possible.",

            "abstract": "After more than eleven-years of progress of Earthscope/USArray transportable array (TA), nearly 2,000 seismic stations have covered the contiguous United States in a nearly regular grid and an unprecedented quantity of continuous seismic data have been accumulated. Based on the TA, many innovations in seismic imaging have been developed (e.g., the ambient noise tomography, eikonal/Helmholtz imaging methods, and the systematic observation of Rayleigh wave horizontal-to-vertical amplitude (H/V) ratios across large seismic arrays). These new imaging methods applied to the complete deployment of the TA provide the opportunity to reveal completely new views of the crust and uppermost mantle across the conterminous United States. In this presentation, we display a set of complementary observations for crustal and uppermost mantle imaging that includes: 1) Rayleigh wave dispersion information observed from ambient noise and teleseimic earthquakes, 2) P-wave receiver functions, and 3) Rayleigh wave H/V ratios observed from teleseismic earthquakes. We obtain these data and uncertainties systematically at each USArray/TA station across the US and invert them using a joint Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The inversion results in spatially dependent posterior distributions of isotropic crustal and uppermost mantle shear wave speeds. We present and discuss the mean and standard deviation of these distributions. Compared with earlier earth models beneath the US notable improvements include: The topography of and contrast across the Moho are improved improved by joint inversion of surface wave dispersion with the receiver functions; Upper crust structures are sharpened by introducing the Rayleigh wave H/V ratio into the inversions; Depth-velocity trade-offs are greatly reduced as the velocity discontinuities are more accurately positioned. In addition, the resulting model displays a great variety and considerable richness of geological and tectonic features in the crust and in the uppermost mantle deserving of further focused and continued interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Northeast British Columbia (NEBC) is estimated to hold large reserves of unconventional natural gas and has experienced rapid growth in shale gas development activities over recent decades. Shale gas development has the potential to impact the quality and quantity of surface and ground water. Robust policies and sound water management are required to protect water security in relation to the water-energy nexus surrounding shale gas development. In this study, hazard-specific vulnerability mapping was conducted across NEBC to identify areas most vulnerable to water quality and quantity deterioration due to shale gas development. Vulnerability represents the combination of a specific hazard threat and the susceptibility of the water system to that threat. Hazard threats (i.e. potential contamination sources and water abstraction) were mapped spatially across the region. The shallow aquifer susceptibility to contamination was characterised using the DRASTIC aquifer vulnerability approach, while the aquifer susceptibility to abstraction was mapped according to aquifer productivity. Surface water susceptibility to contamination was characterised on a watershed basis to describe the propensity for overland flow (i.e. contaminant transport), while watershed discharge estimates were used to assess surface water susceptibility to water abstractions. The spatial distribution of hazard threats and susceptibility were combined to form hazard-specific vulnerability maps for groundwater quality, groundwater quantity, surface water quality and surface water quantity. The vulnerability maps identify priority areas for further research, monitoring and policy development. Priority areas regarding water quality occur where hazard threat (contamination potential) coincide with high aquifer susceptibility or high overland flow potential. Priority areas regarding water quantity occur where demand is estimated to represent a significant proportion of estimated supply. The identification of priority areas allows for characterization of the vulnerability of water security in the region. This vulnerability mapping approach, using the hazard threat and susceptibility indicators, can be applied to other shale gas areas to assess vulnerability to shale gas activities and support water security.",

            "abstract": "The InSight Mission to Mars will launch in March 2016 and land in September 2016, beginning at least 1 Mars year of observations from the surface of Mars. The primary scientific goal of the InSight mission is to characterize the interior of Mars (both deep and near-surface), but it is also equipped with very capable meteorological instrumentation, and consequently has atmospheric science goals as well. The instrumentation InSight carries includes a very sensitive and fast response pressure sensor, as well as a pair of wind and temperature sensors that are similar to those flown on MSL and will be on Mars2020. These sensors will operate essentially continuously at Mars, a first; enabling the production of a complete sampling of the Martian environment, including short-lived transients. InSight also carries cameras that can be used to survey not only the ground in the near environment, but also sky conditions.\nThe pressure sensor responds to signals below 10Hz (~10X its predecessors) and has a noise level of about 10 mPa (better than 1/10 its predecessors). The pair of wind and temperature sensors have been carefully placed opposite one another on the deck to minimize lander interference as much as possible, leaving one sensor on the windward side of the lander at any time. These capabilities, combined with their continuous sampling enable us to pursue new atmospheric science questions at Mars, including quantifying thresholds for aeolian change, detailed dust devil characterization, bolide infrasonic detection and characterization, and quantifying secular trends in pressure. This is in addition to characterizing the normal meteorology at the InSight landing site, which while not completely new, will provide incremental and important constraints for Martian Atmospheric models. We also expect there to be unexpected discoveries, as well as more synergistic approaches to coordination among all the instruments on InSight that may result even more novel capabilities.",

            "abstract": "In June-July 2015, we acquired the first 3D/2D hybrid (short/long streamer) multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection dataset. These data were collected simultaneously across IODP Exp. 313 drillsites, off New Jersey, using R/V Langsethand cover ~95% of the planned 12x50 km box. Despite the large survey area, the lateral and vertical resolution for the 3D dataset is almost a magnitude of order higher than for data gathered for standard petroleum exploration. Such high-resolution was made possible by collection of common midpoint (CMP) lines whose combined length is ~3 times the Earth’s circumference (~120,000 profile km) and a source rich in high-frequencies. We present details on the data acquisition, ongoing data analysis, and preliminary results. The science driving this project is presented by Mountain et al.\nThe 3D component of this innovative survey used an athwartship cross cable, extended laterally by 2 barovanes roughly 357.5 m apart and trailed by 24 50-m P-Cables spaced ~12.5 m with near-trace offset of 53 m. Each P-Cable had 8 single hydrophone groups spaced at 6.25 m for a total of 192 channels. Record length was 4 s and sample rate 0.5 ms, with no low cut and an 824 Hz high cut filter. We ran 77 sail lines spaced ~150 m. Receiver locations were determined using 2 GPS receivers mounted on floats and 2 compasses and depth sensors per streamer. Streamer depths varied from 2.1 to 3.7 m.\nThe 2D component used a single 3 km streamer, with 240 9-hydrophone groups spaced at 12.5 m, towed astern with near-trace offset of 229 m. The record length was 4 s and sample rate 0.5 ms, with low cut filter at 2 Hz and high cut at 412 Hz. Receiver locations were recorded using GPS at the head float and tail buoy, combined with 12 bird compasses spaced ~300 m. Nominal streamer depth was 4.5 m. The source for both systems was a 700 in3 linear array of 4 Bolt air guns suspended at 4.5 m towing depth, 271.5 m behind the ship's stern. Shot spacing was 12.5 m.\nData analysis to prestack time migration is being carried out by Absolute Imaging, a commercial company. The shipboard QC analysis and brute stacks indicate that the final product will be superb. Key advantages of the hybrid 3D/2D dataset are: (1) Velocity control from the 2D long-streamer data combined with the ultra-high resolution of the P-Cable 3D dataset; (2) Opportunity for prestack and poststack attribute analysis.",

In this study we reconstructed the evolution of mineral assemblages of the bulk and clay-size fraction in Cores TL05-4A and TL05-1B retrieved from the Tulare Lake. Composite clay is the dominant composition in the bulk fraction with average contents of ~ 48% followed by quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Smectite dominates the clay mineral compositions, with average contents above ~ 60%. Mineral assemblages since 35 ka are related to changes in sediment provenance and paleoenvironment. Abrupt increase in clay and illite+chlorite content occurred about 14,500 cal BP, which correlates to the end of of the last glacial maximum in California (i.e., the Tioga). Clay content and illite+chlorite increased during post-glaciation whereas quartz+feldspars and smectite decreased. During post-glaciation, melted glaciers increased water supply and sediment discharge to the Tulare Lake. Increase of water supply raised the lake level leading to transgression so that relatively more fine clays deposited in the post-glaciation strata. More illite+chlorite-rich sediments from the Sierra Nevada Mountains diluted the smectite-rich sediments supplied from the near local area to the Tulare Lake. The content ratio fluctuation of smectite versus illite+chlorite during post-glaciation may be useful as a proxy for the precipitation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.",

In this paper, the characteristics of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in an area of shallow dry snow cover were analyzed based on microwave backscattering models and field snow cover measurements. The analysis revealed that the backscattering of shallow dry snow cover was dominated by the scattering of the snow-ground interface, and the dielectric constant and roughness parameters of the underlying frozen soil were the primary factors that affected the total scattering. The dielectric constant of the soil depended on the amount of liquid water present in the soil, and the amount of liquid water was primarily determined by the soil temperature. Furthermore, the insulation properties (thermal resistance) of the snow cover affected the underlying soil temperature. Consequently, the snow cover characteristics affected the backscattering signal recorded by the SAR sensors. Based on an investigation involving ENVISAT-ASAR data and simultaneous ground-based snow observations conducted on March 14, 2008, we found that the snow temperature decreased with increasing snow depth when the snow depth was less than 20 cm, and the temperature increased with decreasing snow depth when the snow depth exceeded 20 cm. Additionally, the amount of liquid water in the underlying frozen soil rapidly increased with increasing temperature. To estimate the SWE, we used a small number of field measurements data and SAR ratio images to develop two equations. The first equation defined the relationship between the snow’s thermal resistance and backscattering ratio, and the second equation yielded the SWE from the estimated thermal resistance of the snow-covered area. The root mean square and relative errors of the estimated SWE were approximately 7.41 mm and 6.17%, respectively. The derived SWE also indicated that blowing snow and sun radiation were two primary factors that determined the spatial distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas.",

Existing fault maps do not share the GPFA-AB boundaries or scale. Hence, their use leads to problems of uneven coverage, varying interpretation of faults vs. lineaments, and different mapping scales. For more uniformity across the GPFA-AB region, we use an analysis of gravity and magnetic fields.\nMultiscale edge Poisson wavelet analyses of potential fields (\"worms\") have a physical interpretation as the locations of lateral boundaries in a source distribution that exactly generates the observed field. Not all worms are faults, and of faults, only a subset might be active. Also, worms are only sensitive to steeply dipping structures.\nTo identify some active structures, we plot worms and intra-plate earthquakes from the ISC, NEIC, and EarthScope TA catalogs. Worms within a small distance of epicenters are tracked spatially. To within errors in location, this is a sufficient condition to identify structures that might be active faults - which we categorize with higher risk than other structures.\nPlotting worms within World Stress Map σ1 directions yields an alternative approach to identifying activatable structures. Here, we use worms to identify structures with strikes favorably oriented for failure by Byerlee's law. While this is a necessary criterion for fault activation it is not a sufficient one - because we lack detailed information about stress magnitudes throughout the GPFA-AB region.\nDetails from both approaches and their resulting GPFA-AB risk maps will be presented at the meeting.",

We base the solution on the unique SI-traceable data of the GNSS radio occultation (RO) observing system, available since 2001 and scheduled long-term into the future. We introduce a new system modeling and data analysis approach which, in contrast to current RO retrieval chains using classical data inversion, enables us to exploit the traceability to universal time (SI second) and to realize SI-traced ECV profiles, accounting also for relevant side influences, with unprecedented utility for climate monitoring and science.\nWe work to establish such a trace first-time in form of the ",

These massive dust storms are funneled through a gap in the coastal mountains and blow out across the Red Sea. The generation and transport of these dust storms is driven by the large-scale atmospheric pressure gradient across the Red Sea, which is a component of the Southwest Indian Monsoon. Dust deposited on the Red Sea is recorded in skeletal geochemistry of corals that live on the Saudi Arabian coast, and provides an opportunity to reconstruct variability in the monsoon system prior to instrumental records. We have generated annually-resolved records of coral Ba/Ca, which display strong correlations to the zonal pressure gradient across the Red Sea during the instrumental period. Our coral-based monsoon records show an increasing trend in the strength of SW Indian Monsoon circulation since the Little Ice Age, in agreement with lower-resolution Arabian Sea upwelling based records. Our records also show strong decadal-scale variability, which was strongest during the late 19th century and has declined during the past century. In this presentation, we will discuss the decadal-scale variability in the SW Indian Monsoon circulation over the past 250 years as revealed by Red Sea Corals and the implications of the relationships and trends observed in this study for projections of future monsoon variability.",

            "abstract": "The High frequency Active Aurora Research Program (HAARP) in Gakona Alaska is the world’s premier facility for active experimentation in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. The ionosphere affects communication, navigation, radar and a variety of other systems depending on, or affected by, radio propagation through this region. The primary component of HAARP, the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), is a phased array of 180 HF antennas spread across 33 acres and capable of radiating 3.6 MW into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. The array is fed by five 2500 kW generators, each driven by a 3600 hp diesel engine (4 + 1 spare). Transmit frequencies are selectable in the range 2.8 to 10 MHz and complex configurations of rapidly slewed single or multiple beams are possible. HAARP was owned by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RV) in Albuquerque, NM but recently was transferred to the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF/GI). The transfer of ownership of the facility is being implemented in stages involving a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and an Educational Partnership Agreement (EPA) which are complete, and future agreements to transfer ownership of the facility land. The UAF/GI plans to operate the facility for continued ionospheric and upper atmospheric experimentation in a pay-per-use model. In their 2013 “Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics” the National Research Council (NRC) made the recommendation to “Fully realize the potential of ionospheric modification…” and in their 2013 Workshop Report: “Opportunities for High-Power, High-Frequency Transmitters to Advance Ionospheric/Thermospheric Research” the NRC outlined the broad range of future ionospheric, thermospheric and magnetospheric experiments that could be performed with HAARP. HAARP is contains a variety of RF and optical ionospheric diagnostic instruments to measure the effects of the heater in real time. The UAF/GI encourages the scientific community to plan experiments at HAARP and bring their remote sensing instruments to HAARP for extended or permanent operation. The power and flexibility of HAARP and its unique location in the subarctic will help secure the future of this facility as the foremost laboratory for active experimentation in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.

            "abstract": "Edge detection identifies seismic or aseismic fault motion, as demonstrated in repeat-pass inteferograms obtained by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) program. But this identification, demonstrated in 2010, was not robust: for best results, it requires a flattened background image, interpolation into missing data (holes) and outliers, and background noise that is either sufficiently small or roughly white Gaussian. Proper treatment of missing data, bursting noise patches, and tiny noise differences at short distances apart from bursts are essential to creating an acceptably reliable method sensitive to small near-surface fractures. Clearly a robust method is needed for machine scanning of the thousands of UAVSAR repeat-pass interferograms for evidence of fault slip, landslides, and other local features: hand-crafted intervention will not do.\nEffective methods of identifying, removing and filling in bad pixels reveal significant features of surface fractures. A rich network of edges (probably fractures and subsidence) in difference images spanning the South Napa earthquake give way to a simple set of postseismically slipping faults. Coseismic El Mayor-Cucapah interferograms compared to post-seismic difference images show nearly disjoint patterns of surface fractures in California's Sonoran Desert; the combined pattern reveals a network of near-perpendicular, probably conjugate faults not mapped before the earthquake. The current algorithms for UAVSAR interferogram edge detections are shown to be effective in difficult environments, including agricultural (Napa, Imperial Valley) and difficult urban areas (Orange County.).",

The response of snow water resources to anticipated warmer climate conditions, and particularly how changes may be manifested in time (e.g., spring vs. winter; wet vs. dry years) and across an elevation profile is examined. We present model simulations of snowpack response to warmer climate over a 3600 m elevation gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada. The Alpine3D snow model was used to simulate the snow mass and energy balance for three reference years: a moderately dry snow season, near-average and moderately wet snow season. Compared to measurements, the uncalibrated model well represented the date of snow disappearance, depth and SWE. A pseudo-climate-warming experiment was conducted by modifying the measured air temperature by +1°C to +6°C along with the corresponding increase in downwelling longwave radiation. In general, the drier snow season and the forested elevations exhibited the most sensitivity to warmer temperatures. At middle elevations (2000 m to 2700 m), 70-80% of the present-day snowpack volume was lost in a +2°C scenario and nearly 90% in a +4°C scenario. At lower to middle elevations, >50% of the predicted change in SWE was caused by a conversion of precipitation from snow to rain while at higher elevations, a majority of the SWE change was caused by enhanced melt. It is found that warmer temperature scenarios caused seasonal average melt rate reductions of ~1 mm day-1 °C-1. The simulated melt rate reduction is explained by a shift in the seasonality of snowmelt occurrence; more frequent and earlier melt occurred under lower net available energy conditions compared to the present-day snowmelt regime, which is characterized by high melt production in the relatively warm and typically cloud-free spring and early summer. The results raise questions about future rates of meltwater mobilization and the hydrological partitioning between ET and runoff. For example, will a shift toward earlier snowmelt correspond with a decrease or increase in ET demand? And how will snowmelt and ET changes combine with more frequent rain-on-snow events to shape future changes in seasonal runoff?",

Yet, projected increases in mean annual temperatures might alter the amount of soil organic C (SOC) currently stored in these ecosystems. Uncertainties about the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition have hindered accurate predictions of C cycle feedbacks to climate change. This study aims to elucidate how the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition varies along an elevational (1000m) and climatic (i.e. mean annual temperature and precipitation) gradient. The study sites are located at Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in Owyhee Mountains of Idaho, USA. We conducted stratified random sampling of soil up to 0-5cm across sagebrush canopy and inter-canopy areas at four elevations. We hypothesized decomposition of SOC pools at lower elevations to have greater temperature sensitivity (more CO2 respired per unit C) compared to upper due to the quality of C that is inherently more temperature sensitive. To assess the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition, we used aerobic laboratory incubations (n=40) across a temperature gradient ((15, 20, 25, 30) oC) at constant soil moisture (60% water holding capacity) for 120 days and measured CO2 respired. Cumulative CO2 respired increased with increasing incubation temperature. Cumulative CO2 respired also increased with elevation as upper elevations support greater amounts of C. However, when normalized by SOC, we found that the temperature response of CO2 respiration was greater in soils derived from lower than higher elevations (p<0.05). These results indicate that the response of SOC decomposition to elevated temperatures differs strongly across the landscape in semi-arid ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater accumulated on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) drains to glacier beds, often discharging into outlet glacier fjords hundreds of meters below sea level. The injection of buoyant meltwater at depth drives a turbulent plume that entrains warm bottom water as it rises along the ice face, resulting in increased submarine melt rates. Recent studies have used remotely sensed data to identify distinct seasonal flow patterns in GrIS outlet glacier dynamics, suggesting some glaciers are especially sensitive to changes at the terminus. However, we currently lack an understanding of the corresponding regional patterns in near-glacier circulation that are a first-order control on submarine melt rates and indirectly modulate the resultant estuarine exchange flow and mixing of fjord waters. In this study, we use a buoyant plume model combined with a synthesis of shipboard hydrography, moored observations, estimates of subglacial discharge, and remotely sensed data on glacier characteristics, to provide an estimate of plume properties across GrIS outlet glaciers in both time and space. We validate our model results with detailed ice-ocean measurements from neighboring outlet glacier fjords in Uummannaq Bay, west Greenland. Model and observations agree that strongly stratified fjords with deep outlet glaciers result in warm, subsurface plumes, while shallow fjords result in surface-intensified plumes that retain their cold meltwater signature. We compare these results to a high-resolution ocean model to provide an estimate of submarine melt rates during peak summer discharge. One advantage of our approach is the rapid characterization of distinct plume regimes across GrIS outlet glacier parameter space. Finally, we compare these plume regimes with characteristics of glacier behavior (ice velocity, surface elevation, terminus position), over decadal and seasonal time-scales. This comparison allows us to investigate which outlet glacier systems might be more sensitive to changes in submarine melt rates, based on their geometry and flow regime.",

Conventional approaches that simplify the complexity of spatiotemporal interactions generally undermine their impacts on flood risks. A previously developed stochastic storm generator called Dynamic Moving Storms (DMS) aims to address the highly-dependent nature of precipitation field: spatial variability, temporal variability, and movement of the storm. The authors utilize a multivariate statistical approach based on DMS to estimate the occurrence probability or frequency of extreme storm events. Fifteen years of radar rainfall data is used to generate a large number of synthetic storms as basis for statistical assessment. Two parametric retrieval algorithms are developed to recognize rain cells and track storm motions respectively. The resulted parameters are then used to establish probability density functions (PDFs), which are fitted to parametric distribution functions for further Monte Carlo simulations. Consequently, over 1,000,000 synthetic storms are generated based on twelve retrieved parameters for integrated risk assessment and ensemble forecasts. Furthermore, PDFs for parameters are used to calculate joint probabilities based on 2-dimensional Archimedean-Copula functions to determine the occurrence probabilities of extreme events. The approach is validated on the Upper Trinity River watershed and the generated results are compared with those from traditional rainfall frequency studies (i.e. Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves, and Areal Reduction Factors).",

            "abstract": "Wintertime orographic clouds have been shown to contain supercooled liquid water (SLW) as observed by radiometers and simulated by numerical models. The presence of SLW is often an indication that the precipitation process is not efficient, possibly due to a lack of ice nuclei able to be activated into ice crystals. Natural ice nuclei often do not become activated until temperatures are colder than -15 C, however silver iodide has been shown to activate at subfreezing temperatures as warm as -5 C (DeMott 1999, Hoose and Mohler 2012). As such, the precipitation from relatively warm mixed-phase orographic clouds with SLW could potentially be enhanced using silver iodide. Idaho Power Company (IPC) has been operating a cloud seeding program in the Payette River Basin of western Idaho for over 15 years aimed at enhancing the precipitation from winter orographic clouds. During the past 5 years, IPC and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have been conducting research aimed at better understanding the cloud physics of the winter orographic clouds in the region and their potential for cloud seeding. From this research, several cases have been identified that have very high amounts of SLW, based on radiometer observations and numerical modeling. In one case, in situ measurements from the University of Wyoming King Air were also collected. This paper will present observations and modeling results of two cases with high SLW and discuss the implications that such cases have on aircraft icing and how seeding them with silver iodide might impact their precipitation production.",

            "abstract": "The chemical and mineralogical characterization of meteorites and their parent asteroids provides us with information about the processes and conditions during the formation of the inner Solar System. However, linking meteorites to their parent bodies is problematic. Astronomical observations aim to reconstruct the surface properties of these bodies primarily by visible and infrared spectra, but space weathering severely modifies the optical, compositional and physical properties of thin surface layers and thus precludes proper identification of chemistry and mineralogy. The effects of space weathering have been experimentally studied mainly with respect to ion bombardment and sputtering. Other studies aimed to simulate the influence of micrometeoroid bombardment by using laser ablation techniques. However, there is sufficient evidence that laser ablation does not realistically lead to the same effects as produced during real micrometeorite impacts. We performed micrometeorite bombardment using a 2MV dust accelerator at the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart, Germany, capable of generating impact speeds up to 100 km s-1. These results are combined with energetic irradiation experiments at the Electron and Photon Induced Chemistry on Surfaces (EPICS) laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. By simulating highly realistic irradiation conditions, we are able to investigate the processes of particle and solar wind irradiation on solid planetary surfaces and study the formation of e.g., nanophase iron in minerals, the effects on hydrous minerals regarding their volatile budgets, or possible OH-formation in nominally anhydrous minerals and relate these to their optical properties. Using a variety of minerals, this work aims to contribute to a better understanding of the general alteration mechanisms in space environments in dependence of weathering agent and available material. We here present the results of initial comparison analysis and the first irradiation experiments.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_eventBartlett.pdf\nThe Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method is the standard approach in practice for predicting a storm event runoff response. It is popular because its low parametric complexity and ease of use. However, the SCS-CN method does not describe the spatial variability of runoff and is restricted to certain geographic regions and land use types. Here we present a general theory for extending the SCS-CN method. Our new theory accommodates different event based models derived from alternative rainfall-runoff mechanisms or distributions of watershed variables, which are the basis of different semi-distributed models such as VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL. We introduce a parsimonious but flexible description where runoff is initiated by a pure threshold, i.e., saturation excess, that is complemented by fill and spill runoff behavior from areas of partial saturation. To facilitate event based runoff prediction, we derive simple equations for the fraction of the runoff source areas, the probability density function (PDF) describing runoff variability, and the corresponding average runoff value (a runoff curve analogous to the SCS-CN). The benefit of the theory is that it unites the SCS-CN method, VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL as the same model type but with different assumptions for the spatial distribution of variables and the runoff mechanism. The new multiple runoff mechanism description for the SCS-CN enables runoff prediction in geographic regions and site runoff types previously misrepresented by the traditional SCS-CN method. In addition, we show that the VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL runoff curves may be more suitable than the SCS-CN for different conditions. Lastly, we explore predictions of sediment and nutrient transport by applying the PDF describing runoff variability within our new framework.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is transforming the outer edge of the Southern US coastal plain. Lower-lying parts of this region, characterized by extensive freshwater-dependent ecosystems, will be largely inundated by gradual sea level rise by the end of this century. In the interim, however, ocean waters are already penetrating and influencing freshwater-dependent coastal landscapes due to a combination of human and natural factors. This landward movement of salinity from the coast onto the coastal plain or “saltwater intrusion” is a critical water resource issue representing the leading edge of climate change for many coastal areas. The salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands has implications for crop and timber yields in managed ecosystems, ecosystem carbon sequestration in unmanaged ecosystems, and degradation of coastal water quality due to extraction of soil nutrients by seasalts. With this in mind, we seek to understand more broadly how vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater intrusion shapes and is shaped by both natural and anthropogenic processes. We present a novel framework that couples intensive, in situ monitoring of hydrological and ecological conditions with a geospatial saltwater intrusion vulnerability index (SIVI). We discuss application of this framework to the Albemarle-Pamlico region of coastal North Carolina, where we are learning how climate, natural landscape structure, and human activities interact to mediate or exacerbate the vulnerability of freshwater-dependent lands to saltwater intrusion. We discuss the involvement of stakeholders and local knowledge in the research process as well. This work advances understanding of vulnerability to climate change in coastal regions by moving beyond simple inundation models to gain a more sophisticated understanding of the human and natural processes influencing salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands. As the Albemarle-Pamlico and similar regions worldwide transform in response to and, indeed, in advance of rising seas, the sustainability of these coastal landscapes hinges on an ability to understand and adapt to this rapidly changing environment. The figure below shows a preliminary index, SIVIPRELIM, applied to one of our study sites in North Carolina, illustrating vulnerability to saltwater intrusion.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol samples were collected on filters from the NCAR C-130 during the WINTER campaign using an inlet believed to transmit particles up to 4 micron in diameter. Filter integration times were nominally 7 minutes. Aqueous extracts of the filter samples were analyzed by ion chromatography for 5 anions and 5 cations, we focus primarily on chloride and nitrate due to their roles coupling chlorine and nitrogen oxide chemistry. Comparison to measurements of submicron aerosol (by PILS and AMS) indicates that there was significant coarse chloride in the boundary layer on all WINTER flights, including the 7 flights over the continent. Significant super micron chloride at altitudes above 2 km was seen in just 3 of the filter samples from the entire mission, all of these were well inland. During the 6 flights over the Atlantic ocean we observed displacement of chloride from the dominant seasalt aerosol at times, but evidence for coarse mode nitrate or sulfate aerosol to explain this is less clear. While coarse aerosol chloride mixing ratios were sufficient to support observed production of nitryl chloride, no correlations between these compounds were observed on any flights. However, nitrate was positively correlated with nitryl chloride, as expected, on all flights when the latter exceeded several 100’s of pptv for extended periods. Aerosol nitrate was also positively correlated with dinitrogen pentoxide when mixing ratios of the latter exceeded ~500 pptv for significant portions of a flight. On the WINTER flights in February aerosol nitrate was often more abundant than nitric acid, this was less often the case for the flights in March. This change in partitioning of nitrate between gas and particle phases reflects an increasing trend of nitric acid and a small decrease in abundance of aerosol nitrate through the campaign.",

The isotopic content of tropospheric methane is an important tool to help quantitatively deconstruct local source and sink dynamics of this radiatively important trace gas and constrain the regional fluxes.\nHere we present a first look at an extensive set of atmospheric methane isotopologue observations during the SWERUS-C3 cruise in July and August 2014 in the Laptev and East Siberian seas. Continuous in-situ isotopic observations of δ13C-methane and δD-methane were made in real time during the cruise using an Aerodyne Dual Quantum Cascade Laser Isotopic Spectrometer. Methane concentrations were also simultaneously measured using an LGR FGGA analyzer. Air was sampled at four different heights from 9 to 35 m above the sea surface.\nThe precision for our 50 second averages of one second data is approximately 50 ppt for 12CH4, 13CH4 and CH3D. Calibrations were made every 2 hours to compensate for the minimal effect of instrument drift. This unprecedented dataset of atmospheric methane isotopologues across the mid and outer Russian Arctic continental shelf seas will contribute to making more precise top-down estimations of us distinguish methane sources, to make top-down estimations of those source strengths and to constrain the modelling of the methane sources from the Laptev and East Siberian Seas to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is the primary source of water in the Willcox and Douglas Basins in southeastern Arizona and about 90 percent of the groundwater withdrawal is for agriculture. It is estimated that current groundwater production exceeds recharge by at least a factor of two in the Douglas Basin and by a factor of three to eight in the Willcox Basin. The groundwater mining has resulted in groundwater declines of as much as 105 feet in the Willcox Basin between 2006 and the present and 52 feet in the Douglas Basin between 2005 and the present.\n The U.S. Geological Survey collected repeat absolute gravity measurements at 8 sites in the Willcox Basin and at 4 sites in the Douglas Basin for the purpose of measuring the change in aquifer storage between 2008 and 2014. All sites in the Willcox Basin showed aquifer-storage loss between 2008 and 2014, with values ranging from 0.5 to 8.5 feet of water. In the Douglas Basin, two sites showed aquifer-storage loss of 0.8 feet and 3.0 feet, respectively. Additionally, two sites in the Douglas Basin showed storage increases of 2.0 feet and 2.9 feet of water in storage. The storage increases are attributed to the sites being close to ephemeral streams where two large precipitation and associated runoff events (remnant East Pacific hurricanes) occurred shortly before the gravity measurements in 2014.\n The Arizona Department of Water Resources has identified three major areas of land subsidence using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data – two in the Willcox Basin and one in the Douglas Basin. Land subsidence of as much as 29 inches in the Willcox Basin and 18 inches in the Douglas Basin has occurred between 2006 and the present—the magnitude and rates of human-induced subsidence have caused earth fissures and impacted roads, a power generation facility, and a railway.\n The declining groundwater levels, decrease in aquifer storage, and land subsidence are a challenge for future groundwater availability in the Willcox and Douglas Basins. Continued monitoring by the USGS and the ADWR will provide 1) the temporal data needed to understand and evaluate how the hydrogeologic systems in the two basins are responding through time to groundwater overdraft and 2) provide a scientific basis for future mitigation efforts such as redistribution of pumping and/or a reduction of groundwater withdrawal.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon River exports ~14 teragrams (0.014 gigatons) of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the Atlantic coast each year, ~15% of the global riverine carbon source to the oceans. Understanding the source and fate of this exported POC is complicated by (1) hydrodynamic sorting of suspended particles in the river cross-section, and (2) seasonality in discharge over the hydrological cycle. Here, we characterize suspended POC composition down the water column (surface-to-bed) and through time (rising discharge in April 2014, falling discharge in July 2014) to assess the extent of and mechanism underlying this variability. Depth-specific sampling of the river cross-section took place at Óbidos, the most downstream gauging station on the main-stem, and was coupled to an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler to calculate export fluxes at both times. Between April and July, raw water discharge increased from 150,000 to 250,000 m3/s. Bulk compositional features (e.g., % OC, δ13C, C/N) varied with both hydrodynamic sorting and seasonality, while thermal stability, derived from ramped oxidation of the suspended sediments, did not differ with depth or season. Compound-specific δ 13C of extracted lipids varied seasonally, as well. We plan to supplement these preliminary data with measurements of POC 14C content across space and time. The observations thus far suggest that the variability in suspended POC composition with depth and season is dominated by physical changes in source. Moreover, the similarities in thermal stability suggest that POC reactivity, and relatedly, its fate downstream and ultimately in the coastal ocean, is relatively invariant across these variable sources.",

            "abstract": "The subduction of oceanic plateaus or aseismic ridges represent significant perturbations to the long term development of subduction systems and associated orogenies, the consequences of which are variable and determined by the physical characteristics of both the overriding and subducting plates. Flat subduction of the ~18 km oceanic crust of the aseismic Nazca Ridge under the 50 km to 65 km continental crust of the Peruvian Andes provides an opportunity to investigate these consequences. Through analysis of 2233 teleseismic P-wave receiver functions from 55 broadband seismometers deployed in southern Peru for the PULSE, CAUGHT and PeruSE seismic experiments we have identified the South American continental Moho and subducted Nazca oceanic Moho to a higher degree of detail than previously possible in the region.\nWe find that the continental Moho beneath the Western and Eastern Cordilleras of the Peruvian Andes is at a depth >60 km to the north and south of the subducted Nazca Ridge but at <50 km depth directly above the subducted ridge, forming an arch-like structure approximately perpendicular to the structural strike of the Andean surface geology and to the Peruvian Trench. Under this arch, the subducted oceanic Moho of the Nazca Ridge occurs at a depth of ~70-80 km and increases in depth north and south of the ridge with at least one apparent tear or offset to the north. Along the southern edge of the subducted ridge, the separation between the South American continental Moho and subducted Nazca oceanic Moho is less than 10 km, requiring the complete removal of any South American continental lithosphere and potentially lateral displacement of the lower-most Andean crust. The positioning of this trench perpendicular structure connects with an uplifted segment of the Peruvian forearc above the subducting ridge and the Fitzcarrald Arch, a ~500 m uplift in the Amazonian foreland basin that lies along strike of the subducting ridge. In contrast to the forearc and foreland features, the arched Moho below the high cordillera is not clearly associated with a change in surface elevation. This suggests the thick Andean crust above the flat slab responds to ridge subduction by thinning. In addition, these observations suggest the ridge remains strongly and continuously coupled to the upper plate for a distance >500 km from the trench.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Reed AGU 1.pdf\nStudents often enter college with preconceived notions about science. These misconceptions, coupled with a potential for a limited number of science classes during college for non-science majors, can make correcting misconceptions a very daunting challenge. In order to efficiently commutate climate science in a limited number of science classes, instructors need to understand the student experiences that have created their preconceived notions. In many cases, a lack of data about student’s experiences leads to instructors simply guessing at how students are thinking about and interacting with science. Student surveys were used in our work to quantify pre-college experiences, both in and out of the classroom, in order to examine the connection to both academic major and choice of college or university students attended. Surveys were given to nearly 400 students across 4 different schools in the Oklahoma City Metro area. The location of students (rural or urban) affected science experiences as well as what types of actives (local libraries, museums, or parks) were available to the students. Connections between the timing of experience (elementary through high school) and the type of experience (in the classroom, with family/friends, or on their own) may influence choice of college or university as well as academic major. A better understating of positive student science experiences will allow instructors to better tailor their pedagogy and facilitate better connections between climate science and students.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake rupture surfaces are typically treated as single rupture planes. However, the observation of four linked, non-parallel to sub-parallel slip surfaces on a mining induced earthquake in 2004 shows that rupture geometries may be more complicated (Heesakkers et al., 2011). Multiple pseudotachylyte-bearing fault surfaces are exposed within a 1.1 km wide mylonite zone of the Paleozoic Norumbega fault system. The pseudotachylytes are present in two juxtaposed mylonite zones: the Ray Corner mylonite and a mylonite derived from Scarboro Formation metavolcanics. The Ray Corner mylonite crosscuts pelitic schists of the Cape Elizabeth Formation, at upper greenschist-facies conditions (quartz + feldspar + chlorite + muscovite ± titanite ± pyrite). The pseudotachylyte veins formed late in the deformational history, during a period of predominantly brittle dextral offset. The pseudotachylytes are cryptocrystalline and have rounded porphyroclasts of quartz and feldspar. Microstructural observations show evidence for static and dynamic recrystallization overprinting the primary quench textures, suggesting that previous generations of rupture surfaces have been recycled into the mylonitic fabric (Price et al., 2012). Many of the pseudotachylyte veins have a sharp boundary on one side and are poorly defined on the other, providing insight to the propagation direction. This confirms that the paleo-earthquake ruptures occurred at conditions where quartz and feldspar were able to deform plastically, near the base of the seismogenic zone.\nUsing differential GPS, we mapped the geometry of pseudotachylyte fault veins, injection veins, and slip surface intersections. At Ray Corner, there are 7 layer-parallel pseudotachylytes in a 4 m wide zone with linking and subsequent oblique pseudotachylytes. Some intersections between pseudotachylytes are dilational, depending on the intersection angle and relative displacement on the two faults. At these sites, pseudotachylyte melt sourced from the two intersecting surfaces fills the zone, and displays swirled compositional banding indicative of melt mixing. As the quench time of thin pseudotachylyte melts is on the order of ≤ 1 s, the two intersecting faults must have ruptured concurrently in order to allow melt mixing between them.",

The Assessment employs a hierarchical value-tree framework that traces the pathways through which Earth observing systems contribute value across 13 societal benefit areas, utilizing multiple levels to provide logical traceability. This presentation describes the methods used to construct societal benefit area value-trees that include key objectives and the information products, services, and research derived from Earth observations that help satisfy them. It describes the methods for weighting nodes at multiple levels of each value-tree and the expert elicitation process for assessing the relative contributions of Earth observing systems to the development of information products, services, and research. The methodology employed in the Assessment is especially useful at assessing the interdependence and relative contributions of multiple Earth observing systems on the development of blended information products and tracing information pathways from direct observations through intermediate products, such as models, to end-products used to improve decision-making. This presentation will highlight case study examples from the 13 societal benefit areas (agriculture and forestry, biodiversity, climate, disasters, ecosystems, energy and mineral resources, human health, ocean and costal resources, space weather, transportation, water resources weather, and reference measurements) to demonstrate tractability from Earth observing systems, through information products and research that satisfy key objectives, to societal benefit.",

            "abstract": "Many upper-plate processes at subduction zones cannot be directly explained by traditional subduction mechanisms. In the Central Andes, the crust is shortened and thickened by the subduction of Nazca plate, but the lower lithosphere is anomalously thin at present. Within the plateau, localized, transient basins have formed since the Miocene. These basins have experienced subsidence, internal shortening, and then inversion. One hypothesis is these basins are related to the formation and foundering of dense eclogite rocks in the lithosphere. Along the eastern plateau, there are sites of basaltic magmatism which show a gradual westward migration. Geochemistry studies suggest that these magmas are mainly caused by upwelling asthenosphere, indicating lithosphere thinning beneath this area. However, the magmas are landward of the basins, and therefore the formation and removal of the dense anomaly is spatially and temporally offset from the region of lithosphere thinning. In this study, 2D numerical models are used to investigate lithosphere removal within a subduction zone. A dense root is placed in lower crust of the upper plate to simulate the eclogitization process and initiate gravitational removal. The model evolves in three phases: 1) As the root becomes denser, the overlying surface subsides and a basin forms; 2) once the root is denser than mantle, it sinks and decouples from the upper plate. During this period, the basin inverts and uplifts. 3) Meanwhile, the mantle lithosphere landward of the root is sheared by the corner flow in the mantle wedge. As the lithosphere is carried trenchward, a gap forms at the landside of plateau which widens over time. Hot asthenosphere upwells to fill the gap and undergoes decompression melting. The model results are consistent with observations from the Central Andes and could have implications for other subduction regions with enigmatic transient basins and backarc magmatism, such as those in North America and Eastern China.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we sought to better understand what natural organic matter fuels heterotrophic microbial communities in the anoxic subsurface at the Rifle (CO) site and what genes may be diagnostic of that activity. We conducted a 20-day microcosm experiment with naturally reduced zone (NRZ) sediments and collected replicate samples every 5 days for omics (metagenome and metatranscriptome) and biogeochemical measurements (e.g., continuous CO2 production, H2, CH4, acetate, DOC, Fe(II), sulfate, NH4+, spectroscopic analyses of sediment OM). No electron donors were added other than the NRZ sediment, which is enriched in organic matter relative to typical Rifle aquifer material. The microcosms were constructed and incubated under anaerobic conditions in serum bottles with a N2headspace.\nBiogeochemical measurements indicate that the decomposition of native organic matter occurred in different phases, including depletion of DOC and release of CO2 during the first week of incubation, followed by a pulse of acetogenesis and methanogenesis after 2 weeks (with acetogenesis dominating carbon flux after 2 weeks). While H2 remained below detection levels throughout the study, a peak of [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, urease, and nitrate reductase transcripts belonging to the Comamonadaceae family occurred at day 15. Some members of Comamonadaceae are facultative H2-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs and fix carbon via the acetogenic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Comamonadaceae plateaued at 73% of the metagenome at this time and represented 69% of the metatranscriptome, succeeding the S-oxidizing Sulfurimonas genus. Sulfurimonas species were the dominant group at day 0, accounting for 43% of the metagenome and 25% of the metatranscriptome, decreasing to 11% in both the metagenome and metatranscriptome by day 10. Less abundant but still present were transcripts for genes involved in cellulose degradation (glycosyl hydrolases), and glycolysis (phosphofructokinase), consistent with plant biomass degradation. Although further analysis will be required to elucidate the complex and dynamic biogeochemical interactions occurring in this system, it is clear that dramatic metabolic changes occurred over time that markedly altered the nature and magnitude of carbon flux.",

Geothermal waters often have elevated concentrations of trace elements and understanding the geochemical cycling of these elements can be challenging. Previous studies have utilized in situ stream pebbles and glass or ceramic substrates with iron-manganese oxide coatings to understand contamination and or chemical cycling. This project’s main focus is to develop an ideal tracing method using adsorption onto substrate surfaces and to define key parameters that are necessary for the phenomenon of adsorption between trace metals and these surface coatings to occur. Sampling locations include the Jemez River and Rio San Antonio in the Jemez mountains, northern New Mexico. Both streams have significant geothermal inputs. Pebbles and cobbles were gathered from the active stream channel and 6mm glass beads and 2 X1 in. ceramic plates were placed in streams for three weeks to allow for coating accumulation. Factors such as leachate type, water pH, substrate type, coating accumulation period and leach time were all considered in this experiment. It was found that of the three leachates (aqua regia, 10% aqua regia and hydroxylamine), hydroxylamine was the most effective at leaching coatings without dissolving substrates. Samples leached with aqua regia and 10% aqua regia were found to lose weight and mass over the following 5, 7, and 10 day measurements. Glass beads were determined to be more effective than in stream pebbles as an accumulation substrate: coatings were more easily controlled and monitored. Samples leached with hydroxylamine for 5 hours and 72 hours showed little difference in their leachate concentrations, suggesting that leach time has little impact on the concentration of leachate samples. This research aims to find the best method for trace metal accumulation in streams to aid in understanding geochemical cycling.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimates of the isotopic composition of paleo-lake water have been made using 18O/16O (ẟ18O) in diatom silica (Dodd and Sharp, GCA, 2010). Post-mortem diatom silica equilibrates with ambient lake water within six months, chronicling the bulk oxygen isotope composition of the lake and resulting in silica that is near the quartz-water fractionation line (Dodd et al, GGG, 2012). The δ18O values of lacustrine diatoms from the Valles Caldera, NM, vary by ~25‰ between glacial and interglacial periods and suggest a collapse of the summer monsoon that currently provides 50% of the modern precipitation in NM. Triple oxygen isotope measurements of diatom silica may serve as a proxy for the isotopic composition of the lake water and as an estimate of paleo-humidity over the precipitation source. The deuterium excess parameter (d= ẟD - 8 ẟ18O) has been used along ice cores as a source relative humidity index, but is difficult to make in lake sediments. Instead, high precision 17O-excess (∆17O) measurements (=ẟ17O ‑ 0.528 ẟ18O) may provide paleo-humidity information. Landais et al. (GRL, 2008) found a ∆17O difference of 0.02‰ in the Vostok ice core between glacial and interglacial times, interpreted as a function of changing relative humidity of the precipitation source. A 0.03‰ change was observed in glacial (∆17O=-0.22‰) and interglacial (∆17O=-0.19‰) diatom silica along the Valles Caldera lake core. Further information regarding the δ18O value of meteoric water can be calculated from paired δ18O-δ17O measurements. The combined δ18O-δ17O values of interglacial diatoms suggest a δ18Ometeoric water value of -9‰. Modern δ18O value of monsoonal precipitation in NM is ~-10‰. The δ18O of glacial diatoms suggest a δ18Ometeoric water = -20‰. Modern δ18O value of winter precipitation in NM is ~-20‰. These results suggest that the seasonality of precipitation in New Mexico can be inferred based on changes in the relative humidity of the precipitation’s source.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental change occurs in seafloor subsidence in time evolved oceanic lithosphere older than 80 Ma which indicates a change from conductive cooling to more complex growth that is actively debated. There is a paucity of in situ seismic data, however, from seafloor older than the critical age threshold of 80 Ma that identify physical properties of the lithosphere or evolution of the LAB with age. Here, we invert for shear wave velocities using previous analysis of Rayleigh wave phase velocity data obtained from the PLATE project (Pacific Lithosphere Anisotropy and Thickness Experiment). We test a range of starting models, and apriori damping of model and data parameters The best fit to our phase velocity observations indicate shear wave velocities in the lithosphere are very high, extending to 4.75 km/s + 0.05 km/s at depths from the Moho down to 60 km + 25 km . A negative velocity gradient is observed from 70 km to 150 km depth with a minimum of 4.2 km/s + 0.3 km/s. The negative velocity gradient indicates the LAB occurs at 80 km + 25 km. The half-space cooling model predicts that detectable changes in velocity structure should extend to approximately 160 km for 150-160 Ma seafloor. Our OBS array is in an area of old seafloor unaffected by subsequent hot spot volcanism. We find lithospheric velocities that are significantly higher than previous global tomographic studies with much lower spatial resolution that inevitably include areas in which the seafloor has been affected by volcanic activity after formation. The anomalously low velocities in the LVZ indicates a compositional change of either partial melt or volatile content in the underlying asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Changetalposter_11x17.pdf\nThe Berry’s Creek Study Area (BCSA) is a tidal estuary located in New Jersey. Several chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) are present in the BCSA waterway and marshes, including mercury, methyl mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations of COPCs and suspended solids in the BCSA vary temporally and spatially due to tidal variability, freshwater flow events, and interaction of marsh, waterway, and sediment bed materials. This system-wide variability confounds evaluation of COPC sources and transport mechanisms when using conventional laboratory-based analysis of discrete water column samples. Therefore, an optically-based biogeochemical monitoring program was conducted using near-continuous measurements of optical properties and an optical-biogeochemical partial least-squares regression model pioneered by B. Bergamaschi (USGS) and colleagues. The objective of the study was to characterize COPC concentration dynamics in the BCSA water column and relate the analysis to sediment bed processes.\nOptical-biogeochemical model results indicated that, in general, measured optical properties were sufficient for predicting COPC concentrations to within 10% of the accuracy of laboratory-based analytical measurements. The continuous, high temporal resolution time series of COPC concentrations determined by the optical-biogeochemical model enabled evaluation of the sediment bed dynamics and variability of COPCs in the surface water of the BCSA. Results indicate that tidally-induced resuspension of waterway sediment bed particulates is the primary mechanism for transport of COPCs to surface water. Waterway-marsh tidal exchange shows a net mass flux of particulate COPCs from waterway to marsh, indicating that particulate COPCs are retained and accumulate in the marshes with relatively little net export of dissolved COPCs from the marshes to the waterway.",

Streamwater chemistry along an elevational gradient of Como Creek showed strong responses to variations in precipitation inputs spanning 2011-2014. Elevation effects on δ18O were apparent, with more depleted values indicative of snowmelt influence observed at the higher elevation sites. Results from one-way ANOVA indicated that the highest elevation stream site, situated right below treeline, was significantly different from the lower three sites with regards to DOC, δ18O, and Ca2+ (p < 0.05) over May-October 2011-2014. Additionally, the second highest site in elevation was found to be significantly different from all other sites with respect to Ca2+ concentrations. Soil moisture sensor and geochemical data from soil tension lysimeters co-located with subalpine groundwater wells revealed a disconnect between soil and surface water chemistry during snowmelt and that of deeper, underlying groundwater. The initial results of this study provide insight on where groundwater recharge and discharge may be occurring in the catchment and help us to evaluate the large September 2013 rain event in the Colorado Front Range, a once in a 1000 year event. Water isotopes were enriched, Ca2+ decreased, and DOC was enriched, showing that new event water had flowed through near-surface soils but not deeper, recharging groundwater, with all values returning to normal within six months. The event was also observable compared to a long-term geochemical and stream stage record at the stream site near the catchment outlet, with the most enriched δ18O value on record of -13.41‰ corresponding to the flood. Remaining questions concerning groundwater dynamics in the catchment include constraining the tradeoffs between forest ET, groundwater recharge, and streamflow under a warming climate in order to forecast future water yield from the catchment. Further research quantifying where and when groundwater is recharging in the catchment will be conducted to determine how hydrological resilience of the catchment will change under varying climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "It is known that female students tend to turn away from science during their pre-college years. Experiences during this time are not limited to the classroom, as cultural influences extend beyond K-12 science education and lead to the widely studied reduction in females in STEM fields. This has a large impact on climate science because currently relatively little effort is put into K-12 climate education, yet this is when college attitudes towards science are formed. To help quantify these changes, 400 surveys were collected from 4 different colleges in Oklahoma. Student responses were compared by gender against student experiences (positive and negative), and interest in science. Results of our work show that females tend to have their first positive experience with science at a younger age with friends, family and in the classroom, and have more of an interest in science when they are younger. Males in general like experiencing science more on their own, and surpass the interest levels of females late in high school and during college. While in college, males are more comfortable with science content than females, and males enjoy math and statistics more while those aspects of science were the largest areas of dislike in females. Understanding how to keep students (particularly female) interested in science as they enter their teen years is extremely important in preventing climate misconceptions in the adult population. Potential small changes such as hosting K-12 climate outreach events and including parents, as opposed to just inviting students, could greatly improve student experiences with science and hence, their understanding of climate science. Importantly, a greater focus on female students is warranted.",

CyberShake integrates large-scale and high-throughput research codes to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for individual locations of interest and hazard maps for an entire region. A recent CyberShake calculation produced about 500,000 two-component seismograms for each of 336 locations, resulting in over 300 million synthetic seismograms in a Los Angeles-area probabilistic seismic hazard model.\nCyberShake calculations require a series of scientific software programs. Early computational stages produce data used as inputs by later stages, so we describe CyberShake calculations using a workflow definition language. Scientific workflow tools automate and manage the input and output data and enable remote job execution on large-scale HPC systems.\nTo satisfy the requests of broad impact users of CyberShake data, such as seismologists, utility companies, and building code engineers, we successfully completed CyberShake Study 15.4 in April and May 2015, calculating a 1 Hz urban seismic hazard map for Los Angeles. We distributed the calculation between the NSF Track 1 system NCSA Blue Waters, the DOE Leadership-class system OLCF Titan, and USC's Center for High Performance Computing. This study ran for over 5 weeks, burning about 1.1 million node-hours and producing over half a petabyte of data. The CyberShake Study 15.4 results doubled the maximum simulated seismic frequency from 0.5 Hz to 1.0 Hz as compared to previous studies, representing a factor of 16 increase in computational complexity.\nWe will describe how our workflow tools supported splitting the calculation across multiple systems. We will explain how we modified CyberShake software components, including GPU implementations and migrating from file-based communication to MPI messaging, to greatly reduce the I/O demands and node-hour requirements of CyberShake. We will also present performance metrics from CyberShake Study 15.4, and discuss challenges that producers of Big Data on open-science HPC resources face moving forward.",

The Thaumasia Plateau of Mars also displays such features in a similar spatial arrangement. This includes Basin & Range-like terrain to the southwest, similar to the Colorado Plateau, and expansive plains to the east. Both the Colorado Plateau and LPOB occur among highly deformed terrains that have resulted from plate collision, subduction, major crustal shortening, contractional, extensional, and transtensional tectonism, basin formation, and magmatic upwelling and associated emplacement of both mafic and felsic rocks.

Sudan Platform (Sudan). To determine the mean residence time of water in the aquifer, the connectivity of its sub-basins and the groundwater flow across these sub-basins have to be understood. An integrated approach was adopted to address these issues using: (1) a regional calibrated groundwater flow model that simulates early (>10,000 years) steady-state conditions under wet climatic periods, and later (<10,000 years) transient conditions under arid condition; (2) 36Cl ages, and (3) GRACE solutions. Our findings include: (1) the NSAS was recharged (recharge: plains: 2–7 mm/yr; highlands 10–27 mm/yr) in the previous wet climatic periods on a regional scale, yet its outcrops are still receiving in dry periods appreciable precipitation over the highlands and modest (3.04±1.10 km3/yr) local recharge; (2) a progressive increase in 36Cl groundwater ages were observed along groundwater flow directions and along structures that are sub-parallel to the groundwater flow direction; (3) the NE-SW Pelusium shear zone provides a preferred groundwater flow pathway from the Kufra to the Dakhla sub-basin as evidenced by the relatively high hydraulic conductivities and relatively younger ages of groundwater along the shear zone compared to the groundwater ages in areas surrounding the shear zone; (4) the E-W trending Uweinat-Aswan basement uplift impedes groundwater flow from the N-Sudan Platform sub-basin as evidenced by the difference in groundwater isotopic compositions across the uplift, the depletion in GRACE-derived total water storage north but not south, of the uplift, and groundwater ages that are indicative of autochthonous precipitation and recharge over the Dakhla sub-basin.

            "abstract": "Over the past decades, researchers have achieved a fundamental understanding of the budgets of turbulent variables over simplified and (more recently) complex terrain. However, potential temperature variance budgets, parameterized in most meteorological models, are still poorly understood even under relatively idealized conditions. Although each term of the potential temperature variance budget has been studied over different stabilities and surfaces, a detailed understanding of turbulent heat transport over different types of surfaces is still missing. The objectives of this study are thus: 1) to quantify the significant terms in the potential temperature variance budget equation; 2) to show the variability of the budget terms as a function of height and stability; 3) to model the potential temperature variance decay in the late-afternoon and early-evening periods. To do this, we rely on near-surface turbulence observations collected within the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) program, which was designed to better understand the physics governing processes in mountainous terrain. As part of MATERHORN, large field campaigns were conducted in October 2012 and May 2013 in western Utah. Here, we contrast two field sites: a desert playa (dry lakebed), characterized by a flat surface devoid of vegetation, and a vegetated site, characterized by a low-elevation valley floor covered with greasewood vegetation. As expected, preliminary data analysis reveals that the production and molecular dissipation terms play important roles in the variance budget, however the turbulent transport term is also significant during certain time periods at lower levels (i.e., below 5 m). Our results also show that all three terms decrease with increasing height below 10 m and remain almost constant between 10 m to 25 m, which indicates an extremely shallow surface layer (i.e. 10 m). Further, at all heights and times an imbalance between production and dissipation terms is observed.",

            "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid areas replenishment of groundwater resources is strongly dependent on surface water infiltration from ephemeral streams and creeks. An accurate estimation of water infiltration and aquifer recharge from these surface water features is paramount, but this task is subject to physical (streambed heterogeneity) and transient (flow variability) challenges of these watercourses. Although several methods are available to estimate stream infiltration, only a handful of them are suitable for ephemeral streams, all of which are indirect methods.\nIn this study we performed an infiltration experiment at the transect scale in an ephemeral stream at the time it was dry, thereby obtaining direct estimates of stream infiltration. Groundwater heads measured in a transect of piezometers orthogonal to the stream identified the development of a groundwater mound laterally displaced several meters into the streambank. The experiment was modelled using the two-dimensional integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeosphere® and calibrated with PEST using different combinations of groundwater heads and infiltration volume data. Although the model can be calibrated to produce a good match to measured groundwater heads, accurate predictions of stream infiltration can be made only if the heads used for model calibration capture the groundwater mound. The use of infiltration flux or volume during model calibration, instead, provides the best calibration results, and does not require knowledge of the position of the groundwater mound. Given that heterogeneity of streambed and streambank sediments leads to the possibility that the groundwater mound developed during flow events will be poorly characterised or perhaps missed altogether, we demonstrate that incorporating infiltration flux or volume data into the model calibration increases the ability of a model to simulate accurate estimates of stream infiltration during natural flow events.",

            "abstract": "In India, most of the rivers form big size natural islands due to change in its course. However, identification of suitable river island is a very challenging task since these are exposed to river flooding. River islands with least vulnerability to the impacts of severe flooding can be a suitable place for construction of tourism destination such as eco-friendly Parks, Hotels etc. The study involves a two step approach viz. automatic extraction of river islands and model development for flood inundation mapping for extraction of eco-friendly tourism destinations. In this study, automatic extraction of the river islands has been carried out using knowledge based classification approach. The satellite data acquired by the Indian Remote Sensing Satellites sensors such as LISS-III and Cartosat-1 DEM have been used for analyses. In the first step, satellite imagery has been broadly categorized into 5 landuse/cover classes viz. Water, Sand, Islands, Settlements and Cropland. Extraction of such islands which remain unaffected during severe flooding has been accomplished with the flood inundation mapping which has been carried out in HEC-GeoRas with in GIS environment. The model utilizes the primary 4 inputs viz. geometry of the river (DEM, slope), time series data of water surface elevation, landuse/cover, and location of rain gauge station for flood inundation mapping. This paper also investigates the applicability of the eco-island concept to include protection of wetland, management of land-resources, sustainable use of natural resources and construction of ecological park/hotels. The output of the study will be very helpful for Government authorities in stabilizing economy, and enhancing the tourism infrastructure in a better way.",

            "abstract": "The inland glacier retreat has often been considered as one of clearest evidences of the global warming last several decades. However, when we try to model the evolution of the inland inter-annual snow storage including glaciers using a standard energy and mass balance snow model, it is impossible to keep the snow storage constant under a constant climate condition. This study treats the inland glaciers as a dynamic equilibrium system that remains constant under static climate condition. We introduced a sub-grid scale parameterization that moves snow/ice from high elevation areas to valleys as the equilibrating factor of the system. This movement of snow/ice occurs by means of wind re-distribution, avalanches, and glaciation. The physically-based model of a dynamic equilibrium snow system at a regional scale was applied to the entire state of Wyoming for long-term simulation. The developed snow model, named RegSnow model, was coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to estimate the snow surface energy fluxes during the 33-year-long historical period for transient model calibration. The RegSnow model predicted that 82.2% of interannual snow and ice storage in Wyoming may disappear by 2100 under the RCP4.5 emission scenario based on the climate projection by CMIP5 GCMs.",

            "abstract": "The alkenone-pCO2 method based on carbon isotope fractionation during growth of haptophyte algae is one of the most widely used approaches to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 level in the Cenozoic. Based on the fractionation of stable carbon isotopes between dissolved CO2 and phytoplankton biomass, as represented by alkenone lipid biomarkers, this relationship (known as εp37:2) scales inversely with growth rate and cell volume to surface area ratio, and positively with CO2. Recently-published estimates for late Pleistocene CO2 levels, however, are poorly correlated with ice core CO2 records, suggesting that alkenone paleobarometry needs to be refined. Here we compiled published records over recent glacial-interglcial (G-IG) cycles and revised the relationship between algal growth rate, as expressed by the physiological parameter ‘b’, and dissolved phosphate concentration. We further show that the magnitude of change in εp37:2 over glacial-interglacial cycles at different sites is dependent on local nutrient conditions, highlighting the importance of constraining b for accurate CO2 estimates. The correlation between GDGT-2/3 ratio and back-calculated b at Ceara Rise (ODP Site 925) suggests that archaeal lipids could be used as proxies to calibrate b. Application of our variable-b method to reported data yields pCO2 estimates that are similar in both trends and magnitude to ice core-derived records.",

RB is deemed to be controlled by the equilibrium between the most abundant ELF protective antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and its putative disulfide GSSG oxidation product. The actual species produced from the oxidation of GSH initiated by ·OH in ELF interfacial layers exposed to air, i.e., under realistic ELF conditions, however, were never identified. Here we report the online electrospray mass spectrometric detection of sulfenate (GSO-), sulfinate (GSO2-) and sulfonate (GSO3-) on the surface of aqueous GSH solutions collided with ·OH(g). We show that these products arise from ·OH specific additions to S-atoms, rather than via H-abstraction from GS-H. The remarkable specificity of ·OH in interfacial water vis-a-vis its lack of selectivity in bulk water implicates an unprecedented steering process during ·OH-GSH encounters at water interfaces. A non-specific systemic immune response to inhaled oxidants should be expected if they were initially converted into a common ·OH intermediate on the ELF (e.g., via fast Fenton chemistry) and oxidative stress signaled by the [GSH]/[GSOH] ratio.",

            "abstract": "Non-linear processes can explain why Saturn’s rings are so active and dynamic. Some of this non-linearity is captured in a simple Predator-Prey Model: Periodic forcing from the moon causes streamline crowding; This damps the relative velocity, and allows aggregates to grow. About a quarter phase later, the aggregates stir the system to higher relative velocity and the limit cycle repeats each orbit, with relative velocity ranging from nearly zero to a multiple of the orbit average: 2-10x is possible.\nSummary of Halo Results: A predator-prey model for ring dynamics produces transient structures like ‘straw’ that can explain the halo structure and spectroscopy: Cyclic velocity changes cause perturbed regions to reach higher collision speeds at some orbital phases, which preferentially removes small regolith particles; Surrounding particles diffuse back too slowly to erase the effect: this gives the halo morphology; This requires energetic collisions (v ≈ 10m/sec, with throw distances about 200km, implying objects of scale R ≈ 20km); We propose ‘straw’, as observed ny Cassini cameras.\nTransform to Duffing Eqn : With the coordinate transformation, z = M2/3, the Predator-Prey equations can be combined to form a single second-order differential equation with harmonic resonance forcing.\n Ring dynamics and history implications: Moon-triggered clumping at perturbed regions in Saturn’s rings creates both high velocity dispersion and large aggregates at these distances, explaining both small and large particles observed there. This confirms the triple architecture of ring particles: a broad size distribution of particles; these aggregate into temporary rubble piles; coated by a regolith of dust. We calculate the stationary size distribution using a cell-to-cell mapping procedure that converts the phase-plane trajectories to a Markov chain. Approximating the Markov chain as an asymmetric random walk with reflecting boundaries allows us to determine the power law index from results of numerical simulations in the tidal environment surrounding Saturn. Aggregates can explain many dynamic aspects of the rings and can renew rings by shielding and recycling the material within them, depending on how long the mass is sequestered. We can ask: Are Saturn’s rings a chaotic non-linear driven system?",

Presented here is a 14-year study of growing season CO2 fluxes in an Alaskan wet sedge tundra ecosystem -which is about 2 km south of the Arctic Ocean and is adjacent to the NOAA Climate Monitoring & Diagnostic Laboratory (CMDL)- and the key environmental controls on these fluxes. We have measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) using the eddy covariance technique from 1998 to 2014 in order to quantify the long-term seasonal and inter-annual variability in the CO2 budget over this period. The WPL correction and the surface heating correction were applied to all CO2 flux data from the open-path instrument (Burba et al., 2008). Despite several gaps in measurement years, we found that growing season net CO2 uptake has significantly increased since the 2000s and that NEE is sensitive to dry conditions in tundra. Our data suggest this increase in CO2 uptake (larger than -6 µmol m-2 s-1) occurred during the initial thawing period and during the June-August growing season. However, there is a decreasing trend in total summer uptake beginning in 2011, continuing until the end of 2014. The mean diurnal pattern for the summer period over the course of 14 years (Figure below), indicates inter-annual variability associated with the key environmental controls on these CO2 fluxes. Monthly trends in Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), net radiation, relative humidity as well as air temperature and soil temperature have consistently simultaneous effects on the variation in NEE. More significant effect of PAR than temperature on summer NEE had been observed for the first period of this study, however our ANOVA, multiple regression and t-test results showed a stronger effect of temperature than PAR in the recent years assuming that Arctic warming will be greater than average global warming. Also the diurnal pattern shows that the maximum daily carbon uptake occurred from early July to mid-August for most of the years.",

The Japanese early warning system is highly dependent on initial estimates of earthquake magnitude and whether or not the earthquake is tsunamigenic. The extent of the evacuation area is predetermined according to magnitude, which for this event was underestimated primarily due to saturation effects associated with seismic instrumentation. GNSS (GPS and other navigation satellites) does not have this limitation and also provides the permanent coseismic motions, but although available was not yet integrated into the Japanese warning system in 2011. We discuss a prototype system for earthquake and tsunami early warning developed at SIO for the western U.S. The system is based on real-time GNSS and accelerometer data, if available at or near a GNSS station. We optimally combine the two types of observations in real time using precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution and accelerometer (PPP-ARA) software to estimate the broadband coseismic displacement and velocity waveforms with a latency of 1-2 seconds. These data allow for accurate detection of P-wave arrivals for near-source medium size earthquakes and greater. Using data from the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah and 2011 Mw 9.0 Great East Japan earthquakes, we demonstrate rapid magnitude estimation, finite-source centroid moment tensor (CMT) solutions for earthquake characterization (is it tsunamigenic?) and static and kinematic fault slip model estimation. In the case of the 2011 event, we show how an accurate magnitude estimate can be obtained in seconds, followed by a finite source model in 2-3 minutes as input to a tsunami prediction model. The first tsunami waves arrived within 30 minutes of earthquake onset and every minute was important in determining an accurate assessment of the geographical extent of evacuation.",

For these storms, the initial storm structure and intensity in the model agrees well with observations. These results attest that the environment, including SST, in which the storm is embedded has a significant impact on the intensity and rainband patterns of these well-developed TCs.\nRecently, the scheme was used throughout the entire life cycle of super typhoon Jelawat (2012), which underwent a rapid intensification (RI) stage, and a few other storms including Haiyan (2013) and Iniki (1992). The NC2014 scheme was also tested in a real-time experiment forecast for a Category 1 hurricane (Ana 2014) over the Hawaiian Islands and compared with the performance of the Hurricane WRF model (HWRF) and the Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS). For all cases considered, the scheme works well in predicting track, intensity and structure for storms with different intensities at different stages of their life cycle.

In this work, we present two parsimonious methodologies to estimate channel width and depth as a function of channel discharge in large river networks. The first method uses high quality but relatively sparse measurements to empirically estimate downstream hydraulic geometry expressions for mean annual and bankfull flow conditions and the theory of at-a-station hydraulic geometry. The second method combines conservation of mass, momentum (encapsulated in a resistance parameterization), and a morphological classification scheme to estimate hydraulic geometry. As a proof-of-concept, we use both methods to estimate the hydraulic geometry for the conterminous US at the scale of the NHD Plus river network. The main advantages of the proposed methodologies are (i) the parameterization in terms of data widely available at the continental scale, (ii) the low computational burden, and (iii) the consistency with previous observational efforts at the scale of individual watersheds and the ability to capture the main scaling characteristics observed in natural systems.",

            "abstract": "Free global data sets on river bathymetry at global scale are not yet available. While one of the mostly used free elevation datasets, SRTM, provides data on location and elevation of rivers, its quality usually is very limited. This happens mainly because water mask was derived from older satellite imagery, such as\nLandsat 5\n, and also because the radar instruments perform bad near water, especially with the presence of vegetation in riparian zone. Additional corrections are required before it can be used for applications such as higher resolution surface water flow simulations. On the other hand, medium resolution satellite imagery from Landsat mission can be used to estimate water mask changes during the last 40 years. Water mask from Landsat imagery can be derived on per-image basis, in some cases, resulting in up to one thousand water masks. For rivers where significant water mask changes can be observed, this information can be used to improve quality of existing digital elevation models in the range between minimum and maximum observed water levels. Furthermore, we can use this information to further estimate river bathymetry using morphological models.\nWe will evaluate how Landsat imagery can be used to estimate river bathymetry and will point to cases of significant inconsistencies between SRTM and Landsat-based water masks. We will also explore other challenges on a way to automated estimation of river bathymetry using fusion of numerical morphological models and remote sensing data. Some of them include automatic generation of model mesh, estimation of river morphodynamic properties and issues related to spectral method used to analyse optical satellite imagery.",

            "abstract": "The Conway Coast features a unique confluence of fan deltas, terrace uplift, and transpressional faulting. Thrust faults have caused the uplift of the Hawkeswood Range which provides sediment sources for local Gilbert-type fan deltas uplifting to form terraces. Sediments are characterized by steeply dipping foreset beds, horizontal topset beds and tangential bottomset beds. These fan deltas tend to form on steep basin margins often associated with extensional faulting. However, the Conway coast is dominated by thrust faulting. The Rafa terrace, dated between 52.4±4.5 and 79.0±3.5 ka with Optically Stimulated Luminescence, is exposed in cliff faces on the beach. Local creek channels deposited the fan deltas and later incised older deposits to reveal a three-dimensional perspective of the fan delta. This perspective is vital to the recreation of the fan delta position and channel avulsion, leading to a better understanding of the role of uplift superimposed by sea level change in the formation of the terraces.\nForty-three photographs were stitched together to form an extensive photomosaic. The types of sediments, significant structures and relationships between adjacent beds were noted and analyzed. Correlations between the sedimentary architecture and sea level change were made using a sea level curve of the South Pacific over the last 140 ka. The incision of mud by gravel producing large flame structures suggests that there was a drop in sea level and a subsequent progradation of the fan delta. Based on the sea level curve, this drop occurred between ~66-79 ka. Higher in the fan delta, a fining-upward sequence points to a rise in sea level. This correlates with a rise on the sea level curve between ~52-63 ka. Upsection there is another coarsening-upward sequence of 5-10 m thick beds suggesting a fall in sea level before the uplift and incision of the terrace and the subsequent formation of the Ngaroma terrace. Due to their lateral extent, the gravels seem to result from sea level change, rather than channel avulsion. Although evidence for both sea level change and channel avulsion are present, the evidence for sea level change is more prevalent than for channel avulsion. Thus this study concludes that sea level change played a larger role than the local fan delta in the formation of the terraces along the Conway coast.",

            "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a common contaminant in many natural environments and is known to be a neurotoxin that impacts human health through bioaccumulation in food webs. The anaerobic conversion of mercury (Hg) to MeHg by microorganisms requires the presence of both HgcA and HgcB. In an effort to link hgcAB abundance and diversity with MeHg generation rates, we performed metagenomic and 16S rRNA sequencing as well as qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of hgcA on samples from eight mercury-contaminated sites ranging from tidal marshes to Arctic permafrost. Custom algorithms were developed to filter hgcA sequences from the metagenomes, and to then select for those lineages that also contained hgcB. In the metagenomes, the Deltaproteobacteria dominated the pool of hgcAB from all eight sites; however, Firmicutes and methanogenic Archaea were each 50% less abundant. In parallel to the metagenomics studies, clone libraries of hgcAB were constructed for each site. This more cost-effective approach allowed us to verify the identity of the hgcAB+ organism, and yielded similar results to the metagenomes. Additionally, to determine the accuracy of our new degenerate qPCR primer sets (three sets specific to the three major clades of mercury methylators) in the environment, qPCR hgcA abundance values were compared to those derived from the metagenomes. Finally, we present evidence that hgcA abundance can correlate with MeHg concentrations but that the relationship is influenced by local environmental conditions. Our work demonstrates the relative efficacy of genetic methods for assessing the presence of mercury-methylators in eight different environments contaminated with mercury as well as the strength of association between abundance of hgcA and the rate of mercury methylation.",

            "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that much of the Laramide orogeny was caused by dynamic effects induced by an extensive flat slab during a period of plateau subduction. A particularly thick block containing the Shatsky Rise conjugate, now in the mid-mantle, left a distinctive deformation footprint from southern California to Denver, Colorado. Thus mid-mantle, relic slabs can provide fundamental information about past subduction and the history of plate tectonics if properly imaged. Here we find clear evidence for a northeastward dipping (35° dip), slab-like, but fat (up to 400-500 km thick) seismic anomaly within the top of the lower mantle below the central United States. Using a deep focus earthquake below Spain with direct seismic paths that propagate along the top and bottom of the anomaly, we find that the observed, stacked seismic waveforms recorded with the dense USArray show multi-pathing indicative of sharp top and bottom surfaces. Plate tectonic reconstructions in which the slab is migrated back in time suggest strong coupling of the slab to North America. In combination with the reconstructions, we interpret the structure as arising from eastward dipping Farallon subduction at the western margin of North America during the Cretaceous, in contrast with recent interpretations. The slab could have been fattened through a combination of pure shear thickening during flat-slab subduction and a folding instability during penetration into the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "This research focuses on the shift in the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the last glacial cycle. Deep sea sediments from the Central Equatorial Pacific (CEP) are used to quantify and isolate the sources and sinks of atmospheric dust. Dust records and influences climate affecting a wide range of process from Earth’s Albedo to carbon export. Our aim is to determine the provenance of windblown dust deposited in the CEP near the Line Islands Ridge using radiogenic Nd and Pb isotopes, and to infer the location of the ITCZ and the changes of atmospheric transport through ice-age climate transitions. We focus on three cores from the CEP, along a meridional transect at approximately 160° W --- 0° 28' N (ML1208-17PC), 4° 41' N (ML1208-31BB), and 7 ° 2’N (ML1208-31BB).\nRadiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb) have been successfully used to distinguish between different potential dust sources in the aluminosilicates fractions of Pacific Sediments. Our preliminary data suggest that the equatorial core (17PC) predominantly receives its dust from South America and South American volcanics South America (206Pb/204Pb = 18.62, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.63, 208Pb/204Pb = 38.62; ; εNd = ~ -5). The middle core, which more closely reflects the modern position of the ITCZ, has varied dust provenance through time, at times consistent with Asian Loess (average ratios are 206Pb/204Pb = 18.88, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.69, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.06; εNd = ~ -7) and Asian Volcanics (εNd = ~-1) suggesting a shift in the ITCZ south of 4N before the LGM. Our results for the most northern core are forthcoming. Prior to Holocene time, the changes in Pb isotope ratios in both cores appear to be in anti-phase; the northern core becomes less radiogenic up to the LGM, while the southern core becomes more radiogenic. This is potentially due to a weakening of the ITCZ during glacial times. A secondary aim of this work is to determine if the ITCZ migrated further south than core 17PC during Heinrich stage II.",

A short list of examples include NCAR’s Climate Variability Diagnostics Package (CVDP), ORNL’s International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB), LBNL’s Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis (TECA), PCMDI’s Metrics Package (PMP), the EU EMBRACE ESMValTool, the WGNE MJO diagnostics package, and CFMIP diagnostics. The full value of these efforts cannot be realized without some coordination. As a first step, a WCRP effort has initiated a catalog to document candidate packages that could potentially be applied in a “repeat-use” fashion to all simulations contributed to the CMIP DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) experiments. Some coordination of community-based diagnostics has the additional potential to improve how CMIP modeling groups analyze their simulations during model-development. The fact that most modeling groups now maintain a “CMIP compliant” data stream means that in principal without much effort they could readily adopt a set of well organized diagnostic capabilities specifically designed to operate on CMIP DECK experiments. Ultimately, a detailed listing of and access to analysis codes that are demonstrated to work “out of the box” with CMIP data could enable model developers (and others) to select those codes they wish to implement in-house, potentially enabling more systematic evaluation during the model development process.",

            "abstract": "To assess the reliability of Quaternary age determinations of alluvial and fluvial deposits across the Sonoran Desert (Coachella Valley and Anza Borrego) in southern California, we applied both 10Be exposure age dating of surface clasts and U-series dating of pedogenic carbonate from subsurface clast-coatings to the same deposits. We consider agreement between dates from the two techniques to indicate reliable age estimates because each technique is subject to distinct assumptions and therefore their systematic uncertainties are largely independent. 10Be exposure dates should yield maximum ages when no correction is made for inheritance and post-depositional erosion is negligible. U-series dating, in contrast, provides minimum dates because pedogenic carbonate forms after deposition. Our results show that: (1) For deposits ca. 70 ka or younger, 10Be and U-series dates were generally concordant. We note, however, that in most cases U-series soil dates exceed 10Be exposure dates that are corrected for inheritance when using 10Be in modern alluvium. This suggests that 10Be concentrations of modern alluvium may exceed the 10Be acquired by late Pleistocene deposits during fluvial transport and hillslope residence (i.e., Pleistocene inherited 10Be). (2) For deposits older than ~70 ka, U-series dates are significantly younger than the 10Be dates. This implies that U-series dates in this region may significantly underestimate the depositional age of older alluvium, probably because of delayed onset of deposition, slow accumulation, or poor preservation of secondary carbonate in response to climatic controls. Thus, whenever possible, multiple dating methods should be applied to obtain reliable ages for late Quaternary deposits.",

Quantifying marine trace elements and understanding their role in biogeochemical cycles is important for predicting the ocean's response to environmental changes, such as a changing climate and the release of elements into the ocean due to human activities. This research program is collaborative in nature and only one component within the broader International GEOTRACES program. An important part of the collaborative scientific process is having access to trustworthy, well-documented data from colleagues. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) serves as the U.S. GEOTRACES Data Assembly Center, and facilitates the management, sharing, and long-term preservation of trace element and isotope data not only from U.S. GEOTRACES researchers, but from marine biogeochemists across the United States. The BCO-DMO data managers work closely with investigators contributing their data to ensure quality and completeness of documentation to foster data discovery and re-use by potential collaborators. The BCO-DMO system provides free and open access to data and tools for discovery, mapping, visualization, and download. Trace element and isotope datasets from the recent U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic Transect and Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect cruises, as well as other GEOTRACES-related projects are now available from BCO-DMO. Related data from legacy programs, including the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), are also freely available for use by investigators seeking to further the understanding of trace metal cycling in the oceans.

Los Angeles (LA) River flows through heavily populated urbanized area in the Los Angeles downtown. The LA River is an effluent-dominated water body during the dry season. The three waste water treatment plants (WWTP) including the Tillman, Burbank, and Glendale discharge the majority of the volume flowing in the LA River during the dry and wet period. The concentration values (ppm) for anions in the dry season ranging 5.5-16,027 (Cl), 0-1.0 (F), 0-21(NO3), 0-1.6 (PO4), and 13.3-2,312 (SO4); whereas the values (ppm) for anions in the wet season ranging 3.4-5,860 (Cl), 0-0.66 (F), 0-17 (NO3), 0-0.67 (PO4), 7.9- 745 (SO4). Dry season concentrations values for trace metals were obtained with values (ppb) ranging 0.9-10 (Ni), 0.8-62 (Zn), 1-4 (As), 0-1 (Pb) and 0-3 (Se). As for wet season trace metals (ppb) ranging 0.001-0.008 (Ni), 0.000001-0.038 (Zn), 0.0016-0.016 (As), 0.00099-0.0058 (Pb), 0.000001-0.0093 (Se). Higher concentrations values during the dry period in the LA River watershed may be attributed to the three WWTPs discharge (75% of the volume of water flowing in the LA River). In water-limited areas such as the Los Angeles basin, urban runoff is a water resource that could enhance restricted water supplies and to enhance localized renewable groundwater resources, thus an assessment of this precious water resource is important for local city and regulatory organizations.

            "abstract": "Crop yields are largely determined by climate variations and agricultural management practices, such as irrigation, fertilization and residue management. Understanding the role of these factors in regulating crop yield variations is not only important for improved crop yield production, but also equally valuable for future crop yield prediction and food security assessments. Recently, the Community Land Model (CLM) has been augmented and evaluated for simulating corn, soybean and cereals at coarse aerial resolutions of 2 degrees (2000x2000 km). To better understand the underlying mechanisms controlling yield variations, we implemented and validated the agricultural version of CLM (CLM-crop) at a 0.125 degree resolution over the Conterminous United States (CONUS). We conducted a suite of numerical experiments to untangle the relative influence of climatic variations (temperature, precipitation, and radiation) and agricultural management practices on yield variations for the past 30 years at the US county level. Preliminary results show that the model with default parameter settings captures well the temporal variations in crop yields, as compared with the actual yield reported by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, the magnitude of simulated crop yields is substantially higher, especially in the Mid-western US. We find that improved characterization of fertilizers and irrigation practices is key to model performance. Retrospectively (1979-2012), crop yields are more sensitive to changes in climate factors (such as temperature) than to changes in crop management practices. The results of this study advances understanding of the dominant factors in regulating the crop yield variations at the county level, which is essential for credible prediction of crop yields in a changing climate, under different agricultural management practices.",

            "abstract": "The global mid-ocean ridge system stretches over 65,000 km and randomly samples the Earth’s mantle. Compositional variations observed in mid-ocean ridge basalts reflect complex relationships between the thermal, compositional, and dynamical state of the mantle. In this study, we compare globally distributed ridge segment averaged helium isotopic compositions with shear-wave velocities, at both the global and regional scale. Our goal is to understand how temperature, composition and mantle flow control the distribution of helium isotopic compositions in basalts erupted at mid-ocean ridges.\nThe global dataset displays a strong correlation between helium isotopes and the underlying shear-wave velocities in the upper mantle with the most prominent correlations corresponding to depths between ~200 to 700 km. A similar, but less pronounced feature, is observed in the mid-mantle at depths of ~1000 to 1500 km. The exclusion of MORBs influenced by hotspots slightly reduces the magnitude of the global correlations observed between helium isotopes and shear-wave velocities in the upper mantle (though a statistically significant correlation still remains), while slightly intensifying the correlation at mid-mantle depths. Data grouped by individual ocean basin exhibit distinct geochemical-seismological correlations. Mid-ocean ridge basalts from the Atlantic and Indian oceans display similar features as the global correlation and dominate the global upper mantle correlations. However, in the Pacific ocean, the most dominant feature is a correlation between helium isotopes and shear-wave velocities at depths between ~750 to 1500 km. In the Atlantic, temperature appears to be the primary driver of helium isotope variability, even when influence from hotspots is removed. However, it still remains unclear what controls helium isotope variability in the Pacific.",

Hence, the Δ17O of water records information about environmental aridity, and the Δ17O of atmospheric O2 is related to atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and O2, and gross primary productivity (GPP). Vertebrates incorporate Δ17O signals of input water (e.g. drinking water and free food water) and atmospheric O2 into body water through respiration, and biominerals forming in equilibrium with body water can preserve this signal over geological timescales. The preservation of fossil biominerals can be evaluated by clumped isotopes as they record the temperature of mineralization, be it primary mineralization in the living animal (at body temperature), or secondary mineralization during diagenesis. We can distinguish the alteration of samples from the deviation between observed clumped isotope temperatures and plausible body temperatures. Meanwhile, diagenesis tends to moderate Δ17O of biominerals towards Δ17O of meteoric waters, such that measured Δ17O values reflect the minimum anomaly in fossil samples. Thus, preservation of anomalous Δ17O indicates at least partial preservation of the original signal.\nWe present Δ17O data from both modern vertebrate and fossil dinosaur biominerals. We use a 17O-enabled body water model to explore the influence of aridity and dietary ecology on animal Δ17O, and to predict the degree of dilution of the atmospheric O2 Δ17O signal by other sources of oxygen to the animal. We observe: 1) animals consuming more leaf water than drinking water are “evaporation sensitive” (ES) animals, and have lower Δ17O relative to “evaporation insensitive” animals in the same climates; 2) ES animals from arid climates have lower Δ17O values compared to ES animals from humid climates, which forms the basis of a paleoaridity proxy; and 3) anomalously low body water Δ17O values are observed for some of the dinosaur samples, indicating a significantly different carbon cycle during that time, with pCO2 up to 3250±1250 ppm during late Jurassic assuming present day GPP and pO2.",

Passive radiometry from satellite shows structure on scales of tens to thousands of kilometers, but there is much structure at short spatial scales not resolved by satellite imagery. Here we use a commercial camera having high spatial resolution (~20 µrad) and high dynamic range (16 bits in each of three color channels) in narrow field-of-view (20 mrad, 110 mrad), zenith-looking mode from the surface, to examine clouds at the scale of centimeters to a few hundred meters, focusing on non-precipitating single-layer clouds during daytime. Up-looking photography of clouds from the surface affords the further advantage, relative to satellite imagery, of black background (space) with contributions to radiance only from blue sky (Rayleigh scattering), aerosols, and clouds, permitting reconstruction of observed radiance by radiation transfer modeling. Contrast between cloudy and cloud-free sky is enhanced in Red/(Red + Blue), RRB, image Figure 1, but no unique value of RRB distinguishes a pixel as cloud vs. cloud-free. Short-range variability is characterized by the autocorrelation length scale, which is not uncommonly as short as a few meters; longer range variability, such as cloud characteristic size, separation distance, and cloud spatial organization, is also characterized. Scene reconstruction yields the 2D distribution of cloud optical depth; spatial inhomogeneity is attributed mainly to horizontal variation in vertical motion of the air and resultant condensation or evaporation associated with upward or downward motion, respectively. Alternative approaches to calculation of the radiative influence of such clouds from the autocorrelation structure of the cloud field are examined.\nFigure 1.

These dolerites with rare vesicles are inferred to be a sill or a thick lava flow although field relationships are obscured. All samples are fresh and comprise holocrystalline medium-grained rocks with ophitic textures. The rocks are classified as picrites based on high MgO (15 to 26 wt. %) together with the presence of skeletal olivine. SEM-EDS data indicate the olivines exhibit a range in composition from Fo74 to Fo85 and, within any one rock the olivines are fairly homogenous and show limited variation. Orthopyroxene compositions are in the range Ca4Mg74Fe22 to Ca2Mg82Fe16. The clinopyroxenes are augites and range in composition from Ca39Mg47Fe13 to Ca40Mg51Fe13 but, as with olivine, the composition variation within individual rocks is limited. Plagioclase feldspars are calcic and show normal zoning from An89 to An30. The high-MgO basal rocks contain alkali feldspar (Or9-70) as rims on plagioclase crystals and as small intergranular crystals. Geochemically the picrites belong to the low-Ti group and are relatively depleted in incompatible elements. The Mg-number varies from 0.74 to 0.81 in some cases due to olivine accumulation and in other cases, because of near-primary compositions. Hence, trends on geochemical plots can be attributed to the fractionation or accumulation of olivine plus chromite. A general decrease in Mg#, compatible trace elements, Fo-content of olivines are observed from bottom to top. Furthermore, incompatible trace elements like Ba and Nb show a general increase with lithostratigraphic height consistent with the increasing degree of differentiation. However, the basal high-MgO rocks appear to be the most contaminated having the highest indices of contamination (e.g., high Rb/Sr) and enhanced K concentration in the plagioclase rims suggesting that the hot high MgO rocks are more susceptible to crustal contamination.",

However there are still gaps in the understanding of the relationship between ion and electron heating. The mechanisms for ion and electron heating are examined using a systematic set of antiparallel reconnection simulations performed with Kinetic Particle in Cell (PIC). Ions and electrons are energized and heated through reflections across contracting magnetic field lines in the center of the outflow exhaust. Long range parallel electric fields form to trap heated electrons, and in turn inhibit the counter streaming ion beams, reducing the ion temperature increment. A balance between electron energy gain from the contracting field lines and energy loss at the inflow edge of the exhaust ultimately determines the electron heating. This mechanism extends far downstream and leads to a net heating which is independent of distance from the x-line. The parallel electric field fundamentally links energy partition between the electrons and ions.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying change in vegetation and geomorphic features which occur during and after storm impact is necessary toward understanding barrier island habitat resiliency under continued climate warming and sea level rise. In August, 2005, the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands, including, from west-to-east, Cat, West Ship, East Ship, Horn, Petit Bois and Dauphin islands, were completely inundated by the tidal surge of Hurricane Katrina. Overwash, scouring, burial under sand, and mechanical damage combined with saltwater flooding and post-storm drought resulted in immediate and long-term vegetation loss. Remotely-sensed data acquired before (2004-2005) and after (2005-2011) Katrina were compared via image classification to determine immediate storm impacts and assess natural re-growth of land area and vegetation. By 2008, merely three years after the storm, total land area of Cat, West Ship, East Ship, Horn, Petit Bois and West Dauphin had recovered to 92, 90, 33, 99, 93 and 91 percent, and total vegetated land area to 85, 101, 85, 94, 83 and 102 percent of pre-Katrina values, respectively. Habitat-type maps developed from field survey, SPOT-5 and radar data were compared with LIDAR-derived elevation models to assess 2010 habitat-type distribution with respect to ground elevation. Although median MSL elevations associated with habitat classes ranged only from 0.5 m to 1.4 m, habitat-type changed distinctively with decimeter-scale changes in elevation. Low marsh, high marsh, estuarine shrubland, slash pine woodland, beach dune, bare sand and beach dune herbland were associated with median elevations of 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 m ± 0.1 m, respectively. The anticipated increases in sea level and tropical storm energy under a continually warming climate will likely inhibit the reformation of higher-elevation habitat-types, such as shrublands and woodlands, in the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "The accuracy of zircon U-Th/Pb ages generated by LA-ICP-MS is limited by systematic bias resulting from differences in crystallinity of the primary reference and that of the unknowns being analyzed. In general, the use of a highly crystalline primary reference will tend to bias analyses of materials of lesser crystallinity toward older ages. When dating igneous rocks, bias can be minimized by matching the crystallinity of the primary reference to that of the unknowns. However, the crystallinity of the unknowns is often not well constrained prior to ablation, as it is a function of U and Th concentration, crystallization age, and thermal history. Likewise, selecting an appropriate primary reference is impossible when dating detrital rocks where zircons with differing ages, protoliths, and thermal histories are analyzed in the same session.\nWe investigate the causes of systematic bias using Raman spectroscopy and measurements of the ablated pit geometry. The crystallinity of five zircon reference materials with ages between 28.2 Ma and 2674 Ma was estimated using Raman spectroscopy. Zircon references varied from being highly crystalline to highly metamict, with individual reference materials plotting as distinct clusters in peak wavelength versus Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) space. A strong positive correlation (R2=0.69) was found between the FWHM for the band at ~1000 cm-1 in the Raman spectrum of the zircon and its ablation rate, suggesting the degree of crystallinity is a primary control on ablation rate in zircons. A moderate positive correlation (R2=0.37) was found between ablation rate and the difference between the age determined by LA-ICP-MS and the accepted ID-TIMS age (ΔAge).\nWe use the measured, intra-sessional relationship between ablation rate and ΔAge of secondary references to reduce systematic bias. Rapid, high-precision measurement of ablated pit geometries using an optical profilometer and custom MatLab algorithm facilitates the implementation of the technique. The technique results in no decrease in the precision of individual measurements and an overall improvement of intra-sessional reproducibility of reference material ages, and thus a reduction in external error.",

During this event, the expeditionary team of Snow Impurity and Glacial Microbe effects on the Arctic (SIGMA) project experienced unexpectedly heavy rainfall at their campsite on the northwestern Greenland ice sheet. We tried to reproduce the rainfall event by using the Japan Meteorological Agency Non-Hydrostatic Model (JMA-NHM) with 5-km horizontal resolution to characterize the temporal and spatial variation of the types of precipitation. The simulated results well agreed with observational data from surface stations and space-borne radar. According to the simulated results, the areas where the 1-h rainfall exceeded 0.1 mm at least once during the event accounted for 48% of the entire area of the Greenland ice sheet. In the coastal regions of western Greenland, precipitation during the event was composed of liquid hydrometeors, whereas in high-elevation regions, it was composed mainly of solid hydrometeors. Over intermediate regions, the phase of the precipitation changed temporally and spatially among liquid, solid, and a mixture of both. These phase transitions of the precipitation are very likely to affect the surface radiative properties of the ice sheet as well as the heat and mass balance at the surface of the ice sheet during the study period and afterward.",

Distinct to other climate forcers like carbon dioxide and methane, BC particles have optical and chemical properties that evolve while aging in the atmosphere. Little is known with regards to the physical and chemical characteristics of these particles in the remote atmosphere, or how BC properties may have evolved with human activities. Antarctic ice cores provide a historical record of BC particles in the atmosphere. Using a new method of tangential flow filtration and transmission electron microscopy, we have isolated and characterized black carbon in century-old Antarctic ice. Our findings revealed unexpected diversity in particle morphology, insoluble coatings, and association with metals, with properties that could have significant atmospheric effects. Given that these new forms of BC may exist in significant proportions, we propose the need to incorporate these forms into future models of atmospheric and climate variability.",

STWBM is applied to estimate the value of water loss based on precipitation minus discharge volume during　short-periods(8 to 80 days). This method can be applicable for examining seasonal characteristics of water loss that relets to ET. We applied STWBM for investigating the effects of 50% thinning in nested headwater catchments draining Japanese cypress (Cryptomeria japonica) and cedar (Chamaecyparis obtusa) forests. Study areas is located to 70 km north of Tokyo with 1250 mm annual precipitation and 14℃ mean annual temperature. 50% of the stems (46% of timber volume) were removed by strip thinning in 17 ha treatment catchment, 9 ha catchment remained untreated as a control. We installed 4 nested gauging stations in treated and control catchments with 3 to 10 ha of drainage areas. Runoff in each nested gauging station was measured in the pre- (from April, 2010 to June 2011) and the post-thinning periods (from January 2012 to December 2012). Total runoff coefficient in treated and control catchment was 54% and 26%, respectively. , . Estimated annual water loss by STWBM was 585 mm in treated and 969 mm in control catchments. Because annual evapotranspiration of Japanese cypress and cedar was about ranging from 400 to 800 mm in this catchment, our estimated water loss mostly associated with ET and partially by water loss by deep bedrock percolation. Estimated water loss after thinning in growth season (May to October) decreased 45 to 60 (in 2012) % and 51 to 60 (in 2013) % for all nested gauging station, while estimated water loss in control catchment was consistent. This result suggested that 50% of thinning decreased water loss by ET but changes can be varied among nested gauging station.",

It has been also been suggested that F-region irregularities may contribute additional attenuation to the VLF signal. Additionally, energy at these frequencies that escapes the ionosphere altogether strongly impacts the radiation belts, driving electron precipitation via whistler-electron gyroresonance, and contributes to the formation of the slot region.\nWe present an analysis of measurements captured by the DEMETER satellite over VLF transmitters.

Velocity interferometry was used to record shock velocities and reflectivities at 532 nm during decaying shock compression. The data show up to 40% (or higher) reflectivity, corresponding to notable electrical conductivities, in response to high pressures and temperatures. Furthermore, band-gap closure, dependent on density, can be examined from the reflectivity data. Ionic salts are simple model systems amenable to first-principles theory and serve as analog materials for predicting whether specific chemical constituents can reside in the rocky mantles or metallic cores of planets. A key objective is to disentangle the complementary roles of temperature and compression in transforming ionic into metallic bonding. Furthermore, at high pressures CsI becomes analogous to Xe: they are isoelectronic and follow matching equations of state.

While numerous studies have demonstrated a tight coupling between soil N availability and soil volumetric water content, this relationship is not well understood in desert ecosystems where rain events create pulses of biological activity, such as microbial secretion of extracellular enzymes that enable nutrient acquisition. Moreover, climate models are projecting shifts in the size and frequency of rain events across semi-arid ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic activities; therefore these changes are expected to have consequences for soil N availability in these regions. The goals of this study were to determine (1) if soil N availability pulses in response to monsoon rain events of differing size and frequency, and (2) how soil N availability varies over the course of a monsoon season in a semi-arid grassland. To answer these questions, we analyzed soils collected from a northern Chihuahuan Desert grassland during the 2014 summer monsoon. Soils were collected monthly over a period of eight days in conjunction with experimentally manipulated irrigation treatments that varied in both size (small=5mm and large=20mm) and frequency (small=weekly (n=12) and large=monthly (n=3)). Using KCl extraction, soils were processed for their inorganic plant-available nitrogen content (NH4+-N and NO3--N). We found that while soil N availability increased over the monsoon season across all treatment types, large events appeared to saturate soils, creating anaerobic conditions that stimulated nitrogen loss most likely through the denitrification pathway. Soils were also assayed for nitrogen specific extracellular enzyme activities, specifically leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), which breaks down the bond in leucine amino acids to mobilize nitrogen, and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), which breaks down amino sugars in microbial cell walls. Preliminary results suggest that by mid-monsoon, LAP activity pulses within 24 hours in response to small frequent irrigation events, while NAG activity pulses 48 hours after an irrigation event regardless of the event size or frequency. Our results imply that less frequent larger monsoon events could result in lower soil N availability, which may limit net primary production in desert grasslands.",

Magnitude, spatial scale, and temporal development of the related magnetic perturbations suggest that the generator is related to the interaction of the flow bursts with the dipolar magnetosphere after onset of reconnection in the near-Earth tail. The question remains whether it is the flow energy that feeds the wedge current or the internal energy of the arriving plasma. In this presentation I argue for the latter. The current generation is attributed to the force exerted by the dipolarized magnetic field of the flow bursts on the preceding layer of high-beta plasma after flow braking. The generator current is the grad-B current at the outer boundary of the compressed high-beta plasma layers. It needs the sequential arrival of several flow bursts to account for duration and magnitude of the ionospheric closure current.",

However traditionally data storage used for geophysical software systems has centered on file-based systems and libraries such as NetCDF and HDF5. In this session we’ll discuss the advantages and challenges of moving to an object store-based model for geophysical data. We’ll review a proposed model for a geophysical data service that provides an API-compatible library for traditional NetCDF and HDF5 applications while providing high scalability and performance. One further advantage of this approach is that any dataset or dataset selection can be referenced as a URI. By using versioning, the data the URI references can be guaranteed to be unmodified, thus enabling reproducibility of referenced data.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_poster_YingLi.pdf\nOrganic aerosol is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and its major component is secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Formation and evolution of SOA is a complex process involving coupled chemical reactions and mass transport in the gas and particle phases (Shiraiwa et al., 2014). Current air quality models do not embody the full spectrum of reaction and transport processes, nor do they identify the dominant rate-limiting steps in SOA formation, resulting in the significant underprediction of observed SOA concentrations, which precludes reliable quantitative predictions of aerosols and their environmental impacts.\nRecently, it has been suggested that the SOA chemical evolution can be represented well by “molecular corridor” with a tight inverse correlation between molar mass and volatility of SOA oxidation products (Shiraiwa et al., 2014). Here we further analyzed the structure, molar mass and volatility of 31,000 unique organic compounds. These compounds include oxygenated organic compounds as well as nitrogen- and sulfur-containing organics such as amines, organonitrates, and organosulfates. Results show that most of those compounds fall into this two-dimensional (2-D) space, which is constrained by two boundary lines corresponding to the volatility of n –alkanes CnH2n+2 and sugar alcohols CnH2n+2On. A method to predict the volatility of nitrogen- and sulfur- containing compounds is developed based on those 31,000 organic compounds. It is shown that the volatility can be well predicted as a function of chemical composition numbers, providing a way to apply this 2-D space to organic compounds observed in real atmosphere. A comprehensive set of observation data from laboratory experiments, field campaigns and indoor measurements is mapped to the molecular corridor. This 2-D space can successfully grasp the properties of organic compounds formed in different atmospheric conditions.\nThe molecular corridor represents a new framework in which chemical and physical properties as well as reaction rates and pathways involved in SOA evolution can be described, thus is potentially for use in the further development of aerosol models for air quality and climate.",

            "abstract": "Advance information about the timing and locations of malaria epidemics can facilitate the targeting of resources for prevention and emergency response. Early detection methods can detect incipient outbreaks by identifying deviations from expected seasonal patterns, whereas early warning approaches typically forecast future malaria risk based on lagged responses to meteorological factors. A critical limiting factor for implementing either of these approaches is the need for timely and consistent acquisition, processing and analysis of both environmental and epidemiological data. To address this need, we have developed EPIDEMIA – an integrated system for surveillance and forecasting of malaria epidemics. The EPIDEMIA system includes a public health interface for uploading and querying weekly surveillance reports as well as algorithms for automatically validating incoming data and updating the epidemiological surveillance database. The newly released EASTWeb 2.0 software application automatically downloads, processes, and summaries remotely-sensed environmental data from multiple earth science data archives. EASTWeb was implemented as a component of the EPIDEMIA system, which combines the environmental monitoring data and epidemiological surveillance data into a unified database that supports both early detection and early warning models. Dynamic linear models implemented with Kalman filtering were used to carry out forecasting and model updating. Preliminary forecasts have been disseminated to public health partners in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia and will be validated and refined as the EPIDEMIA system ingests new data. In addition to continued model development and testing, future work will involve updating the public health interface to provide a broader suite of outbreak alerts and data visualization tools that are useful to our public health partners. The EPIDEMIA system demonstrates a feasible approach to synthesizing the information from epidemiological surveillance systems and remotely-sensed environmental monitoring systems to improve malaria epidemic detection and forecasting.",

In this study, Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis (NPFDA) methods are applied to forecast air temperature and wind speed time series in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The dataset consists of hourly measurements recorded for a period of 29 years, 1982-2010. The novelty of the Functional Data Analysis approach is in expressing the data as curves. In the present work, the focus is on daily forecasting and the functional observations (curves) express the daily measurements of the above mentioned variables. We apply a non-linear regression model with a functional non-parametric kernel estimator. The computation of the estimator is performed using an asymmetrical quadratic kernel function for local weighting based on the bandwidth obtained by a cross validation procedure. The proximities between functional objects are calculated by families of semi-metrics based on derivatives and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). Additionally, functional conditional mode and functional conditional median estimators are applied and the advantages of combining their results are analysed. A different approach employs a SARIMA model selected according to the minimum Akaike (AIC) and Bayessian (BIC) Information Criteria and based on the residuals of the model. The performance of the models is assessed by calculating error indices such as the root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE, BIAS and relative BIAS. The results indicate that the NPFDA models provide more accurate forecasts than the SARIMA models.\nKey words: Nonparametric functional data analysis, SARIMA, time series forecast, air temperature, wind speed",

            "abstract": "For over 100 years root biomass has been used to infer patterns of resource uptake. These patterns are used to understand plant growth, plant coexistence and water cycles. In savannas, observations of root biomass led to the two-layer hypothesis which suggests that grasses outcompete trees due in part to dense shallow root mats that have been presumed to provide grasses with more soil water than trees. Here we show that root biomass can be a poor indicator of resource uptake. More specifically, we combine a hydrologic tracer experiment with a soil water model to measure the amount of water plant species remove from different soil depths. We use this approach in mesic, xeric, sandy and clay sites and reveal surprisingly similar rooting patterns among sites. Our approach revealed that the depth from which grasses and trees absorbed half of their annual water was twice as deep (23 and 43 cm, respectively) and niche partitioning was greater (0.82 vs. 0.95) than would be inferred from root biomass or tracer uptake data alone. Contrary to long-standing assumptions based on root biomass distributions, our approach suggested that shallow rooting patterns provided grasses with 32% less water than slightly deeper tree rooting patterns. Our results provided good predictions (R2 = 0.82) of soil water content throughout the soil profile and throughout the growing season and helped predict tree and grass growth responses to treatments in separate precipitation manipulation experiments. Results provide an example of how quantifying water uptake can reveal patterns of root activity that are not apparent from root biomass distributions and help resolve long-standing questions about species coexistence and water use.",

            "abstract": "Many communities in mountainous areas have limited access to and/or understanding of co-seismic landslide hazard maps. Furthermore these maps rarely provide the information that a community seeks: Where is safest? How big could the landslide be? Geomorphic intuition suggests that: 1) on the ridges one is less likely to be hit by a landslide than elsewhere in the landscape; 2) hazard increases with the amount of upslope unstable area; 3) longer slopes contain more candidate landslides and are also capable of producing larger landslides thus they constitute a more severe hazard. These observations could help communities in siting infrastructure or making earthquake plans but have not, to our knowledge, been tested against past landslide inventories. Co-seismic landslide models make no attempt to predict landslide size and focus on initiation, ignoring the runout which is critical in the slope length control on hazard. Here we test our intuitive hypotheses using an inventory of co-seismic landslides from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The inventory is mapped from high-resolution remote imagery using an automated algorithm and manual delineation and does not distinguish between source and runout zones. Discretizing the study area into 30 m cells we define landslide hazard as the probability that a cell is within a mapped landslide polygon (p(ls)). We find that p(ls) increases rapidly with increasing slope and upslope area. Locations with low local slope (<10˚) or upslope area (<900 m2/m) have p(ls) less than one third of the areal average. The joint p(ls) conditional on local slope and upslope area identifies long steep slopes as particularly hazardous and ridges (where slope and upslope area are both low) as particularly low hazard. Examining the slope lengths associated with each landslide in the inventory we find that hillslope length sets an upper limit on landslide size but that its influence on the detailed size distribution is more difficult to untangle. Finally, we combine local slope and upslope unstable area in a simple mechanistic rule-based model of landslide runout hazard and test its ability to predict p(ls). Our findings support the intuitive view that long steep slopes are among the most hazardous locations while ridges are the least hazardous locations in terms of co-seismic landslides.",

Recent laboratory and ambient measurements suggest that both production yields and removal rates of chemically produced secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are much stronger and more diverse than currently assumed in chemistry-climate models (which typically consider wet deposition as the major loss process). In this study, we re-assess the global SOA distribution and budget with newly proposed SOA production and loss processes derived from these recent measurements, as well as from theoretical calculations. We evaluate and discuss the relative importance of removal pathways for organic vapors and particles (e.g. dry and wet deposition, photo-dissociation, evaporation, and heterogeneous surface reactions), and their effect on the SOA vertical distribution and budget using the GEOS-Chem global chemistry-transport model. We compare simulated SOA from various model configurations against ground, aircraft and satellite measurements to assess the extent to which these new developments in our understanding of SOA formation and removal processes are consistent with observed characteristics of the SOA distribution. Our results show strong changes in predicted vertical profiles of organic aerosols with higher SOA concentrations in the boundary layer and lower concentrations in the upper troposphere, which appear to be in a better agreement with aircraft measurements.",

However, there are clear differences for rotations rates of 1-16x\npresent earth day lengths between the mixed layer and fully coupled ocean models,\nwhich points to the necessity of using fully coupled oceans whenever possible.\nThe latter was recently demonstrated quite clearly by Hu & Yang 2014 in their\naquaplanet study with a fully coupled ocean when compared with similar mixed\nlayer ocean studies and by Cullum et al. 2014.\nAtmospheric constituent amounts were also varied alongside adjustments to cloud\nparameterizations. While the latter have an effect on what a planet's global mean\ntemperature is once the oceans reach equilibrium they do\nnot qualitatively change the overall relationship between the globally averaged\nsurface temperature and incident solar flux for rotation rates ranging from 1\nto 256 times the present Earth day length. At the same time this study\ndemonstrates that given the lack of knowledge about the atmospheric constituents\nand clouds on exoplanets there is still a large uncertainty as to where a planet\nwill sit in a given star's habitable zone.\nWe also explore options for understanding the possibility for regional habitability\nvia an aridity index and a separate moisture index. The former is related to the competition\nbetween precipitation and the potential evapotranpiration of the soil (via a modified\nPenman-Monteith equation) while the latter is a measure of the amount of liquid water found\non land.\nCullum, Stevens & Joshi 2014, Astrobiology, vol 14, No. 8, pg 645\nHu & Yang 2014, PNAS, 111, 629\nYang, Cowan & Abbot 2013, ApJL, 771, 45\nYang et al. 2014, ApJL, 787, 2",

However, hypersaline discharge from desalination facilities presents environmental risks, particularly to benthic organisms. The risks posed by salt levels and chemical additives, which can be toxic to local ecosystems, are typically mitigated by ensuring high levels of dilution close to the source.\nWe report on laboratory flume experiments examining how internal waves at the pycnocline of a layered ambient density stratification influence the transport of hypersaline effluent moving as a gravity current down the slope. We found that some of the hypersaline fluid from the gravity current was diverted away from the slope into an intrusion along the pycnocline. A parametric study investigated how varying the energy of the internal wave altered the amount of dense fluid that was diverted into the pycnocline intrusion. The results are compared to an analytical framework that compares the incident energy in the internal wave to potential energy used in diluting the gravity current. These results are significant for desalination effluents because fluid diverted into the intrusion avoids the ecologically sensitive benthic layer and disperses more quickly than if it had continued to propagate along the bed.",

            "abstract": "Asteroids, comets and other primitive solar system bodies are key sources of information on the early solar system, on volatiles and organics delivered to the terrestrial planets, and on processes of planetary formation now observed in operation around other stars. Whether asteroids (in various size classes) are rubble piles or monolithic, and whether any porosity or internal voids contain volatiles, are first-order questions for understanding the delivery of volatiles to the early Earth, and for assessing impact hazards. Information on bulk composition aids discrimination between types and origins of primitive bodies, .e.g., the degree of aqueous alteration and bound-water content of carbonaceous chondrite bodies, and the volatile mass fraction of comets. Radar and radio methods can provide direct information on bulk composition, micro- and macro-porosity, body-scale internal structure, and on whether voids in rocky materials are volatile- or vacuum-filled. Such methods therefore figure prominently in current missions to primitive bodies (e.g., CONSERT) and in a variety of proposed missions. Radio transmitters necessary for conventional methods, however, add considerably to spacecraft mass and power requirements. Moreover, at many wavelengths most useful for radio sounding, powerful radio emission from the Sun strongly interferes with conventional signals.\nHere we present initial results from an investigation of how solar radio emission could serve as a natural resource for probing interiors of primitive bodies, rather than as interference. We briefly review methods for using stochastic radio illumination (aka noise radar methods), and illustrate the characteristics of solar radio emission relevant to mission design (e.g., observed intervals between emission events of specified intensity for different points in the solar cycle). We then discuss methods for selecting and interpreting observations in terms of interior properties, for bodies is different size classes (relative to the radio wavelength). Our preliminary results indicate considerable promise, certainly for bodies near 1 AU, and possibly also for bodies farther from the Sun.",

            "abstract": "Fine sediment is a crucial resource to the Colorado River ecosystem in Grand Canyon National Park, AZ. Much of the fine sediment is supplied during flash floods on the Little Colorado River (LCR) and its tributary, Moenkopi Wash (MW). Concentrations of suspended-sediment during flash floods on MW are often greater than 200,000 mg/L, and have exceeded 490,000 mg/L. Historically, the highest concentrations of suspended-sand measured in the LCR have been the result of flooding on MW.\nOver the last 65 years, widespread geomorphic change on MW has occurred that has likely altered the amount of fine sediment supplied to the LCR. Geomorphic changes include channel-bed aggradation, channel narrowing, increases in sinuosity, and non-native vegetation colonization of the banks and floodplains. Channel-bed aggradation has exceeded 2m, and the channel has narrowed by more than 66% in some areas. In these areas, the combination of aggradation and narrowing has resulted in the loss of cross-section area by nearly 90%. The direct causes of these changes are unclear and may include changes in stream flow and sediment supply caused by human activities and/or climate, and the increased sediment trapping efficiency of vegetation. However, the causes are likely a complex combination of all of the above. Although stream gages have existed on Moenkopi Wash since 1926, frequent changes in gaging locations combined with substantial flood attenuation during flash floods make it difficult to compile a long-term flow record at a single location. Therefore, we are using a kinematic-wave model to route floods between the historic gaging locations in order to construct a long-term flow record near the mouth of Moenkopi Wash. Analyses of the long-term flow record, combined with analyses of suspended-sediment transport are used to evaluate how the geomorphic transformation of Moenkopi Wash has affected sediment delivery to the Little Colorado and the Colorado Rivers.",

Outboard terraces at ~90 to 115 m below sea level (using a nominal water column velocity of 1500 m/s) may correlate with the Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS2); the last glacial maximum (LGM).  Submarine terraces were mapped on both the gentle sloping windward (west) and the steeper sloping leeward (east) sides of San Clemente Island. The submarine terrace’s depths are roughly the same on both sides of the island and suggest uniform uplift. These findings are consistent with the onshore mapping of terraces on San Clemente Island. The island exhibits a marked asymmetry both onshore and offshore, with a steeply dipping eastern margin and a gentle dipping western margin. This marked asymmetry cannot be explained by the uniform uplift of San Clemente Island based on the observed onshore and offshore terraces. In our model, the asymmetry of San Clemente Island records an early phase of predominantly extensional deformation during the middle to late Miocene, with San Clemente Island being the footwall block. Such asymmetry is also observed across the 30-mile bank and the Coronado Bank with steeply dipping eastern margins and gently dipping western margins. New regional multichannel seismic data and reprocessed industry data show no sediment divergence along the hangingwall blocks, which suggests that extensional deformation predated sedimentation. Finally, the elevations of the terraces on San Clemente Island are similar to those observed on the mainland from Baja California to Newport Beach, requiring any tectonic model fitting the uplift pattern of mainland terraces to account for the similar elevations not only along the margin but also across the margin out to 70 nautical miles offshore.",

            "abstract": "A better description of the amplitude of photosynthetic and respiratory gross CO2 fluxes at large scales is needed to improve our predictions of the current and future global CO2 cycle. Carbonyl sulphide (OCS) has been proposed as a new tracer of gross photosynthesis (GPP), as the uptake of OCS from the atmosphere is dominated by the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme abundant in leaves that also catalyses CO2 hydration during photosynthesis. But soils also exchange OCS with the atmosphere which complicates the retrieval of GPP from atmospheric budgets. Indeed soils can take up large amounts of OCS from the atmosphere as soil microorganisms also contain CA, and OCS emissions from soils have been reported in agricultural or anoxic soils. To date no mechanistic framework exists to describe this exchange of OCS between soils and the atmosphere but empirical results, once up-scaled to the global scale, indicate that OCS consumption by soils dominates over production and its contribution to the atmospheric budget is large, at about one third of the OCS uptake by vegetation, with also a large uncertainty. Here, we propose a new mechanistic model of the exchange of OCS between soils and the atmosphere that builds on our knowledge of soil CA activity from CO2 oxygen isotopes. In this model the OCS soil budget is described by a first-order reaction-diffusion-production equation, assuming that the hydrolysis of OCS by CA is total and irreversible. Using this model we are able to explain the observed presence of an optimum temperature for soil OCS uptake and show how this optimum can shift to cooler temperatures in the presence of soil OCS emissions. Our model can also explain the observed optimum with soil moisture content previously described in the literature as a result of diffusional constraints on OCS hydrolysis. In order to simulate the exact OCS uptake rates and patterns observed on several soils collected from a range of biomes, different CA activities had to be evoked in each soil type, coherent with that for CO2 isotopes given the differences in affinity of CA for both trace gases.",

            "abstract": "To improve predictions of naturally emitted CH4 from northern wetlands, it is necessary to further examine the methanogenic pathways in these wetlands. Stable isotope C ratios (δ13C) have been used as a robust tool to distinguish different pathways, but different sources of parent compounds (acetate and CO2) with unique δ13C may add complexity to previously established criteria. Large portions of peatlands accommodate a mixture of different sphagna and sedges. Plant species may look very similar and belong to the same genus but are different morphologically and physiologically. To better understand the relationships between surface vegetation patterns and methanogenic pathways, 26 peatland sites were studied in Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska in summers of 2014 and 2015. These sites were ordinated using multiple factor analysis into 3 clusters based on pH, temp, CH4 and volatile fatty acids production rates, δ13C values, and surface vegetation species/pattern. In the low-pH trophic cluster (pH~3.5), non-vascular/vascular plant ratios (NV/V) were ~ 0.87 and dominated by diverse Sphagnum species and specific sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum), and fermentation was the dominant end-point in decomposition with no CH4 detected. Although NV/V is about the same in the intermediate cluster (0.74) (pH~4.5), and Sphagnum squarrosum was largely present, both hydrogenotrophic (HM) and acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM) were very active. Syntrophy was present at certain sites, which may provide CO2 with unique δ13C for CH4 production. At the highest pH trophic cluster examined in this study (pH~5), non-vascular plants were almost not existent and Carex aquatilis dominated. CH4 production rates (mainly HM) were slower than those in the intermediate cluster and the apparent fractionation factor a was lower than in the sites with syntrophy, which warrants further investigation of the position and compound specific δ13C analysis of volatile fatty acids.",

British Columbia geologic map (Geoscience Map 2009-1A) shows that this area also consists of many crosscutting minor faults in addition to the San Juan Fault north of the LRF.\nTo investigate the seismic evidence of the subsurface structures of these minor faults and of possible hidden active structures in this area, precise earthquake locations are required. In this study, we relocate 941 earthquakes reported by Canadian National Seismograph Network (CNSN) catalog from 2000 to 2015 within a 100km x 55km study area surrounding the LRF. We use HypoDD [Waldhauser, F., 2001] double-difference relocation method by combining P/S phase arrivals provided by the CNSN at 169 stations and waveform data with correlation coefficient values greater than 0.7 at 50 common stations and event separation less than 10km. A total of 900 out of the 931 events satisfy the above relocation criteria. Velocity model used is a 1-D model extracted from the Ramachandran et al. (2005) model. Average relative location errors estimated by the bootstrap method are 546.5m (horizontal) and 1128.6m (in depth). Absolute errors reported by SVD method for individual clusters are ~100m in both dimensions.\n We select 5 clusters visually according to their epicenters (see figure). Cluster 1 is parallel to the LRF and a thrust FID #60. Clusters 2 and 3 are bounded by two faults: FID #75, a northeast dipping thrust marking the southwestern boundary of the Wrangellia terrane, and FID #2 marking the northern boundary. Clusters 4 and 5, to the northeast and northwest of Victoria respectively, however, do not represent the surface traces of any mapped faults. The depth profile of Cluster 5 depicts a hidden northeast dipping structure, while other clusters illustrate near-vertical structures. Seismicity of Clusters 1 and 3 suggests vertically dipping patterns for FID #60 and FID #2, while Cluster 4 may reveal a hidden vertically dipping structure. It is noteworthy that most events in this area are deeper than 20km, but the explanation for such deep earthquakes is still unclear.",

The Cucomongo Canyon Restraining bend lies to the south of Fish Lake Valley, and causes localized uplift. The developmental history of the Cucomongo Canyon restraining bend and the resultant uplift, deformation, and displacement is the focus of an integrated study by the Miles Geoscience Center at the University of Texas at Dallas. This specific part of the study focuses on the southernmost section of Fish Lake Valley, where Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are juxtaposed with Cenozoic sediments on multiple faulted boundaries. Structural constraints are not very well known as the faults are locally obscured by Quaternary alluvial deposits of various ages. Analysis of high resolution topography, produced from LiDAR scanning performed by the Miles team, and imagery shows subtle geomorphic expressions related to faulting. A near surface geophysical survey utilizing high resolution seismic refraction and microGal gravity measurements was done to explore the subsurface beneath the alluvium. Forward models were created to identify faults and ascertain vertical offsets and orientations. The geophysical models indicate a zone of extensional deformation north of the restraining bend",

            "abstract": "Release of a volatile phase, usually considered to be water, from the downgoing plate and the upward migration of volatile saturated melt toward higher temperatures in the interior of the wedge is one mechanism for generation of melt at a convergent plate boundary (Gill, 1981; Grove et al. 2012). However, other volatiles, including CO2, may be released. Adding CO2 reduces the water mole fraction in melt that is stable at a given temperature. Dissolved water has a large effect on melt viscosity; but, CO2 has practically none, leading to the possibility of significant viscosity variations in melt rising through the mantle wedge. This may have important implications for the heterogeneity of erupted melts as discussed below.\n“Saffman-Taylor” instability occurs as a low viscosity fluid flowing in porous media displaces another of higher viscosity. The low viscosity fluid forms fingers that extend progressively into the high viscosity fluid. For miscible fluids (no surface tension effects) in a non-compacting matrix (Chouke, 1982), the development of fingers is controlled by interdiffusion of the fluids.\nNumerical experiments to be reported examine viscous fingering in a compacting permeable matrix at conditions appropriate for melt generation in a mantle wedge. Mixing of melts with different CO2/water by diffusion in silicate melts alone is generally slow; however, fingering reduces the scale of CO2/water heterogeneity making diffusion more effective. We explore the persistence of a CO2/water heterogeneity of a given scale rising through the mantle wedge at a rate fast enough to preserve 230Th disequilibrium. The rise height over which heterogeneity can persist as fingers develop depends on the viscosity, i.e. CO2/water, variation initially present; viscosity variations on the order of 10% allow km-scale heterogeneity to persist over vertical scales comparable to the height of the wedge.",

            "abstract": "Multiphase flow in geologic materials is an important area of research for hydrology and oil recovery. A valuable tool for determining how liquid water and/or hydrocarbons transport through soils and rocks is neutron tomography due to its high sensitivity to hydrogen. This technique allows for the 3D reconstruction of the liquid phase in the sample. In order to resolve the solid phase structure of the sample it is necessary to perform x-ray tomography which often must be conducted at a separate facility from the neutron imaging. When imaging deformable samples or stochastic flow this delay in imaging modes ruins the analysis as the sample is no longer in an identical state. To address this issue and bring a unique capability to NIST, an instrument has been commissioned for the simultaneous imaging with neutrons and x-rays. The new system orients a micro-focus 90 kV x-ray beam 90° to the neutron beam which facilitates rapid dual-mode tomography of samples. Current highest spatial resolutions are 20 µm and 10 µm for the neutron and x-ray detectors, respectively, with upcoming improvements. This presentation will focus on introducing the new system and demonstrating its ability with several cases. Examples of high resolution water uptake and high speed imaging of uptake dynamics will be given.",

Comprised of savanna, shrub, tropical forest and a number of agricultural crops, the extensive fires burn belt covers central and south of NSSA during dry season (from October to March) contributes to one of the highest biomass burning rate per km2 in the world. Due to smoke particles’ absorption effects of solar radiation, they can modify the surface and atmosphere temperature and thus change atmospheric stability, height of the boundary layer, regional atmospheric circulation, evaporation rate, cloud formation, and precipitation. Hence, smoke particles emitted from biomass burning over NSSA region has a significant influence to the air quality, weather and climate variability. In this study, the first version of this Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEER.v1) emissions of several smoke constituents including light-absorbing organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) are applied to a state-of-science meteorology-chemistry model as NOAA Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). We analyzed WRF-Chem simulations of surface and vertical distribution of various pollutants and their direct radiative effects in conjunction with satellite observation data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar data with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO) to strengthen the importance of combining space measured emission products like FEER.v1 emission inventory with mesoscale model over intense biomass burning region, especially in area where ground-based air-quality and radiation-related observations are limited or absent.",

            "abstract": "In order to predict the dynamic responses of newly consolidated cohesive sediment beds, a better understanding of the material rheological properties (bulk density, ρ, kinematic viscosity, ν, and shear modulus, G, assuming mud is a simple Voigt viscoelastic model) of these sediment beds is needed. An acoustic approach that uses a commercially available 250 kHz shear wave transducer and tone-burst waves has been developed to measure those properties. This approach uses a 86.3 mm long delay-line (DL) to separate the generated pressure and shear waves, and measures the reflected shear waves as well as the reflected pressure waves caused at the interface between the delay line and the mud to interpret these properties. By using materials (i.e., air, water, olive oil, and honey) with available rheological properties to establish a calibration relationship between the information carried by the measured reflected waves and those given material properties, the mud properties as well as thνe change of these properties during consolidation can be interpreted. Using jelly pudding as a check, a value of G ≈ 12310 N/m2 and ν ≈ 5 x 10-5 m2/s were estimated. For the consolidating kaolinite bed (with zero salinity and initial suspended sediment concentration about 420 g/cm3), the measurements show that the shear modulus developed after about 40 hours and approached a value on the order of 15000 N/m2 after about 100 hours. The initial kinematic viscosity was about 5 x 10-4 m2/s, and it decreased slowly with time and approached a low plateau between 10-6 and 10-7 m2/s after 300 hours. The measured bulk density showed a small increasing rate during the entire consolidation period, except at a short period between 80 and 90 hours after consolidation. Results from this study suggest a promising approach for developing an in-situ instrument to measure mud properties, as well as many other materials in other industries.",

A key tsunamigenic source for New Zealand is the Hikurangi Trench that lies offshore on the eastside of the North Island. The trench is the result of the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Island at a rate of 40-45 mm/yr. Though there have been no M9 historical events on the Hikurangi Trench, events in this magnitude range are considered in the latest version of the National Seismic Hazard Maps for New Zealand (Stirling et al., 2012).\nThe RMS modeling approaches the tsunami lifecycle in three stages: event generation, ocean wave propagation, and coastal inundation. The tsunami event generation is modeled based on seafloor deformation resulting from an event rupture model. The ocean wave propagation and coastal inundation are modeled using a RMS-developed numerical solver, implemented on graphic processing units using a finite-volume approach to approximate two-dimensional, shallow-water wave equations over the ocean and complex topography. As the tsunami waves enter shallow water and approach the coast, the RMS model calculates the propagation of the waves along the wet-dry interface considering variable land friction.\nThe initiation and characteristics of the tsunami are based on the event rupture model. As there have been no historical M9 events on the Hikurangi Trench, this rupture characterization posed unique challenges. This study examined the impacts of a suite of event rupture models to understand the key drivers in the variations in the tsunami inundation footprints. The goal was to develop a suite of tsunamigenic event characterizations that represent a range of potential tsunami outcomes for M9 events on the Hikurangi Trench. The focus of this case study is the Napier region as it represents an important exposure concentration in the region and has experience tsunami inundations in the past including during the 1931 Ms7.8 Hawkes Bay Earthquake.",

The amplitudes and phases of the semidiurnal tides are derived first and a analytical method is developed to compute the vertical fluxes of heat and Na induced by dissipation semidiurnal tides. The derived heat/Na fluxes are highly sensitive to the phase differences of the semidiurnal tides in vertical winds with those in temperatures/Na densities. The uncertainties of the fluxes are estimated. The data collected from March 2013 to February 2014 are used for such study, thus the seasonal variations of the vertical fluxes are examined.

The knowledge of the uncertainties is important for the interpretation of results, but also for model-data-integration where uncertainties of input parameters play an important role for parameter estimations. The estimates of uncertainties rely either on time series analysis or on comparisons between collocated towers or comparisons in time under similar bio-meteorological conditions. We will present a unique data set from 3 collocated EC towers (distance of 500 - 600 m) at the long-term EC site ‘Majadas del Tietar’, Spain. The site is a Savanna type ecosystem with oak trees and grass in the understory. Cattle are grazing the area from autumn to early summer. The combination of EC data and hyperspectral remote sensing data from aircraft flight with the CASI system allows to associate flux differences to differences in the spectral properties of the surface within the footprints. The drawback is that maps of VI can only be used as long as the vegetation (structure or phenology) is not changing. But not only vegetation indices (VI), also differences of the full spectra will be used to determine differences of footprint areas. First results show correlations between flux differences and differences of VI within the footprint areas. This indicates that multi-tower approaches and paired observations from one tower (if the footprint area is not identical) may overestimate the uncertainty of eddy covariance measurements.",

Its spectral channels are centered at 355, 380, 445, 470*, 555, 660*, and 865* nm, where the asterisk denotes the polarimetric bands. In order to retrieve information from the AirMSPI observations, we developed a efficient and flexible retrieval code that can jointly retrieve aerosol and water leaving radiance simultaneously. The forward model employs a coupled Markov Chain (MC) [2] and adding/doubling [3] radiative transfer method which is fully linearized and integrated with a multi-patch retrieval algorithm to obtain aerosol and water leaving radiance/Chl-a information. Various constraints are imposed to improve convergence and retrieval stability. We tested the aerosol and water leaving radiance retrievals using the AirMSPI radiance and polarization measurements by comparing to the retrieved aerosol concentration, size distribution, water-leaving radiance, and chlorophyll concentration to the values reported by the USC SeaPRISM AERONET-OC site off the coast of Southern California. In addition, the MC-based retrievals of aerosol properties were compared with GRASP ([4-5]) retrievals for selected cases. The MC-based retrieval approach was then used to systematically explore the benefits of AirMSPI’s ultraviolet and polarimetric channels, the use of multiple view angles, and constraints provided by inclusion of bio-optical models of the water-leaving radiance.\n",

            "abstract": "The electric fields in thunderstorms can exceed the breakdown value locally near hydrometeors. But are fields high enough and the regions large enough to initiate a streamer discharge? And where would a sufficient density of free electrons come from to start the discharge in the humid air that rapidly binds electrons in water-clusters?\nTo analyse these questions, we investigate the interaction of extensive air showers (created by high energy cosmic particles) with the hydrometeors in a thunderstorm. The extensive air showers are modelled in full detail with CORSIKA (https://web.ikp.kit.edu/corsika/). As extensive air showers are occurring with a frequency that strongly depends on their size, proper stochastics are derived to cope with the large number of random variables in the system, such as: occurrence, primary energy, altitude of first interaction and inclination. These variables are important factors that determine the extremes of the high energy particle flux passing through a hydrometeor at a given altitude. In addition, the interaction of the high energy particle flux with the hydrometeor is modelled with EGS5 (http://rcwww.kek.jp/research/egs/egs5.html). Finally the streamer initiation and evolution is modelled by our 2.5D streamer fluid code that now can include dielectric bodies; here we used the frequency dependent dielectric permittivity of ice, accounting for the fact that ice can not polarise instantaneously.",

In this data sparse areas, reanalysis products are arguably the best available source of infromation on the four dimensional structure of the atmosphere. Here in-suit observations at 12 weather stations (AWS) with altitude > 5000 m a.s.l from the Tibetan Observation and Research Platform (TORP) have been collected since 2005. These data are used for a comprehensive comparison with 10 reanalysis products including 20thC, CFSR, ERA-Int, FNL, HAR, JRA25, JRA55, MERRA, NCEP1, and NCEP2. The variables include six hour, daily and monthly temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. Statistical results show that all reanalysis products can capture much of the synoptic-scale variability of in-situ observations although reanalysis values are systematically higher than the observations. With the increase of time scale, the performance of all reanalysis products get better. Compararison with in-situ observtion verifies the best overall performance of ERA-Int in temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, and the second best performance of JRA55.",

            "abstract": "The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in stratospheric halogen loading, which is expected to result in less chemical depletion of ozone and thus increased stratospheric ozone amounts [WMO, 2011]. To unambiguously identify a positive ozone response directly attributable to declining halogen levels, consistent long-term ozone profile observations are required. Although near-global satellite observations of the ozone profile have been made since 1978, no single instrument has covered this entire period, meaning that merged data series combining several instrument records are required to fully understand long-term ozone changes.\nAll available long-term data sets are analysed for trends in the period 1979-2012. The data sets are based on a varying combination of instruments including SBUV/2, SAGE-2, HALOE, UARS-MLS, OSIRIS, SAGE-3, GOMOS, ACE-FTS, and Aura-MLS. The analyses reveal that all data sets represent seasonality and interannual variability well, with those data sets based on the same instrument set tending to be more similar, despite different merging techniques being used. A multiple linear regression analysis reveals that long-term ozone trends are similar in the period prior to 1997, but show more diversity for the period since 1998. This is likely a result of the different instruments used to construct each data set, which vary more in the latter period. These results have important implications in terms of the detection of ozone recovery resulting from the reduction in stratospheric halogen loading. This work was done as part of the Si2N (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC), the International Ozone Commission (IOC), the ozone focus area of the Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations (IGACO-O3), and the Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) - SPARC/IOC/IGACO-O3/NDACC) initiative.",

            "abstract": "Elevated nutrient fluxes from agricultural catchments affect downstream water resources. A method to assess nutrient fluxes is the evaluation of the export regime. The export regime classifies the relation between concentration and discharge and integrates mobilization as well as retention processes. Solutes can be exported chemostatically (variance of concentration << variance of discharge) or chemodynamically (variance of concentration ≥ variance of discharge). Starting point of this study is the evaluation of export regimes of nitrate in a series of neighboring sub-catchments of the Central German River Bode catchment. We found an accretion pattern of nitrate with increasing concentration when discharge is increasing and thus a chemodynamic export regime. Here we follow a nested approach and have a closer look at the controls of nitrate export in the small (1.4 km2) headwater catchment of the Sauerbach stream. The Sauerbach catchment is dominated by agricultural land use and is characterized by tile drains. We hypothesize that discharge as well as nitrate export is controlled by the groundwater head variability over time. To that end we follow a joint data analysis of discharge, groundwater heads and nitrate concentrations in groundwater, tile drains and surface water. At the gauging station the nitrate export is chemodynamic exhibiting the typical accretion pattern also found at the larger scale. Our data analysis shows that nitrate export regime is in two ways controlled by the depth to groundwater and the groundwater head variability: Discharge increases with increasing groundwater heads due to the activation of tile drains. On the other hand, depth to groundwater and passage through the unsaturated zone is the major control of aquifer nitrate concentration. At wells with larger depth to groundwater nitrate concentrations are significantly lower than at more shallow wells indicating retention processes in the unsaturated zone. Therefore the concentration in the stream increases with increasing heads since the activated tiles drain shallow groundwater with higher nitrate concentrations. We can thus show that the export regime of nitrate provides insight into the spatial relation of discharge producing zones and nitrate source zones within a catchment.",

            "abstract": "Predicting river channel evolution relies on an understanding of when and at what rate coarse sediment moves in a channel. Unfortunately, our predictive abilities are limited by the logistical challenges and potential dangers inherent in current techniques for monitoring sediment transport during flood events, especially in steep, highly active landscapes. However, the use of seismic signals near rivers shows promise as a safe, low-cost method for studying sediment transport in these settings. Seismic signals near rivers are partially generated by both water turbulence and bedload sediment particles impacting the river bed during transport. Here, we attempt to isolate the seismic signatures of discharge and bedload transport in a steep mountain channel by examining high-frequency broadband seismic data from the well-studied Erlenbach stream (local slope of ~10%) in the Swiss Prealps. The extensive monitoring infrastructure and long history of sediment transport data at this field site allow us to independently constrain discharge, precipitation, and bedload transport during flood events over a two month field campaign. We perform a general linear least squares inversion of the seismic data, exploiting times with isolated rain or discharge events, to identify the spectral signals of water turbulence, rain, and bedload sediment transport. We find that the signal generated by rain exhibits a roughly broadband spectrum, while discharge and sediment transport exhibit power primarily in lower frequency bands. Our preliminary results indicate that with only precipitation and discharge data, it is possible to isolate the seismic signal of bedload transport in steep fluvial environments. Seismic studies may therefore have the potential to revolutionize our ability to monitor and understand these environments.",

At first, we estimate the locations of strong motion generation areas (SMGA) based on the teleseismic data inversion results by some other researchers. Then, preliminarily determine the total areas of SMGA referring to the scaling law introduced by Somerville et al. (1999). Finally, we implement the genetic algorithm searching for the optimized source parameters. Based on the source models, we synthetize the waveforms for the 18 stations located near the source region. Our results show that the comparison between the synthetic waveforms and the observed records agree each other very well. We find that there are five obvious SMGAs on the fault. The locations of the two of them are similar with the asperities from the teleseismic data inversion. However, the combined strong motion generation areas and the rise time we obtained are smaller than those values predicted by the extension value of the scaling law by Somerville et al. (1999).",

            "abstract": "GPS (Global Positioning System) radio occultation (RO) data proved to be a great tool for atmospheric monitoring and studies. In the recent decade, they were frequently used for analyses of the internal gravity waves in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere region. Internal gravity waves are widely recognized to contribute significantly to the energy and angular momentum transport. Due to their role in affecting the atmospheric circulation and turbulent mixing they are one of the main processes controlling the composition and structure even of the UT/LS region.\nAtmospheric density is the first quantity of state gained in the GPS RO retrieval process and is not burdened by any additional assumptions. However, there are no studies elaborating in details the utilization of GPS RO density profiles for gravity waves analyses. In the presented study, we introduce a method for the density background separation and a methodology for the internal gravity waves analysis using the GPS RO density profiles. Correspondence between analytical forms of the density and widely used temperature background profiles is examined. Comparison between the power spectrum of the normalized density and normalized dry temperature fluctuations in the lower stratospheric region further confirms the advantages of the density profiles utilization. In the vertical range of 8 km 40 km, to avoid possible violation of the WKB approximation around the tropopause, results of the continuous wavelet transform are presented and discussed. In the LS region, analysis of global and temporal variation of gravity wave activity is done and regions of breakdown of IGWs are examined. Specific behavior of IGW activity in the Northern Pacific / Eastern Asia region is revealed, possible wave sources are examined and its influence on the UT/LS region is discussed. Finally, the limits of our approach are discussed and the advantages of the density usage are listed.",

            "abstract": "Large hydrosystem modelling and understanding is a complex process depending on regional and local processes. A nested interface concept has been implemented in the hydrosystem modelling platform for a large alluvial plain model (300 km2) part of a 11000 km2 multi-layer aquifer system, included in the Seine basin (65000 km2, France). The platform couples hydrological and hydrogeological processes through four spatially distributed modules (Mass balance, Unsaturated Zone, River and Groundwater). An automatic multi-scale calibration procedure is proposed. Using different data sets from regional scale (117 gauging stations and 183 piezometers over the 65000 km2) to the intermediate scale(dense past piezometric snapshot), it permits the calibration and homogenization of model parameters over scales.\nThe stepwise procedure starts with the optimisation of the water mass balance parameters at regional scale using a conceptual 7 parameters bucket model coupled with the inverse modelling tool PEST. The multi-objective function is derived from river discharges and their de-composition by hydrograph separation. The separation is performed at each gauging station using an automatic procedure based one Chapman filter. Then, the model is run at the regional scale to provide recharge estimate and regional fluxes to the groundwater local model. Another inversion method is then used to determine the local hydrodynamic parameters. This procedure used an initial kriged transmissivity field which is successively updated until the simulated hydraulic head distribution equals a reference one obtained by krigging. Then, the local parameters are upscaled to the regional model by renormalisation procedure.\nThis multi-scale automatic calibration procedure enhances both the local and regional processes representation. Indeed, it permits a better description of local heterogeneities and of the associated processes which are transposed into the regional model, improving the overall performances of the two nested models.",

            "abstract": "Experiments demonstrating asymmetrical dispersive transport of a conservative tracer across interfaces between different porous materials have recently been performed. Here, this phenomenon is studied numerically on the pore scale. The flow field is derived by solving the Stokes equation. The dispersive transport is simulated by a large number of particles undergoing random walks under the simultaneous action of convection and diffusion. Two main two-dimensional configurations are studied; each consists of two segments (called coarse and fine) with the same structure, porosity, and length along the main flow, but different characteristic solid/pore sizes. One structure consists of two channels containing cavities of different sizes, and the second of square “grains” of different sizes. At time t=0, a large number of particles is injected (as a pulse) around a given cross-section. The corresponding breakthrough curves (BTCs) are registered as functions of time at six different cross sections. Calculations are made twice; in the first case (CtoF), particles are injected in the coarse side and are transported towards the fine one; in the second one (FtoC), the opposite case is studied. These calculations are performed for various Péclet numbers (Pe). Comparison of the resulting BTCs shows features that are similar to experimental observations, but with qualitative and quantitative differences. The influences of the medium, of the injection and observation planes, and of Pe are detailed and discussed. A BTC for pulse injection can be characterized by its maximum M(t_M) and the time t_M at which it occurs. The observed differences for channels bounded by cavities are very small. However for the granular structures, M(t_M) is always larger for FtoC than for CtoF ; t_M depends on all the parameters, namely Pe, the size ratio between the large and small grains, the injection and the observation planes.",

            "abstract": "In order to investigate possible seismo-electromagnetic signals of local earthquakes seismological and magnetotelluric measurements were conducted on the Nicoya-Pensinsula of Costa Rica between May 2010 and August 2011. During this time 25 local earthquakes were recorded on the magnetotelluric stations. Analysis shows that the seismological and the electromagnetic data are correlated. P- and S-waves could be identified on all components. The frequency content of the B-field is similar to that of the seismic acceleration. The frequency content of the electric field is limited to 2 to 4 Hz. The waveforms and amplitudes of the seismological and electromagnetic signals correlate partially, but envelopes show up to 1 second time shifts between maxima. We estimated the dimension of different effects to find an explanation for the observed waveform of the data. The coseismoelectric effect of the incoming seismic wave produces an electric field which is in the same order of the observed electric field. But the origin for the observed narrow frequency band as well as the occurrence of a seismo-electric S-phase remain unsolved. The change of the magnetic flux through the coil by tilt induces a voltage which is large enough to explain the signal of the magnetic components. A tilt of 10-5° produces a voltage of 5 mV. Other effects such as a lateral movement of the measurement equipment can be neglected. The most surprising observation of our survey which can not be explained by the existing seismo-electromagnetic theory is that the coda appears similarly strong for seismic and seismo-electric field records. An explanation could be seismo-electric converted waves generated at fluid bearing fractures and faults of the upper crust.",

With complete knowledge of the core flow, the imaged toroidal field well reproduces magnitude and pattern of the dynamo model toroidal field. However, quality of the imaging depends strongly on latitude. In particular, amplitude and correlation between the dynamo model and the imaged toroidal fields decline substantially at low-latitude. Such degradation in imaging quality is probably due to the fact that the low-latitude flux patches in the radial magnetic field are manifested as a result of flux expulsion, an effect of magnetic diffusion, which is not incorporated in the method.",

            "abstract": "Mesospheric ice layers, observed as noctilucent clouds (NLC) from ground, are the visible manifestation of extreme conditions in the polar summer mesopause region. Temperatures fall very low so that water vapor can freeze condence, which at 69°N usually occurs beginning of June. However, in 2013 the ALOMAR RMR lidar observed the first NLC on 21 May and the clouds reoccured during the following days. These were the earliest detections since 20 years and indicated an about 10 days earlier onset of the mesospheric ice season. This is supported by the colocated MAARSY radar which showed the occurrence rates of polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) increasing faster than usual.\nThe exceptional case was accompanied by ∼6 K lower temperatures and higher water vapor mixing ratios at NLC altitudes above ALOMAR from end of April until beginning of June as measured by the MLS instrument onboard the AURA satellite. Using MERRA reanalysis data we will show that the zonal mean temperature as well as the dynamic conditions in the Arctic middle atmosphere deviated in spring 2013 significantly from the mean conditions of the last 20 years. The planetary wave activity in the high latitude stratosphere was enhanced from 20 April to beginning of May. The colder and wetter upper mesosphere in May 2013 is attributed to this unusual late planetary wave activity in the stratosphere, introducing a strong upwelling in the mesosphere, lower temperatures and an upward transport of water vapor, which finally resulted into earlier existence conditions for mesospheric ice particles. For the southern hemisphere a high correlation between winter/summer transition in the stratosphere and onset of mesospheric ice is known as intra-hemispheric coupling. We regard the processes in the Arctic middle atmosphere in spring 2013 as a first evidence for intra-hemispheric coupling in the northern hemisphere, extending from the stratosphere into the mesopause region.",

            "abstract": "When fractures are sufficiently dense, they partition fractured media into blocks. The determination of the statistical properties of these blocks is important for the oil industry, for instance; the oil which is initially located in the porous medium may flow into the fractures and this transfer is controlled by the block geometry. Our first purpose is to determine the geometrical properties of these blocks; little is known about them except for infinite fractures.\nFractures of various shapes and of various densities are generated isotropically with random positions. The blocks are determined after the fractures are triangulated. Therefore, each solid block is limited by several triangulated plane faces. Then, the neighbors of a given triangle are identified. When this is done for all the triangles, the independent connected components of the triangles are identified by a pseudo-diffusion algorithm. Each independent component corresponds to a block. The block density corresponds to the number of blocks per unit volume.\nThen, the volume, the surface and the number of faces are calculated for each block. The dimensionless density rho’ which is equal to the average number of intersections of a fracture with other fractures, varies between 1 to 150, for three shapes, namely squares, rectangles with an aspect ratio of 4 and 20-gons which are very close to disks.\nSome of the results can be summarized as follows. The block density is proportional to rho’**4, independently of the fracture shape. The fraction of volume occupied by blocks follows a power law as well until it gets close to 1.\nUnexpectedly, the mean block volume and the mean surface area of the blocks start increasing with rho’ and decrease for large rho’ where they follow the predictions for infinite fractures. The average number of faces of a block increases until it reaches 6 as predicted for infinite fractures.\nDimensionless relations which are convenient to apply, summarize the numerical findings.",

            "abstract": "Leaf phenology plays a major role in land-atmosphere mass and energy exchanges. Much work has focused on phenological responses to light and temperature, but less to leaf area changes during dry periods. Because the duration of droughts is expected to increase under future climates in seasonally-dry as well as mesic environments, it is crucial to (i) predict drought-related phenological changes and (ii) to develop physiologically-sound models of leaf area dynamics during dry periods. Several optimization criteria have been proposed to model leaf area adjustment as soil moisture decreases. Some theories are based on the plant carbon (C) balance, hypothesizing that leaf area will decline when instantaneous net photosynthetic rates become negative (equivalent to maximization of cumulative C gain). Other theories draw on hydraulic principles, suggesting that leaf area should adjust to either maintain a constant leaf water potential (isohydric behavior) or to avoid leaf water potentials with negative impacts on photosynthesis (i.e., minimization of water stress). Evergreen leaf phenology is considered as a control case. Merging these theories into a unified framework, we quantify the effect of phenological strategy and climate forcing on the net C gain over the entire growing season. By accounting for the C costs of leaf flushing and the gains stemming from leaf photosynthesis, this metric assesses the effectiveness of different phenological strategies, under different climatic scenarios. Evergreen species are favored only when the dry period is relatively short, as they can exploit most of the growing season, and only incur leaf maintenance costs during the short dry period. In contrast, deciduous species that lower maintenance costs by losing leaves are advantaged under drier climates. Moreover, among drought-deciduous species, isohydric behavior leads to lowest C gains. Losing leaves gradually so as to maintain a net C uptake equal to zero during the driest period in the growing season provides the highest gain. Since these strategies are all defined based on often-modeled quantities, they can be implemented in ecosystem models depending on plant functional type and climate.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of the magnetostratigraphy of Arctic Ocean sediments is muddled by multiple reversals that start a few meters below the sea floor. This level, which was earlier interpreted as the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary, roughly coincides with the base of Marine Isotope Stage 6 (ca. 128 ka). Results of thermal demagnetization and analyses of magnetic extracts led Channell and Xuan (2010) to propose a self-reversal mechanism caused by oxidation of primary titanomagnetite to secondary titanomaghemite. We present a detailed study of the natural remanent magnetization acquired by the 7 m long core LR12-PC06, which was collected from the Lomonosov Ridge during the LOMROG expedition in 2012 and can be directly correlated to the ACEX depth scale by grain size and density profiles. Similar to previous studies, the magnetic directions of many initially normally magnetized samples trended towards reversed during alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to 100 mT, although this change was often associated with a significant increase in intensity. Experiments investigating the possibility of spurious laboratory magnetizations as a cause of the aforementioned intensity increase included increasing the AF level to 120 mT. In contrast to previous studies employing less intense fields, our more intense fields removed the reversed component and directions returned to normal. While our trial study of LR12-PC06 is by no means conclusive, it shows that one component, with a relatively narrow and medium coercivity spectrum, acquired a reversed natural remanence that is superimposed upon a normal magnetization with a wider coercivity spectrum and multiple possible contributors. We suggest that the reversed component, when characterized by a narrow coercivity spectrum, can be considered as a secondary magnetization, probably acquired by a rapidly formed and fine grained diagenetic mineral. Our applied method and results may help discriminate between true and apparent reversal boundaries.",

            "abstract": "A detailed field study on a small test site of agricultural land situated in loess region in Southern Moravia (Czech Republic) and laboratory analyses were carried out in order to test the applicability of magnetic methods in assessing soil erosion. Haplic Chernozem, the original dominant soil unit in the area, is nowadays progressively transformed into different soil units along with intense soil erosion. As a result, an extremely diversified soil cover structure has developed due to the erosion. The site was characterized by a flat upper part while the middle part, formed by a substantive side valley, is steeper. We carried out field measurements of magnetic susceptibility on a regular grid, resulting in 101 data points. The bulk soil material for laboratory investigation was gathered from all the grid points.\nValues of the magnetic susceptibility are spatially distributed depending on the terrain. Higher values were measured in the flat upper part (where the original top horizon remained). The lowest values of were obtained on the steep valley sides. Here the original topsoil was eroded and mixed by tillage with the soil substrate (loess).\nA soil profile unaffected by erosion was investigated in detail. The vertical distribution of magnetic susceptibility along this ”virgin” profile was measured in laboratory on the samples collected with 2-cm spacing. The undisturbed profile shows several soil horizons. Horizons Ac and A show a slight increase in magnetic susceptibility up to a depth of about 70 cm. Horizon A/Ck is characterized by a decrease in susceptibility, and the underlying C horizon (h > 103 cm) has a very low value of magnetic susceptibility. The differences between the values of susceptibility in the undisturbed soil profile and the magnetic signal after uniform mixing the soil material as a result of tillage and erosion are fundamental for the estimation of soil loss in the studied test field. Using the uneroded profile from the studied locality as a basis for examining the changes in cultivated soils, tillage homogenization model can be applied to predict changes in the surface soil magnetism with progressive soil erosion. The model is very well applicable at the studied site.\nAcknowledgement: This study was supported by NAZV Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic through grant No QJ1230319.",

            "abstract": "Particle aggregation is a key process that significantly affects dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic ash, with obvious implications for the associated hazards. Most theoretical studies of particle aggregation have been based on the Smoluchowski Coagulation Equation (SCE), which describes the expected time evolution of the total grain-size distribution under the hypothesis that particles can collide and stick together following specific mathematical relations (kernels). Nonetheless, the practical application of the SCE to real erupting scenarios is made extremely difficult – if not even impossible - by the large number of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) which have to be solved to study the typical sizes of volcanic ash (1 micron to 1 mm). We propose an algorithm to approximate the discrete solutions of the SCE, which can describe the time evolution of the total grain-size distribution of the erupted material with an increased computational efficiency. This algorithm has been applied to observed volcanic eruptions (i.e., Eyjafjallajokull 2010, Sakurajima 2013 and Mt. Saint Helens 1980) to see if the commonly used kernels can explain field data and to study how aggregation processes can modify the tephra dispersal on the ground. Different scenarios of sticking efficiencies and aggregate porosity have been used to test the sensitiveness of the SCE to these parameters. Constraints on these parameters come from field observations and laboratory experiments.",

Experiments were performed “room-dry” (40-60% humidity, 8.5 -12.5 MPa normal stress) or “water-dampened” (0.5 ml distilled water, 3.5 MPa normal stress), with displacements up to 1m. Mineralogy and microstructures of pre and post-experiment material was investigated by quantitative X Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).\nThe starting material is composed of smectite (beidellite, 55.8 wt.%), illite (17.2 wt.%), quartz (8.5 wt.%), plagioclase (7.4 wt.%), K-feldspar (7.1 wt.%) and kaolinite (5 wt.%). At all investigated slip velocities, water-dampened gouges have peak and steady state frictional strengths (0.04<μ<0.1) lower than room dry gouges and are velocity-neutral to velocity-weakening. Under room-dry conditions, the gouges are velocity-strengthening at intermediate velocities (0.001 – 0.1 m s -1 , 0.25<μ<0.35) and strongly velocity-weakening at slip velocities > 0.1 m s -1 (μ<0.1).\nA detectable amount of amorphous material formed in room-dry experiments at low and high-slip velocities, likely by comminution and disordering of smectite.Room-dry gouges deformed at low slip velocities are foliated (P foliation) and cut by a series of shear bands lying either sub-parallel (Y) or at low angles to gouge layer boundaries (R). At high slip velocities, room-dry gouges contain a weak P foliation and a single, prominent Y shear. Deformed water-dampened gouges display homogeneous internal texture, lacking foliation or systematically organized fracture sets.\nIn room-dry gouges, velocity strengthening at intermediate slip velocities and a pronounced peak friction at high slip velocities, represent an energy barrier to seismic rupture propagation. The lack of such a barrier in water-dampened conditions is compatible with propagation of the Tohoku-Oki rupture in wet sediments to the trench and with large coseismic slip at shallow depths. The low friction measured in water-dampened gouges is consistent with the small thermal anomaly measured along the plate boundary fault.",

            "abstract": "Temporal stability of model parameters is one major concern in hydrological modeling especially under non-stationary conditions including climate change and variation in catchment characteristics. In this study, we focus on the impact of variation in catchment characteristics on model parameters stability. According to the annual cycle of vegetation phenology inferred by the variability of NDVI, we split one year to growth period (May-October) and dormant period (November-April), and calibrate the parameters of a semi-distributed model to 19 growth periods and 19 dormant periods during 1982-2000 in the upper Han River basin of China (the largest tributary of Yangtze River). The results show that the calibrated parameters present significant non-stationarity, where the variation magnitude for the dormant periods is larger than that for the growth periods. The variation of the parameters can be attributed to the variation of vegetation cover, which is the most visible and detectable feature in all kinds of catchment characteristics experiencing change during the study period. Furthermore, it can be considered as an index representing the self-organization of catchment characteristics due to co-evolution of vegetation, soil, topography, geology, and so on, and even the feedbacks between climate and various catchment characteristics. We develop a time-varying parameterization framework consisting of 14 unitary regression equations for NDVI and model parameters, and embed this framework in the hydrological model. The correlation coefficients between model parameters and NDVI are 0.50-0.75 for the growth periods, and 0.42-0.63 for the dormant periods, indicating that the variability of calibrated parameters can reflect the changing conditions of the study area. The simulations of the modified parameterization scheme suggest that considering time instability of model parameters can improve the modeling performance for both the high flow portions and the low flow portions under non-stationary conditions.",

A geothermal gradient of 36°C km-1 suggests that such subsurface granites form an economically viable hot dry rock reservoir at > 4 km depth. In order to assess the likelihood of reactivating any pre-existing fractures during hydraulic reservoir stimulation, slip and dilation tendency analyses (Morris et al. 1996) were carried out. For this purpose, we determined orientations of pre-existing fractures in 14 granite exposures along the southern border fault of an MGCR basement high. Additionally, the strike of 192 Permian magmatic dikes affecting the granite was considered. This analysis revealed a prevalence of NW-SE-striking fractures (mainly joints, extension veins, dikes and subordinately brittle faults) with a maximum at 030/70 (dip azimuth/dip).\nBorehole data and earthquake focal mechanisms reveal a maximum horizontal stress SHmax trending N150°E and a strike-slip regime. Effective in-situ stress magnitudes at 4.5 km depth, assuming hydrostatic conditions and frictional equilibrium along pre-existing fractures with a friction coefficient of 0.85 yielded 230 and 110 MPa for SHmax and Shmin, respectively. In this stress field, fractures with the prevailing orientations show a high tendency of becoming reactivated as dextral strike-slip faults if stimulated hydraulically. To ensure that a stimulation well creates fluid connectivity on a reservoir volume as large as possible rather than dissipating fluids along existing fractures, it should follow a trajectory at the highest possible angle to the orientation of prevailing fractures, i.e. subhorizontal and NE-SW-oriented.\n",

            "abstract": "Hypoxia is a growing problem in coastal waters worldwide, and is a well-known cause of benthic mortality. The semi-enclosed Baltic Sea is currently the world’s largest human-induced dead zone. During the early Holocene, it experienced several periods of natural hypoxia following the intrusion of seawater into the previous freshwater lake. Recent studies suggest that at that time, the hypoxia expanded north to include the deep basin of the Bothnian Sea.\nIn this study, we assess whether the coastal zone of the Bothnian Sea was also hypoxic during the early Holocene. We analysed a unique sediment record (0 – 30 mbsf) from the Ångermanälven estuary, which was retrieved during the International Ocean Discovery Programme (IODP) Baltic Sea Paleoenvironment Expedition 347 in 2013. Using geochemical proxies and foraminifera abundances, we reconstruct the changes in redox conditions, salinity and productivity in the estuary. Our preliminary results suggest that bottom waters in this coastal basin became anoxic upon the intrusion of brackish seawater in the early Holocene and that the productivity was elevated. The presence of benthic foraminifera in this estuary during the mid-Holocene suggests more saline conditions in the Bothnian Sea than today. Due to isostatic uplift, the estuary likely gradually became more isolated from the Bothnian Sea, which itself became more isolated from the Baltic Sea. Both factors likely explain the subsequent re-oxygenation of bottom waters and gradual refreshening of the estuary as recorded in the sediments. Interestingly, the upper meters of sediment are enriched in minerals that contain iron, phosphorus and manganese. We postulate that the refreshening of the estuary triggered the formation of these minerals, thereby increasing the phosphorus retention in these sediments and further reducing primary productivity. This enhanced retention linked to refreshening may contribute to the current oligotrophic conditions in the Bothnian Sea.",

The melt distribution in this area is very heterogeneous, with corridors of ultramafic seafloor where plate separation is accommodated by large offset normal faults [Sauter, Cannat et al., 2013]. These ultramafic corridors also expose rare gabbros and basalts. We use the major and trace elements composition of these magmatic rocks to document the petrogenesis of MORB in this exceptionnally low melt supply portion of the MOR system.\nBasalts from the easternmost SWIR represent a global MORB end-member for major element compositions [Meyzen et al., 2003], with higher Na2O and Al2O3 wt%, and lower CaO and FeO wt% at a given MgO. Within this group, basalts from the ultramafic corridors have particularly high Na2O, low CaO and FeO wt%. Best fitting calculated liquid lines of descent are obtained for crystallization pressures of ~8 kbar.\nGabbroic rocks recovered in the ultramafic corridors include gabbros, oxide-gabbros and variably impregnated peridotites. This presentation focuses on these impregnated samples, where cpx have high Mg#, yet are in equilibrium with the nearby basalts in terms of their trace element compositions. Plagioclase An contents vary over a broad range, and there is evidence for opx resorption. These characteristics result from melt-mantle interactions in the axial lithosphere, which may explain several peculiar major element characteristics of the basalts. Similar interactions probably occur beneath ridges at intermediate to slow and ultraslow spreading rates. We propose that they are particularly significant in our study area due to its exceptionnally low integrated melt-rock ratio.",

Long-term measurements of BC wet deposition are very important to understand BC loss because wet deposition is major sink of BC. We measured BC mass concentrations in air (MBC) and in rainwater (CBC) simultaneously at Cape Hedo on Okinawa Island, Japan, in the East China Sea, from April 2010 to March 2013. MBC was measured by a Continuous Soot Monitoring System (COSMOS) and CBC was measured by a combination of an ultrasonic nebulizer and a Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). The monthly averaged MBC, CBC, and BC wet deposition flux (FBC) showed marked seasonal variations, being highest in spring. The FBC during the four spring seasons (51 mg m-2 (3month)-1) was about 77% of the annual average of FBC (65.5 mg m-2 yr-1). This flux is comparable to the average BC net flux (emission - deposition) over North China, indicating the importance of precipitation amount over the East China Sea as a sink of BC transported from North China.

            "abstract": "Model parameters can introduce significant uncertainties in climate simulations. Sensitivity analysis provides a way to quantify such uncertainties. Existing sensitivity analysis, however, cannot estimate the maximum sensitivity in climate simulations due to parameter uncertainties. In this study, we propose a new concept of nonlinear ensemble parameter perturbation (NEPP) to estimate the maximum effect of parameter uncertainties on the simulation of Earth’s climate. The NEPP is obtained by solving a maximization problem which is defined by the maximum variation of a unique ensemble of short-term predictions with large enough members and whose gradient is estimated by an ensemble-based approach. This method is applied to investigate the maximum variation of the climate of Lorenz-63 model and a sophisticated climate model, respectively, caused by uncertain parameters. It is found that the NEPP method is capable of estimating the maximum sensitivity in climate simulations due to parameter uncertainties. The results also illustrate that there is a high relevance between short-term prediction sensitivities and long-term climatic sensitivities. Apart from being independent of the initial conditions, the NEPP belongs to the most unstable mode of parameter perturbation for the model climate. Furthermore, the NEPP depends only weakly on, although related to, the time scales of short-term predictions.",

            "abstract": "A simulation-based approach has been developed to enable site-specific optimization of tidal and current turbine arrays in real-life waterways. The computational code is based on the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory Virtual StreamLab (VSL3D), which is able to carry out high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flow and sediment transport processes in rivers and streams taking into account the arbitrary geometrical complexity characterizing natural waterways. The computational framework can be used either in turbine-resolving mode, to take into account all geometrical details of the turbine, or with the turbines parameterized as actuator disks or actuator lines. Locally refined grids are employed to dramatically increase the resolution of the simulation and enable efficient simulations of multi-turbine arrays. Turbine/sediment interactions are simulated using the coupled hydro-morphodynamic module of VSL3D. The predictive capabilities of the resulting computational framework will be demonstrated by applying it to simulate turbulent flow past a tri-frame configuration of hydrokinetic turbines in a rigid-bed turbulent open channel flow as well as turbines mounted on mobile bed open channels to investigate turbine/sediment interactions. The utility of the simulation-based approach for guiding the optimal development of turbine arrays in real-life waterways will also be discussed and demonstrated.\nThis work was supported by NSF grant IIP-1318201.

Their plagioclases are totally fresh, but contain in their mass, nebulous inclusions most times below the resolution of optical microscope, or expressed as solid silicate phases clinopyroxene and pargasitic amphibole, up to 10 µm sized, having T equilibrium above 900°C with their host plagioclase. These gabbros have a well-expressed magmatic foliation, relayed by plastic strain marked by stretched olivine crystals, and pinching twins in plagioclase.\nIn addition to major elements analyses, the crystallographic relationships of these Mg silicate inclusions to their host plagioclase are explored by Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) processing.\n- Diopsidic clinopyroxene inclusions are dominant over pargasitic amphibole that tend to locate close to the margins of host plagioclase (Fig 1). Some inclusions are mixed clinopyroxene-amphibole, separated by a non-indexed phase that could represent a pyribole-type structure, suggesting transformation from clinopyroxene to amphibole during cooling. High chlorine content in the amphibole sign the seawater contamination at least during the development of this phase.\n- Preliminary statistical pole figures (Fig. 2) in the six joined plagioclase grains studied, show that both plagioclase and diopside inclusions have a strong crystal preferred orientation (CPO) connected such that the strong [010]pl maximum coincide with the strong [100]di. In addition, a coincidence appears between three sub-maxima of [100]pl and [001]di. These interesting relationships are refined. It is inferred that clinopyroxene developed through corrosion of the plagioclase by a Mg-bearing hydrous fluid, penetrating possibly via twin interface and diffusing at T~1100°C, upper limit of clinopyroxene stability in hydrous conditions. Development of pargasite implies increasing hydration during cooling.",

            "abstract": "We perform a Bayesian statistical analysis on historical and late Holocene rates of sea-level change. The data that form the input to the statistical model are tide-gauge measurements and proxy reconstructions from cores of coastal sediment. The aims are to estimate rates of sea-level change, to determine when modern rates of rise began and to observe how these rates have evolved over time. Many current methods for doing this use simple linear regression to estimate rates. This is often inappropriate as it is too rigid and it can ignore uncertainties that arise as part of the data collection exercise. This can lead to over-confidence in the sea-level trends being characterized.\nThe proposed model places a Gaussian process prior on the rate process (i.e. the process that determines how rates of sea-level are changing over time). The likelihood of the observed data is the integral of this process. When dealing with proxy reconstructions, the model is set in an errors-in-variables framework so as to take account of age uncertainty. It is also necessary to account for glacio-isostatic adjustment, which introduces a covariance between individual age and sea-level observations. This method allows for the estimation of the rate process with full consideration of all sources of uncertainty.\nThe model captures the continuous and dynamic evolution of sea-level change and results show that modern rates of rise are consistently increasing. Analysis of a global tide-gauge record (Church and White, 2011) indicated that the rate of sea-level rise increased continuously since 1880AD and is currently 1.9mm/yr (95% credible interval of 1.84 to 2.03mm/yr). Applying the model to a proxy reconstruction from North Carolina (Kemp et al., 2011) indicated that the mean rate of rise in this locality since the middle of the 19th century (current rate of 2.44 mm/yr with a 95% credible interval of 1.91 to 3.01mm/yr) is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years.",

This experiment uses the Met Office Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3), a coupled model with fully dynamic atmosphere and ocean components as part of the climateprediction.net distributive computing project. Parameters are selected so that the model has good top of atmosphere radiative balance and simulations are run without flux adjustments that “nudge” the climate towards a realistic state, but have an adverse effect on important ocean processes. This ensemble provides scientific insights on the possible role of the AMOC, among other factors, in climate trends, or lack thereof, over the past 20 years.\nThis ensemble is also used to explore how the occurrence of hiatus events of different durations varies for models with different transient climate response (TCR). We show that models with a higher TCR are less likely to produce a 15-year warming hiatus in global surface temperature than those with a lower TCR.",

            "abstract": "Meteor smoke particles (MSP) play an important role in the aeronomy of the middle atmosphere as shown by satellite, groundbased and in-situ measurements. Especially the MSPs influence on the D-region charge balance has been studied recently by rocket borne measurements and a simplified ionospheric model. Here, the influence of MSP on the ionosphere and also the neutral atmosphere is studied within the complete chemistry of the Sodankylä Ion and Neutral Chemistry Model (SIC). The SIC model is a time dependent ionospheric model with 43 positive ion species, 29 negative ion species and 15 neutral species. In addition the output of an aerosol microphysics model is used to initialize the MSP distribution. The chemistry of these ions and neutrals is realised through more than 300 different reactions, e.g. photoionization, electron-ion recombination and ion-neutral interaction. The interaction between MSP and the charged components of the SIC model is expressed by MSP size dependent capture rates. By implementing MSP as new components into the reaction scheme of the SIC-model we can identify their influence on both, the D-region ionosphere and the neutral mesosphere. This influence is studied during polar night were electrons are effectively captured between 80 and 100 km. This lack of electrons causes an increase of positive ion numberdensity due to reduced electron-ion recombination. We concentrate in this paper on the changes in the negative and positive ion chemistry due to the presence of MSP.",

            "abstract": "The Pannonian Basins situated in a context of lithospheric fluxing by mantle CO2-rich fluids, as evidenced by Plio-Pleistocene alkaline basalts and Basin gas geochemical data [1]. Such type of intracontinental CO2-fluxes remain poorly constrained at the scale of the global C-cycle. We report here the first quantification of the CO2 volumes stored in the lithospheric mantle, by coupling geochemical and 3D micro-tomography studies of lherzolitic and harzburgitic mantle xenoliths. The Pannonian Basin xenolith peridotites present numerous signs of melt/fluid migration. The compositions of glasses found in the peridotites vary from sub-alkaline (Na2O + K2O = 3.8 wt. %) to alkaline (Na2O + K2O = 12.6 wt. %) and from mafic (SiO2 = 48.2 wt. %) to more felsic (SiO2 = 62.1 wt. %) compositions and differ markedly from the host basalts of the xenoliths. Microthermometric and Raman spectroscopic studies on fluid inclusions (n = 115) show pure CO2 compositions with densities range between 0.6 and 0.9 g.cm3 [290 to 735 MPa (PCO2)], corresponding to deep fluid trapping on both sides of the Moho. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography (Micro-CT), together with laboratory micro-CT were performed to obtain information about structure, volume and density of each phase (minerals, melts and fluids). Fluids and melts are mainly located at grain boundaries and secondary trails cut off the grain boundaries, which implies a contemporary introduction of such fluids [Figure 1]. The amount of fluid inclusions in xenoliths is heterogeneous and varied from 0.79 ± 0.15 to 4.58 ± 0.54 vol % of the peridotite. The carbon-dioxide content stored in the lithospheric mantle, due to the percolation of asthenospheric melts produced in the mantle beneath the Pannonian Basin, can be estimated by the combination of 3D reconstruction (Micro-CT) and CO2 pressures from inclusions.\n[1] B.

            "abstract": "As one of the organic nitrogen species, amines are alkaline compounds ubiquitously detected in the atmosphere. Amines have been found to have the potential to enhance atmospheric new particle formation via forming aminium sulfate salts as much as 1000-fold when compared with ammonia, albeit at relatively low atmospheric contents (Almeida et al., 2013). Hygroscopicity of aminium sulfate particles can affect their cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity, light scattering or absorption and reactivity in the atmosphere. However, aerosol thermodynamic models such as Extended Aerosol Thermodynamics Model (E-AIM) assume that aminium ions behave similarly to ammonium ions, thus resulting in inaccuracy in predictinghygroscopicity of such compounds. In this study, Micro-Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the hygroscopicity of mono-methylaminium sulfate (MMAS), di-methylaminium sulfate (DMAS), tri-methylaminium sulfate (TMAS) and mono-ethylaminium sulfate (MEAS) particles. Since amine can evaporate from stock solutions, Ion Chromatography was used to determine aminium-to-sulfate ion molar ratio (A/S) of studied particles. Results were compared with literature data (Clegg et al., 2013). Due to amine evaporation upon mixing, A/S of stock solutions for particle generation can be below 2.0. In fact, initial A/S were 1.59, 1.91, 1.33 and 2.00 of MMAS, DMAS, TMAS and MEAS particles respectively. Ultimately A/S decreased to 1.5 and 1.0 for DMAS and TMAS, suggesting di-methylamine (DMA) and tri-methylamine (TMA) evaporated from corresponding particles. A/S of MMAS and MEAS kept relatively constant during the relative humidity (RH) cycle in hygroscopic measurements. Unlike (NH4)2SO4, all studied aminium sulfate particles can take up water at low RH. MMAS and MEAS particles underwent phase transition at around 45% and 20% RH respectively, while particles of other aminium sulfates showed continuous hygroscopic trends.\n",

            "abstract": "Several climate modelling studies in the past have used reduction in solar constant to simulate the climatic effects of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering. This is most likely valid only for space-based mirrors/reflectors but not for SRM methods that rely on stratospheric aerosols. In this study, we use a climate model to evaluate the differences in climate response to SRM by uniform solar constant reduction and stratospheric aerosols. The experiments are designed such that global mean warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration (2xCO2) is nearly cancelled in each case. In such a scenario, the residual climate effects are similar when important surface and tropospheric climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are considered. However, there are significant differences in stratospheric temperature response and diffuse and direct radiation reaching the surface. A difference of 1K in the global mean stratospheric (61-9.8 hPa) temperature is simulated between the two SRM methods, with warming in the aerosol scheme and a slight cooling for sunshades.\nWhile the global mean surface diffuse radiation increases by ~23% and direct radiation decreases by about 9% in the case of aerosol SRM method, both direct and diffuse radiation decrease by similar fractional amounts (~1.0%) when solar constant is reduced. When CO2 fertilization effects from elevated CO2 concentration levels are removed, the contribution from shaded leaves to gross primary productivity (GPP) increases by 1.8 % in aerosol SRM because of increased diffuse light. However, this increase is almost offset by a 15.2% decline in sunlit contribution due to reduced direct light. Overall both the SRM simulations show similar decrease in GPP (~ 8%) and NPP (~3%) relative to 2xCO2, indicating the negligible effect of the fractional changes in direct/diffuse radiation on the overall plant productivity. Based on our modelling study, we conclude that the climate states produced by a reduction in solar constant and addition of aerosols into the stratosphere can be considered almost similar except for two important aspects: stratospheric temperature change and the partitioning of direct versus diffuse radiation reaching the surface.",

Valuable information about the statistical variations of the velocity structure in the upper few kilometers of the crust can be obtained from well logs. We apply geostatistical methods to characterize the one-point and two-point statistics of velocity variations observed at vertical scale lengths less than 200 m in an ensemble of vertical sonic logs from the central Los Angeles basin. The stochastic variability at these scales can be separated into two components, one with a correlation length of about 10-60 m and a second with a correlation length of about 1-4 m. The one-point statistics of both components are distinctly non-Gaussian, with those of the first skewed to low velocities and those of the second skewed to high velocities. Assuming that the horizontal correlation lengths are much greater than the vertical correlation lengths, we obtain a long-wavelength polarization anisotropy of around 6-8% from Backus averaging of the profiles. We also investigate the magnitude of wave scattering caused by the small-scale heterogeneity and speculate on its role in explaining the anomalous near-surface attenuation of high-frequency seismic waves.",

            "abstract": "Diatom assemblages preserved in 18 sediment cores recovered in the eastern Indian, Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean are used for the reconstruction of the variability of summer sea surface temperature (SSST) and sea ice concentration during the Last Interglacial (LIG) or Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5). The large coverage of the core sites allows for reconstructions on latitudinal and longitudinal transects across the Southern Ocean and thus for the comparison of the environmental signal evolution in different sedimentary basins of the Southern Ocean. Such information is crucial for the understanding of climate signal propagation in the Southern Ocean and on inter-hemispheric scale. The quantitative temperature and sea ice records are derived with newly established diatom-based transfer functions at millennial to centennial resolution. Stratigraphic age assignment relies on a combination of oxygen isotope stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, core-core correlation using physical, geochemical and microfossil abundance pattern together with a tuning of sediment core signals with climate records in Antarctic ice cores. All records display a rapid transition from glacial (MIS 6) to MIS 5 conditions to reach maximum temperatures in the latest MIS 6/MIS 5 transition (Termination II) and the early LIG attributed to MIS 5.5. The amplitude of the SSST change is up to 5°C, with generally smaller values in the Pacific sector. During this period Southern Ocean temperature may exceed modern surface temperatures by up to 3°C and the winter sea ice edge is located south of the modern ice edge. Higher resolution cores display short-term temperature rebounds during the Termination II warming. Such cold rebounds are not discerned in the ice core records. The Southern Ocean warming could be triggered by precessional changes influencing high latitude summer insolation and potentially be accelerated by feedback mechanisms such as the reduction of surface albedo (sea ice), CO2 outgassing of the Southern Ocean and changes in meridional overturning circulation. The new set of data fills a gap in information in the global evolution of Earth climate during the Last Interglacial and will be used for the testing of numerical modeling results of the last distinctly warmer and higher sea level than present climate period.",

            "abstract": "Measuring the temporal variation of water content along a slope is important for predicting and preventing slope disasters. We conducted repeated monthly geoelectrical surveys since February 2011 on one slope of an embankment in the large-scale rainfall simulator of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED). In order to confirm the relationship between water content and resistivity changes in the slope due to heavy rain, we conducted seven artificial rain experiments at the embankment, controlling the total amount and intensity of rainfall using the mobile rainfall simulator. We observed soil water content and conducted geoelectrical measurements on the slope of the embankment before, during and after the artificial rains. It is difficult to obtain the rapid change of resistivity structure due to the rain because the analysis of resistivity structure requires measurement by much electrode array combination. Therefore, we performed only a continuous measurement using a Wenner array with “a” spacing of 0.5 m and 1 m. The changes in analyzed resistivity took place almost simultaneously with changes in water content. The fall of resistivity accelerates as the intensity of rainfall increases. The resistivity changed significantly with a rapid change in water content. The change in resistivity is slightly earlier than the change in volumetric water content at the same depth. These facts indicate that geoelectrical monitoring is effective for observing changes in the water content of the slope of an embankment caused by heavy rain.",

This incoherency complicates the analysis of future high resolution altimetric missions (SWOT, COMPIRA). Attempts at quantifying the product of these interactions have been achieved with models of the ocean global circulation. These models resolve however the first few vertical modes of internal tide and their ability to represent interactions between internal tides and balanced circulation has to be tested against controlled high resolution numerical simulations. We present here first attempts in order to study such interactions in a controlled idealized setting. High resolution (1 km horizontal grid size) numerical simulations of mesoscale/submesoscale turbulence are produced by destabilizing a baroclinic jet in a zonally-periodic channel. An plane wave internal tide is generated inside the domain thanks to a localized wave-maker and propagates through the mesoscale/submesoscale turbulence. We quantify the level of incoherency of the internal tide and study how this level depends on the modal structure of the internal tide and the intensity of the mesoscale/submesoscale turbulence.",

            "abstract": "Estimates show that in 2005, in the largest 136 coastal cities, there were 40 million people and $3,000 billion of assets exposed to 1 in 100 year coastal flood events. Mean sea level rise will increase this exposure to 150 million people and $35,000 billion of assets by 2070. Any further change in the statistics of flood frequency or severity would impact severely on economic and social systems. It is therefore crucial to understand the physical drivers of extreme storm surges, and to have confidence in datasets used for extreme sea level statistics. Much previous research has focussed on the process of tide-surge interaction, and it is now widely accepted that the physical basis of tide-surge interaction is that a phase shift of the tidal signal represents the effect of the surge on the tide. The second aspect of interaction is that shallow water momentum considerations imply that differing tidal states should modulate surge generation: wind stress should have greater surge-generating potential on lower tides.\nWe present results from a storm surge model of the European shelf that demonstrate that tidal range does have an effect on the surges generated. The cycle-integrated effects of wind stress (i.e. the skew surge) are greater when tidal range is low. Our results contradict the absence of any such correlation in tide gauge records. This suggests that whilst the modulating effect of the tide on the skew surge (the time-independent difference between peak prediction and observations) is significant, the difference between individual storms is dominant. This implies that forecasting systems must predict salient detail of the most intense storms. A further implication is that flood forecasting models need to simulate tides with acceptable accuracy at all coastal locations. We extend our model analysis to show that the same modulation of storm surges (by tidal conditions) applies to tropical cyclones. We conduct simulations using a mature operational storm surge model in the Bay of Bengal with tropical cyclones from the IBTrACs database; we demonstrate that – just as with the extra-tropical case - higher storm surges on the Bangladesh coastline are generated during smaller tides.",

            "abstract": "The Tian Shan in central Asia is one of the world’s highest mountain ranges. The 2500 km-long WSW-ENE-trending arc of mountains extends from the western Kyrgyz Republic across northwestern China and almost to the border with Mongolia. Understanding the glacial history of this vast region is important because there is a general lack of paleoclimatic data from this highly continental location, at the confluence of major climate systems, and because glaciers are sensitive monitors of climate change. We examine the glacial history of the Ak-Shyrak massif and surrounding plateaus with average altitudes of ~3500 m a.s.l. To reconstruct the glacial history of this area we use a combined approach including geomorphological mapping, and cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of erratic boulders on glacial landforms. We observe large site-specific scatter in our 10Be and 26Al exposure ages. Apparent minimum surface exposure ages range from ~2 ka to ~2.5 Ma, with early Quaternary- late Pliocene apparent exposure ages relating to some of the highest 10Be concentrations ever recorded for glacial deposits. Most dated boulders, however, fall in the apparent exposure age range of 100 ka to 300 ka. Consistent with previous results from the western and central Tian Shan, none of our boulders record a global last glacial maxima expansion of glaciers, and this contrasts to data from the eastern Kyrgyz Tian Shan. This spatial variation in glacier extent might be due to differences in paleoclimate. However, local physiographic conditions (e.g. altitude, slope, aspect) or external forcing factors other than climate (e.g., landslides) may cause local or regional differences in glacier response. We refrain from assigning mapped glacial advances to marine oxygen isotope stages because of the considerable age scatter. Finally we assess and discuss possible reasons for the observed age scatter and early Quaternary-late Pliocene apparent exposure ages in terms of prior and/or incomplete exposure histories of individual samples and compare our data to other regional datasets.",

Measurements of two independent chemical water mass tracers (231Pa/230Th and εNd), not affected by changes in the global carbon cycle, from the very same samples reveal strikingly similar responses of the AMOC to ice sheet retreat during the last two glacial Terminations. In contrast to the prevailing view attesting a shallower and weaker north Atlantic overturning to glacial climates, we show that a deep and vigorous overturning circulation mode persisted throughout most of the last glacial cycle. Critical deviations from this mode were restricted to times of maximum ice-sheet extent during glacial maxima, suggesting that AMOC stability was largely insensitive to millennial scale melt-water pulses and buoyancy forcing during warm and intermediate climate states.",

As part of the Belmont-project “Bangladesh Delta: Assessment of the Causes of Sea-level Rise Hazards and Integrated Development of Predictive Modeling Towards Mitigation and Adaptation” (BAND-AID) a global inverse method is employed to estimate the different contributors to sea level, such as melting of glaciers and ice-sheets, hydrology, glacial isostatic adjustment, as well as shallow and deep steric effects from Jason-1/2 altimetry and GRACE data.\nIn the global inverse method, spatial patterns (fingerprints) are computed a-priori for each of the contributing process, applying the sea level equation for mass fingerprints, and empirically (PCA) for steric fingerprints from ARGO data. Temporal GRACE gravity data and along-track Jason-1/ -2 altimetry is then combined to estimate the temporal evolution of these patterns, which allows the partitioning of altimetric sea level into individual sources. This method largely mitigates truncation and leakage problems associated with GRACE resolution. Globally, our estimates are close to others, although they point at a somewhat larger deep steric effect.\nIn this work we provide preliminary results for the Bay of Bengal / Bangladesh region by confronting global inversion with local measurements. Estimated sea level trends are compared to trends from tide gauges and differences are interpreted in terms of unmodeled regional effects, such as land subsidence. Initial results provide an indication on the magnitude of the contributions from the different sources at the coast of Bangladesh / in the Bay of Bengal; e.g. the contribution from the Greenland ice-sheets between 2003 and 2011 (0.69 mm/a) is significantly larger compared to that of Antarctica (0.15 mm/a), but the biggest effect results from steric sea level changes (-1.5 to 6 mm/a).",

High-scattering and high-attenuation shallow anomalies are indicative of magma and fluid-rich zones within and below the volcanic edifice down to 6 km depth, where a high-scattering body outlines the top of a deeper aseismic velocity anomaly. Both the volcanic edifice and these structures induce a combination of strong scattering and attenuation on any seismic wave-field, particularly those recorded on the northern and eastern flanks of the volcanic cone. North of the cone, between depths of 0 and 10 km, a low-velocity, high-scattering, and high-attenuation north-south trending trough is attributed to thick piles of Tertiary marine sediments within the St. Helens Seismic Zone. A laterally-extended 3D scattering contrast at depths of 10 to 14 km is related to the boundary between upper and lower crust, and caused in our interpretation by the large scale interaction of the Siletz terrane with the Cascade arc crust. This contrast presents a low scattering, 4-6 km2 “hole” under the north-eastern flank of the volcano. We infer that this section represents the main path of magma ascent from depths greater than 6 km at MSH, with a small north-east shift in the lower plumbing system of the volcano. We conclude that combinations of different non-standard tomographic methods, and particularly the application of full-waveform tomography to highly heterogeneous media, represent the future of seismic volcano imaging.",

It is, however, not clear how the methane may migrate through the still existing hydrate stability zone as the gas should form new hydrate further up in the section. In an effort to better understand the physical processes and quantify the hydrate/gas distribution in the area, GEOMAR and the University of Southampton collected different types of electromagnetic data sets with different depth ranges and resolution in a region, which has been extensively covered by seismic investigation.\nThe presence of hydrate within seafloor sediments causes an increase in both the bulk modulus, and hence the seismic velocity, and in the electrical resistivity. The presence of gas decreases seismic velocity but increases electrical resistivity.\nBoth seismic and controlled source electromagnetic methods can and have been used to estimate hydrate and gas content. Since seismic velocity and the electrical resistivity are sensitive also to a range of other parameters such as lithology, porosity and pore fluid salinity, single rock property parameter investigations are hampered by many uncertainties. However, since the sensitivities are different for the two properties, determination of both velocity and resistivity for the same volume of sea bed provides a powerful tool for distinguishing the contribution of hydrate or gas from that of other parameters.\nIn this work we report on a new type of 3D electromagnetic high resolution tomography experiment which was focused on the CNE03 chimney in the centre of the region. The data indicates the presence of a highly resistive zone, where seismic travel time tomography has shown the presence of gas hydrates within the chimney. The distribution of methane hydrate concentrations are derived based on a joint interpretation of seismic velocity and electrical resistivities.",

Both heterocystous and non-heterocystous N2-fixing cyanobacteria are symbiotic with marine diatoms and thrive in low nutrient environments. These associations are significant exporters of carbon to the deep-sea, but suitable tracers for reconstructing their importance in past environments are lacking. We recently analyzed the heterocyst glycolipids (HGs) of the heterocystous Richelia intracellularis symbiont of the marine diatoms Hemiaulus hauckii and H. membranaceus and found unique C5 glycolipids with C30-32 carbon chains, a structure different from the C6 glycolipids detected in freshwater heterocystous cyanobacteria.\nWe developed a high performance liquid chromatography/ multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) method specific for trace analysis of long chain C5 HGs and applied it to suspended particulate matter (SPM) and surface sediment from the Amazon plume, a region known to harbor marine diatoms carrying heterocystous cyanobacteria as endosymbionts. C5 HGs were detected in both SPM and sediments demonstrating their biomarker potential. They were not detected in SPM or sediment from freshwater settings in the region. Rather, limnetic SPM and sediments contained C6 HGs which are established biomarkers for free-living heterocystous cyanobacteria. Glycolipids have been found preserved in sediments of up to 49 Ma old. Our development of the C5 biomarkers has the potential to improve our knowledge of the contribution of symbiotic cyanobacteria to the paleo-N-cycle.",

            "abstract": "The unusual K-shaped island of Sulawesi, located in the convergent zone between the Eurasian, Australian and Pacific plates, has traditionally been interpreted as the consequence of collision and accretion. New data challenge this idea and indicate that crustal extension has played an important role in its Neogene development.\nIn the north of the Sulawesi North Arm are Eocene–Lower Miocene basalts intercalated with radiolarian chert and volcaniclastic sediments, which were deformed during collision of the Sula Spur with the North Arm. Undeformed granitoids derived from lower crustal rocks intrude the sequence and preliminary LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages decrease from 9.44±0.43 Ma in the north to 8.19±0.20 Ma in the south.\nStructurally beneath all these rocks is the Malino Metamorphic Complex (MMC) which exposes dominantly quartzo-feldspathic muscovite schists to gneisses, with subordinate amphibolites and garnet schists. The MMC is a metamorphic core complex, surrounded by a discontinuous greenschist carapace and shear zones with opposite shear senses on the northern and southern sides of the complex. Metamorphic rocks from the MMC yield SHRIMP U-Pb ages on zircon rims of 15.42±0.62 Ma and 15.36±0.53 Ma. Locally these metamorphic rocks are intruded by undeformed granitoids with SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of 4.85 ± 0.07 to 3.78±0.04 Ma. Late stage exhumation accommodated by high angle oblique normal faults is indicated by apatite (U-Th)/He ages between 3.26±0.23 Ma and 1.43±0.24 Ma, at a rate of 0.27 mm/a based on age-elevation plots.\nLower Pliocene–Lower Pleistocene syn-extensional shallow marine siliciclastic and carbonate sediments are crosscut by normal faults. The timing of faulting and lack of metamorphic detritus in these young sediments support rapid and recent regional uplift. We interpret two phases of extension in North Sulawesi, one during the Middle Miocene and another during the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene, exhuming the granitic and metamorphic rocks.",

In an environment that receives regular sea fog and a mean annual rainfall of only 25 mm, Gobabeb is ideally situated to study the drivers and ecological role of fog in arid environments. Currently more than ten meteorological projects perform measurements at or close to Gobabeb. These projects include continuous trace gas measurements, fog isotope sampling, in situ surface radiation measurements, land surface temperature and other satellite validation studies, and multiple aerosol/dust monitoring projects; most of these projects are also components in other global monitoring networks. To these projects, Gobabeb has recently added a network of nine autonomous weather stations spanning the central Namib that will continuously collect basic meteorological data over an area of approximately 70x70 km. Using this data in conjunction with modeling efforts will expand our understanding of fog formation and the linkages between fog and the Benguela Current off Namibia’s coast. Historical weather data from previous meteorological stations and satellite observations will also enable development of a fog time series for the last 50 years to determine climate variability driven by possible changes in the Benguela Current system. To complement these efforts, Gobabeb is also expanding its decades-old ecological research programs to explore the impacts of the fog on the region’s biota at various time and spatial scales. Gobabeb’s long-term, multidisciplinary projects can serve as a prototype for monitoring in other fog-affected systems, together increasing our understanding of coastal fog dynamics, land-atmosphere-ocean connections, and the impacts of fog-related global change.",

            "abstract": "Aseismic slip is a key component of the moment budget of subduction zones, in some cases it accounts for more than half the total slip. It has been suggested that the propagation of aseismic slip as slow slip sequences precedes large megathrust events, such as the Tohoku-oki earthquake, Mw 9.0, 11th March 2011. Complex patterns of aseismic slip in space and time have been observed using either GPS data or repeating earthquakes, yet the physical mechanisms driving this behaviour are still poorly understood and have implications for seismic hazard assessment. Therefore, in this study both these datasets are combined in a time-dependent inversion, to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of aseismic slip in northeast Japan, during the interseismic period of 21st March 1996 to 29th October 2003.\nDaily displacements recorded by ~800 GEONET stations are associated with slip on the subducting plate interface using a time-dependent inverse modelling scheme. The bounds on slip are defined by the location and slip of repeating earthquakes. Initial results show significant slip heterogeneity along-strike and down-dip. The majority of the upper part of the plate, at depths of 5 – 30 km, is locked except for two patches at 37° and 40° latitude. At 30 – 70 km depth there are three regions of aseismic slip, which exhibit periodic acceleration and deceleration throughout the interseismic period; in the south near Tokyo, offshore Sendai, and the northernmost part of Honshu at 41.5° latitude. Within these regions, patches with an average velocity of 7 to 8 cm/yr show large fluctuations in velocity, which in some cases precede the smaller variations observed for patches with an average velocity of 2 to 4 cm/yr. These observations are discussed in terms of the changes in effective normal stress, and the heterogeneous frictional properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone.",

During this period, seven tropical cyclones propagated over the OBS network, providing the unique opportunity for in situ analysis and spatio-temporal tracking of this source of secondary (i.e twice the frequency of the ocean waves) microseismic noise and pressure fluctuations induced on the seafloor. We performed spectral analysis, seafloor pressure and ground polarization analyses on the continuous OBS data, focusing on cyclone Dumile, which passed directly over the OBS network. We observe that microseisms strongly increase in amplitude in the 0.1-0.45 Hz frequency band as the cyclone approaches and propagates over the instruments, and that this noise amplitude is directly related to the distance and intensity of the cyclone. Analysis of the temporal noise variations across the network permit to locate and track the area of maximum noise amplitude, which points towards the cyclone centre with good accuracy. Polarization analyses show that cyclones generate compressional waves in the water column, which give rise to both compressional and surface waves that propagate through the solid earth. In addition to atmospheric, oceanographic and satellite observations, microseisms recorded on the seafloor may therefore be considered a means for monitoring cyclone evolution and intensity.",

            "abstract": "The uplift process of the Tibetan Plateau and its mechanism has always been the research hot spot for geoscientists. In this paper, 11 years of time-variable gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) newest Release 05 have been used to get the secular trends of gravity anomaly in CHINA and adjacent area by least square method. A reduction of hydrological signals from the detected integral secular trends using global hydrological models (Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS and Climate Prediction Center, CPC) is attempted. The glacier model provided by Paulson is used to reduce the GIA(Glacial Isostatic Adjustment) effect. In addition, the scaling factor method is used to weaken the GRACE post-process errors. It turns out that a remarkable positive signal in the inner Tibetan Plateau, which is explained by a forward modeling with 3D rectangular prism based on the hypothesis of subduction of Indian plate beneath Eurasian plate. Bangong-Nujiang suture zone is used to divide the Tibetan Plateau into southern and northern parts, then we get the gravity anomaly rate of northern part +0.27, which is consistent with the GRACE result 0.35±0.13.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive climatology of migratory anticyclones affecting the Mediterranean was generated by the University of Melbourne finding and tracking algorithm (MS algorithm), applied to 34 years (1979–2012) of ERA-Interim MSLP on a 1.5°x1.5° resolution. The algorithm was employed for the first time for anticyclones in this region, thus, its robustness and reliability in efficiently capturing the individual characteristics of the anticyclonic tracks in such a closed basin with complex topography were checked and verified. Then, the tracks and the statistical properties of the migratory systems were calculated and analyzed.\nConsidering that cold-core anticyclones are shallow and weaken with height contrary to the warm-core that exhibit a vertically well-organized structure, the vertical thermal extend of the systems was studied with an algorithm developed as an extension module of the MS algorithm using ERA-Interim temperatures on several isobaric levels from 1000hPa to 100hPa on an 1.5°x1.5° resolution. The results verified that during both cold and warm period, cold-core anticyclones mainly affect the northern parts of the Mediterranean basin, with their behavior to be strongly regulated by cyclonic activity from the main storm track areas of the North Atlantic and Europe. On the other hand, warm-core anticyclones were found mainly in the southern Mediterranean and North African areas.\nHere, in order to get a perspective on the dynamic and thermodynamic processes in anticyclonic formation, a dynamical analysis at several vertical levels is performed. The study of mean fields of potential vorticity, temperature advection, vorticity advection at various levels can elucidate the role of upper and low levels during anticyclogenesis and system evolvement and help to further understand the dynamic mechanisms which are responsible for the anticyclogenesis over the Mediterranean region.\nAcknowledgement: This research project is implemented within the framework of the Action «Supporting Postdoctoral Researchers» of the Operational Program \"Education and Lifelong Learning\" (Action’s Beneficiary: General Secretariat for Research and Technology) and is co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Greek State.

            "abstract": "Monitoring vegetation conditions is a critical activity for assessing food security in Africa. Rural populations relying on rain-fed agriculture and livestock grazing are highly exposed to large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in water availability. Monitoring the state, evolution, and productivity of vegetation, crops and pastures in particular, is important to conduct food emergency responses and plan for a long-term, resilient, development strategy in this area.\nThe timing of onset, the duration, and the intensity of vegetation growth can be retrieved from space observations and used for food security monitoring to assess seasonal vegetation development and forecast the likely seasonal outcome when the season is ongoing.\nIn this contribution we present a set of phenology-based remote sensing studies in support to food security analysis. Key phenological indicators are retrieved using a model-fit approach applied to SOPT-VEGETATION FAPAR time series. Remote-sensing phenology is first used to estimate i) the impact of the drought in the Horn of Africa, ii) crop yield in Tunisia and, iii) rangeland biomass production in Niger. Then the impact of the start and length of vegetation growing period on the total biomass production is assessed over the Sahel. Finally, a probabilistic approach using phenological information to forecast the occurrence of an end-of-season biomass production deficit is applied over the Sahel to map hot-spots of drought-related risk.",

            "abstract": "Peritectic minerals in migmatites can trap droplets of melt that form via incongruent melting during crustal anatexis. In most cases, these melts crystallize and form nanogranites upon slow cooling of the anatectic terrane. To obtain information on the primary compositions of crustal melts, nanogranites must be remelted and rehomogenized before analysis.\nA new occurrence of nanogranites was reported in granulitic gneisses at the bottom of the prograde metamorphic sequence of Jubrique, located on top of the Ronda peridotite slab (Betic Cordillera, S Spain). These nanogranites are trapped in garnet porphyroblasts. They show partially irregular to well facetted negative crystal shapes, and have variable size from ~5-10 µm and reach ~200 µm in diameter. They appear at the core and rim of large Grt crystals, and are composed of rare glass, daughter Qz, Pl, Kfs, Bt and Ms, and solid inclusions of Ky and less frequently Gr, Hc, Rt, Ilm, Zrn and Mnz. Ky was the main solid phase that favored the trapping of melt inclusions (MI) during Grt growth. The presence of Ky+Rt within MI, and their occurrence in the high-P cores of Grt, suggest that partial melting in the gneisses initiated at relatively high P conditions, and that most Grt in these rocks crystallized in the presence of melt.\nTo recover the major and trace element composition of the primary melt during anatexis, we performed remelting experiments on chips of MI-bearing Grt separated from a sample of gneiss at Jubrique, using a piston cylinder apparatus. Experiments were run at 800, 825 and 850°C, 15 Kbar and dry conditions (i.e. no added H2O) for 24 hrs. Preliminary results of the first experiment at 850º show that nanogranites have been successfully remelted; they all contain glass regardless of their textural position. Glass is leucogranitic (SiO2≈65wt%; FeO+MgO≈2wt%), potassic (K#≈12), high in ASI (close to peraluminous) and hydrous (H2O≈11wt.%.). The degree of remelting, however, varies among inclusions regardless of the textural position; some inclusions only show glass whilst others have, in addition, residual Als±Qz±Sp±Bt±Gr plus new St, which overgrows on Ky. The presence of St, decrepitation cracks, Grt reaction rims and irregular boundaries in some inclusions suggest interaction between melt and Grt and/or overheating during the experiment.",

            "abstract": "Users of earthquake planning scenarios require the ground-motion map to be credible enough to justify costly planning efforts, but not all ground-motion maps are right for all uses. There are two common ways to create a map of ground motion for a hypothetical earthquake. One approach is to map the median shaking estimated by empirical attenuation relationships. The other uses 3-D physics-based modeling, in which one analyzes a mathematical model of the earth's crust near the fault rupture and calculates the generation and propagation of seismic waves from source to ground surface by first principles. The two approaches produce different-looking maps. The more-familiar median maps smooth out variability and correlation. Using them in a planning scenario can lead to a systematic underestimation of damage and loss, and could leave a community underprepared for realistic shaking. The 3-D maps show variability, including some very high values that can disconcert non-scientists. So when the USGS Science Application for Risk Reduction’s (SAFRR) Haywired scenario project selected 3-D maps, it was necessary to explain to scenario users—especially engineers who often use median maps—the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the two approaches. We used authority, empirical evidence, and theory to support our choice. We prefaced our explanation with SAFRR’s policy of using the best available earth science, and cited the credentials of the maps’ developers and the reputation of the journal in which they published the maps. We cited recorded examples from past earthquakes of extreme ground motions that are like those in the scenario map. We explained the maps on theoretical grounds as well, explaining well established causes of variability: directivity, basin effects, and source parameters. The largest mapped motions relate to potentially unfamiliar extreme-value theory, so we used analogies to human longevity and the average age of the oldest person in samples of varying sizes to illustrate extreme values to non-scientists. We explained the importance of nonlinearity in the relationship between shaking and loss. This was the second time SAFRR encountered skeptics of 3-D maps among scenario consumers, so a short manuscript was prepared that would serve similar uses in the future.",

            "abstract": "When valley glaciers retreat and/or thin, they expose stores of sediment prone to failure and rapid reworking through a range of mass movement processes. The newly exposed bedrock slopes are also thought to undergo a period of more intense, or more frequent, failure before returning to the background norm. However, the magnitude-frequency of failures above and in front of ice is poorly constrained, as are their spatial relationship to previous ice extents. Here we show the results from a combination of repeat helicopter, UAV and ground based photogrammetry that has been processed using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques to produce high-resolution elevation and change models. These data require few ground control and so lend themselves to deployment in remote, or difficult to access high-mountain regions where our understanding of failure patterns has been limited by a lack of high-quality monitoring data. Our initial data cover the valley walls of Glacier d’Argentiere, Mer De Glace, Glacier des Bossons and the Bionnassay Glacier on the French side of the Mt Blanc massif at the start and end of the summer 2014 season. These glaciers have a rich documented history of ice retreat, thinning, and permafrost locations to link to the spatial patterns of failure.",

            "abstract": "Quartz-rich sandstones in the Banda Arc islands of Tanimbar, Babar, Timor and Sumba are equivalent of Mesozoic sandstones on the Australian margin where they are important hydrocarbon reservoirs. They have been exposed by on-going collision providing an opportunity to study their provenance. Previous studies suggested that rivers draining Australia provided most input. New light mineral, heavy mineral and detrital zircon data provide information on sources of sediments and constraints on palaeogeographic models. Conventional light mineral plots of sandstones from the islands typically show a recycled orogen and continental block origin, consistent with an Australian source. However many of the sandstones are texturally immature. Many samples also contain volcanic quartz and volcanic lithic fragments. Heavy mineral assemblages of most samples contain material from acid igneous and metamorphic rocks, with few indications of mafic or ultramafic sources. Rounded ultrastable minerals are typical, but these are commonly mixed with angular grains. Detrital zircon (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages range from Archean to Mesozoic, but variations in age populations indicate differences in source areas along the Banda Arc in locality and time. We recognise distinctive Permo-Triassic, older Palaeozoic and Proterozoic ages characteristic of a Bird’s Head, New Guinea, acid igneous source and this component diminishes from east to west. On Tanimbar and Babar, sediment came from both Australia and the Bird’s Head. Sandstones in Timor have immature textures and show differences from east to west. They contain zircons derived from the Birds Head, as well as Precambrian zircons suggesting a northern Australian origin. In contrast, immature textures, heavy minerals and Cretaceous zircon ages in rocks from Sumba suggest that they were mainly derived from metamorphic sources. Mesozoic to Archean zircons indicate derivation from Australian crust that had collided in Sulawesi during the Cretaceous.",

            "abstract": "Fukuyama et al. (2013, AGU Fall Meeting) reported that using large-scale biaxial apparatus at NIED with a loading rate of 0.1mm/s, many foreshocks were observed and pre-slip was not evident under 2.6MPa normal stress (LB04-003), but pre-slip was always recognized prior to each stick slip and foreshocks were not common under 6.7MPa normal stress (LB04-005). To further investigate these phenomena to understand what controls the foreshock activity, we conducted another series of experiments using similar rock specimens made of gabbro. We conducted a series of ten experiments whose normal stress was 6.7MPa in the first seven experiments and was lowered to 3.4MPa in the rest of three. We could not find any foreshocks in 9 experiments and the only experiments we found foreshocks was the fifth one (LB09-005), which was under 6.7MPa normal stress with loading rate of 0.1mm/s and 0.01mm/s (loading rate was changed at the middle). It seems that foreshock activity does not depend only on the normal stress but is also related to the detailed fault surface condition, which was created by previous slip history. In Fukuyama et al. (2013), initial roughness of the simulated fault surface was #600 while in the present experiment it was #2000. These differences in initial condition might affect the foreshock generation. In the present cases, a most serious experiment with 1mm/s for 400mm slip (LB09-004) was included, which was a previous experiment of LB09-005. We think LB09-004 provided a damage distribution and that could help generate the foreshocks. It should be noted that foreshock hypocenters, estimated from the PZT array, are located on the grooves. And amount of grooves generated during the experiment was the largest for LB09-005. These features suggest the change in surface condition prior to LB09-005, which might facilitate the generation of foreshocks.",

Two experiments were performed: the control experiment (CNTL) with the default parameter values and the sensitivity experiment (EXP) with the values obtained from a “two-step” parameter optimization method, which applied a full factor sampling scheme and the simplex downhill algorithm. Results show that parameter changes lead to variation of diabatic heating and affect the lower tropospheric temperature and circulation through the interaction and mutual responses between dynamical and physical processes. Furthermore, the interactions of dynamical and physical processes are different in the tropics and high latitudes. In the tropics, dynamical processes mainly resulted from vertical motion balance the variation of latent heating, both of which are negatively correlated to offset each other and play significant roles in the simulation of temperature. However, in the high latitudes, dynamical processes mainly due to horizontal advection dominate the total temperature tendency compared to physical processes. The variation of dynamical effects can overcompensate the diabatic heating from physical processes, thus affecting the geopetential height and wind fields. Moreover, there exists a positive feedback among the temperature, geopotential height, and meridional wind in the mid and high latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Mixing of river and lake water can alter water temperature, conductivity, and other properties that influence ecological processes in freshwater estuaries of the Great Lakes. This study uses geostatistical methods to rapidly visualize and understand water quality sampling results and enable adaptive sampling to remove anomalies and explore interesting phenomena in more detail. Triaxus, a towed undulating sensor package, was used for collecting various physical and biological water qualities in three estuary areas of Lake Michigan in Summer 2011. Based on the particular sampling pattern, data quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) processes, including sensor synchronization, upcast and downcast separation, and spatial outlier removal are first applied. An automated kriging interpolation approach that considers trend and anisotropy is then proposed to estimate data on a gridded map for direct visualization. Other methods are explored with the data to gain more insights on water quality processes. Local G statistics serve as a supplementary tool to direct visualization. The method identifies statistically high value zones (hot spots) and low value zones (cold spots) in water chemistry across the estuaries, including locations of water sources and intrusions. In addition, chlorophyll concentration distributions are different among sites. To further understand the interactions and differences between river and lake water, K-means clustering algorithm is used to spatially cluster the water based on temperature and specific conductivity. Statistical analysis indicates that clusters with significant river water can be identified from higher turbidity, specific conductivity, and chlorophyll concentrations. Different ratios between zooplankton biomass and density indicate different zooplankton structure across clusters. All of these methods can contribute to improved near real-time analysis of future sampling activity.",

            "abstract": "We report the micro-Raman evidence for pressure-induced incipient amorphization of quartz in the UHP Brossasco-Isasca Unit (Dora-Maira Massif, Italian western Alps). Fifteen quartz inclusions in garnet were studied that comprise single crystals and aggregates of two-to-four crystals, along with one matrix crystal in a strain shadow. Palisade quartz, from coesite inversion, is also observed in garnet. The straight alignment of inclusions in prograde garnet indicates that quartz grew during garnet growth at about 650°C and 2.8 GPa, from HP to UHP metamorphic conditions. In single quartz crystals, disordering of lattice and densification (i.e., diaplectic glass) are revealed by two additional bands in Raman spectra: the former at 480 cm-1, derived from tetrahedral densified SiO2 amorphous phase composed of four-membered rings, and the latter at 605 cm-1, from defect structures involving partially broken SiO2 bonds. At the P-T metamorphic conditions of garnet growth, coesite is the thermodynamically stable form of crystalline silica. The existence of a lower enthalpy configuration, however, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for phase transition at constant pressure. If a kinetically accessible path is not available for the transition to ensue, metastable denser amorphous phase is formed instead. Amorphization of α-quartz requires experimental (or theoretical) lithostatic (hydrostatic) pressures > 15 GPa, while in presence of deviatoric stresses (i.e., non-lithostatic conditions), required pressures are lowered down to ≤ 5 GPa, at room temperature. Previous numerical geodynamic models suggested that in UHP terranes tectonic overpressure, greater than up to 0.3 GPa the lithostatic one, may be locally present (Gerya et al., 2008, Lithos, 103, 236-256). Our study confirms the presence of transitory pressure deviations from lithostatic values during prograde UHP metamorphism on a time scale that allows minerals to record these pressures.",

            "abstract": "Regional gravity field recovery in spherical radial base functions is a strongly ill-posed problem. The ill-posedness is mainly due the restriction of observations as well as the base functions to a specific area. We investigate this ill-posedness as well as the related regularization process. We compare four different methods for the choice of regularization parameter and discuss their characteristics. Moreover, two different kinds of shape coefficients for the spherical radial base functions are used to assess the impact of shape coefficients on the regularization process. These shape coefficients are the Shannon coefficients with no smoothing properties and the Spline kernel with smoothing features. As the data set, we use two months of real GOCE ultra-sensitive gravity gradient components which are Txx, Tyy, Tzz and Txz. The regional solutions are considered in Amazon. Our results indicate, that the method used for the choice of regularization parameter is directly influenced by the shape of spherical radial base functions. In addition we conclude, that the Shannon kernel along with a proper regularization approach delivers satisfactory results with physically meaningful coefficients.",

This is project is the result of a wide scientific collaboration between institutions of Mexico and Spain with the main aim of studying the lithospheric structure in Rivera and North American Plates convergence regions and Jalisco Block, and, also, identifying submarine structures that could be tsunamigenic sources.\nThe first phase of this project was carried out in February and March of 2014. More than 5200 km of Multichannel Seismic Reflection (MCS) data were acquired, together with multibeam and parametric soundings and potential fields (gravity and magnetism) data. Wide Angle profiling were recorded deploying 16 OBS in 32 locations, offshore Jalisco and Nayarit regions Onshore, a network of 100 short period seismic portable stations were deployed in 240 locations along 5 seismic lines of 200-300 km length that worked combined with Seismological Network of Jalisco State (SisVOc). In addition, 8 land seismic stations were installed in Marías Islands and Isabel Island. These instruments registered, in continuous mode, the source energy was generated by big airgun array of 5800 ci, shooting every 120 s. The British vessel RRS James Cook, which participated in this project as a part of the exchange program between Spanish and English scientific vessels, was responsible of carrying out the MCS profiles and the deployment of OBS. For them, it was used a 6 km length digital streamer and airgun array of high capacity. Moreover, the ARM Holzinger and RV El Puma participated in this project and were provided by the Mexican Navy and UNAM, respectively.\nThe second phase of this project was carried out in June 2014. 100 short period seismic stations were installed along one seismic profile from La Caldera de la Primavera (Guadalajara) to Barra de Navidad (Jalisco coast), covering 200 km distance.\nThe new data acquired during TSUJAL project provide a dense sampling of studied plates and give new seismic images about continental deformation along and across the subduction zone, accretionary wedge size, about contact between Rivera and North American Plates.",

            "abstract": "Initialized decadal hindcasts and radiatively-forced historical simulations from the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are analysed to address the relative roles of the initialization and radiative forcing in providing multi-year skill of the Atlantic multi-decadal variability (AMV). The initialized hindcasts reproduce better the phase of the AMV index fluctuations. The radiatively-forced component consists of a residual positive trend, although its identification is ambiguous. Initialization reduces the inter-model spread when estimating the level of AMV skill, thus reducing its uncertainty. Our results show a skilful performance of the initialized hindcasts in capturing the AMV-related SST anomalies over the subpolar gyre and Labrador Sea regions, as well as in the eastern subtropical basin, and the inability of the radiatively-forced historical runs to simulate the horseshoe-like AMV signature over the North Atlantic. The initialized hindcasts are also more skilful at reproducing the observed AMV teleconnection to the West African monsoon. The impact of the start date frequency is described, showing that the standard of five-year interval between start dates yields the main features of the AMV skill that are robustly detected in hindcasts with yearly start date sampling. This work concludes that skilful initialized multi-model forecasts of the AMV-related climate variability can be formulated, improving uninitialized projections, until 3-6 years ahead.",

            "abstract": "This work is devoted to the systematic study of electron lifetimes from narrowband wave-particle interactions in the plasmasphere. It relies on a new formulation of the bounce-averaged quasi-linear pitch angle diffusion coefficients parameterized by a single frequency, w, and wave-normal angle, theta [Albert, 2012]. We first show that the diffusion coefficients scale with w/Wce, where Wce is the equatorial electron gyrofrequency, and that maximal pitch angle diffusion occurs along the line alpha0=pi/2-theta, where alpha0 is the equatorial pitch angle. Lifetimes are computed for L-shell values in the range [1.5, 3.5] and energies, E, in the range [0.1, 6] MeV as a function of frequency and wave-normal angle. The lifetimes are relatively independent of frequency and wave-normal angle after taking into consideration the scaling law, with a weak dependence on wave-normal angle up to 60-70°, increasing to infinity as the wave-normal angle approaches the resonance cone. We identify regions in the (L, E) plane in which a single wave type (hiss, VLF transmitters, or lightning-generated waves) is dominant relative to the others. We find that VLF waves dominate the lifetime for 0.2-0.4 MeV at L~2 and for 0.5-0.8 MeV at L~1.5, while hiss dominates the lifetime for 2-3 MeV at L=3-3.5. The influence of lightning-generated waves is always mixed with the other two and cannot be easily differentiated. Limitations of the method for addressing effects due to restricted latitude or pitch angle domains are also discussed. Finally, for each (L, E) we search for the minimum lifetime and find that the “optimal” frequency that produces this lifetime increases as L diminishes. Restricting the search to very oblique waves, which could be emitted during the DSX satellite mission, we find that the optimal frequency is always close to 0.16Wce.",

The availability of long time series of high-resolution multidisciplinary data is a fundamental requirement to understand the multi-scale physical processes controlling faulting and earthquake generation processes. A crucial step for the seismological community is the availability of high-resolution catalogues of accurate earthquake locations describing the long-term brittle response of the fault activity.\nWe report on the seismicity recorded in a sector of the Northern Apennines undergoing active extension and where a set of high-angle normal faults is detached by the Alto Tiberina low-angle normal fault (ATF). From 2010, this area hosts a research infrastructure (the Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory, TABOO), consisting of a dense array of multi-sensor stations, devoted to studying the earthquakes preparatory phase and the fast and slow deformation processes along the ATF fault system.\nWe show the location of about 30k low-magnitude earthquakes recorded during the past 4 years (2010-2014) showing a completeness magnitude of the catalogue of ML0.5. Data have been analyzed by combining an automatic picking procedure for P and S waves, together with cross-correlation and double-difference location methods.\nThe seismicity pattern shows an almost constant and high rate of seismic release along the ATF plane (r = 24.30e−04 eqks/day*km2) with clusters of similar events identified all along the fault plane. On the contrary a long series of low magnitude seismic sequences (Mmax 4.0) activated minor synthetic and antithetic normal faults segments (4–5 km long) located in the main fault hanging-wall. The geometry of the fault segments described by the seismicity distribution is cinematically consistent with the focal mechanisms solutions.",

We then examine the air quality data together with the meteorology data to investigate the potential impacts of extreme air pollution meteorology on air quality.

            "abstract": "There are at least two different micro-instability processes that applies to the F-region cusp/polar cap ionosphere. These are the Gradient Drift Instability (GDI) and the Kelvin Helmholtz Instability (KHI). Due to space weather effects on radio communication and satellite signals it is of practical interest to assess the relative importance of these two instability modes and to quantify their growth rates. The Investigation of Cusp Irregularities (ICI) rocket program has been developed to investigate these plasma instabilities and formation scintillation irregularities. High resolution measurements are critical to get realistic quantities on the growth rates. The results achieved so far demonstrates that cusp ionosphere precipitation can give rise to km scale plasma structures on which grow rates are down to a few tens of seconds compared to earlier measures of ten minutes based on ground observations. This has to do with the spatial resolution required for these measurements. Growth rates for the KHI instability is found to be of the same order, which is consistent with growth rates calculated from the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. I.e. both instability modes can be highly efficient in the cusp ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "We combine energetic electron observations by the two STEREO spacecraft with ACE measurements at the Earth's longitude to investigate events with wide longitudinal spreads. We scanned the whole STEREO dataset up to mid-2013 and collected 21 of such events. To be counted as a wide-spread event, a minimum longitudinal separation angle of 80 degrees is requested between the source active region at the Sun and the magnetic footpoint of one spacecraft observing the event. Special attention is paid to anisotropies to distinguish different source and transport mechanisms leading to the unexpectedly wide particle spreads. One favorable mechanism is efficient perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium leading to vanishing anisotropies for larger separation angles. Another scenario is a large particle spread which is performed close to the Sun either due to a coronal shock or due to coronal transport. In this case, the observations at 1 AU during the early phase of the events are expected to show significant anisotropies due to the wide injection range at the Sun and particle focusing during the outwards propagation. For both of the above scenarios we find events in our sample, which suit the expected observations and even further events, which suggest a more complex scenario.",

            "abstract": "Vietnam is currently undergoing a rapid economic and demographic development, characterized by internal migrations from the rural areas to the main cities with increasing water demands to guarantee adequate energy and food productions. Hydropower is the primary renewable energy resource in the country, accounting for 33% of the total electric power production, while agriculture contributes for 18% of the national GDP and employs 70% of the population. To cope with this heterogeneous and fast-evolving context, water resources development and management have to be reconsidered by enlarging their scope across sectors and by adopting effective tools to analyze the potential of current and projected infrastructure along with their operating strategies. This work contributes a novel decision-analytic framework based on Multi-Objective Evolutionary Direct Policy Search (MOE-DPS) to support the design of integrated and sustainable water resources management strategies in the Red–Thai Binh River system. The Red River Basin is the second largest basin of Vietnam, with a total area of about 169,000 km2, and comprises three main tributaries and several reservoirs, namely SonLa and HoaBinh on the Da River, ThacBa and TuyenQuang on the Lo River. These reservoirs are regulated for maximizing hydropower production, mitigating flood primarily in Hanoi, and guaranteeing irrigation water supply to the agricultural districts in the delta. The dimensionality of the system and the number of objectives involved increase the complexity of the problem. We address these challenges by combining the MOE-DPS framework with Gaussian radial basis functions policy approximation and the Borg MOEA, which have been demonstrated to guarantee good solutions quality in such many objective policy design problems. Results show that the proposed framework successfully identified alternative management strategies for the system, which explore different tradeoffs among the multi-sector services involved. These solutions are then evaluated under various scenarios of climate change and projected socio-economic conditions to identify their vulnerabilities and, possibly, to design improved operating policies, which are more robust to the future uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is a mountain glacier system comprised of over 400 glaciers, and is an important contributor to historical and future sea level rise. Assessment and monitoring of AP glaciers is crucial for understanding sensitivity to climate change. However, whilst retreat of glacier fronts and the behaviour of individual glaciers has been extensively documented, wide-area assessment of AP glacier mass change is lacking. This research addresses this by unlocking a unique historical archive of aerial imagery through a remote sensing approach. This is enabling quantitative, wide-area assessment of glacier change across the AP.\nUnderstanding AP change over the 20th Century is vital for modelling future changes. However, satellite measurements span only a few decades, and to-date there has been no means of quantifying change over longer periods. However, this research presents a novel methodology to extract 3D measurements from an archive of > 30,000 aerial images dating back to the 1940s. This overcomes the requirement for ground control by employing an automated registration technique. Control is derived from digital elevations models (DEMs) generated from present-day ASTER satellite imagery. Through least squares surface matching, DEMs extracted from archival imagery are registered to scale-stable ASTER DEMs to determine relative change. This minimises offsets between the two DEMs, allowing robust determination of elevation changes. The spatial pattern of 20thC change is being assessed at 50 benchmark glaciers distributed across the AP, for periods of up to 65 years. In complement, a temporally refined assessment is being undertaken at 10 glaciers with multiple epochs of aerial imagery. Results to-date indicate a general trend of surface lowering, most notably over frontal regions. Spatial and temporal patterns of change will be used to investigate the drivers of AP change and establish a suite of benchmark glaciers for future monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Supertyphoon Haiyan (local name: Yolanda) struck the Philippines on 7–9 Nov 2013. It constantly reached category 5 (SSH scale) during its crossing of the archipelago. Storm surge heights of more than 7 m, wave heights of up to 5 m, and extensive flooding along the coast are reported. The death toll surpassed 6,000 individuals, and more than 16 M people were affected in total. The massive storm surge, which surprised many residents in particular on Samar and Leyte, also initiated the dislocation of large boulders at the coastline of SE Samar. Since such deposits may indicate maximum flooding distances and flow velocities of extreme wave events over timescales exceeding the era of historical documentation, they have increasingly been explored as a source for coastal hazard assessment. However, there is no clear consensus on differences in transport capacities and boulder field patterns created by storms and tsunamis. Thus, records from recent events provide a pivotal reference for process-related interpretation of other coastal boulder fields. We conducted a geomorphological and sedimentological survey after Haiyan on Leyte, Samar, Negros, and Bantayan. In SE Samar, the largest boulder (~75 m³; 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 m³; ~180 t) was shifted for 45 m on an inclined upper intertidal platform behind a Holocene reef by longshore sliding. A clast of ~70 t was moved by saltation and/or rolling for the same distance. A boulder of ~23.5 t was quarried at 2 m a.s.l. (above mean sea level) from the cliff edge of the Pleistocene carbonate platform and transported to a position of 6 m a.s.l. Boulders of up to ~17 t were moved from 6.5 to 10 m a.s.l., 2 m below the highest flood marks. Volumes of the limestone boulders were calculated using DGPS-derived point clouds transferred to ArcGIS. Densities were estimated to be around 2.3 g cm-3 using rock samples and the Archimedean principle. Downward-facing rock pools, grass patches, living barnacles, roots and soil staining on exposed former bottom sides, and fresh wood jammed under the rocks provide unambiguous evidence for subrecent transport and overturning. We conclude that the geological legacy of Haiyan calls for a careful reconsideration of possible storm surge transport where boulders, based on their size, have previously been associated with tsunami impacts and storms have been ruled out to be the cause.",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project (DSDDP) is an international research initiative aiming to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental and paleoseismic history of the Dead Sea Basin (DSB) in the Levantine region. Within this framework, analysis of microbial communities intend to qualify the extent of life in this extreme environment, the factors allowing its development and their contribution to the sedimentary and geochemical record. The extreme chemistry of the Dead Sea prevents the use of common in situ imaging techniques leaving little information on the general activity of the subsurface biosphere. Cloning and metagenomic techniques have however been implemented at different levels of a 457 m deep core. Results suggest a differential development or survival of the microbial community along the sedimentary column. Reasons for such distribution remain unclear but cannot only be imparted to salinity. Poorly known communities (e.g. Candidate Divisions MSBL1 and KB1) with strong potential for adaptations to anoxic hypersaline environments are recovered in some intervals. Halobacteria classes generally dominate the assemblages. Metagenomic data allowed characterizing their presence in two evaporitic facies of the core (aragonite at 2.7 m and gypsum at 90.6 m below lake floor), where they exhibit both salt-in and salt-out strategies to cope with the high salinities of the Dead Sea. Metabolisms are also adapted to the high heavy metal concentrations and low nutrient availability in the sediment. Although more work is needed in order to infer the impact of these microorganisms on the sediment and element cycles, indices of methanogenesis, fermentation and sulfate reducing activity imply influence on the carbon and sulfur cycle of the Dead Sea subsurface. This is highlighted by traces of microbial degradation of organic matter viewed under SEM, and by the formation of euhedral Fe-S mineralizations as a result of reduction of sulfur. Overall, this work calls for the importance of unilaterally establishing protocols for the study of geomicrobiological characteristics in ICDP projects. It also demonstrates the input and drawbacks of high-throughput sequencing methods, to study poorly known assemblages in extreme environments.",

Furthermore, we want to learn more about the structure of the oceanic crust and mantle 100 km North of the Gloria Fault (major transform fault at the plate boundary between Eurasian and African plate in the Atlantic ocean). For the latter, we employ receiver functions and apparent P-wave incidence angles.\nWe deployed 12 ocean bottom stations (OBS) as a mid aperture array (75 km) in the deep Eastern Mid Atlantic (4-6 km) in 2011. Each free fall station consists of a broad band seismometer and a hydrophone. After 10 month of recording, the stations were recovered. We use P phase and Rayleigh phase polarization to estimate the orientation of the stations.\nDifferent data quality and site effects at the stations need a careful review of the processing parameters (filter, deconvolution length) used for the calculation of the receiver functions. We defined different criteria as relative spike position within the deconvolution time window, and energy ratios of several time windows of the deconvolved traces to assess an evaluation of the receiver function quality in dependence on the used processing parameters. Additionally, we had a look at the relationship between the apparent incidence angle and the S-velocity and find that it differs for the ocean bottom in comparison to the free surface. Surprisingly, the densities of the oceanic crust and the water column, as well as the P-velocity of the water column have also an influence on the apparent incidence angle. We measured incidence angles for several events and find that the angles show a dependence on the dominant frequency of the event.\nBy comparison with synthetic receiver functions, we find that water multiples have a small or no influence at all on the real data receiver functions. We identify the MOHO conversion which indicates a crustal thickness of about 6 to 9 km which could be expected for 70 Ma old oceanic crust. Furthermore, there exist several features which are related to mantle structures. Finally, we use the Zhu and Kanamori (2000) algorithm, the apparent incidence angle, and the comparison with synthetic receiver functions to come up with a preliminary 1D velocity model.",

Data acquisition concerning paleo-earthquakes, related hazards, and tectonic activity beyond historical records plays an important role. Such information can be obtained with tools from tectonic geomorphology, geophysics, historic seismicity, and paleo-seismology that should span a variety of time and length scales.\nThe Chon-Kemin Valley in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan) is a small, intermontane basin of unknown origin framed by a network of active faults. In the year 1911, the Chon-Kemin earthquake (Mw=8.1) activated fault structures of about 200 km length which also ruptured the surface along the Chon-Kemin Valley and caused numerous landslides and rock avalanches of up to several tens of millions of cubic meters in volume. The Chon-Kemin earthquake was one of a series of strong seismic events that affected the northern Tien Shan between 1885 and 1938.\nA seismic survey across the Chon-Kemin Valley was conducted to investigate the subsurface velocity structure of the valley and its surrounding faults. Tomographic inversion techniques were applied to first-arrival traveltimes of refracted P waves, and the seismic data were screened for reflection signatures. Additionally, the region was analyzed through paleo-seismological trenching.\nTomographic and reflection images identified a shallow basin structure bounded by a set of thrust faults in the south only which - in part – correlate with the surface trace of the rupture. The deformation seems to be distributed in time and space across several sub-parallel fault strands. Synthesis of historical (analog) recordings of this earthquake provide new insights into the source mechanisms and processes.",

            "abstract": "Variations of the abundance of heavy species observed in the solar wind are usually attributed to spacecraft encounters with streams emanating from different places and altitudes in the source region and their further evolution is considered as being negligible. These conclusions are based on an analysis of highly averaged data and much less attention was devoted to variations on the time scale of seconds. The BMSW instrument onboard the Spektr-R spacecraft provides a high-time resolution data of the helium and proton fluxes and proton velocity, density, and temperature that suitable for investigations of rapid variations. The paper compares measurements in two points (Spektr-R and Wind) and focuses on the changes of helium abundance on this middle scale and on their correlations with variations of other parameters. We have found that only a low-frequency part of He abundance variations can be attributed to changes of the source region, whereas a significant portion of them could be generated by in-transit turbulence that is probably driven by the speed difference between the ion species.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the large-scale deformation of the India-Eurasia collision zone has been pursued for more than 4 decades. However, the driving forces for the largest area of continental deformation zone on earth have not been entirely resolved; the source of such driving forces remains enigmatic. One reason could be that the driving forces have to be sufficiently large to overcome the resistance of the Tibetan Plateau, created by excess gravitational potential energy (GPE) over a long time span. Another reason is that seismic experiments carried out in the Tibetan Plateau, due to the harsh natural conditions, are fewer, making it challenging to resolve high-resolution seismic structure beneath Tibet. We address this issue of driving forces in this deformation zone by quantifying the primary contributions to the lithospheric stress field. We take into account effects of topography and shallow lithosphere structure, as well as tractions originating from deeper mantle convection, in order to calculate model estimates of the total lithosphere stresses. We evaluate recent published global seismic tomographic models (P-wave, S-wave, and geodynamic models) and select a tomographic model which, when used in the semi-analytical mantle circulation model HC (Hager and O'Connell, 1981; Milner et al., 2009), provides a best fit to observations of geoid, surface motions, strain rates, and stress orientations. We use the joint modeling of lithosphere and mantle dynamics approach of Ghosh and Holt (2012) to compute the full lithosphere stresses, except that we use HC for the circulation model, which can only handle radial viscosity variations. After using the selected seismic tomographic model of SAW642AN (Panning and Romanowicz, 2006) to compute the global lithosphere stresses, we refine the calculated stresses in the India-Eurasia collision zone. Our results show that both the driving stresses from mantle convection and GPE differences contribute to the deviatoric stress field in this area. The mantle convection influence, consisting of significant downwelling of negative density buoyancies beneath Tibet and Indian Plate, contributes to the NE-SW compressional stresses, whereas the GPE differences contribute the North-South rifts and the clockwise rotation of motions around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis.",

Cryostratigraphyc features i.e. total ice content and forms of ice patterns reflects the important processes such as water migration due to freezing in frozen active layer soils and history of sedimentation and freezing in underlying perennially frozen deposits. That plays significant role in biogeochemical processes that take place in the Arctic ecosystem.\nCurrent research was based on description and analyzing of 8 cores taken during 2012 and 2013 coring campaigne had been done at the Barrow Environmental Observatory research site.\nCores were taken from different types of polygons and analyzed on lithological composition, soil density, ice content and thermal conductivity. Volumetric ice content within the active layer composed by organic soil consists of 70 to 80% and within silt one – less than 60%. Ice content of underlying syncryogenic perennial frozen deposits is about 70%. No clear evidences of soil moisture redistribution due to freezing of active layer were noticed in the cores composed by the organic soil.\nOrganic soil does not have any clear cryogenic structures. Ice usually fills the pores and follows the plants fibers. Mineral soil has recticulated cryogenic structure (ice forms grid like patterns with vertically oriented cells) with some thin (up to 2 cm thick) layers of soil particles and aggregates suspended in ice.\nThermal conductivity of frozen samples varies in the range from 1.5 to 2.8 W/(m*°K). It has a positive correlation with soil density and negative with gravimetric ice content (see figure below). Mineral soils have a higher bulk density and average thermal conductivity in the range 2.15 W/(m*°K), organic soils have a lower density and average thermal conductivity about 2 W/(m*°K). Samples, composed by fibrous has an extremely high ice content and low bulk density. Its average thermal conductivity is close to the values typical for ice (2.3 W/(m*°K)).\nCurrent research was supported by US DOE as a part of research project Next Generation of Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE).",

            "abstract": "Paucity of measurements means that quantifying and evaluating the Arctic thermal and hydrological cycles is problematic. For example: atmospheric reanalyses are not well constrained by observations; for river runoff measurements, there are un-gauged flows to consider; and until the relatively recent advent of autonomous measurement systems, ocean measurements outside the summer melt season were rare. We have assembled a complete and continuous Arctic Ocean boundary measurement array from moored installations in four ocean gateways: Fram, Davis and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening. Occasionally “patching” with coupled ice-ocean general circulation model (GCM) output is required; if so, the output water properties are validated and calibrated against climatology. This approach enables application of inverse modeling methods through the use of conservation constraints, and consequent generation of a set of 12 monthly-mean ocean (including sea ice) fluxes of freshwater and heat spanning a full calendar year. We will present results from a single annual cycle (2005-6). We have also transferred the design of the Arctic Ocean Boundary Array to the GCM environment, where we have calculated the mean annual cycles (from ca. 30-year model runs) both of net surface fluxes (atmosphere-ocean and land-ocean, including sea ice) and equivalent ice and ocean boundary fluxes of freshwater and heat, at two model resolutions (1/4 degree and 1/12 degree global mean) and for two different surface forcing data sets. We will show the resulting comparisons of the mean annual cycles of measured and modeled Arctic freshwater and heat fluxes, and also show the modeled mean annual cycle of heat and freshwater storage. We believe that the integral boundary array formed by sustained measurements in the four named ocean gateways should be a cornerstone of any Arctic environmental monitoring system.",

            "abstract": "Collisionless shocks play a significant role in the solar wind interaction with the planets, and their studies are important for understanding of physical processes in the vicinity of astrophysical objects. The main process that takes place at the collisionless shock is the redistribution of the energy of the directed plasma motion to the plasma thermalization and acceleration of a part of particles to high energies. The shocks are often associated with high-frequency (several Hz) wave packets in both upstream and downstream regions. These waves could be resolved only in fast magnetic field data because the time resolution of plasma instruments is often insufficient for their detection. The BMSW instrument onboard the Spektr-R spacecraft measures solar wind parameters with a resolution of 32 ms and open new ways to a detailed analysis of these waves. In this paper, we compare the waves in regions adjacent to interplanetary shocks observed in course of the 2011–2013 years and with a set of bow shock crossings associated with wave activity. Since the magnetometer onboard Spektr-R is not in operation, we compare BMSW observations with Wind fast magnetic field measurements. We analyze differences in the ion structure of low-Mach number fast forward interplanetary shocks and bow shocks (as representatives of fast reverse high-Mach number shocks). The comparison is focused on the formation mechanism of both types of shocks and on a search for a best scaling parameter.",

            "abstract": "Thick packages of drift-type sediments were identified in the northwestern and central part of the Fram Strait, mainly along the western Yermak Plateau flank, but also in the central, flat part of the Fram Strait. A large-scale field of sediment waves was found north of 80.5°, along the Yermak Plateau rise. This field separates two drift bodies, a deeper one towards west and a shallower one towards east. The drift bodies were deposited by bottom currents, most likely by the northbound Yermak Branch of the West Spitsbergen Current, but an influence of a southbound current on the westren drift body cannot be ruled out. Within the drift bodies and even more pronounced withing the sediment waves, a stratigraphic boundary is clearly visible. It separates a lower package of waves migrating upslope at a low angle of ~5° from an upper package with significantly increased wave crest migration at ~16.5°. Using the seismic network, this stratigraphic boundary could be tracked to ODP Leg 151, Site 911, where it corresponds to the lithostratigraphic boundary between units IA and IB dated to 2.7 Ma. The increase in wave-crest migration angle points at a shift towards higher sedimentation rates at 2.7 Ma. This corresponds to the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation with a major expansion of the Scandinavian, northern Barents Sea, North American and Greenland ice sheets. The Barents Shelf that was subaerially exposed and the expansion of the northern Barents Sea ice sheet (as well as Svalbard) are the likely sources for enhanced erosion and fluvial input along the pathway of the West Spitsbergen Current, resulting in higher sedimentation rates in the Fram Strait.",

The ability to retrieve this information from real-time processing of DR data was originally developed for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the Aura spacecraft and is used by Volcano Observatories and Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) charged with mapping ash clouds from volcanic eruptions and providing predictions/forecasts about where the ash will go. The resulting real-time SO2 and AI products help to mitigate the effects of eruptions such as the ones from Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle in Chile, which cause massive disruptions to airline flight routes for weeks as airlines struggle to avoid ash clouds that could cause engine failure, deeply pitted windshields impossible to see through, and other catastrophic events. We will discuss the implementation of real-time processing of OMPS DR data by both the Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), which provide real-time coverage over some of the most congested airspace and over many of the most active volcanoes in the world, and show examples of OMPS DR processing results from recent volcanic eruptions.",

This work extends the work of (Jouve et al. 2011, ApJ) to take into account the correct spherical geometry and meridional circulation into so-called Babcock-Leigthon flux transport dynamo models. Based on twin-experiments, in which we observe our dynamo simulations, and on a well defined cost function using toroidal and poloidal field observations we are able to recover the main attributes of the dynamo solution used to test our data assimilation algorithm. By assimilating solar data (such as Wolf number or butterfly diagram) we are starting to deduce the profile and temporal variations of key ingredients of the solar dynamo. We find that the data sampling and the temporal window are key to get reliable results. We show how such a powerful technique can be used to improve our ability to predict the solar magnetic activity.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that the solar wind undergoes a heating along its path through the solar system but the sources of this heating are still under debate. Among them, a gradual dissipation of large scale discontinuities toward smaller scales and, eventually, to the heat via turbulent cascades is frequently discussed.\nThe contribution presents the analysis of ion density variations that are measured onboard the Spektr R spacecraft with a unique time resolution of 32 ms. The analysis reveals that (1) the mean frequency spectrum of density variations in the MHD range (up to about 0.05 Hz) is steeper than usually discussed –5/3, and (2) this part is followed by a plateau that is terminated near proton kinetic scales. We study the dependence of the slopes of different parts of the frequency spectra on background plasma parameters and discuss the results in view of present theories of Alfvenic turbulence in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "The eastern segment of the Hellenic Arc and Trench system is characterized by the occurrence of large earthquakes and tsunamis known from both the historical and geological record particularly in Rhodes Isl. (Greece). Historical sources maintain direct evidence of coseismic uplift in the eastern coast of Rhodes, e.g. the very large earthquake of 12 October 1856 (M~7.5), caused ground uplift while the sea receded permanently. Similar observations have been made regarding the earthquake of c. 227 BC who caused the collapse of Colossus in Rhodes and the tsunamigenic earthquake of c. AD 142. Such observations, supported by the instrumental record of seismicity, make realistic the suggestion that the historical earthquakes had their epicenters offshore but close to Rhodes city. However, in SW Asia Minor at the opposite side of Rhodes, coastal subsidence was reported as a result of the strong earthquake sequence of February-April 1851. The occurrence of strong tsunamis after some earthquakes is an independent evidence for significant, submarine coseismic fault displacement very likely in the Rhodes Abyssal Plain of water depth up to 3 km. On the other hand, geological observations have indicated that the eastern side of Rhodes has systematically uplifted during the Holocene with uplift amplitude increasing from S to N with average velocity ranging from 0 in Prasonisi at south to 1 mm/yr at the NE side of the island where coseismic uplift was reported historically. We compare the historical rate of uplift with the geologically estimated rate. To this aim we compiled a new catalogue of historical earthquakes that caused coseismic uplift in the coastal zone of Rhodes city and adopted that they had their epicenters offshore but very close to the city. From damage descriptions maximum macroseismic intensity was assigned to each one of the earthquakes. Then intensity was converted to earthquake magnitude from empirical relationships found for instrumental Greek earthquakes. The geological and historical uplift rates were compared and seismotectonic implications were discussed from the point of view of the possible surplus or deficit of the historical uplift versus the geological uplift and the resulting potential stress accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Shearing of mantle rocks within Earth’s lithosphere and asthenosphere causes mantle minerals, particularly olivine, to develop anisotropic fabrics that can be detected seismically. In laboratory studies, such anisotropic fabrics have also been associated with dependence of the viscosity of a mineral on the orientation of an applied stress. This anisotropic viscosity may affect tectonic plate motions and the stability of the lithospheric base, but it is highly dependent on 1) the rate of fabric development and 2) the poorly constrained viscosity tensor, which relates the stress applied to an olivine crystal of known orientation to the resulting strain-rate. Here we constrain the importance of viscous anisotropy in the asthenosphere using two steps. First, we developed a stochastic model of olivine fabric development in which we assume that the a-axes of olivine grains rotate into the direction of shear with continual random readjustments to the orientation of the crystals. We constrain parameters in the model by quantitatively comparing calculated fabrics to those developed in recent laboratory experiments on olivine aggregates. The resulting model is then compared to observations of naturally deformed peridotites to confirm its applicability to natural systems. Second, we use laboratory observations of strain-rates that result from stresses applied to aggregates of olivine with known crystallographic fabrics to constrain the relevant parameters of the anisotropic viscosity tensor. Together, this effort allows us to constrain both the rate of anisotropic fabric development in an arbitrary deformation geometry and also the magnitude of anisotropic viscosity that should result from these fabrics. These constraints can be applied usefully to time-dependent models of shearing within the asthenosphere or lithospheric shear zones to understand the governing viscosity structures of these regions and their associated geodynamic complexity.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation to climate change for water management involves complex interactions between different actors and sectors. The need to understand the relationships between key stakeholder institutions (KSIs) is increasingly recognized. The complexity of water management in India has meant that enhancing adaptive capacity through improved inter-institutional networks remains a challenge for both government and non-governmental institutions. To analyse such complex inter-actions this study has used Social Network and Stakeholder Analysis tools to quantify the participation of, and interactions between, each KSI in the climate change adaptation and water discourse based on keyword analysis of their online presence. Using NodeXL, a Social Network Analysis tool, network diagrams have been used to evaluate the inter-relationships between these KSIs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-five KSIs to identify the main barriers to adaptation and to triangulate the findings of the e-documents analysis. The analysis found that there is an inverse relationship between institutions’ reference to water and climate change in their web-documents. Most institutions emphasize mitigation rather than adaptation. Bureaucratic delays, poor coordination between the KSIs, unclear policies and systemic deficiencies are identified as key barriers to improving adaptive capacity within water management to climate change. However, the increasing attention being given to the perceived climate change impacts on the water sector and improving the inter-institutional networks are some of the opportunities for Indian water institutions. Although websites of Union Government Institutions seldom directly hyperlink to one another, they are linked through \"bridging\" websites which have the potential to act as brokers for enhancing adaptive capacity. The research has wider implications for analysis of complex inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional issues involving multi stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the atmospheric conditions that resulted in the 2013 Colorado floods, which caused 8 deaths and $2 billion in property damages. We assess the spatial characteristics of the rainfall event by using object identification and clustering methods and by using Poisson clustering techniques for the temporal characteristics. The characteristics of the atmospheric moisture and rainfall that led to this flooding event are found using satellite imagery, station and reanalysis data, allowing us to assess the frequency of these characteristics and any associated trends in the recent past. We also quantify the sources of moisture during the 2013 flood, and hypothesize that the amount of moisture from local moisture recycling is larger than from the Southwest US Monsoon and the Gulf of Mexico due to antecedent wet soils and record high temperatures. The observed hydrologic record is used to assess if extreme runoff events had occurred under similar meteorological conditions and if antecedent conditions and the sources of moisture are similar for other extreme hydrologic conditions. The findings of this study will allow us to understand the spatial and temporal features of atmospheric conditions that lead to hydroclimatic extreme events in the region, and aid in informing both climate and hydrologic models to more accurately simulate hydroclimatic extremes.",

            "abstract": "Sediment drifts form > 1000 m thick and > 100 km long elongated ridges along many carbon-rich continental margins creating potential reservoirs for gas and gas hydrate. Drifts develop under geostrophic currents that are often influenced on tectonic timescales by ocean basin development. Here, we discuss the tectono-sedimentary evolution of a growing Arctic gas and gas-hydrate charged sediment drift on oceanic crust in eastern Fram Strait, the tectonic controlled and only deep-water gateway between the subpolar North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. Ultraslow-spreading between NW Svalbard and NE Greenland restricts ocean basin development here permitting the unique interaction of a mid-ocean ridge transform fault with a developing sediment drift since the Late Miocene. Geophysical data constrain the timing of a 30 km lateral offset of the gas hydrate-charged deep-water sediment drift across the Molloy Transform Fault. Our reconstruction shows the drift expanded greatly during the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation at 2.7 Ma and was deposited across the transform and subsequently offset during the last 2 Ma. We describe an early gas charge model for the development of the deep-water gas hydrate system here and suggest it could be as old as 2 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Electrokinetic waves describe the coupling between seismic and electromagnetic waves that exist in porous media. The coupling between them arise from an electrochemical boundary layer between grain and fluid interface of saturated porous media. Acoustical waves cause a disturbance of the electrical fluid charge within the double layer, which therefore creates an electric streaming current (seismoelectric effect). Inversely, electromagnetic waves can generate mechanical signals (electroseismic effect). Electrokinetic conversion potentially combines high seismic resolution with good electromagnetic hydrocarbon sensitivity. The (stationary and frequency-dependent) streaming potential coefficient is a key property, which gives rise to the coupling between electromagnetic and acoustical waves. It depends strongly on the fluid conductivity, porosity, tortuosity, permeability, pore throat and zeta potential of porous media.\nWe examine experimentally both, the stationary and dynamic permeabilities and coupling coefficients of sintered glass bead systems. For this purpose a multi-purpose measuring cell was developed which allows us to carry out - besides common ultrasound experiments - also to perform stationary and frequency-dependent permeability and coupling coefficient measurements.\nFor the experiments sintered mono- and slightly polydisperse glass bead samples with different glass bead diameters between 0.4 and 8mm and porosities ranging between 21 and 39% were used.\nThe stationary and dynamic permeability and streaming potential measurements are supported by µCT scans which enable us a deeper insight into the porous medium. Based on the µCT scans of the produced sintered glass bead samples essential influence parameters, like tortuosity, porosity, effective particle diameters and pore throats in different regions of the entire scanned region have been analyzed in detail to understand the laboratory experiments, cf. Illustration 1. In addition lattice Boltzmann simulations on voxel-based data were performed to determine the numerical permeabilities of different-sized subsets and finally compared with laboratory experiments. A clearly defined permeability-, and porosity-gradient in dependence on the sample height due to gravitational influences could be determined.",

            "abstract": "The initial analyses of the Ulysses and IBEX interstellar neutral (ISN) gas observations showed small but significant differences in the ISN flow parameters. In particular, the IBEX observations have defined a narrow and tightly coupled tube in the 4-dimensional ISN parameter space (temperature and inflow speed, longitude, and latitude), which extended to the original Ulysses flow vector but with a somewhat different optimum set of values. However, adopting the Ulysses velocity vector resulted in a significantly higher temperature. Interestingly, the optimum flow vector obtained with IBEX resulted in the same temperature obtained from the Ulysses GAS analysis. These intriguing results were the starting point for a hypothesis that then was tested with a literature study from the past four decades, i.e., that the flow direction of interstellar He may be changing over time.\nHere, we analyze the data from both experiments using the Warsaw Test Particle Model, i.e., same simulation program and ionization rate model. For Ulysses GAS, we use the original data set and, in addition, the same set reprocessed with improved information on the instrument pointing in the sky. For IBEX, we model a subtle, previously unaccounted for data throughput issue for the first two observation seasons, and we analyze, for the first time, data from the two most recent seasons, when the data throughput issue was eliminated through a mode change and when the IBEX pointing strategy was changed to improve the sensitivity of the observations to tighten the possible range of the ISN flow parameters. In addition, we have refined the data uncertainty system, improved the analysis of the IBEX pointing information, and we now explicitly take into account the newly discovered Warm Breeze.\nIn combination, we present the ISN velocity vector relative to the Sun and the He temperature for the entire Ulysses GAS observations and the past two IBEX-Lo observation seasons as a time series from 1994 until 2014.",

            "abstract": "United States forests and wood products have been a significant and persistent carbon sink of 100-200 million tons annually since 1950, currently offsetting about 12% of U.S. emissions of CO2. This carbon sink is caused by recovery of forest C stocks following timber harvest and abandonment of agricultural land over the last 150 years, and more recently the growth-enhancing effects of N deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and climate variability. The forest carbon sink would have been significantly larger if not for continued losses of forest to other land uses such as urban development, and increasing impacts from natural disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks. Projections of the future U.S. C sink have raised concerns that it may disappear in a few decades because of slower growth, continued losses of forest area, and increasing demand for timber products especially bioenergy. However, continuing atmospheric and climate changes may delay this projected decline in the sink strength for another 50 years or longer. Research is urgently needed to improve projections of land-use changes and demand for timber, quantify the large-scale effects of atmospheric change and climate variability, and develop modeling approaches that can effectively integrate these multiple factors. Policy decisions to meet emissions reduction targets are partially dependent on assumptions about the magnitude of the future forest carbon sink; therefore, it is important to have convincing projections about how these various driving factors will affect forests in the future.",

The tropical\nPacific is also subject to strong and variable zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradients at\nthe interannual timescale (El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon: ENSO). A large\namount of climate records are available in the western and the central part of the Pacific and\nallow the reconstruction of SST. On the contrary there is a critical lack of data in the eastern\npart of the Pacific Ocean. In order to fill this void, we present geochemical results (Sr/Cabased\nSST) obtained from massive aragonitic coral skeletons (Porites genus) from Clipperton\natoll (10°N, 109°W), ideally located for our scientific purpose. Two coral records accurately\ndated by U/Th method covering part of the 12th (end of the Medieval Warm Period) and a part\nof the 16th (beginning of the Little Ice Age) centuries will be compared to a 20th century\nClipperton composite record (Wu et al., Palaeo3, 2014). The intensity and frequency of\nENSO events together with the seasonal range of SST in the eastern Pacific over the last\nmillennium will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan valleys are confronting severe climate change related issues (floods in summer, flash flood and landslides, water scarcity in higher altitudes) because of fluctuating monsoon precipitation and increasing seasonal temperatures. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is applied to the River Beas basin, using daily Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation and NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) meteorological data to simulate the river regime and crop yields. The Beas is regionally significant as it holds two giant dams, one which annually diverts 4700 Mm3 of water to a nearby basin. We have applied Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Ver. 2 (SUFI-2) to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the stream ﬂow modelling. The model evaluation statistics for Daily River flows at the Jwalamukhi and Pong gauges show good agreement with measured flows (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.70 and PBIAS of 7.54 %). We then applied the models within a scenario-neutral framework to develop hydrological and crop yield Impact Response Surfaces (IRS) for future changes in annual temperature and precipitation for the region from AR5. Future Q10 and Q90 daily flows indicate amplified ‘flash flood’ situations and increased low flows, respectively, with increasing temperatures due to increased snowmelt from retreating glaciers. Under existing crop and irrigation management practices, the IRS show decreasing and increasing crop yields for summer (monsoon) and winter (post monsoon) crops, respectively, with rising temperature. Climate change scenario studies shows that, the sensitivity of winter (post monsoon) crop yields to precipitation increases with increasing temperature. The paper will consider the implications of the research for future agricultural water resource management and the potential of adaptation to offset yield losses",

            "abstract": "Glaciers and snowpacks influence streamflow by altering the volume and timing of discharge. With climate change, an initial increase in total runoff is expected followed by an eventual decrease, as the glaciers or permanent snowpacks retreat. Without reliable data on snow and ice volumes and properties, initialising hydrological models for climate impact assessment is challenging.\nIn this paper we explore the implications of the model-setup assumptions regarding snow/ice reserves for future water resources simulations in the Beas catchment in northern India. Two contrasting HySIM model builds, in which snowcover in the high-elevation subcatchment is either seasonal (snow melt is snowpack limited) or permanent (snow melt is energy-limited) were calibrated and validated against observed discharge data (2000-2008). We then applied both models within a scenario-neutral framework to develop Impact Response Surface of hydrological response to future changes in annual temperature and precipitation for the region from AR5.\nBoth models had similar baseline model performance (NSE of 0.68-0.70 in calibration and 0.66 in validation), but the impact response surfaces differ in the magnitude and (for some combinations) direction of model response at low (Q10) and high (Q90) daily flows. For example, for +1oC / +10% change in annual temperature / precipitation, corresponding to around the 75th percentile changes for RCP 8.5 for the region in 2065, future Q10 changes by between -5% (assuming seasonal snow cover) and +45% (permanent snowcover) and Q90 by between +10 (seasonal snow cover) and +55% (permanent snowcover). This paper will consider the implications of data inadequacies in snowpack characterization for assessing the impacts of climate change and the associated timing of hydrological tipping points.",

            "abstract": "Current deep space tracking systems enable accurate reconstructions of the orbit and of the forces acting on a spacecraft. The estimation of the gravitational forces exerted by the bodies the spacecraft approaches are especially interesting, since the gravity field is a direct, although degenerate, expression of the internal structure. Microwave tracking of planetary probes is thus one of the few available sources of information on the interior of planets and satellites.\n NASA’s Deep Space Network will play once more a crucial role in planetary geodesy between 2016 and 2017, when the Juno and the Cassini spacecraft will probe the gravity fields of the two largest planets of the solar system. Both Juno and Cassini will be inserted into highly eccentric orbits with low pericenter altitudes, respectively around Jupiter and Saturn. The proximity to the planets offers an unprecedented sensitivity to the high degree harmonics of their gravity fields. The DSN, together with the onboard radio systems, will allow a precise measurement of the spacecraft range rate, the primary observable quantity in the determination of the gravity field.\nJuno will benefit from the use of an advanced tracking system based upon a full two-way radio link in Ka-band. Onboard the spacecraft a Ka-band digital transponder guarantees a very high frequency stability in the coherent retransmission of the received radio signal. During the 2002 solar conjunction of the spacecraft, a similar radio system onboard Cassini, together with a triple-link plasma calibration technique, enabled the most accurate test of General Relativity ever carried out. A failure of the Cassini analog Ka-band transponder forces the use of the less accurate X-band tracking system.\nThe main objectives of the gravity measurements at the two gas giants are the determination of the size of a heavy elements core, and of the amount of mass involved in the atmospheric circulation. Given the simultaneity and similarity of the two experiments it is possible to make the best use of the experimental and modeling efforts, while providing an immediate comparison of the results for the two planets. We will compare the experimental setup of the two experiments and outline the expected accuracies in the estimation of the gravity field obtained with numerical simulations.",

In this presentation, we will show how the recent QuikSCAT and ASCAT sensors could be used to build 15-year observation data time series for sea ice monitoring for both Arctic and Antarctic areas.\nBackscatter data enable to discriminate sea ice from open ocean areas, in particular scatterometers are useful to detect new ice, even at the early stage of growth which is not possible using radiometers.\nBackscatter data from scatterometer can also be used for sea ice type detection (first year from multi-year sea ice in the Arctic), results and differences between C-band and Ku-band sensors results will be presented.\nMoreover, sea ice displacement maps can be built in central Arctic from backscatter data, examples will be shown using the merging of scatterometer and radiometer data. We will see in this presentation that Antarctic sea ice displacement maps can also be inferred. From these displacement maps, mean sea surface currents can be estimated.\nIn this presentation we will also focus on the benefit of the use of the two ASCAT sensors that are presently available (onboard MetOp-A -since 2007 and -B, since 2012), in particular for the Antarctic area.\nThis presentation will enhance i) the need of scatterometer data for sea ice application with many examples of the inferred parameters in particular from the U.S. QuikSCAT/SeaWinds and the E.U. MetOp/ASCATs scatterometers ii) the need of the continuity of scatterometers missions and iii) the benefit of the combination of sensors and datasets (scatterometers, scatterometers with radiometers) for a long-term observation of the polar areas.\nThese data are routinely processed at IFREMER/CERSAT and available for the scientific community. The ASCAT calibrated reprocessed data (2007-2014) will be soon available, added to the SeaWinds/QuikSCAT dataset (1999-2009), they will provide an exceptional basis for future analysis and synthesis of long-term variations of the sea ice in both Arctic and Antarctic polar areas.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols affect the Earth’s climate through their radiative effects, being one of the most uncertain areas in climate modeling. Radiative effects depend mainly on the aerosol optical properties and can be divided into direct and semi-direct effect, produced by the scattering and absorption of radiation; and indirect effect, which influences the aerosols-cloud interactions. Aerosols are widely known to affect radiation, temperature, stability, clouds, and precipitation. However, scientific literature about their effects on wind is scarce.\nIn this sense, the effects of aerosol particles on spatially-distributed winds over Europe are examined. The methodology carried out consists of two WRF-Chem simulations for Europe for the entire year 2010 differing only in the inclusion (or not) of aerosol radiative feedbacks. These simulations have been carried out under the umbrella of the second phase of the AQMEII (Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative, http://aqmeii.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). A Euro-CORDEX compliant domain at 0.22º and 23 km resolution has been used. The first simulation does not take into account any aerosol feedbacks (NFB) and the second simulation differs from the base case by the inclusion of direct and indirect radiative feedbacks (FB).\nResults show that the presence of aerosol generally reduces the wind over Europe. The absorption and scattering of solar radiation by the aerosol particles heat the air and cool the ground temperature leading to an atmospheric stability. This increases the atmospheric stability and decreases the turbulence, as consequence the vertical transfer of momentum diminishes and the surface winds are slower. In addition, the decrease of solar radiation to the ground weakens the thermal circulations, such as land-sea breezes which is more noticeable in the southern of Europe in summer. On the other hand, the indirect effect of the aerosols through their enhancement of clouds also favors a decline of winds evidenced by the spatial correlations between the cloud optical depth and wind speed reductions.\nDespite these results further investigation is necessary in order to reduce the uncertainties of the aerosol effects over meteorological variables.",

Educating the next generation of informed decision-makers that will be able to make knowledgeable responses to global climate change impacts requires them to have access to information that is credible, accurate, easy to understand, and appropriate. However, available resources are too often produced by inaccessible models for scenario simulations chosen by researchers hindering exploration and enquiry.\nThis paper describes the interactive exploratory web-based CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment (IA) Platform (www.climsave.eu/iap) that aims to democratise climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability modelling. The regional version of the Platform contain linked simulation models (of the urban, agriculture, forestry, water and biodiversity sectors), probabilistic climate scenarios and socio-economic scenarios, that enable users to select their inputs (climate and socioeconomic), rapidly run the models using their input variable settings and view their chosen outputs.\nThe interface of the CLIMSAVE IA Platform is designed to facilitate a two-way iterative process of dialogue and exploration of “what if’s” to enable a wide range of users to improve their understanding surrounding impacts, adaptation responses and vulnerability of natural resources and ecosystem services under uncertain futures. This paper will describe the evolution of the Platform and demonstrate how using its holistic framework (multi sector / ecosystem service; cross-sectoral, climate and socio-economic change) will help to assist learning around the challenging concepts of responding to global change.",

            "abstract": "Soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves are mandatory for modeling water flow in soils. It is a common approach to measure few points of the water retention curve and to calculate the hydraulic conductivity curve by assuming that the soil can be represented as a bundle of capillary tubes. Both curves are then used to predict water flow at larger spatial scales. However, the predictive power of these curves is often very limited. This can be very easily illustrated if we measure the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) for a drainage experiment and then use these properties to predict the water flow in the case of imbibition. Further complications arise from the incomplete wetting of water at the solid matrix which results in finite values of the contact angles between the solid-water-air interfaces. To address these problems we present a physically-based model for hysteretic SHPs. This model is based on bundles of angular pores. Hysteresis for individual pores is caused by (i) different snap-off pressures during filling and emptying of single angular pores and (ii) by different advancing and receding contact angles for fluids that are not perfectly wettable. We derive a model of hydraulic conductivity as a function of contact angle by assuming flow perpendicular to pore cross sections and present closed-form expressions for both the sample scale water retention and hydraulic conductivity function by assuming a log-normal statistical distribution of pore size. We tested the new model against drainage and imbibition experiments for various sandy materials which were conducted with various liquids of differing wettability. The model described both imbibition and drainage experiments very well by assuming a unique pore size distribution of the sample and a zero contact angle for the perfectly wetting liquid. Eventually, we see the possibility to relate the particle size distribution with a model which describes the SHPs.",

            "abstract": "Iceland’s Katla volcano frequently produces explosive eruptions (VEI 3-5) that generate large quantities of ash and powerful glacial floods (jökulhlaups). Its last eruption (VEI 4, basalt) was in 1918, but another may be imminent, given recent unrest and historic correlation with activity at Eyjafjallajökull, which erupted in 2010.\nInvestigations of eruption products at nearby Torfajökull [1,2] have shown that volatiles are the primary control on the eruptive behaviour of subglacial rhyolite, rather than ice thickness. Explosive events are characterised by high pre-eruptive H2O contents (up to ~5 wt. %) and more closed system degassing, demonstrated by H2O–Cl ratios, microlite contents and vesiculation modelling. We have continued to develop the use of volatile degassing as an sensitive indicator of syn-eruptive pressure conditions [3,4].\nWe are now applying similar approaches to the basaltic Katla 1918 event, to determine the relative influence of volatiles and meltwater on eruption mechanisms. Sampling has included air-fall tephra from Mýrdalsjökull and jökulhlaup deposits from Múlakvísl. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data reveals that airfall tephra have degassed to atmospheric conditions (0.07 wt % H2O), whereas jökulhlaup-carried juvenile clasts have elevated H2O contents (0.18 to 0.32 wt % H2O), consistent with quenching beneath a load of ice, water or tephra.\nOngoing quantification of vesicle and crystal size distributions, together with experimental vesicle growth rates using hotstage microscopy, will help constrain rates and amounts of magma decompression, degassing and interactions with meltwater. We also aim to investigate chamber-to-surface degassing through analysis of volatile concentrations in melt inclusions.\n[1] Owen et al. 2013a Geology 41: 251-254\n[2] Owen et al. 2013b J Volcanol Geoth Res 258: 143-162\n[3] Tuffen et al. 2010 Earth Sci Rev 99: 1-18\n[4] Owen et al. 2012 Bull Volcanol 74: 1355-1378",

            "abstract": "We undertook a detailed field campaign in the Wadi Gideah, which is located in the Wadi-Tayin Massif in the southern part of the Oman Ophiolite, to sample a complete section of fast-spreading oceanic crust. Our concept of performing different analytical and structural investigations on the same samples enabled us to create a coherent data set. The thickness of the layered and virtually undeformed oceanic crust, containing pillow lavas and sheeted dikes as well as varitextured, foliated and layered gabbros resting on a relatively thin MOHO transition zone, was recalculated to approximately 6km. Here we present our data focusing on the petrological and geochemical logs obtained. Samples from the layered gabbro sequence show modal compositions of ~50 vol% plagioclase, ~40 vol% clinopyroxene and ~10 vol% olivine in average. The samples from the foliated gabbro sequence display a slightly higher amount of plagioclase. In very few samples up to 20 vol% of orthopyroxene is present. The layered gabbro sequence display Mg# 71-82 for olivine, Mg# 75-83 for clinopyroxene and An% in plagioclase of 71-93 mol%. The foliated gabbro sequence display Mg# 67-79 for olivine, Mg# 76-85 for clinopyroxene and An% in plagioclase of 58-85 mol%. The varitextured gabbro sequence display Mg# 74-80 for clinopyroxene and An% 59-86 in plagioclase mol%. The generally evolving trends in mineral major element composition from bottom to top of the profile are also observed for bulk rock major and trace element data. The average Sr87/Sr86 ratio is 0.7033 ± 0.0002 for the entire foliated and layered gabbro with significantly higher values for samples from fault zones cutting the gabbros at all crustal level which here are interpreted as possible hydrothermal pathways for cooling of the deep crust. We calculated the Wadi Gideah bulk crust composition and modeled possible fractionation paths, implying significant crystallization in the deep crust.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical processes mediated by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria have the potential to impact on the post-closure evolution of a geological disposal facility (GDF) for radioactive waste. However, the organisms promoting these processes will likely be subject to significant radiation fluxes. Therefore, the impact of acute doses of ionizing radiation on the physiological status of the model Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis was assessed. FT-IR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF-MS suggested that the metabolic response to radiation is underpinned by alterations to lipids and proteins. Furthermore, the irradiated phenotype exhibits enhanced Fe(III)-reduction.\nThe impact of radiation on the extracellular environment was also assessed. Exposure to gamma radiation caused activation of ferrihydrite and hematite for enzymatic reduction by S. oneidensis. TEM, SAED and Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that this effect was a result of radiation induced changes to crystallinity leading to an increase in bioavailability of Fe(III) for respiration.\nTo assess the impact of radiation on sediment microbial communities, a series of microcosm experiments were constructed and gamma irradiated over a two month period. Sediments irradiated at a dose rate of 0.5 Gy h-1 exhibited enhanced Fe(III) reduction despite receiving doses potentially lethal to indigenous microorganisms, whilst biogeochemical processes in sediments irradiated with 30 Gy h-1 were only partially restricted. Despite this, 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing revealed significant dose-dependent shifts in the microbial communities in tandem with changes in microcosm biogeochemical profiles.\nCollectively, these results indicate that, despite significant total absorbed doses, biogeochemical processes will likely not be restricted by dose rates expected in a deep geological repository. Indeed, electron accepting processes in such environments may even be stimulated by radiation.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons are often considered the panacea of provenance analysis but are often limited to inquiry based solely on the presence or absence of populations and thus restricted to qualitative comparisons. However, if one broad age spectrum source dominates a detrital dataset other sources may be obscured. We present a method for removing a broad age spectrum source through a process of randomly drawing grains from the dominant source, pairing them with sample grains and removing matched aged grains. This results in a residual population representing all remaining unassociated ages, which can then be compared to other potential sources using PDP crossplot and likeness comparisons. The sources best matching our post-removal sample are resampled in varying proportions, with the dominant, broad age spectrum source, to recreate the pre-subtraction sample by maximizing the population comparison tests.\nWe test our method with a synthetic dataset of 18, 10,000-grain 'sandstone' populations created from 6 easily differentiable sources and 1 complex source representing the dominant, broad age spectrum source. Synthetic detrital zircon age populations are created by randomly selecting from each of the synthetic populations. This method was able to consistently determine the correct sources and their mixing proportions to within ±10% of the original artificial sandstone proportions. Covariance between the two comparison tests also shows improvement relative to their pre-removal counterparts. Previously published detrital zircon age data from modern sediment samples of the Yangtze River (He et al., 2013) show a dominance of ages commonly attributed to the Triassic Songpan Ganze Terrane, which has a broad age spectrum. We applied our method to these Yangtze age populations in conjunction with 35 potential sources units compiled and consolidated from the literature. Applying this technique to modern Chinese sediments identifies previously unknown contributing sources and their mixing proportions, which can significantly increase our ability to examine spatial and temporal changes and patterns often sought in provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "Channel bank erosion has been shown to contribute significantly to catchment sediment budgets, yet representation of this process in catchment models is often overly simplistic, or non-existent. In this study, the physically-based hydrological SHETRAN model has been modified to improve representation of channel bank erosion processes by incorporation of the influences of vegetation and channel sinuosity. The presence of vegetation on channel banks increases bank stability, reducing erosion rates. Large flood events have the potential to remove bank vegetation resulting in a sudden increase of bank erodibility, which then decreases over time as vegetation re-establishes. Within the updated model, erodibility coefficients throughout the catchment are temporally variable and respond to high magnitude discharge events to represent vegetation removal. The influence of further flood events during the vegetation recovery period is enhanced due to the increased erodibility, enabling the model to represent memory within the catchment. Meteorological conditions after high magnitude events influence the length of recovery time, which is also incorporated within the model. Channel sinuosity and channel curvature show a non-linear relationship with bank erosion due to the positioning of high-velocity flow within channels. The influence of sinuosity has been incorporated within the model by spatial variation of minimum and maximum bank erodibility coefficients according to variation of sinuosity within represented channels. The developed model has been applied to the Eden catchment, Cumbria, UK. The model has been validated using observed long-term bank erosion data from a GIS overlay methodology, indicating bank erosion contributes up to 11% of the annual catchment sediment budget. This paper will detail both the new modelling approach and accuracy of its application.",

            "abstract": "As Cassini passes close to Saturn during its regular orbits, evidence of particle injections can often be found in many different data sets (including MAG, CAPS, MIMI, and RPWS). One reason injections are easily visible in Saturn’s inner magnetosphere is that the circumplanetary neutral gas distribution can reduce the intensities of some charged particles. For example, energetic ions can be lost from the system following charge exchange with neutrals and energetic electrons can lose energy in collisions with gas and dust. Injections in the inner magnetosphere are believed to be flux tube interchange events that are part of a larger circulation system in which cold dense plasma flows outward carrying magnetic flux with it. The closed magnetic flux is ultimately returned to the inner magnetosphere in the form of injections of rapidly moving hotter but lighter flux tubes from the middle magnetosphere. In this presentation, we will look at injections from the perspective of multiple Cassini data sets. Some features of these structures have already been identified in the literature from one or more data sets. For example, the tendency for injections to appear as enhancements (depressions) in magnetic field strength at low (high) magnetic latitude has been documented (Andre et al. 2007). Furthermore, that flux tube bundles seem to narrow in spatial extent in the equatorial plane in the higher magnetic field region has also been described. Here, we will look at selected structures distributed in radial distance and latitude as a step toward generalizing their characteristics at various locations. We will consider issues such as the magnetic signature in the field components, the typical wave signatures, the energy range of the injection, and the presence of isolated features versus multiple features occurring simultaneously. We will also discuss observational issues, such as when each instrument is optimally suited to detect injections, and how this relates to their structure.\nAndre, N., et al.

            "abstract": "We study in detail the 2014 winter with floods which devastated parts of Britain and extreme winter conditions at the east coast of North America. The event was associated with an anomalous Arctic polar vortex. Using a novel developed forced sensitivity tool, we reproduce the large-scale atmospheric circulation which led to this extreme climatic event in a fully coupled climate model. The same tool is now used in a future climate to reproduce this event under warmer 2100 conditions. We use initial conditions from an RCP8.5 scenario simulation of EC-Earth and use the forced sensitivity tool, which produces optimal model tendency perturbations, to force the large-scale atmospheric circulation to reproduce the anomalous vortex in the fully coupled model. We find that, with the same large-scale atmospheric circulation as that of the winter of 2014, in the future climate simulations baroclinic activity over the east coast of North America is greatly reduced, despite the flow of Arctic air over the continent during the event. As a result of this, less cyclones are transported to Europe resulting in much smaller precipitation amounts in Western Europe. Also in the future climate simulations no anomalous cold wave is found over the east coast of North America due to a reduced north-south temperature gradient as a result of Arctic amplification. This particular case shows that some climatic extremes will become less severe in the future. The results of this study will be presented to the audience, as well as a brief description of the method applied.",

Models for seasonal forecasts of precipitation in this region are mostly based on statistical connections between precipitation and slowly-varying atmospheric variables like sea surface temperature (SST) and large-scale atmospheric circulation. Here we examine such connections with the atmosphere general circulation model ECHAM5 in order to explore the seasonal predictability of HoA rainfall with a dynamical model.\nA historic run with a T106 horizontal resolution (~ 1.125°) was forced with reconstructed sea surface temperature data from 1870 to 2009. Comparisons to observation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project showed that ECHAM5 captures the diverse seasonal cycles of precipitation throughout the HoA. The results of an analysis of variance indicate that the season with the highest potential for seasonal predictability of rainfall in this region is the Northern Hemisphere summer.\nIn agreement with observational studies, the model simulations show an El Niño-like SST pattern with a warm tongue in the equatorial East and Central Pacific in summers of low precipitation in the Horn of Africa. Accordingly, the large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies show a weak Tropical Walker Circulation in summers of low precipitation.\nWe conducted a set of sensitivity experiments with ECHAM5. Results so far show that warm SST anomalies in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific have to persist until summer to provoke a dry summer in the HoA. We do not find a difference in the HoA rainfall pattern when driving the model with evolving East Pacific or Central Pacific El Niños.",

            "abstract": "The heat capacity, Cp, for nine synthetic solid-solution members of the grossular(Gr)-spessartine(Sp) binary was measured between 2 and 300 K using relaxation calorimetry and from 280 K to 764 K using DSC methods. All solid-solution garnets exhibit normal heat capacity behavior from 764 K down to low temperatures. Below 7 K, a heat-capacity anomaly, originating from a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition related to an ordering of the electron spins of the Mn cation, is observed. This lambda-anomaly is sharp and pronounced for Mn-rich solid-solution members and it becomes more flattened and rounded with decreasing Mn concentration in the garnet. The corresponding Néel temperature decreases from 6.2 K in pure Sp to less than 2 K in Gr-rich garnets with XMngrt < 0.5. The calorimetric entropy, S298, at 298 K for all intermediate composition garnets shows a slight positive deviation from ideality, resulting in an excess calorimetric entropy, ΔSex,cal, of approximately 2 J/mol∙K. The vibrational and magnetic parts of the total calorimetric entropy, Svib and Smag, respectively, were separated using a single-parameter phonon dispersion model. A symmetric entropy interaction parameter of WS,CaMngrt = 3.8 ± 2.0 J/cation∙mol∙K is calculated for Ca-Mn mixing in the Gr-Sp binary based on garnets with XMngrt ≥ 0.5. More Gr-rich garnets have impurity phases, complicating their exact Cp behavior and, thus, they were not used in this calculation.\nA thermodynamic analysis of the published phase equilibrium experiments was also made using the calorimetrically derived WS,CaMngrt. The analysis yields a symmetric enthalpy interaction parameter of WH,CaMngrt = 3.2 ± 0.3 kJ/cation∙mol, giving a maximum excess enthalpy, ΔHex, of 0.8 kJ/cation∙mol for the Gr-Sp binary. ΔHex calculated from line broadening of IR powder spectra of the same studied Gr-Sp garnets agrees within error with that derived from the phase equilibrium and calorimetry results. ΔGex for Gr-Sp garnets is slightly positive at 500°C and becomes more negative with increasing temperatures. Its absolute values are small though and, thus, Ca-Mn mixing in garnet can be considered nearly ideal at most geologically relevant P-T conditions.",

The depth of the base of the GHSZ predicted by a numerical model that takes in to account variation in ocean temperature over the past two thousand years, is consistent with the depth of the BSR, even at its shallowest depth, where a steady-state model places base of the GHSZ shallower than the BSR. Similarly, farther up slope, where the BSR loses it coherency, the depths of the shallowest nephars are compatible with the predicted depth of the base of the GHSZ from the time-dependent model, but are about three times deeper than the predicted steady-state depth of the BSR. This approach to defining the limits of the GHSZ is not precise, as it depends upon the presence of gas. In the shallow sediment sequence, which has a high proportion of glacigenic sediments, gas is restricted to a smaller number of permeable units than in the contourite-dominated sequence farther down the continental slope. Where the seabed is shallower than the GHSZ, numerous plumes of methane gas ascend from the seabed, and gas, which has migrated up slope through dipping permeable layers, locally ponds beneath a thin veneer of unconformable glacial and post-glacial sediments on the continental shelf.",

            "abstract": "Global warming and ocean acidification caused by the rising levels of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere need to be better constrained by long-term studies of high resolution natural archives, especially at inter-annual and decadal scales. In the framework of the French INSU program LEFE/CYBER ACID-Antilles, here we developed a 200-year long interannual time series of sea surface temperature and pH based on the geochemical composition of tropical reef forming coral. The selected tropical coral called CHANCEL-1 is a colony of genus Siderastrea Siderea which was collected in 2008 from a living micro–atoll off Martinique in the Lesser Antilles, facing the eastern side of the Caribbean Sea. The colony of 1-meter extension presents a mean growth rate of 4 – 5 mm/yr. Along the growth axis, we measured the boron isotopic composition (delta11B) and trace element ratios (Li/Mg, Sr/Ca), which reveal a progressive decrease of the surface water pH and increase of temperature during the past 200 years. These observations cooperate the anthropogenic forcing, i.e. rising atmospheric CO2 and rising sea surface temperatures due to global warming. However, other processes apparently affect the geochemical records, as indicated by sub-decadal variations of pH and temperature reconstruction overprinting the long term global trend. Possible drivers of such most likely regional variability might be decadal changes of oceanographic conditions (upwelling, freshwater runoff, seawater masse changes, etc.) as well as species dependent biological controls.",

The CFZ is part of the Trans-Alborán Shear Zone which constitutes part of the diffuse plate boundary between Africa and Iberia. The CFZ is inferred to behave as a stretching transform fault with∼40 km left-lateral offset. It was active principally between 12 – 6 Ma BP, and has been exhumed from ca. 1 - 2 km depth. The relatively recent movement history and the semi-arid terrain lead to excellent exposure.The phyllosilicate-rich fault gougeis excellently preserved. In 2010 we conducted a controlled source seismic experiment at the CFZ in which explosive sources in boreholes (two groups of 3 explosions) were placed in two strands of the fault zone. The signals were observed with dense linear seismic arrays crossing the CFZ at 3.5km and 8.3km distance, respectively. The recordings show clear high-energy P-phases at receivers and from sources located at or near the fault zone. We interpret these phases as P-waves trapped in the low-velocity layer (waveguide) formed by the damage zone of the fault(s). With waveform modeling (using an analytical solution assuming a straight waveguide embedded in two quarter spaces and a line source at depth) we derive basic models well-explaining the observations. Lab-measurements of the different rocks constrain the possible models. Additionally, we employed extensive three-dimensional finite-difference (3D-FD) modeling with more realistic (curved and anastomosing) waveguide geometries. It seems that the studied segments of the CFZ form effective waveguides for seismic waves with connectivity over several kilometers. The derived seismic models together with lab measurements of the seismic velocities indicate that the average fault zone core widths are in the order of 15 to 25m which is in good agreement with surface geological mapping.",

These instruments were called Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEPs). ALSEPs kept transmitting data to the Earth until September 1977. When the observation program ended in 1977, a large portion of these data were not delivered to the National Space Science Data Center for permanent archive. In 2010, for the purpose of searching, recovering, preserving, and analyzing the data that were not previously archived, NASA’s then Lunar Science Institute formed the ALSEP Data Recovery Focus Group. The group consists of current lunar researchers and those involved in the ALSEP design and data analysis in the 1960s and 1970s. Among the data not previously archived were the 5000+ 7-track open-reel tapes that recorded raw data from all the ALSEP instruments from April 1973 to February 1976 (‘ARCSAV tapes’). These tapes went missing in the decades after Apollo. One of the major achievements of the group so far is that we have found 450 ARCSAV tapes from April to June 1975 and that we are extracting data from them. There are 3 other major achievements by the group. First, we have established a web portal at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, where ~700 ALSEP-related documents, totaling ~40,000 pages, have been digitally scanned and cataloged. Researchers can search and download these documents at www.lpi.usra.edu/ lunar/ALSEP/. Second, we have been retrieving notes and reports left behind by the now deceased/retired ALSEP investigators at their home institutions. Third, we have been re-analyzing the ALSEP data using the information from the recently recovered metadata (instrument calibration data, operation logs, etc.). Efforts are ongoing to get these data permanently archived in the Planetary Data System (PDS).",

            "abstract": "In SW Yukon–SE Alaska, the present-day Pacific–North America relative motion is highly oblique to the main plate boundary, resulting in strong strain-partitioning tectonics that link the Aleutian subduction to the west to Queen Charlotte transform to the south. This transition region is also the site of present-day orogeny and accretion of the Yakutat Terrane to the Northern Cordillera.\nMultiple datasets (GPS, geomorphology, seismicity) are integrated to characterize and quantify strain patterns, with particular emphasis on strain partitioning between strike-slip and shortening deformation. New GPS data straddling the main faults (Denali, Totschunda, Fairweather) indicate that, south of the collision corner, 95% of the Pacific-North America strike-slip motion is accommodated on the plate-boundary Fairweather Fault, leaving near-zero motion on the Denali Fault only ~100 km inboard. In contrast, the fault-perpendicular component is strongly distributed between shortening offshore, in the orogen, and inland outward motion.\nIn the region of highest convergence obliquity, GPS data show a diffuse indentor-like deformation, with strong along-strike variations of the main fault slip rates. Preliminary results of a regional geomorphology study give further information about the Denali Fault, where previous data suggest a velocity decrease from 8 mm/yr (Matmon et al.,2006) to 4 mm/yr (Seitz et al., 2010). A high resolution DEM processed from Pleiades satellite imagery highlights a significant vertical component on the Denali Fault and very little to no strike-slip movement in its southern part. Metric-scale displacements are measured along the “inactive” part of the fault showing recent vertical deformation since the Last Glacial Maximum (~20 kyrs ago). In contrast, significant dextral offsets on post-LGM structures are measured on the southern Totschunda Fault. Ongoing datation of geomorphological markers (Be10, OSL) will give us new slip-rate estimates along the southern part of the main transpressional faults (Denali, Totschunda). Our preliminary results suggest that, both south and north of the collision front, the lithospheric scale Denali Fault does not show any significant strike slip movement and that deformation is mostly accommodated along the Fairweather and Totschunda Faults.",

            "abstract": "The important ecosystem services of the vulnerable high altitude forests of the tropical African highlands are under increasing environmental and human pressure. The afro-alpine treeline forms an apparent and temperature-responsive vegetation boundary and is therefore potentially valuable as a proxy of climate change in the tropics. However, a review of the current literature about treeline dynamics in tropical Africa indicates that climate change did not cause rising treelines, due to high human pressure and growing human population densities. On average the treeline is depressed below its climatic limit by 400 ± 300 meter, but regional differences are high and there are still many uncertainties. A multidisciplinary study of treeline dynamics is conducted in the north Ethiopian highlands. The Erica arborea L. treeline is studied over a century, using satellite imagery, aerial photographs, repeat photography and dendroclimatology. Repeat photography is proven a unique tool for the identification of treeline dynamics on the long-term. Results in the Simen Mts. indicate a treeline rise of more than 100 meters since the early 20th century. In contrast, historical satellite and aerial imagery indicate that there has been strong deforestation since the last 30 years and a significant (p<0.05) but small rise of the treeline elevation of 11 ± 4 vertical meters in Lib Amba Mt. Dendroclimatological results indicate a weak but significant (p<0.05) correlation between tree ring width and interannual precipitation patterns. However, since treelines in the African tropical mountains are strongly disturbed by human and livestock pressure, they cannot directly be used as a proxy for climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Bolivian Altiplano is today one of the driest high altitude desert of the world with rainfall (about 330 mm/yr) mostly concentrated during austral summer. Yet over the last 130,000 years, this region has experienced abrupt rainfall changes at millennial timescale, which were responsible for the successive formation and disappearance of large lakes. To interpret these abrupt past rainfall changes, previous studies have invoked the modern day impacts of Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperature variability as observed over the last 30 years. Our research has explored these hypotheses by investigating the detailed links between the observed variability in both oceans and Andean rainfall changes over the 20th century. The results show that the LMDz Atmosphere General Circulation Model nudged with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice cover is well able to simulate the mean climatology and rare precipitation events of the 20th century over the Andean Altiplano. Furthermore, we are able to attribute specific causes triggering these rainfalls, highlighting the strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean inter-hemispheric thermal contrast. Based on these findings, we designed several idealized experiments to explore the implication of our results for past and future Andean rainfall changes. In particular, we show that the inter-hemispheric sea surface temperature contrast in the Atlantic Ocean during abrupt Heinrich events (North Atlantic cooler than South Atlantic) was the dominant factor that triggered through atmospheric teleconnections increased precipitations over the tropical Andes.",

            "abstract": "Bursts of tremor accompany a moving slip pulse in Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. The sources of this non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are largely unknown. We have developed a model describing the mechanism of NTV generation. According to this model, NTV is a reflection of resonant-type oscillations excited in a fault at certain depth ranges. From a mathematical viewpoint, tremor (phonons) and slip pulses (solitons) are two different solutions of the sine-Gordon equation describing frictional processes inside a fault. In an ETS event, a moving slip pulse generates tremor due to interaction with structural heterogeneities in a fault and to failures of small asperities (see Figure). Observed tremor parameters, such as central frequency and frequency attenuation curve, are associated with fault parameters and conditions, such as elastic modulus, effective normal stress, penetration hardness and friction. Model prediction of NTV frequency content is consistent with observations. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the complicated pattern of tremor migration, including rapid tremor propagation and reverse tremor migration. Migration along the strike direction is associated with movement of the slip pulse. Rapid tremor propagation in the slip‐parallel direction is associated with movement of kinks along a 2D slip pulse. A slip pulse, pinned in some places, can fragment into several pulses, causing tremor associated with some of these pulse fragments to move opposite to the main propagation direction. The model predicts that the frequency content of tremor during an ETS event is slightly different from the frequency content of ambient tremor and tremor triggered by earthquakes.\nFigure 1. The slip velocity w of a slip pulse in time-space (x-t) coordinates moving in (a) ideal substrate and (b) substrate with a structural heterogeneity. Pulse is driven by constant external shear stress. Figure 1(b) shows that the pulse oscillates about an obstacle, emitting tremor",

The effect on climate depends on the rate of gas injection above the tropopause. The key parameter is the height reached by the eruptive plume as a function of mass flux and entrainment rate. We propose a model of entrainment in 2D volcanic plumes based on lab scale experiments on turbulent jets and plumes. In this model, entrainment varies with the Richardson number and we predict that the height of the column critically depends on the source buoyancy flux determined by the eruptive temperature and the amount of gas in the volcanic mixture at the vent. We obtain that “hot” basaltic planar plumes form stable eruptive columns, even for large eruption rates. Only if fragmentation is not efficient enough, the column collapse will prevent the injection of gas in the stratosphere.",

The aim of this study was to determine the main driving forces of the spatial variability in CH4 flux in a high arctic fen situated in Zackenberg, NE Greenland. The study was conducted over three years (2011-2013) and included 16-20 control plots and in 2013 also 29 “treated” plots, e.g., excluded muskoxen grazing (10), snow fence (9) and automated chamber (10). The plots were distributed over a 0.25 km2 area. From 1 July to 10 August we measured (all variables only in 2013) fluxes of CH4 and CO2 (NEE, Reco and GPP), temperature, water table and active layer depth, PAR, substrate conc. for CH4 production in pore-water (i.e. acetate, AA) and the species composition and density of sedges. We found significant treatment effects, a 1.8-times difference in CH4 flux between the years and a high spatial variability, e.g., 9- and 35-times difference between max and min plots depending on year and treatment. GPP was consistently a strong driver of the variability in CH4 flux. In 2013 several plant productivity related variables were singled out as the strongest drivers of the variability in CH4 flux, e.g., (in order of strength) NEE, GPP and AA. The driver of NEE, GPP and AA was the density of Eriophorum scheuchzeri. The drivers were the same and followed the same patterns irrespective of treatment. In conclusion, the results show a strong dependence of the spatial variability in CH4 flux on productivity and carbon input to vegetation and pore-water. The main driver of this input is the vegetation composition and density. The results indicate that future environmental changes in wet arctic ecosystems that affect the vegetation composition and productivity will have large impacts on their carbon balance and CH4 flux, irrespective of whether these changes are driven directly by climate change or by indirect effects on for instance grazing pressure.",

            "abstract": "Denitrification is a microbial process removing dissolved inorganic nitrogen in ecosystems. Most in-stream denitrification studies focused on reach-scale denitrification in small streams and overlooked the variation of denitrification within channel. Despite of increases in channel size and geomorphic complexity in large rivers, denitrification pattern in large rivers in generally assumed similar to that in small streams. In this study, we surveyed the Cahaba River and found various denitrification rates in different locations within a large river channel. We hypothesize that the variation in denitrification rates is correlated to the distributions of benthic sediment size and organic matter content within the large river channel. Following the survey, to assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of denitrification based on what we found in large river, we mapped the channel morphology, estimated sediment spatial distribution, and developed an agent-based model that simulates nitrogen movement in the water and removal via dentrification related to sediment size and organic matter contents. This study advances our knowledge of denitrification in large rivers, and provides guidance for further field experiments on denitrification in large rivers.",

            "abstract": "Economic values of the ecosystem services of coastal ecosystems have been evaluated as among the highest of those the world’s ecosystems. Recently more attentions have been paid on the mechanisms how the freshwater contribute to the high productivity and species diversity of the coastal ecosystems. In the present study, results from physical and biological surveys conducted at four locations (Yuza, Otsuchi, Obama and Beppu) in Japan in order to examine effects of river water and submarine groundwater on productivity and species diversity of fishery resources are introduced. Fish sampling was conducted by the use of small seine net (2 x 1 mm, 2 mm mesh). Invertebrates (crustaceans and polychaetes, as prey for the fishes) were collected with a plankton net (0.3 x 0.4 m, 1 mm mesh) and a core sampler (10 x 10 cm circular cylinder). In addition, underwater camera recording was conducted by four digital cameras (1 min interval, for 3 hours) to analyze abundance and species composition of fishes around each sampling site. Relationships between physical parameters (water temperature, salinity and Rn concentration) and biological parameters (abundance, biomass and species diversity of fish, crustaceans and polychaetes) were investigated. Significant increase in abundance and number of species of fishes and some invertebrate species were observed in three of the four locations, indication submarine groundwater promote biological production and species diversity in coastal ecosystems. The mechanisms how the freshwater input from the land contributes to the high productivity and species diversity in the coastal ecosystems will be examined through wood web analysis (e.g. stomach contents and stable isotopes) in the ongoing study. Possible effects of climatic changes (including the global warming) through spatio-temporal variability in submarine groundwater discharge on the productivity and species diversity in coastal ecosystems are predicted based on the species interactions and optimum temperature for each species.",

            "abstract": "Two-phase flow in porous media is important in many natural and industrial processes like geologic CO2 sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and water infiltration in soil. While it is well known that the wetting properties of porous media can vary drastically depending on the type of media and the pore fluids, the effect of wettability on fluid displacement continues to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. Here we study this problem experimentally, starting with the classic experiment of two-phase flow in a capillary tube. We image the shape of the meniscus and measure the associated capillary pressure for a wide range of capillary numbers. We confirm that wettability exerts a fundamental control on meniscus deformation, and synthesize new observations on the dependence of the dynamic capillary pressure on wetting properties (contact angle) and flow conditions (viscosity contrast and capillary number). We compare our experiments to a macroscopic phase-field model of two-phase flow. We use the insights gained from the capillary tube experiments to explore the viscous fingering instability in the Hele-Shaw geometry in the partial-wetting regime.\nA key difference between a Hele-Shaw cell and a porous medium is the existence of micro-structures (i.e. pores and pore throats). To investigate how these micro-structrues impact fluid-fluid displacement, we conduct experiments on a planar microfluidic device patterned with vertical posts. We track the evolution of the fluid-fluid interface and elucidate the impact of wetting on the cooperative nature of fluid displacement during pore invasion events. We use the insights gained from the capillary tube and patterned microfluidics experiments to elucidate the effect of wetting properties on viscous fingering and capillary fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with glass beads, where we observe a contact-angle-dependent stabilizing behavior for the emerging flow instabilities, as the system transitions from drainage to imbibition.",

The resource is then characterized using robust metrics on abundance, variability, and intermittency of wind power density at separate heights. The analyses suggest high resource in western regions of Saudi Arabia, especially at the Red Sea and the mountainous regions away from the coastline. Southern coast of Oman and the Gulf of Aden also demonstrate high median wind power density. These corresponding high wind regions also exhibit high availability over the period of record length (1979-2013) as characterized by power density above 200W/m2, as well as similar behavior in episode length, which measures the persistence of the resource. These identified high wind regions differ in resource variability in terms of the coefficient of variation. The western mountainous regions of Saudi Arabia and the coastline of Oman show moderate variability compared to the Red Sea, where it sees two different regimes of variability, low in the north and high in the south. The Gulf of Aden demonstrates surprisingly low variability. Further statistical measures of variability, abundance, and intermittency will be elaborated. We will also discuss the geographical and meteorological factors controlling the wind resource in the region.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of the formation of layering surrounding meddy-like vortex lenses is investigated from a tracer stirring point of view using a tracer advection model as well as Primitive Equation (PE) and Quasi Geostrophic (QG) models. Recent in situ data inside a meddy as well as high resolution PE simulations reveal the formation of highly density-compensated layers in temperature and salinity at the periphery of the vortex core. Passive tracer experiments suggest that the vertical variance cascade is triggered by the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity field resulting in the generation of thin layers. The time evolution of this process down to scales of O(10m) is quantified and a simple scaling is proposed and shown to describe precisely the thinning down of the layers as a function of the initial azimuthal tracer gradients and the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity. Non-linear QG simulations were performed and analysed and a step-by-step interpretation of these results on the evolution of layering is proposed in the context of tracer stirring.",

However, combining various sensors allows for synergies between different datasets and alleviation of shortcomings related to sensor-specific compromise between spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate how these concepts have been implemented in SatAgro, an online precision agriculture platform for individual farmers. In this project, we combine MODIS and Landsat data to allow user-friendly daily access to information about plant phenology, coupled with Landsat-based insight into spatial detail at the land parcel level. We developed an approach to combine MODIS Terra and Aqua data which utilizes quality information contained in MODIS product with pixel-based NDVI to select the more reliable retrieval. Phenology-related statistics are estimated not only based on time series of vegetation indices, but also ancillary meteorological data. Landsat data is processed using LandCor atmospheric correction framework, which considers within-scene atmosphere variability, surface anisotropy, and varying acquisition geometry. The effect of particular improvements in data pre-processing is demonstrated through estimates in spatio-temporal consistency of phenological evolution across space and time and between the two sensors. Lastly, we discuss the potential to integrate further sensors in the platform, in particular from Sentinel satellites.",

            "abstract": "It has been well known that free-air anomalies and gravitational effects of the topographic masses are mutually proportional, at least in general. However, it is rather intriguing that this feature is more remarkable in elevated mountainous areas than in lowlands or flat regions, as we demonstrate on practical examples. Further, since the times of Pierre Bouguer we know that gravitational effect of the topographic masses is station-height-dependent. In our presentation we show that the respective contributions to this height dependence, although they are nonzero, are less significant in the cases of both the nearest masses and the more remote ones while the contribution of the masses within hundreds and thousands of meters from the gravity station is dominant. We also illustrate that, surprisingly, gravitational effects of the non-near topographic masses can be apparently independent on their respective volumes, while their gravitational effects are still well proportional to the gravity station heights.\nOn the other hand, based on interpretational reasons, Bouguer anomaly should not correlate very much with the heights of the measuring points or, more specifically, with the gravitational effect of the topographic masses. Standard practice is to estimate a suitable (uniform) reduction or correction density within the study area in order to minimize such an undesired correlation and, vice versa, the minimum correlation is often utilized as a criteria for estimating such density.\nOur main objective is to point out, from the aspect of the correction density estimations, that the contributions of the topographic masses should be viewed alternatively, depending on the particular distances of the respective portions of those masses from the gravity station. We have tested majority of the existing methods of such density estimation and developed a new one which takes the facts mentioned above into consideration.\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contracts APVV-0827-12 and APVV-0194-10.",

            "abstract": "With the development of accurate purely numerical forward modeling techniques such as the Spectral Element Method (SEM; Komatitsch and Tromp, 2002a,b) it is now possible to simulate seismic wave propagation in realistic 3-D Earth models at the global scale. While up to recently the routine use of the SEM in moderate computer clusters was mostly limited to the modeling of long-period waveforms (f ~ 50 mHz), the advancement of High Performance Computing resources now allows the easy calculation of synthetic seismograms accurate up to f ~ 200 mHz. The availability of these high frequency and high accuracy waveforms pushed us to look closer at mantle body-wave phases. In particular, we are interested in studying the effects of 3-D structure on deep seismic phases such as S, Sdiff, ScS, SKS and SKKS. These phases are either transmitted, reflected or refracted in the lowermost mantle and have been extensively used to retrieve information about the D’’ layer. Despite recent studies advancing our knowledge of D’’, previous results regarding its thickness, heterogeneity and anisotropy are still not univocal. To explore the reasons of these discrepancies, we first perform a systematic analysis of the effects of the elastic, anelastic and anisotropic structure on the waveforms and secondly we compare synthetic seismograms calculated for the most recent tomographic models with real data. Our preliminary results show that the interference with other phases as well as the misinterpretation of the shape of the waveforms can lead to different models for the D’’ when these phases are used to constrain deep Earth structure. Our ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the potentialities and limitations of these deep seismic phases for the study of the Earth’s deep interior.",

The horizontal (30 km) and temporal (2 days) resolutions of the float array were set in order to capture relationship between biogeochemical phenomena and physical processes such as westward propagating eddies and atmospheric disturbances. The observations of large mass flux at 200 m, a high chlorophyll-a concentration in the deep chlorophyll maximum layer, large Fv/Fm ration and high dissolved oxygen concentration in the shallow oxygen maximum layer will be summarized and interpreted as biogeochemical responses to physical processes in and around mesoscale eddies including submesoscale motions, diapycnal mixing and surface wind forcing.",

            "abstract": "In southeastern Australia wildfire occurs regularly, resulting in increased hillslope erosion. However, post-wildfire erosion processes differ depending on hillslope aspect. Equatorial (north)-facing slopes are drier than polar (south)-facing slopes and experience overland flow erosion after wildfire. By contrast, overland flow is not an active process on polar-facing slopes, even after high-intensity wildfires. These differences in post-wildfire erosion processes are accompanied by observations that slope angle and curvature also differ by hillslope aspect. An airborne LiDAR dataset flown over our study area in the Kinglake National Park, Victoria shows that the mean slope angle of polar-facing slopes is nearly 5 degrees steeper than equatorial-facing slopes. We have sought to test the hypothesis that aspect differences in post-wildfire erosion processes are sufficient to create differences in hillslope geometry.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we use a simple 1D model that simulates hillslope evolution over thousands of years. We limit our model to low-drainage area hillslopes where debris-flows are unlikely to occur. Erosion is modeled as nonlinear diffusion regardless of aspect during non-wildfire model years. Wildfire is modeled by changing the erosional processes on each slope aspect to reflect the effects of post-wildfire erosion according to a wildfire recurrence interval. For two years following a model wildfire we allow overland flow erosion to erode equatorial-facing slopes, whereas polar-facing slopes erode according to nonlinear diffusion for only one year following a wildfire. The erosion parameters on the polar-facing slopes are changed during this period to reflect higher post-wildfire erosion. In addition to erosional processes, we use an exponential soil production law to simulate new soil formation every model year.\nOur preliminary results suggest that changes in erosional magnitude associated with the different wildfire erosional processes are sufficient to produce the observed differences in hillslope geometry over millennial timescales. This early result suggests that interactions between wildfire and local moisture regimes (i.e. aspect) may be a major driver of long-term hillslope evolution in tectonically quiescent, non-glaciated terrain.",

An impressive number of fluid inclusion studies indicate three main populations of fluid inclusions in HP and UHP metamorphic rocks: i) aqueous and/or non-polar gaseous fluid inclusions (FI), ii) multiphase solid inclusions (MSI), and iii) melt inclusions (MI). Chemical data from preserved fluid inclusions in rocks match with and implement “model” fluids by experiments and thermodynamics, revealing a continuity behind the extreme variations of physico-chemical properties of subduction-zone fluids. From fore-arc to sub-arc depths, fluids released by progressive devolatilization reactions from slab lithologies change from relatively diluted chloride-bearing aqueous solutions (± N2), mainly influenced by halide ligands, to (alkali) aluminosilicate-rich aqueous fluids, in which polymerization probably governs the solubility and transport of major (e.g., Si and Al) and trace elements (including C). Fluid inclusion data implement the petrological models explaining deep volatile liberation in subduction zones, and their flux into the mantle wedge.",

We compare water levels and volume strains for these earthquakes. A comprehensive analysis for the mechanism of far-field coseismic water-level changes is performed by analyzing the in-situ permeability, Skempton’s coefficient B, and together with the broadband seismograms from a nearby station. We find that an undrained consolidation with a decreasing permeability induced by the shaking of teleseismic waves is observed in the far field. By the in-situ observation for different earthquakes, shaking of teleseismic waves can induce consolidation or dilatation in the aquifer of Fuxin well, both of them being able to enhance permeability and thus to build a new pore-pressure equilibrium system between the Fuxin well and the nearby Sihe reservoir (150 m away from the Fuxin well). The resulting interstitial fluid flow across the region increases coseismic water levels in the aquifer of Fuxin well.",

            "abstract": "Coupling with the hydrodynamic and depositional processes, the dispersal and fate of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) was studied based on elemental, isotopic and molecular biomarker (n-alkanes, perylene) parameters in surface sediments. The distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) coincides with that of the sediment grain size, suggesting the hydrodynamic constraints on the accumulation of SOM. There existed a significant presence of terrigenous-derived n-alkanes in the central YS mud deposits inferring from these molecular parameters and PCA identification, suggesting the dominant role of the hydrodynamic forcing on the selective dispersal and preferential accumulation of the fluvial terrigenous OM in the YS. The central mud deposits of the YS are the sinks of the long-distance transported Yellow River-derived sediments and its associated terrigenous OM; For the coastal ECS, the presence of bacteria/algae-derived organic matter (OM) and agriculture soil-derived OM could be responsible for the lower C/N and elevated δ13C values. There could be an effectively preferential dispersal of land-based SOM, while with potential subsequent degradation induced by the local addition of marine-derived OM. The significant relationships between perylene and the terrigenous organic matter (OM) proxies could suggest a combination of the predepositional fluvial input of perylene and in situ formation from its precursors with land-derived OM origins for its appearance in the coastal ECS. The deposition flux of perylene could be likely served as a geochemical imprint to assess the river input influence on the sedimentary environment of the coastal ECS.",

            "abstract": "We report on the identification and geological study of a nearly 300-km-long valley system located westward of Idaeus Fossae, in Tempe Terra, Mars. The valley apparently originates from a subsided area surrounding the ejecta of a relatively fresh crater and after about 25 km from its source area enters a series of dam-breach paleolakes. The lake chain consists of six open basins (with associated fan-shaped sedimentary deposits) and covers an area of about 2500 sq. km over a E-W stretch of about 100 km. The latter lakes are interconnected and were likely coeval and drain eastward into a main 20-km-diameter crater-lake forming a complex and multilobate deltaic deposit whose front lies at about 1800-1820 m below the martian datum. The deltaic deposit is about 8-km-long and morphologically resembles the Jezero delta, showing a well-developed distributary pattern with evidence of channel switching on the delta plain. The floor of the crater-lake is not incised by the main valley, however a breach area is present along the eastern crater rim and consists of two spillover channels at about the same elevation of the crater inlet (-1820 m). These latter channels connect the crater lake to the eastward portion of the valley continuing towards Idaeus Fossae with a more than 180-km-long complex pattern of anabranching channels . We used high-resolution imagery and topography (HRSC, and CTX and HiRISE stereo pairs) to derive a geological-geomorphological map of the area and to understand its evolution. The extension and morphology of the observed fluvio-lacustrine features suggest relatively long-term (>103 yrs) formation timescales as also supported by the presence of the main fan delta in the central open basin. The overall water source for the 300-km-long fluvial system is unclear, though the occurrence of many rampart craters and the relationships between their ejecta and the channels suggest that subsurface volatiles might have also played an important role.",

            "abstract": "Temporal and compositional patterns of Neogene ignimbrites in the Central Andes were analysed using GIS and geostatistical modelling based on 203 digitized ignimbrite sheets for which geochronological, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb-isotopic data on pumices as well as Sr-O isotopes on minerals from selected samples were compiled and compared to compositional and isotopic data from andesite lavas. Composition, timing, volumes and sources of erupted ignimbrite deposits are thus constrained and magma volumes through space and time are calculated. The total erupted ignimbrite magma volume of 31,000 km3 (minimum value) in the past 30 Ma indicate an average magmatic addition of 20-30 km3*Ma/km, similar to the basaltic “base”-flux for arc magmatism. Ignimbrite flare-ups are, however, rather punctuated, short-lived events well separated in space and time. There is a clear N-S “younging” of ignimbrite pulses from N to S at 19-24 Ma, 13-14 Ma, 6-10 Ma and 3-6 Ma. Ignimbrite eruptions occurred in the wake of subduction of the Juan-Fernandez ridge on the Nazca Plate passing below the Central Andes from N to S. Low angle subduction caused compression and fluid release is followed by massive inflow and melting of asthenospheric mantle when the slab steepened again after the passing of the ridge. This in turn caused massive melting within the crust aided by advective heat transport. Differences in chemical and isotopic composition of the large-volume ignimbrites are related to changes in crustal thickness, and different “preconditioning” during the Andean orogeny at a given space in time. Isotope data and whole rock compositional data suggest a higher degree of crustal assimilation for the younger Altiplano ignimbrites in the S (c. 50%) compared to the older (22-19 Ma) ignimbrites in the N were the crustal component is significantly less (20%). REE compositions reflect changes in crustal thickness with a \"transition\" at c. 13-9 Ma that can be related to accelerated crustal shortening and lower crustal heating at that time. There is no “single” ignimbrite flare up, we suggest a more dynamic scenario, with “flares” moving from N to S across the Central Andes during the past 25 Ma. Our database yield volumes of mantle and crustal magmas produced through time and space and should aid to constrain numerical models of Andean geodynamic processes.",

Disaster risk and crisis management requires long-term planning, and to undertake that planning, a science-driven approach is needed to understand and assess disaster risks and to help in impact assessment and in recovery processes after a disaster. Science is used in assessments and rapid modeling of the disaster impact, in forecasting triggered hazards and risk (e.g., a tsunami or a landslide after a large earthquake), in contacts with and medical treatment of the affected population, and in some other actions. At the stage of response to disaster, science helps to analyze routinely the disaster happened (e.g., the physical processes led to this extreme event; hidden vulnerabilities; etc.) At the stage of recovery, natural scientists improve the existing regional hazard assessments; engineers try to use new science to produce new materials and technologies to make safer houses and infrastructure. At the stage of disaster risk mitigation new scientific methods and approaches are being developed to study natural extreme events; vulnerability of society is periodically investigated, and the measures for increasing the resilience of society to extremes are developed; existing disaster management regulations are improved. At the stage of preparedness, integrated research on disaster risks should be developed to understand the roots of potential disasters. Enhanced forecasting and early warning systems are to be developed reducing predictive uncertainties, and comprehensive disaster risk assessment is to be undertaken at local, regional, national and global levels. Science education should be improved by introducing trans-disciplinary approach to disaster risks. Science can help society by improving awareness about extreme events, enhancing risk communication with policy makers, media and society, and assisting disaster risk management authorities in organization of local and regional training and exercises.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this work is to better understand the influence of subduction beneath Calabria on seismic hazard, as very little is known about present-day kinematics and the seismogenic potential of the slab interface in the Calabrian Arc region. This evaluation is significant because, depending on stress conditions, subduction zones can vary from being fully coupled to almost entirely decoupled with important consequences in the seismic hazard assessment.\nAlthough the debate is still open about the current kinematics of the plates and microplates lying in the region and the degree of coupling of Ionian lithosphere beneath Calabria, GPS data suggest that this subduction is locked in its interface sector. Also the lack of instrumentally recorded thrust earthquakes suggests this zone is locked.\nThe current seismotectonic model developed for the Italian National territory is simplified in this area and does not reflect the possibility of locked subduction beneath the Calabria that could produce infrequent, but very large earthquakes associated with the subduction interface. Because of this we have conducted an independent seismic source analysis to take into account the influence of subduction as part of a regional seismic hazard analysis. Our final model includes two separate provinces for the subduction beneath the Calabria: inslab and interface. From a geometrical point of view the interface province is modeled with a depth between 20-50 km and a dip of 20°, while the inslab one dips 70° between 50 -100 km. Following recent interpretations we take into account that the interface subduction is possibly locked and, in such a case, large events could occur as characteristic earthquakes.\nThe results of the PSHA analysis show that the subduction beneath the Calabrian region has an influence in the total hazard for this region, especially for long return periods. Regional seismotectonic models for this region should account for subduction.",

            "abstract": "Mantle flow patterns around subduction zones and the consequent seismic anisotropy have been the subject of many studies across different disciplines. However, even though upper mantle anisotropy is not controversial, our primary means of imaging subduction zones in the upper mantle –teleseismic tomography– commonly assumes that the mantle is isotropic. We investigate the possible effects of unaccounted-for anisotropy in seismic imaging of the upper mantle in a subduction setting by carrying out a synthetic test in three steps: (1) We build an anisotropic velocity model of a subduction zone. The model was built from self-consistent estimates of mantle velocity structure and strain-induced anisotropy that are derived from thermo-mechanical and microstructural modeling. (2) We generate P-wave travel-time delay data for this model using an event distribution that is representative of what is typically recorded by a temporary seismic array. The anisotropic travel times are calculated through the prescribed model using a graph-theory ray tracer. (3) We invert the anisotropic synthetic delays under the assumption of isotropy, as is common practice. The tomographic inversion of the synthetic data recovers the input velocity structure fairly well, but delays caused solely by anisotropy result in very significant additional isotropic velocity anomalies that are artificial. Some of these artifacts are nonetheless attractive targets for (mis)interpretation. For example, one of the most notable artifacts is a low velocity zone in the mantle wedge. Our initial results suggest that significant artifacts may be common in isotropic velocity models of subduction zones and stress the need for mantle imaging that properly handles anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "The response of plant performance and nitrogen (N) dynamics to biochar amendments were studied across various levels of N input for two growing seasons in mesocosms representing an organic lettuce production systems. A silt loam soil was amended with pine chip (PC) and walnut shell (WS) biochar (10 t ha-1) in combination with five organic N fertilization rates 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of 225 kg N ha-1. N output through harvest, leachate, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were determined to assess N utilization and environmental losses of biochar-amended soils. Analysis of plant performance indicate that PC and WS biochar did not provide any increases in plant biomass in soils that received less than business-as-usual fertilization rates. At 100% N fertilization rate, biochar amendments (both PC and WS) improved lettuce biomass production, which resulted in significant increases in NUE with no effects on N2O emissions. Furthermore, N losses via leaching were decreased by PC biochar at 100% N fertilization rates. Thus, due to increases in plant biomass and decreases in N losses via leachate, PC biochar significantly decreased the ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass. Findings from this study suggest that biochar can provide some beneficial effects to organic farming systems, however, not in all circumstances, given the effects seem to vary with biochar type and fertilization level.",

            "abstract": "Unlike the majority of the East African Rift, the Mozambique region has not been deeply studied, not only due to political instabilities but also because of the difficult access to its most interior regions. An earthquake with M7 occurred in Machaze in 2006, which triggered the investigation of this particular region. The MOZART project (funded by FCT, Lisbon) installed a temporary seismic network, with a total of 30 broadband stations from the SEIS-UK pool, from April 2011 to July 2013.\nPreliminary locations of the seismicity were estimated with the data recorded from April 2011 to July 2012. A total of 307 earthquakes were located, with ML magnitudes ranging from 0.9 to 3.9. We observe a linear northeast-southwest distribution of the seismicity that seems associated to the Inhaminga fault. The seismicity has an extension of ~300km reaching the Machaze earthquake area. The northeast sector of the seismicity shows a good correlation with the topography, tracing the Urema rift valley.\nIn order to obtain an initial velocity model of the region, the ambient noise method is used. This method is applied to the entire data set available and two additional stations of the AfricaARRAY project. Ambient noise surface wave tomography is possible by computing cross-correlations between all pairs of stations and measuring the group velocities for all interstation paths. With this approach we obtain Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves in the period range from 3 to 50 seconds. Group velocity maps are calculated for several periods and allowing a geological and tectonic interpretation.\nIn order to extend the investigation to longer wave periods and thus probe both the crust and upper mantle, we apply a recent implementation of the surface-wave two-station method (teleseismic interferometry – Meier el al 2004) to augment our dataset with Rayleigh wave phase velocities curves in a broad period range. Using this method we expect to be able to explore the lithosphere-asthenosphere depth range beneath Mozambique.",

            "abstract": "Where deformation is accommodated by complex arrays of interacting faults, individual fault strands often show fluctuating levels of activity through time with intervals of high, or low, slip rate corresponding to earthquake clusters or quiescence, respectively. Thus earthquakes may occur on structures other than those defined as active based on historical events and paleoseismic records, confounding attempts to map seismic hazard with such datasets. A major challenge is to identify which faults are ahead of their long-term slip rate, which faults are behind their long term rate but still active, and which faults are no longer active. We show that cosmogenic 36Cl depth profiles measured systematically along the fault plane in trenches excavated below the base of bedrock scarps as well as along the exhumed scarp formed by extensional fault slip can be used to estimate both the average Holocene slip rate and the elapsed time since the last earthquake. Specifically, the increase in 36Cl concentration with height immediately above and below the ground surface at the scarp base reveals whether the elapsed time is anomalously long (or short) compared to the expected mean earthquake recurrence. For an area of active extension in Italy, we demonstrate that independent constraints on Holocene slip rates and elapsed times of historical earthquakes show a close correspondence with estimates derived from the 36Cl profiles. However, some faults slipped at rates higher than their Holocene-averaged rate from ~5 ka to the Middle Ages, indicating greater strain accumulation on the SW flank of the central Apennines in a zone that is now quiescent. The historical catalogue shows that, since the earthquake of 1349 A.D., activity has been concentrated in a 50km wide zone of faults further to the NE. In contrast, when viewed over the whole Holocene, strain is symmetrically distributed across the whole array. When taken together, along with documented earthquake shaking since Roman times, these data suggest that the locus of strain accumulation has migrated from one crustal scale fault system to another over a distance of several 10’s of km over a time scale of several thousand years and that deformation in this area is more variable in both space and time than the geodetically-determined interseismic strain accumulation would predict.",

Under the hypothesis that surface compositional information can be efficiently derived from such spectral measurements with the use of statistical techniques, we have conducted unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses to identify and characterize spectral units from MASCS observations. The results display a large-scale dichotomy, with two spectrally distinct units: polar and equatorial, possibly linked to differences in surface environment or composition. The spatial extent of the polar unit in the northern hemisphere correlates approximately with that of the northern volcanic plains. To explore possible relations between composition and spectral behavior, we have compared the spectral units with elemental abundance maps derived from MESSENGER’s X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS). It is important to note that the mapping coverage for XRS differs from that of MASCS, particularly for the heavy elements. Nonetheless, by comparing the visible and near-infrared MASCS and XRS datasets and investigating the links between them, we seek further clues to the formation and evolution of Mercury’s crust. Moreover, the methodology will permit automation of the production of new maps of the spectral and chemical signature of the surface.",

Magnetostatic interactions are calculated in real space, allowing simulations to be performed for particle ensembles with arbitrary geometry. For weakly interacting uniaxial particles, the equilibrium magnetization at each field step is obtained by direct solution of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, assuming a quasi-static distribution of interaction fields. For all other cases, the equilibrium magnetization is calculated using an approximate iterated solution to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Multithreading is employed to allow multiple curves to be computed simultaneously, enabling FORC diagrams to be simulated in reasonable time using a standard desktop computer. Statistical averaging and post processing lead to simulated FORC diagrams that are comparable to their experimental counterparts. The method is applied to several geometries of relevance to rock and environmental magnetism, including densely packed random clusters and partially collapsed chains. The method forms the basis of FORCulator, a freely available software tool with graphical user interface that will enable FORC simulations to become a routine part of rock magnetic studies.",

Some of the mechanisms of biofouling and bioweathering are today identified and partially understood but most emphasis is on chemical weathering, while mechanical contributions have been neglected. However, as demonstrated by the perseverance of a seed germinating and cracking up a concrete block, the turgor pressure of living organisms can be very significant. Here, we present results of a systematic study of the effects of the mechanical forces of growing microbial populations on the weathering of porous media.\nWe designed a model porous medium made of glass beads held together by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a curable polymer. The rheological properties of the porous medium, whose shape and size are tunable, can be controlled by the ratio of crosslinker to base used in the PDMS (see Fig. 1). Glass and PDMS being inert to most chemicals, we are able to focus on the mechanical processes of biodeterioration, excluding any chemical weathering.\nInspired by recent measurements of the high pressure (~0.5 Mpa) exerted by a growing population of yeasts trapped in a microfluidic device, we show that yeast cells can be cultured homogeneously within porous medium until saturation of the porous space. We investigate then the effects of such an inner pressure on the mechanical properties of the sample.\nUsing the same model system, we study also the complex interplay between biofilms and porous media. We focus in particular on the effects of pore size on the penetration of the biofilm within the porous sample, and on the resulting deformations of the matrix, opening new perspectives into the understanding of life in complex geometry.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "The physical disturbance of the marine sedimentary environments by commercial bottom trawling is a matter of concern. The direct physical effects of this fishing technique include scraping and ploughing of the seabed and increases of the near-bottom water turbidity by sediment resuspension. However, the quantification of the sediment that has been resuspended by this anthropogenic activity over years and has been ultimately exported across the margin remains largely unaddressed. The analysis of sediment accumulation rates from sediment cores collected along the axes of several submarine canyons in the Catalan margin (northwestern Mediterranean) has allowed to estimate the contribution of this anthropogenic activity to the present-day sediment dynamics. 210Pb chronologies, occasionally supported by 137Cs dating, indicate a rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates since the 1970s, in coincidence with a strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Such increase has been associated to the enhanced delivery of sediment resuspended by trawlers from the shelves and upper slope regions towards the canyon’s interior, and to the rapid technical development at that time, in terms of engine power and gear size. This change has been observed in La Fonera (or Palamós) Canyon at depths greater than 1700 m, while in other canyons it is restricted to shallower regions (~1000 m in depth) closer to fishing grounds. Two sampling sites from La Fonera and Foix submarine canyons that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0.6-0.7 cm/y) were reoccupied several years after the first chronological analyses. These two new cores reveal a second and more rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates in both canyons occurring circa 2002 and accounting for about 2 cm/y. This second change at the beginning of the XXI century has been attributed to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards slope fishing grounds surrounding submarine canyons, and also to technical improvements in trawling vessels, presumably related to subsidies and aids provided by the European Commission to the fishing industry.",

            "abstract": "Microwave emissions during solar flares have a great sensitivity to magnetic field and can be used to diagnose magnetic field in the flaring regions. Ideally this diagnostic capability had better be applied to spatially resolved microwave spectra so that information of local magnetic field can be obtained. On the other hand it is also worthwhile to develop a diagnostic tool for spatially integrated microwave flux spectra, as are most commonly available to date. Our target is strong microwave bursts exhibiting significant fluxes at low (<5 GHz) frequencies which do not drop with decreasing frequency as much as a single uniform source would produce. We investigate the coronal magnetic structure of such microwave sources through a spectral modeling in which the volume and thickness of the microwave source are expressed as functions of magnetic field strength and the functions are adjusted to reproduce the spatially integrated spectra. It is found that the corona around the fan field lines in a separatrix dome structure is the most likely place to have the required spatial distribution of magnetic field strength and also to allow high energy electrons access. This spectral modeling uses, as constraints, hard X-ray spectra from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and microwave spectra from the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) and the Korean Solar Radio Burst Locator (KSRBL).",

            "abstract": "Direct observations of coseismic fault displacement and rupture-related features are essential to understand seismic cycles, to quantify seismic hazard, and to constrain rupture dynamics. They are also needed to trace the paleoseismic history of active faults. Such observations in submarine environments are practically absent, but critical to assess associated tsunami hazard. The ODEMAR cruise studied a ~10 km section of the Roseau Fault (RF) off Les Saintes Islands (Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles), a normal fault that generated a Mw 6.3 earthquake in 2004 that triggered a tsunami (<3.5 m of run-up). Microbathymetric data and video observations conducted with the autonomous underwater vehicle ABYSS (GEOMAR) and the remotely operated vehicle VICTOR (IFREMER) allow us to document recent fault-related deformation features.\nFirst, the RF hangingwall shows an indurated and ubiquitous rippled sediment layer, locally covered by recent, unconsolidated sediments reworked by currents. Seafloor photomosaics show the indurated layer disrupted by extensional cracks (up to few m long, several 10s of cm wide, ~30 cm deep) along >1 km and by the RF scarp base, that are certainly very young as they are not covered by unconsolidated sediments.\nSecond, video imagery reveals well-preserved, subvertical and polished fault planes exposed at the RF scarp base. Videomosacing and video derived 3D terrain models of a fault outcrop (~12 m long, ~5 m high) reveal on the fault plane a thin, continuous line of unconsolidated sediment sub-parallel to and 10s' of cm above the fault/sediment contact. The line represents the paleo-fault/sediment contact prior to a very recent displacement event, as strong currents in the area would otherwise have washed out the sediment. The fault surface above this line is rougher than that below it.\nBased on the apparent young age of these features, and given the recurrence time of seismic events along the RF (hundreds to a few thousands of years for Mw 6 earthquakes), we attribute them to the 2004 Saintes event. High-resolution bathymetry, videomosaicing, and 3D terrain models thus provide critical constraints on coseismic deformation: We document the rupture of >1.5 km of the RF, and we quantify a coseismic vertical displacement of at least 0.8 m, constraining model-derived estimates of fault displacement.",

Understanding these effects on vegetation and biogenic emissions is important as Texas concurrently faces requirements to achieve and maintain attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in several large metropolitan areas.

The contemporary sea ice changes are especially visible in the Eastern Hemisphere All these factors affect the change extreme events.\nDaily and sub-daily data of 940 stations to analyze variations in the space time distribution of extreme temperatures, precipitation, and wind over Russia were used. Changing in number of days with thaw over Russia was described. The total seasonal numbers of days, when daily surface air temperatures (wind, precipitation) were found to be above (below) selected thresholds, were used as indices of climate extremes. Changing in difference between maximum and minimum temperature (DTR) may produce a variety of effects on biological systems. All values falling within the intervals ranged from the lowest percentile to the 5th percentile and from the 95th percentile to the highest percentile for the time period of interest were considered as daily extremes. The number of days, N, when daily temperatures (wind, precipitation, DTR) were within the above mentioned intervals, was determined for the seasons of each year. Linear trends in the number of days were calculated for each station and for quasi-homogeneous climatic regions. Regional analysis of extreme events was carried out using quasi-homogeneous climatic regions. Maps (climatology, trends) are presented mostly for visualization purposes.\nDifferences in regional characteristics of extreme events are accounted for over a large extent of the Russian territory and variety of its physical and geographical conditions. The number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95% percentile has increased in most of Russia and decreased in Siberia in spring and autumn. Reducing the number of days with extremely low air temperatures dominated in all seasons. At the same time, the number of days with abnormally low air temperatures has increased in Middle Volga region and south of Western Siberia.

            "abstract": "The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a zonally symmetric mode of mass exchange (also, zonal-mean zonal winds) between the mid- and high-latitude in the Northern Hemisphere with a vertically equivalent barotropic structure. The AO owes its existence to the wave-mean flow interaction in the mid-latitude westerly zone. One way of the wave-mean flow interaction is that the breaking or absorption of planetary waves (i.e., the convergence of EP fluxes) locally changes the speed of zonal-mean zonal winds, which should influence the AO phase. In the present study, projected future AO changes are evaluated among historical and RCP runs of the 5th phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models, in the context of the wave-mean flow interaction in the troposphere and stratosphere. The CMIP5 models can be broadly grouped into two: one with lid height above 1 hPa (“high-top model”) and the other with lid height below 1 hPa (“low-top model”). In the high-top model group, the projected future change of seasonal intensity of stratospheric wave absorption/breaking (measured by the EP flux divergence) is a systematic indicator for the AO change, because the two parameters are linearly related with each other among the models. In contrast, the linear relationship is not found in the low-top model group. The results may imply that the more realistically resolved stratospheric processes in the high-top model group enhance the structural dependence of the AO changes on the stratospheric changes, which may, in turn, imply the increased role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling on the AO changes in the high-top models.",

The most recent solar minimum brought to light gaps in the current understanding of the relationship between ionospheric structure and solar irradiance. The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) offers an invaluable dataset for studying long-term ionospheric variability, as it has been continuously providing extensive coverage of the northern and southern polar ionosphere since 1995 (the solar minimum preceding the 23rd solar cycle). An under-utilized portion of the SuperDARN dataset is the ground-backscatter: the backscatter that returns from a reflection point on the ground along an open (or irregularity-free) propagation path. The ground-backscatter provides a measure the ionospheric density at the peak of the radar signal’s path. These measurements are used to the examine the changes in the bottomside, polar ionosphere over the 23rd and 24th solar cycles.",

            "abstract": "We compute P-wave receiver functions from teleseismic data recorded by our local network of broadband stations in Sikkim Himalaya operated between 2006 and 2013. Our network spreads across the Lesser Himalaya (stations NAMC and RABN), Higher Himalaya (stations GTOK, MANG, CHTG and LCHG) and Tethyan Himalaya (station YUMT). Using Common Conversion Point (CCP) stack, we observe a Low Velocity Zone (LVZ) at depth of 9-12 km beneath the Lesser Himalaya which deepens to 14-16 km beneath the Higher Himalaya. This LVZ is the basal decollement (Main Himalayan Thrust) and marks the top of the downgoing Indian plate. The shallow segment of this fault is frictionally locked and the 2006 (Mw 5.7) Sikkim earthquake occurred at the downdip end of this locked zone. On the CCP stacks, the Moho is highlighted as a strong impedance contrast interface beneath all the stations and to the first order dips gently (~9°) to the north. However, we observe second order dip variations on the Moho beneath the Lesser and Higher Himalaya, with segments dipping to the south. To model the detailed structure within the crust and the second order Moho dip variations we jointly invert P-wave Receiver Functions with Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion data. The higher frequency (5 to 15 s) dispersion data is acquired by analysis of ambient noise between pairs of simultaneously operating stations in Sikkim Himalaya, while the longer period dispersion data (> 15 s) is taken from our previous study of group velocity tomography of India. Our inversion results show that the Moho beneath Lesser Himalaya is at depth between 43 and 48 km; beneath Higher Himalaya at depths between 53 and 55 km; and beneath Tethyan Himalaya at a depth of 60 km. Using this velocity structure, we relocate all earthquakes (> mb3.5) which originated within Sikkim Himalaya between 2006 ans 2013 and found that they occur both within the downgoing Indian plate and the Himalayan wedge.\nKeywords: Sikkim Himalaya, P-wave Receiver Functions, Crustal structure, Earthquakes.",

The main contribution of this work consisted in paving the road towards the development of a “community-based” fault model reflecting the level of knowledge gathered thus far by the WCR working group. The most relevant available data used for this exercise are: - onshore/offshore fault traces, based on geological and high-resolution seismics, revealing a complex network of E-W striking, ~10 km long fault segments; microseismicity recorded by a dense network ( > 60000 events; 1.5<Mw<4.5), delineating steep and low-angle (blind) active fault geometries between 4 and ~10 km depth; GPS velocity vectors, indicating that most of the N-S extension rate (16 mm/y) is limited to the width of the WCR; recent historical seismicity investigations, that have led to important reassessments of magnitudes and locations of M>=5 19th century events and a few paleoseismological investigations, allowing to consider time-dependent ERF. B-value estimates are found to be catalogue-dependent (WCR, homogenized NOA+Thessaloniki, SHARE), which may call for a potential break in scaling relationship. Furthermore, observed discrepancies between seismicity rates assumed for the modeled faults and those expected from GPS deformation rates call for the presence of aseismic deformation. Uncertainty in the ERF resulting from the lack of precise knowledge concerning both, fault geometries and seismic slip rates, is quantified through a logic tree exploration. Median and precentile predictions are then compared to ERF assuming a uniform seismicity rate in the WCR region. The issues raised by this work will be discussed in the light of seismic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "Changes to glacier fronts and ice shelves and glacier acceleration are well documented, but there are almost no data on mass changes for the more than 400 glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. Satellite data have been used to calculate change over the last 3 decades, but methods to quantify this over longer timescales have eluded researchers. However there is an archive of aerial photography dating back to the 1940s, this has been largely ignored due to the range of technical problems associated with deriving quantitative data from historic imagery and the lack of ground control data. This presentation demonstrates how advances in photogrammetric processing and capture of modern aerial photography has allowed this archive to be 'unlocked'.\nAccurate photogrammetric reconstruction from aerial photographs traditionally requires known ground control points acquired in the field; however, in remote and inaccessible areas, such as the Antarctic Peninsula, this is often impossible. A method for providing control for historic photos without fieldwork, by linking them to a newly acquired, highly accurate photogrammetric model adjusted through direct kinematic GPS positioning of the camera has been applied to a number of glaciers across the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThis presentation will outline the photogrammetric workflow and associated errors to highlight the suitability of this technique and demonstrate the data that can be obtained. Accurate measurements of surface elevation change on glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula over a 70 year time span have enabled quantification of spatial and temporal patterns of change. The results show a general trend of glacier retreat, but with thinning of the glacier terminus marginally offset by accumulation in the upper areas of the glacier. The use of this technique opens up possibilities for ‘unlocking the archive’ in other remote glacial areas where historic aerial photography exists but the collection of ground control points is limited.",

            "abstract": "Today the Neotropics contain some of the world’s most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems. Sediments obtained from two radiocarbon infinite (>48,000 years) stratigraphic sections on the eastern Andean flank, provide new insight into the relationship between biodiversity and disturbance during the Pleistocene (~200,000 years). Pollen analysis of modern and fossil material indicates that hyper diverse forest vegetation has been a feature of the Andean flank landscape for 100,000 years (pollen richness: modern = 44, fossil = 48). Correlation of past vegetation with disturbance events (volcanic and fluvial) indicates the response of hyper-diverse forest to past landscape scale change.\nPollen records from near Mera (01°27 S, 78°06 W; 1117 m asl) indicate two major changes in the pollen assemblage, with forest communities dominated by: i) Hedyosmum-Alnus-Ilex, and ii) Combretaceae-Melastomataceae-Myrtaceae. These two pollen assemblages most closely resemble modern vegetation cloud forest (2500-3400m asl) and lower montane rain forest (700-2499 m asl) respectively. Sedimentary evidence suggests that at least 21 volcanic events and three changes in the local fluvial regime perturbed the regional landscape during the period of deposition. However, there is no evidence for volcanic or fluvial disturbance events causing a persistent change in vegetation community.\nVolcanic events (tephra deposits) are associated with increased fire (charcoal particles), and changes in vegetation (pollen grains); however, within ~50cm of sediment accumulation above each tephra, pollen assemblages revert to pre-deposition compositions. Increased fluvial influence (gravel deposits) is associated with elevated input of pollen from taxa today found at higher elevations (Podocarpus-Celtis). The input of high elevation taxa concomitant with fluvial deposits is most likely indicative of an increase in long-distance transport of pollen along water courses originating in the Andes. Our data indicate that the closed-canopy forest vegetation of the eastern Andean flank was resilient and resistant to landscape scale changes in the past, providing insight into how it may respond in the future.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial lakes have been widely documented since first being identified beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet in the 1960s and comprise a significant component of the subglacial hydrological system (Wright & Siegert, 2011). However, their investigation is largely limited to contemporary ice masses despite critical information that could be gleaned from palaeo-subglacial lake studies, including: (i) their influence on meltwater drainage, ice flow and ice streams; (ii) details about how they relate to palaeo-floods, ice dynamics and sub-Milankovitch-scale climate events; and (iii) as archives of long-term Quaternary climate change. They are also readily available, we can sample the sediments and maps the landforms with ease and we have comprehensive information on the lake-bed properties.\nOutput from numerical ice sheet models and the simple Shreve equation approach has been used to diagnose where subglacial lakes are likely to have occurred in the geological record (Livingstone et al. 2013). However, their identification remains controversial due to the difficulty in distinguishing their signature from proglacial lake deposits (see Livingstone et al. 2012). Here, we present new geomorphological, geophysical and sedimentological evidence for the existence of a palaeo-subglacial lake network beneath the suture zone of the former Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. These relatively small (~1 km diameter) palaeo-subglacial lakes manifest as flat-spots in a drumlin field and are perched in upland areas behind small ridges. The flat-spots, which comprise basins in-filled with diamicton, are associated with subglacial meltwater channels and eskers that we interpret to document lake drainage events.\n",

            "abstract": "Expected fluxes of energetic neutral helium atoms (He ENA) emitted from the heliosheath and created by the Ribbon secondary ENA mechanism are relatively small for the directions of the nose and flanks of the heliosphere. The mean free path against ionization in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) for the He ENA reaches ~8,000 AU for atoms of energy ~5 keV, i.e., about 10 times higher than the mean free path against ionization for hydrogen atoms for the same energy. Thus observation of potential sources in the Local Interstellar Medium by an ENA detector could be possible for distances over a dozen thousand AU. This includes a potential to observe processes at the LIC boundary, to which the closest distance is likely smaller than 10,000 AU. Measurements of He ENA could potentially be used to bridge the gap between direct in situ sampling of our Galactic environment, available from Ulysses and IBEX, and the parsec-scale telescopic observations of interstellar absorption lines.\nEstimates of the expected heliospheric emission of He ENA are taken from a simple model of the heliosphere, for which we have obtained results consistent with HSTOF observation of He ENA. We use analytical model of the secondary ENA emission with a simple heliolatitude dependence in the supersonic solar wind. For the extraheliospheric sources, we examine simple He ENA production models on distant (<~0.1 pc) boundary layer. One such model, proposed earlier as an extraheliospheric source for the IBEX Ribbon at the hypothetic interface between the LIC and the Local Bubble, is now extended to provide estimates of the fluxes at a wider energy range, from a few to a few tens of keV, taking various distances to the interface into account.\nIncluding an appropriate mass spectrometer in the IMAP energetic neutral atom detector will give opportunity to distinguish helium atoms from the general ENA flux. This added capability would provide IMAP with a potential to discover possible enhancements in the He ENA fluxes other than from the heliotail direction, which could enable studying kinetic non-equilibrium processes operating in the “dark gap” region currently inaccessible for observations by IBEX and by traditional astrophysical techniques. These processes are potentially ubiquitous in the interstellar medium.",

The rates of seismic moment accumulation from geodesy and of historical seismic release by earthquakes agree within the uncertainties, ruling out significant aseismic deformation. Within the considered 400 km long section of the Apennines, this balance yields an average recurrence interval of 30–75 years for MW≥6.5 events without requiring a future earthquake larger than those observed historically (MW~7). A minimum estimate of unreleased strain allows MW≥6.5 and MW≥6.9 events to be released in ~35% and ~10% of the central-southern Apennines, respectively.

            "abstract": "Nonlinear triad interactions redistribute energy among a wave field, which transforms the shape of the incident short waves (f = 0.05 – 2 Hz) and generates energy at infragravity frequencies (f = 0.005-0.05 Hz). Recently, it has been suggested that infragravity energy may dissipate by energy transfers from infragravity frequencies to either the (former) short-wave spectral peak, or through infragravity-infragravity self-interactions that cause the infragravity waves to steepen and to eventually break. To investigate these infragravity dissipation mechanisms, we use the non-hydrostatic SWASH model. In this study, we first validate the model with the high-resolution GLOBEX laboratory data set and then explore the dependence of the energy transfers, with a focus on infragravity frequencies, on beach slope. Consistent with previous studies we find that SWASH is able to reproduce the transformation and corresponding nonlinear energy transfers of shoreward propagating waves to great detail. Bispectral analysis is used to study the coupling between wave frequencies; nonlinear energy transfers are then quantified using the Boussinesq coupling coefficient. To obtain more detailed insight we divide the nonlinear interactions in four categories based on triads including 1) infragravity frequencies only, 2) two infragravity frequencies and one short-wave frequency, 3) one infragravity frequency and two short-wave frequencies and 4) short-wave frequencies only. Preliminary results suggest that interactions are rather weak on gently beach slopes (1:80) and, in the innermost part of the surf zone, are dominated by infragravity-infragravity interactions. On steeper slopes (1:20), interactions are stronger, but entirely dominated by those involving short–wave frequencies only. The dependence of the transfers on offshore wave conditions and beach shape will be explored too. Funded by NWO.",

            "abstract": "Small-scale high-contrast layers related to high porosity zones or impermeable clay lenses can have a significant effect on water flow and transport processes within aquifers. Such layers can act as electromagnetic waveguides causing late arrival high amplitude elongated wave trains in the GPR data. Recently, we introduced a waveguide amplitude analysis approach that is able to identify continuous low-velocity waveguides between two boreholes including their upper and lower boundaries. Here, we analyze synthetic waveguide models for different thickness, dip, extent, permittivity, and conductivity parameters. These results showed that 1) high-amplitude elongated wave trains in the data are most probably caused by a change in porosity rather than a change in clay content, 2) spatially limited high-porosity layers have characteristic wave behavior forming late-arrival high-amplitude spreading in the data, 3) for a high porosity lens that is not connected to any of the boreholes, the amplitude analysis can be used to identify the lens, but not to estimate the lens boundaries. The waveguide amplitude analysis was extended to detect spatially limited high porosity layers and was applied to an experimental crosshole GPR dataset. Similar events in the data were observed as caused by the modelled spatially limited waveguides and two wave-guiding structures could be identified. Using the ray-based inversion results as starting model for the full-waveform inversion was not able to explain all the data due to the unreliable ray-based inversion results close to the water table caused by the low ray-coverage. Information gained from the amplitude analysis was necessary to improve the starting model for the full-waveform inversion. The final results of the full-waveform inversion imaged two high porosity layers with limited lateral extension that were caused by high porosity sand units embedded in lower porosity gravel and were confirmed by neutron-neutron logging data.",

            "abstract": "Large igneous provinces (LIP) are often found in close temporal and spatial proximity with continental breakups, supporting the model, that an arriving mantle plume produces large amounts of melt and has a massive influence on the breakup process. The South Atlantic is a classical example, with flood basalts on both adjacent continents and a paired age progressing ridge system connecting them with the current hotspot location at Tristan da Cunha.\nTo estimate the influence of the plume on the preexisting continental crust, a large-scale geophysical experiment was conducted in 2011 at the intersection of Walvis Ridge with the African continent. We present four P-wave velocity models derived from seismic refraction data. One extends 430 km along the ridge crest and continues onshore to a total length of 730 km, while the other three crossing the ridge perpendicular: one (480 km long) far offshore in the oceanic regime, one (600 km) close to shelf break and the last one (400 km) onshore.\nCrustal velocities beneath Walvis Ridge range between 5.5 km/s and 7.0 km/s, which are typical velocities for oceanic crust. The crustal thickness, however, is approximately three times larger than of normal oceanic crust: 17 km in the western part increasing to 22 km towards the continent.\nThe continent ocean transition is characterized by 30 km thick crust with a high velocity body (HVB) in the lower crust and seismic velocities up to 7.5 km/s. The western extend of the HVB is to a similar distance from shore as for HVBs observed south of Walvis Ridge. In contrast, the eastern boundary lies well within the continental domain, at the 40 km thick crust of the Kaoko fold belt. Here, the variation of seismic velocities indicates that hot material intruded the continental crust during the initial rifting stage. However, beyond this relatively sharp boundary (40 km wide), the remaining continental crust seems unaffected by intrusions and the root of the Kaoko belt is no eroded.\nThe cross-profile indicates that Walvis Ridge might be broader than its topographic expression and that the northward lying seamounts are part of the ridge. A HVB can only be found at the northern flank of the ridge, but not at its base.\nWe conclude, that the postulated arriving plume head did not modify the continental crust on a large scale, but was a rather regional anomaly.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that salinity increases in the subtropical gyre system may have pre-conditioned the North Atlantic Ocean for a rapid return to stronger overturning circulation and high-latitude warming following meltwater events during the Last Glacial period (Schmidt et al., 2006).\nPlanktonic foraminifera oxygen isotopes (δ18O) measured on the surface dwelling Globigerinoides ruber show a positive gradient going from the Gulf Stream into the subtropical gyre during the Holocene as well as the Last Glacial Maximum (Keigwin, 2004). This gradient is due to decreasing temperatures, increasing salinity and a change from a summer to year round occurrence of G. ruber(Keigwin, 2004).\nDuring rapid climate oscillations between 54 and 46 ka of Marine Isotope Stage 3, including Heinrich ice-rafting event 5, this gradient may have been largely absent; G. ruber δ18O of ODP Site 1060 (subtropical gyre location) and ODP Site 1056 (Gulf Stream location) are virtually identical. Lower G. ruber δ18O that characterize the major warm DO interstadials 14 and 12 suggest a mainly summer occurrence of this species and indicate a more zonal and wider Gulf Stream inﬂuencing both ODP Sites. A large vertical δ18O gradient between shallow dwelling G. ruber and the deep dwelling species Globorotalia inﬂataat site 1056 is associated with strong summer stratiﬁcation, supporting a Gulf Stream presence during these major interstadials.\nFrom about 51 ka until the end of Heinrich event 5 G. ruber δ18O is increased and the δ18O gradient between G. ruber and G. inflata is greatly reduced, suggesting a more year round occurrence of G. ruber and absence of summer stratification at site 1056, associated with subtropical gyre conditions. From this we infer that the Gulf Stream may have taken up a position nearer to the continental shelf during this cold period, where it may have been narrower with reduced transport.",

            "abstract": "Inner core anisotropy was discovered more than 25 years using both seismic body wave and normal mode observations (e.g. Morelli at al, 1986, Woodhouse et al, 1986). More recent studies have shown that the inner core may also display regional variations, which are often simplified as `hemispheres' (e.g. Tanaka & Hamaguchi, 1997), with stronger anisotropy and lower isotropic velocity seen in the west. The existence of hemispheres is key to our understanding of the dynamics of the inner core and its thermal and compositional structure.\nHere, we combine seismic body wave and normal mode data and perform a combined inversion in order to reconcile the two data types. Our model shows evidence for hemispherical variation in isotropic velocity in the top 250 km. The anisotropy also varies regionally, but is confined to a narrower wedge region instead of a full hemisphere. The narrow anisotropic wedge region is clearly visible in both the normal mode and body wave data. Thus, the hemispherical variations in isotropic velocity may be unrelated to the much narrower wedge region in which the anisotropy is strongest and they may require different explanations.\nTwo mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hemispherical pattern and regional variations: either (a) inner core translation, wherein one hemisphere is melting and the other is solidifying, or (b) thermochemical convection in the outer core, leading to different solidification conditions at the inner core boundary. Neither is (yet) able to explain all seismically observed features, and a combination of different mechanisms is probably required.",

            "abstract": "Wastewater pharmaceutical contamination of shallow groundwater is a substantial concern in effluent-dominated streams, due to aqueous mobility and designed bioactivity of pharmaceuticals and due to effluent-driven hydraulic gradients. Improved understanding of the environmental fate and transport of wastewater-derived pharmaceuticals is essential for effective protection of vital aquatic ecosystem services, environmental health, and drinking-water supplies. Substantial longitudinal (downstream) transport of pharmaceutical contaminants has been documented in effluent-impacted streams. The comparative lack of information on vertical and lateral transport (infiltration) of wastewater contaminants from surface-water to hyporheic and shallow groundwater compartments is a critical scientific data gap, given the potential for contamination of groundwater supplies in effluent-impacted systems. Growing dependencies on bank filtration and artificial recharge applications for release of wastewater to the environment and for pretreatment of poor-quality surface-water for drinking water emphasize the critical need to better understand the exchange of wastewater contaminants, like pharmaceuticals, between surface-water and groundwater compartments.\n The potential transport of effluent-derived pharmaceutical contaminants from surface-water to hyporheic-water and shallow groundwater compartments was examined in a wastewater-treatment-facility (WWTF) impacted stream in Ankeny, Iowa under effluent-dominated (71-99% of downstream flow) conditions. Strong hydraulic gradients and hydrologic connectivity were evident between surface-water and shallow-groundwater compartments in the vicinity of the WWTF outfall. Carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and immunologically‑related compounds were detected in groundwater 10-20 meters from the stream bank. Direct aqueous‑injection HPLC-MS/MS revealed high percentage detections of pharmaceuticals (110 total analytes) in surface-water and groundwater samples. The results demonstrate the importance of effluent discharge as a driver of local hydrologic conditions in an effluent-impacted stream and thus as a fundamental control on surface-water to groundwater transport of effluent-derived pharmaceutical contaminants.",

The underlying 3d pore-space geometries were obtained by means of micro-CT scans of a beadpack, Bentheimer sandstone, and Ketton and Estaillades carbonates. Based on these statistics, we introduce a new Lagrangian model for transport that reproduces the aforementioned statistics. Our model is based on a spatio-temporal Markov process of the Lagrangian velocity of fluid particles, where the model parametrization is related to the medium characteristics. Transport predictions are validated against flow and transport results from pore-scale direct numerical simulation. The new model enables the detailed investigation of the transition between non-Fickian and Fickian dispersion in real porous media. Moreover, the model sheds light on the connection between geometrical pore-space characteristics and transport behavior.",

            "abstract": "Turbidity currents, which occur at the continental margins and transport sediments along submarines canyons are particulate gravity currents made of poorly sorted particles. In such currents, the flow is to a large extent controlled by the grain size distribution of the particles at the source. Here we present the combined results of a box model and lock-exchange experiments of particulate gravity currents at small volumetric concentrations of particles (< 4%) flowing along a V-shaped valley, for which we looked at the grain size distributions along the deposit. The currents were made of 1) Silicon Carbide (SiC), 2) Glass Beads (GBs), 3) combined poorly sorted SiC/GBs, and 4) moderately sorted combined SiC/GBs. Experimental particles sizes were in the range 3-100 microns. We used 20 particle size classes to characterize the distributions. First we show that a box model that solves for the deposition of all the particle size classes, remarkably describes the speed of the currents, the mass deposited by the currents, and the material density of the deposit for those currents initially made of SiC and GBs. Last but not least, the box model also reconstructs the mass based size distributions along the deposits characterized by various fining. Yet, the reconstructed distributions differ with the shape of the particles. In the presence of only round GBs particles, the mass based size distributions given by the box compare extremely well with the experimental counterparts. In the presence of SiC, there is a systematic shift towards the smaller grain sizes of the mass based size distributions given by the box compared to the experimental ones. Several hypotheses to explain this shift are currently being investigated.

In the upper basin, the bedrock is old plutonic rock overlain by much younger volcanic rocks. The intermediate basin includes three major tributaries flowing into the Loire River from the left bank: the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne rivers; the main stream flows westward and its valley stretches toward the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Loire River drains the sedimentary series of the Paris Basin, mainly carbonate deposits. The lower Loire basin drains pre-Mesozoic basement of the Armorican Massif and its overlying Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary deposits. The Loire River is one of the main European riverine inputs to the Atlantic ocean.\nHere we are reporting concentration and isotope data for Zn in river waters and suspended sediments from the Loire River Basin. In addition, we also report concentration and isotope data for the different industrial sources within the Loire Basin, as well as data for biota samples such as mussels and oysters from the Bay of Biscay and North Brittany. These organisms are known to be natural accumulators of metal pollutants.\nZinc isotopic compositions are rather homogeneous in river waters with δ66Zn values ranging from 0.21 to 0.39‰. This range of variation is very different from anthropogenic signature (industrial and/or agriculture release) that displays δ66Zn values between 0.02 to 0.14‰.

Statistical analyses show that mean February temperature (MFT) is the most robust and independent variable explaining chironomid species variability. The best MFT transfer function was a partial least squares (PLS) model with a coefficient of determination (r2Jackknifed) of  0.69, a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.33˚C, and maximum bias of 2.15°C. The transfer function was tested by applying it to a Late Glacial to Holocene record from Blue Lake, New South Wales using published data. The reconstruction displays an overall pattern very similar to the Milankovitch driven summer insolation curve for 30°S and to the chironomid based summer temperature reconstruction from Eagle Tarn, Tasmania (Rees and Cwynar 2010) suggesting that the model is robust. The transfer function was also applied to reconstruct the Last Glacial Maxium (LGM) summer temperature from Welsby Lagoon, North Stradbroke Island (Queensland). Preliminary results show a c. 4.2~8.6˚C of cooling in summer temperatures during the LGM from south east Australia.\nStable oxygen and deuterium isotope composition (δ18O and δD) of the chitnous subfossil head capsules from Australian chironomids were also measured to explore the opportunity developing them as an independent temperature proxy. This is the first application of this technique in the Southern Hemisphere. The modern range of chironomid δ18O values were measured based on the same 33 lakes sampled for the transfer function. For these lakes, head capsules of single genera were picked to avoid complications from ‘vital effects’. The relationship of chironomid δ18O to modern lake temperatures has been investigated. Deuterium (δD) on the head capsules has been measured concurrently and the relationship to climate and environment will be explored based on the latest available results.\n",

We used the Morphologi G3 tool developed by\nMalvern Instruments Corporate (Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK) for the grain size analyses. We first\nestablished a criterion for identifying the appropriate number of grain size classes nbclass\nfor characterizing the grain size distributions. We considered the four statistical indicators that are\nthe arithmetic mean size dmean, the standard deviation σd, the skewness Skd, and the kurtosis Kd,\nand show that the four indicators for the initial grain size distributions reach plateaux when nb_class\n≥ 20. Hence we chose nbclass=20 as being our appropriate bin width. These four indicators were\nthen calculated for samples taken along the deposits to establish the grain size distributions along\nthe deposits. The subsequent profiles of dmean, σd, Skd, and Kd with distance from the lock show\nhighly variable behaviours between the different initial distributions. In particular, the distance\nover which the loss of the largest grains of the initial distribution occurs [dmean> dmean(initial)],\ncan cover up to half the runout length. Curiously, the different rates of fining estimated from the\ncurves (dmean/ dmean(initial)) as a function of downstream distance (x/x_runout) do not appear to\nbe well correlated with the sedimentation velocities based on dmean(initial). This is currently being\ninvestigated.",

            "abstract": "Preparation of a new nuclear power plant project is going on in Hungary at Paks site. Although there is an operating plant at the site, comprehensive geological, geophysical investigation has to be implemented in accordance with Hungarian nuclear safety regulation and international norms for confirming the site acceptability and providing a neotectonic basis for site seismic hazard assessment. The scope, techniques and methods of investigations have to be adapted to the geotectonic environment of the site and Pannonian Basin as a whole. The poster presents a brief summary of the program and provides a detailed description of the seismic survey focusing on the 3D subsurface imaging that is the most important task of planned geophysical investigations.\nThe 3D geophysical imaging provides essential geodynamic information to assess the capability of near site faults and for the seismic hazard analysis, as well as for the hydrogeological modeling. The planned seismic survey gives a unique dataset for understanding the spatial relationship between individual fault segments. The 3D survey allows predicting and characterization of deformations induced by recent lithospheric stresses that is crucial for assessing the tectonic stability of the area. 3D seismic survey has to be combined with appropriate 2D and 3D shallow seismic profiling. The obtained 3D seismic data are also used for numerical geodynamic modeling. Rheology of rocks fundamentally influences the frequency of seismic activity, i.e. the accumulation and release of seismic energy. Regarding this the Pannonian Basin has specific features: the crust is thin and thermal gradients are high. This implies the whole lithosphere can be considered rheologically weak and its behavior is mostly plastic. It is suspected that most of the fault zones in the Pannonian basin are restricted to the sedimentary fill and the uppermost crust, and rest of the lithosphere experiences aseismic deformation.",

Pattern classification tools allow to handle efficiently compositional data of volcanic products, complying with their multivariate nature. In the framework of the European MED-SUV project, we explore the application of various data mining methods to volcanic products erupted at Mt. Etna, Italy. Considering 13 major and trace elements for each sample, groups with similar geochemical composition were identified. The set of samples analyzed covers the time span from 2006 to 2012, during which there were two major episodes of effusive activity (2006, 2008-2009) and 25 lava fountains (2011-12). Our approach allows a convenient visualization of the multi-component characteristics of magma in just a single picture, using a color code and cluster membership values. This result offers an important advantage with respect to classical analyses, which require many low-dimensional diagrams (78 possible combinations in conventional 2D graphs).The synoptic information provided by pattern classification easily allows us i) to identify trends of evolution with time even within each eruptive center, and ii) the immediate comparison of the compositional features with all products analyzed in the past.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated the statistical distribution of auroral density cavities (ADC) in the auroral acceleration region (AAR) using data from the Cluster satellites. The data was collected from 2002 to 2007, at geocentric altitudes of 3.0-6.5 RE and 60-80 degrees invariant latitude. All time intervals containing upward ion beams events were manually inspected for the presence of inverted-V electrons and the spacecraft potential determined as a proxy for the electron density. The parallel potential drops above and below the satellite was estimated in order to determine the satellite's position relative the AAR.\nBetween 4.0 and 5.5 RE several crossings of the upper edge of the AAR were observed. The maximum rate of occurrence was found between 4.75 and 5.0 RE. Between 3.75 and 6.5 RE many of the events exhibits an ion beam but no inverted-V electrons. This is consistent with the satellite being located inside the flux tube of the AAR but above the AAR. A sharp increase in the occurrence rate of ion beams without inverted-V electrons is found above 5.25 RE. The maximum occurrence rate is found between 6 and 6.5 REwhere none of the events exhibits any inverted-V.\nThe spacecraft potential exhibits a monotonic decrease with the geocentric altitude, though the rate of decrease is very small between 4.5 and 5.75 RE. Above 5.75 RE, where a large number of events do not exhibit any inverted-V electrons, the spacecraft potential exhibits a rapid decrease. This is consistent with entering a distinct region of low electron densities.\nThe observations indicate that the AAR extends considerably higher that the 2.0-3.0 RE which is often cited. The region between 4.5 and 5.75 RE appears to be a transition region based on the behavior of the spacecraft potential and loss of inverted-V electrons. We interpret this as being the upper edge of the AAR. However, the ADC does not appear to be confined by the AAR and will in many cases both extend above the AAR and in many cases become more pronounced above the AAR.",

            "abstract": "It is evident that at scales of 102 to 10-2 m there is significant isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle that is not always reflected in primitive melts. The “Os isotopic gap”[1] is one such manifestation of this phenomenon but a similar offset exists between the Nd isotope composition of abyssal peridotites and the mid-ocean ridge basalts that they are inferred to have produced[2]. This study takes advantage of recent advances in the analysis of Nd isotopes as NdO+[3,4] which permit the precise analysis of single clinopyroxene grains (<1 mg mass; <5 ng Nd) from a continental harzburgitic xenolith from Kilbourne Hole, NM. Analyses of aggregates of clinopyroxenes from 5 Kilbourne Hole xenoliths reveal a wide range of 143Nd/144Nd (0.513011 ± 28 to 0.513615 ±19)[5]. This study demonstrates significant grain-to-grain isotopic heterogeneity at a scale of 10-2 m (143Nd/144Nd = 0.513089 ± 78 to 0.513364 ± 74) which (i) is equivalent to the range of values for Pacific MORB[6] and (ii) is more primitive than local basalts with an asthenospheric signature[7]. This suggests that small-scale refractory domains exist within the mantle which are either not sampled during partial melting or whose presence is obscured by the melting of higher volumes of more fusible material.\nRef:[1]Alard et al.

            "abstract": "The expansion of tropical forest into savanna may potentially be a large carbon sink, but little is known about the patterns of carbon sequestration during transitional forest formation. Moreover, it is unclear how nutrient limitation, due to extended exposure to firedriven nutrient losses, may constrain carbon accumulation. Here, we sampled plots that spanned a woody biomass gradient from savanna to transitional forest in response to differential fire protection in central Brazil. These plots were used to investigate how the process of transitional forest formation affects the size and distribution of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. This was paired with a detailed analysis of the nitrogen cycle to explore possible connections between carbon accumulation and nitrogen limitation. An analysis of carbon pools in the vegetation, upper soil, and litter shows that the transition from savanna to transitional forest can result in a fourfold increase in total carbon (from 43 to 179 Mg C/ha) with a doubling of carbon stocks in the litter and soil layers. Total nitrogen in the litter and soil layers increased with forest development in both the bulk (+68%) and plant-available (+150%) pools, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the upper layers. However, the analyses of nitrate concentrations, nitrate : ammonium ratios, plant stoichiometry of carbon and nitrogen, and soil and foliar nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that a conservative nitrogen cycle persists throughout forest development, indicating that nitrogen remains in low supply relative to demand. Furthermore, the lack of variation in underlying soil type (>20 cm depth) suggests that the biogeochemical trends across the gradient are driven by vegetation. Our results provide evidence for high carbon sequestration potential with forest encroachment on savanna, but nitrogen limitation may play a large and persistent role in governing carbon sequestration in savannas or other equally fire-disturbed tropical landscapes. In turn, the link between forest development and nitrogen pool recovery creates a framework for evaluating potential positive feedbacks on savanna–forest boundaries.",

We can image and track CMEs from their birth in the solar corona to their impact on Earth and beyond. We can routinely compare imaging observations with in-situ measurements of the same event and at the same time. It is tempting to think that the understanding the evolution of CMEs in the inner heliosphere should be straighforward. This is not the case. Although the prediction of the time of arrival of CMEs at Earth has improved somewhat, there are many outliers. Predicting the speed of the transient at Earth remain hit-or-miss. Clearly, the details of the propagation of CMEs in the inner heliosphere still elude us, preventing progress in Space Weather forecasting amongh other things. ",

Recently, observations have been made that suggest that a substantial fraction of sub-millimeter raindrops fall at speeds exceeding their expected terminal velocities. The prevalence of these super-terminal drops and their microphysical importance (if any) is still uncertain.\nHere, the existence of such super-terminal velocities for sub-millimeter drops is confirmed with the use of 22 optical disdrometers of two different types (21 laser precipitation monitors and a single 2-dimensional video disdrometer). A substantial fraction of sub-millimeter drops are seen to exceed their theoretical terminal fall velocities by at least 30%. Super-terminal fractions seem to be reasonably spatially uniform within a single rain event, but can vary substantially from storm to storm. Analysis of the 2-dimensional video disdrometer data convincingly demonstrates that the detected super-terminal drops are not due to drop fragmentation on the detector.",

Combined with land-use changes, modifications in the rainfall regime and climate can have important consequences on local livelihoods, as illustrated by the devastating droughts in the 1980s. Primary production, but also atmosphere dynamics and aquifer recharge, strongly depend on surface-atmosphere interactions. Although the processes underpinning the water and energy cycles at the surface-atmosphere level are starting to be understood, little is known about how they could have evolved in the past 60 years.\nThis study analyses changes in the water and energy cycles for two major ecosystems (millet and fallow) found in the agro-pastoral Sahel from 1950 to 2010, in a context of strong climate and land-use change. Estimations were undertaken using a process-based Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model (SiSPAT) capable of representing the main surface-atmosphere interactions taking place in the Sahel. Vegetation characteristics were simulated through coupling with vegetation models (STEP and SARRAH) and in-situ data representative of the various ecosystem types. Changes in the rainfall regime induced modifications of the water cycle, both at annual and seasonal time-scales. Different productivities and water seasonal cycles for the millet and fallow systems were evidenced, in accordance with previous studies. When combined with land-use changes, this induced large variations in the water and energy cycles at the landscape scale.\nThese modifications could have important feedback effects on local climate, which are currently not taken into account in Earth System Models. Future work should also focus on understanding the impact of other drivers of change, such as decreasing soil fertility and increased grazing pressure, on ecosystem productivity and the resulting effects on the water and energy cycles in the Sahel.",

This condition produces an integral equation for the trapped flux. We find that in the relativistic regime the limiting electron energy spectrum varies asymptotically as 1/E, for large energy E, just as in the non-relativistic case. However, the scaling coefficient in the relativistic case is twice that in the non-relativistic result.

The latitudinal profiles of amplitude and phase difference of dayside H-component Pi 2s supported that electric fields from high-latitude region penetrate equatorward, and then drives the zonal ionospheric current enhanced at the dayside equator due to the Cowling effect. However, it is unclear how the dayside zonal ionospheric current are connected with the source electric field to ensure current continuity. In this study, we investigated the distribution of equivalent ionospheric currents associated with Pi 2 fluctuations on the day side using magnetic data from globally distributed ground-based stations. The equivalent current vectors were determined by rotating the filtered horizontal magnetic field vector by an angle of 90 degrees clockwise. Oscillating equivalent currents flowed equatorward (poleward) in the prenoon sector and poleward (equatorward) in the postnoon sector. Around the noon, the equivalent current flows in the zonal direction. The meridional component of equivalent currents in the prenoon sector is larger than in the postnoon sector and configuration of currents appears to be asymmetric. We also numerically estimated the distribution of ionospheric currents produced by the SCW-like pair of FACs around the midnight. The distribution of the simulated ionospheric current is consistent with that of equivalent currents derived from observed magnetic fields. We conclude that the oscillating ionospheric current system driven by nightside FAC oscillations is the dominant source of dayside Pi 2 pulsations.",

This is known as the South Atlantic Anomaly caused by a growing patch of reversed magnetic flux at the core-mantle boundary. The investigation of existence and evolution of similar features over the past millennia using global spherical harmonic models is hampered by the fact that at present only very few paleomagnetic data from equatorial and many southern hemisphere regions are available to constrain models well in these regions. Here, we present the results of paleomagnetic investigations of sediment cores from four locations at low latitudes. OPD 1078 and 1079 lie off the coast of Angola, GeoB6517-2 and ODP 1076D are located in the Congo Fan and M35003-4 is situated southeast of Grenada in the Tobago Basin. In addition to the paleomagnetic work all cores were subjected to a comprehensive set of rock magnetic measurements. Detailed age models based on radiocarbon dating are available for all locations, since the sites were already subjects of different aspects of climatic studies. We include these new records and previously presented data from two Ethiopian locations in millennial scale global models of the CALSxk type. Agreement of the new data to previous models and modifications of models due to the additional data are discussed, focussing in particular on magnetic field structures resembling the present-day South Atlantic Anomaly.",

            "abstract": "Drought prone states such as Texas requires creditable and actionable drought early warning ranging from seasonal to multi-decadal scales. Such information cannot be simply extracted from the available climate prediction and projections because of their large uncertainties at regional scales and unclear connections to the needs of the decision makers. In particular, current dynamic seasonal predictions and climate projections, such as those produced by the NOAA national multi-models ensemble experiment (NMME) and the IPCC AR5 (CMIP5) models, are much more reliable for winter and spring than for the summer season for the US Southern Plains. They also show little connection between the droughts in winter/spring and those in summer, in contrast to the observed dry memory from spring to summer over that region.\nTo mitigate the weakness of dynamic prediction/projections, we have identified three key processes behind the spring-to-summer dry memory through observational studies. Based on these key processes and related fields, we have developed a multivariate principle component statistical model to provide a probabilistic summer drought early warning indicator, using the observed or predicted climate conditions in winter and spring on seasonal scale and climate projection for the mid-21stcentury. The summer drought early warning indicator is constructed in a similar way to the NOAA probabilistic predictions that are familiar to water resource managers. The indicator skill is assessed using the standard NOAA climate prediction assessment tools, i.e., the two alternative forced choice (2AFC) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). Comparison with long-term observations suggest that this summer drought early warning indicator is able to capture nearly all the strong summer droughts and outperform the dynamic prediction in this regard over the US Southern Plains. This early warning indicator has been used by the state water agency in May 2014 in briefing the state drought preparedness council and will be provided to stake holders through the website of the Texas state water planning agency.\nWe will also present the results of our ongoing work on using NASA satellite based soil moisture and vegetation stress measurements to further improve the reliability of the summer drought early warning indicator.",

More often ADCPs are being also used to monitor concentration of suspended matter in rivers or in marine environments by the analysis of the acoustic backscatter intensity.\nIn the framework of the European Research Infrastructure EMSO (European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water-column Observatory, www.emso-eu.org), its cabled node, the NEMO–SN1 multidisciplinary seafloor observatory, was deployed in the Western Ionian Sea (Southern Italy) at a depth of 2100 m, about 25 km off-shore Eastern Sicily close to the submarine slope of the Mt. Etna volcano. Starting from February 2013, the Mt. Etna was interested by thirteen different parossistic events producing intense eruption followed by pyroclastic fallout that reached distances of tens kilometres from the eruptive centre. Four of these events affected the ESE sector with a consequent fallout in the Western Ionian Sea and they were detected by NEMO-SN1. In fact, its scientific payload also included an ADCP (RDI WorkHorse 600 kHz) with the main aim to monitor the hydrodynamic conditions of about 30 metres of the water column above the station. Surprisingly, this sensor offered spectacular recordings of the Mt. Etna pyroclastic activity occurred on 2013 wich affected the ESE sector.\nThis work aims to present new records of pyroclastic fallout associated to explosive events observed at sea bottom by the analysis of backscatter signal of the ADCP. A multidisciplinary approach taking into account the Mt. Etna eruptive activity as well as the local oceanographic dynamic is necessary to describe marine processes involved in volcanic ash sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Decreased sea ice extent due to warming has already resulted in the use of new shipping routes through the Arctic. Marine traffic is a source of air pollutants, including NOx, SO2, and aerosols, and is predicted to be an increasingly significant source of Arctic pollution in the future. Currently there are large uncertainties in both global and Arctic shipping emissions, leading to uncertainties in diagnosing current and future impacts of marine traffic on Arctic air quality and climate.\nThis study focuses on the local scale, examining chemical/aerosol transformations occurring in individual ship plumes. Measurements of ship pollution in the Arctic taken during the EU ACCESS aircraft campaign (Arctic Climate Change, Economy and Society) in July 2012 are used to quantify the amount of pollution emitted from different ship types. This is combined with regional model (WRF-Chem) simulations to evaluate the impacts of shipping in northern Norway in summer 2012. The model is run at high resolution (2x2 km) combined with STEAMv2 (Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model version 2) emissions (1x1 km, 15 minute resolution) produced for shipping activity during the measurement period. WRF-Chem model results are compared with 3 ship plumes sampled during ACCESS. The model shows that both the location and total amount of pollution in individual ship plumes are correctly represented. Given this, the model is used to investigate the regional influence of ship pollution off the coast of Norway on a weekly time scale during July 2012, focusing on ozone photochemistry in ship plumes, the evolution of aerosols, and investigating the fate of black carbon emitted from ships. We compare regional modeling results obtained using 15 minute resolution STEAMv2 emissions with results using weekly averaged emissions, which are more representative of emissions typically used by global models to study the impacts of shipping on air quality and climate.",

            "abstract": "The modern polar cryosphere reflects an extreme climate state with profound temperature gradients towards high-latitudes. It developed in association with stepwise Cenozoic cooling, beginning with ephemeral glaciations and the appearance of sea ice in the late middle Eocene. The polar ocean gateways played a pivotal role in changing the polar and global climate, along with declining greenhouse gas levels. The opening of the Drake Passage finalized the oceanographic isolation of Antarctica, some 40 Ma ago. The Arctic Ocean was an isolated basin until the early Miocene when rifting and subsequent sea-floor spreading started between Greenland and Svalbard, initiating the opening of the Fram Strait / Arctic-Atlantic Gateway (AAG). Although this gateway is known to be important in Earth’s past and modern climate, little is known about its Cenozoic development. However, the opening history and AAG’s consecutive widening and deepening must have had a strong impact on circulation and water mass exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic.\nTo study the AAG’s complete history, ocean drilling at two primary sites and one alternate site located between 73°N and 78°N are proposed. These sites will provide unprecedented sedimentary records that will unveil (1) the history of shallow-water exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic, and (2) the development of the AAG to a deep-water connection and its influence on the global climate system.\nThe specific overarching goals of our proposal are to study:\n• the influence of distinct tectonic events in the development of the AAG and the formation of deep water passage on the North Atlantic and Arctic paleoceanography, and\n• the role of the AAG in the climate transition from the Paleogene greenhouse to the Neogene icehouse for the long-term (~50 Ma) climate history of the northern North Atlantic.",

Long-period ground motion impacts on the seismic response of taller structures. It is hence important to understand the characteristics of long-period ground motion associated with the 3D structure and finite fault properties, in particular in those regions with deep sedimentary basins and a complex geological context.\nWe implement a recent high resolution model of the Po basin (MAMBo), derived from geological constraints, in spectral-element code SPECFEM3D_cartesian (Peter et al., 2012). The simulations are numerically accurate for periods of 2 sec and longer, and incorporate complex 3D basin structure and topography as well as the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of source rupture. The response of our basin model has been evaluated for several instrumental earthquakes. Synthetics seismograms reproduce well amplitude and long duration, as well as envelope and coda, observed in paths that travel through sediments.\nWe also evaluate ground motion produced by plausible earthquakes inferred from historical data, such as the Modena (1501) and Verona (1117) events that caused well-documented strong effects in a unusually wide areas with lengths of hundreds of kilometers. We test different representations of the seismic source, from point source to finite sources with different rupture histories, evaluating the impact on shaking amplitude. We compare our results with damage maps (when available) and with the GMPEs currently adopted for this area, evaluating the effects of finite fault and 3D propagation on ground shaking. We show that deterministic ground motion calculation can indeed provide information to be actively used to mitigate the effects of destructive earthquakes on critical infrastructures.",

With observations coming from satellites, automated ship-based systems, autonomous underwater and airborne vehicles, in situ observing systems, and numerical models the field of oceanography is now clearly in the domain of Big Data. The NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) and its partners around the world are addressing the entire range of Big Data issues for the ocean environment. A growing variety, volume, and velocity of incoming “Big Ocean” data streams are being managed through numerous approaches including the automated ingest and archive of incoming data; deployment of standardized, machine-consumable data discovery services; and interoperable data access, visualization, and subset mechanisms. In addition, support to the community of data producers to help them create more machine-ready ocean observation data streams is being provided and pilot projects to effectively incorporate commercial and hybrid cloud storage, access, and processing services into existing workflows and systems are being conducted. NODC is also engaging more actively than ever in the broader community of environmental data facilities to address these challenges. Details on these efforts at NODC and its partners will be provided and input sought on new and evolving user requirements.",

            "abstract": "Transport processes in porous media are frequently simulated as particle movement. This process can be formulated as a stochastic process of particle position increments. At the pore scale, the geometry and micro-heterogeneities prohibit the commonly made assumption of independent and normally distributed increments to represent dispersion. Many recent particle methods seek to loosen this assumption. Recent experimental data suggest that we have not yet reached the end of the need to generalize, because particle increments show statistical dependency beyond linear correlation and over many time steps. The goal of this work is to better understand the validity regions of commonly made assumptions. We are investigating after what transport distances can we observe:\nA statistical dependence between increments, that can be modelled as an order-k Markov process, boils down to order 1. This would be the Markovian distance for the process, where the validity of yet-unexplored non-Gaussian-but-Markovian random walks would start.\nA bivariate statistical dependence that simplifies to a multi-Gaussian dependence based on simple linear correlation (validity of correlated PTRW).\nComplete absence of statistical dependence (validity of classical PTRW/CTRW). \nThe approach is to derive a statistical model for pore-scale transport from a powerful experimental data set via copula analysis. The model is formulated as a non-Gaussian, mutually dependent Markov process of higher order, which allows us to investigate the validity ranges of simpler models.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo is a key variable controlling solar radiation absorbed at the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface, and thus meltwater production. Recent decline in surface albedo over the GrIS has been linked to enhanced snow grain metamorphic rates and amplified ice-albedo feedback from atmospheric warming. However, the importance of distinct surface types on ablation zone albedo and meltwater production is still relatively unknown, and excluded in surface mass balance models. In this study, we analyze albedo and ablation rates (m d-1) using in situ and remotely-sensed data. Observations include: 1) a new high-quality in situ spectral albedo dataset collected with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer measuring at 325–1075 nm, along a 1.25 km transect during three days in June 2013; 2) broadband albedo at two automatic weather stations; and 3) daily MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo (MOD10A1) between 31 May and 30 August. We find that seasonal ablation zone albedos have a bimodal distribution, with two alternate states. This suggests that an abrupt switch from high to low albedo can be triggered by a modest melt event, resulting in amplified ablation rates. Our results show that such a shift corresponds to an observed melt rate percent difference increase of 51.6% during peak melt season (between 10–14 July and 20–24 July, 2013). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that seasonal changes in GrIS ablation zone albedo are not exclusively a function of a darkening surface from ice crystal growth, but rather are controlled by changes in the fractional coverage of snow, bare ice, and impurity-rich surface types. As the climate continues to warm, regional climate models should consider the seasonal evolution of ice surface types in Greenland’s ablation zone to improve projections of mass loss contributions to sea level rise.",

Independent Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–EOS LWP was used to corroborate that the observed variations with sun-view geometry were not severely affected by seasonal/latitudinal changes in cloud properties. Microwave retrievals showed generally small (< 10%) cross-swath variations. The view angle (cross-swath) dependence of MODIS optical thickness was weaker in backscatter than forward scatter directions and transitioned from mild ∩ (bell) shape to stronger U (bowl) shape as heterogeneity, sun angle, or latitude increased. The 2.2 μm effective radius variations always had a U shape, which became pronounced and asymmetric toward forward scatter in the most heterogeneous clouds and/or at the lowest sun. Cloud fraction had the strongest and always U-shaped view angle dependence. As a result, in-cloud MODIS cloud liquid water path (CLWP) showed surprisingly good view angle (cross-swath) consistency, usually comparable to that of microwave retrievals, due to cancellation between optical thickness and effective radius biases. Larger (20-40%) nadir-relative increases were observed in the most extreme heterogeneity and sun angle bins, that is, typically in the polar regions, which, however, constituted only 3-8% of retrievals. The good consistency of MODIS in-cloud CLWP was lost for gridbox-mean LWP, which was dominated by the strong cloud fraction increase with view angle. More worryingly, MODIS LWP exhibited significant and systematic absolute increases with heterogeneity and sun angle that is not present in microwave LWP.",

The lake with a surface area of 360 km² has trapped sediments and volcanic ashes and hence, contains essential information of major climatic and environmental change of the central northern Mediterranean region.\nIn the frame of the ICDP project SCOPSCO (Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid), several scientific questions are adressed: age and origin of the lake, paleoclimatic change during the Quaternary, tephrostratigraphy, and driving forces for the outstanding biodiversity.\nSediments of the lake have been targeted for a deep drilling campaign in spring 2013. Four sites (DEEP, CERAVA, GRADISTE, PESTANI) have been cored to a depth of 569 m below lake floor (blf).\nHigh-quality continuous downhole logging data have been achieved at all drill sites by the use of the following tools: spectral gamma ray, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, dipmeter, borehole televiewer and sonic. Additionally, vertical seismic profiling was conducted at the DEEP site. Seismic investigations indicate a sediment fill of the lake basin up to a thickness of 700 m. First results from cores revealed, that the bottom part, below 430 m blf is characterized by coarser grained deposits while the upper part yields fine grained pelagic sediments.\nThe borehole logging data at the DEEP site shows strong contrasts in all physical properties, in particular in spectral gamma ray (GR), magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and seismic velocity (vp). Furthermore, the pelagic facies show a cyclic alternation in these parameters as well as in the structural features from borehole televiewer.\nBy use of the current age estimate of the record of around 1.2 Ma, the GR data was tested for matching with the benthic δ18O record and shows high correlation (R² = 0.72), whereas high GR indicate glacial and low GR interglacial periods. Spectral analysis was applied and several emphasized wavelengths were identified. To investigate the variability of these high amplitudes, the sliding window technique was used and reveals a temporal evolution. Linking of the signals to Milanković cycles suggest orbitally driven sedimentation for 1.3 Ma and a mean sedimentation rate of 33 cm/ka.",

            "abstract": "The Balkans region that sits at the transition between stable Eurasia and highly straining Eastern Mediterranean, is a natural laboratory to study diffuse deformation of areas affected by continental collision. As in the Himalayan collision zone, it results in a widespread seismicity and underestimated seismic hazard (England & Jackson, 2011). Several Mw~6 shallow earthquakes occurred there in the last century producing large destructions and casualties. The completeness interval of the available historical seismicity catalogs is probably below the average recurrence of individual seismogenic structures, making them insufficient for accurate estimates of seismic hazard there. However, cGPS networks in the Balkans have been growing during the last few years mainly for civilian application, opening new opportunities to quantify the present-day rates of crustal deformation.\nHere, we processed all the currently available data acquired on these new networks using the Gipsy-Oasis software and combined them with previously published velocities. We use this dense velocity field together with tensor moments from RCMT and CMT to derive an homogeneous map of the current-day strain using the methodology of Haines & Holt (1993). We image the deformation resulting from the boundary conditions around the Balkans : (i) the NE motion of Adria-Apulia blocks, (ii) the rigid Eurasian and Black sea backstops, (iii) the hellenic subduction zone and NAF rapid SE motion.\nWe show that the «Adria-Apulia push» is nearly entirely accommodated by compression across the Dinarides with minor propagation in the Pannonian basin. On the other hand, East of 20°E, the entire peninsula is moving southward, probably driven by the hellenic subduction pull. The transition between the SW-NE compressive and the N-S extensive regimes roughly corresponds to the Scutari-Pec transform zone, also known to be a boundary between paleomagnetic domains. Therefore, we show that the clockwise rotation pattern imaged by Perouse et al. (2012) in northern Greece extends up to northern Serbia (46°N), involving the whole Balkans. Finally, we calculate that the N-S extension does not account for the whole SW-NE compression over the Dinarides and that significant strain is stored over the Balkans, probably on multiple active structures that remain to be identified.",

            "abstract": "The Sahel is one of the regions in the world which has experienced the strongest climatic changes in the past decades. In a context of high population growth and mainly agriculture-based economies and livelihoods, these fluctuations can cause serious societal problems. Understanding past and predicting future climatic changes and their implications on natural and cultivated ecosystems are hence primordial. Modelling efforts in the fields of hydrology and ecohydrology have already been undertaken, but are hindered by data availability as soon as the multi-decadal time scale is targeted. Indeed, in addition to being scarce, climatic data are often discontinuous in time, limiting the use of many modelling tools.\nIn this study we produced a continuous and consistent data set at Niamey, Niger (13.5° N, 2.1° E) from 1950 to 2012 at different temporal scales (daily, 3-h and 30-min) that can be used as inputs in most LSM-type, vegetation and hydrological models. A stochastic component was introduced to reflect the uncertainty on the determination of missing data. Variables under study were: rainfall, air temperature, specific humidity, air pressure, wind speed, cloud cover, clear-sky longwave and shortwave radiation. Missing data were filled through regression methods, artificial neural networks, or by randomly selecting the missing variables from data classes presenting similar properties.\nThe datasets showed an increase in temperature of over 1°C since the 1950s. They also maintained the diurnal and seasonal cycles for all variables, thus verifying their internal coherence. Uncertainty at the sub-daily scale did not propagate at longer time-scales for the climatic data. Finally, trends in the seasonal and diurnal cycle of main variables were analyzed and were found coherent with published data. As an illustration of a possible use of this dataset, variations in the water and energy budgets for 1950-2012 for a major ecosystem in the region were simulated using a detailed LSM/SVAT model (SiSPAT). This dataset could be used by the community to better understand and predict land-surface-atmosphere interactions in Central Sahel, including hydrological ones, such as historical changes in yield, growth of natural vegetation, changes in the water cycle and as a high-quality baseline for climate change impacts studies.",

            "abstract": "The Rocknest eolian drift sediments were pyrolyzed in the Science Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Curiosity rover, yielding a small, discrete peak of C1-C3 volatiles, which were detected by direct mass spectrometry. This peak was observed to have a maximum intensity at ~820°C in all four evolved gas analysis (EGA) experiments of the scooped and sieved (to ≤ 150 mm) Rocknest sediment, though it is strongest in the second and third analyses. It was not observed in any blanks or subsequent samples of drilled rocks. Estimates of the total reduced carbon concentration are 16 ± 4 ppm carbon by weight in the sample. Evolved gas analysis does not support definitive identification of trace molecules in gas mixtures, however the masses that define the observed peak are consistent with primarily CO2 (oxidized carbon phase; 9 ± 2 ppmw carbon ) and CO, with 1-2 orders of magnitude less C1-3 hydrocarbons. The observed mass composition and temperature of evolution for the Rocknest-820°C peak are suggestive of reduced carbon in a refractory state within the sample and inconsistent with reaction products that one might expect from terrestrial organic materials that are part of SAM’s background. These carbon volatiles are most likely released from inclusions or decrepitating minerals and this entrapment may be responsible for their preservation after significant exposure to ionizing radiation and mechanical weathering. Detection of these volatiles indicates reduced carbon phases are present in some Martian surface sediment. Carbon concentrations for Rocknest are within the range reported for magmatic carbon in Martian meteorites and the composition is comparable to volatiles released from terrestrial basaltic glasses. The Rocknest drift deposit is considered representative of the global dust on Mars. The very-high-temperature volatile release from Rocknest implies a possible global distribution of reduced carbon on the Martian surface.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) supported the research described here.",

            "abstract": "Seacliff erosion is a serious hazard with implications for coastal management, and is often estimated using successive hand digitized cliff tops or bases (toe) to assess cliff retreat. Traditionally the recession of the cliff top or cliff base is obtained from aerial photographs, topographic maps, or in situ surveys. Irrespective of how or what is measured to categorize cliff erosion, the position of the cliff top and cliff base is important. Habitually, the cliff top and base are hand digitized even when using high resolution lidar derived DEMs. Even if efforts were made to standardize and eliminate as much as possible any digitizing subjectivity, the delineation of cliffs is time consuming, and depends on the analyst’s interpretation. We propose an automatic procedure to delineate the cliff top and base from high resolution bare-earth DEMs. The method is based on bare-earth high-resolution DEMs, generalized coastal shorelines and approximate measurements of distance between the shoreline and the cliff top. The method generates orthogonal transects and profiles with a minimum spacing equal to the DEM resolution and extracts for each profile xyz coordinates for cliff's top and toe, as well as second major positive and negative inflections (second top and toe) along the profile. The difference between the automated and digitized top and toe, respectively, is smaller than the DEM error margin for over 82% of the top points and 86% of the toe points along a stretch of coast in Del Mar, CA. The larger errors were due either to the failure to remove all vegetation from the bare-earth DEM or errors of interpretation during hand digitizing. The automatic method was further applied between Point Conception and Los Angeles Harbor, CA. This automatic method is repeatable, takes advantage of the bare-earth high-resolution, and is more efficient.",

The resulting leading-order dynamical balance in the Navier-Stokes equation therefore involves the Coriolis term, pressure, the Lorentz force and buoyancy. For numerical reasons, weak viscosity is often retained although this is not expected to be dynamically important. The system of equations for the unknown flow is then purely linear, and involves an inversion of the discretised Coriolis and viscous terms.\nIn a full sphere, we present a Galerkin scheme which results in a very low condition numbers for the linear system, when compared to other standard methods, leading to highly accurate solutions for the flow. The excellent properties of our method reflect the facts that: (i) the boundary conditions are handled implicitly, (ii) the correct behaviour at the origin is hard-wired into the scheme and (iii) we do not need to take any curl operations to formulate the discrete equations.",

            "abstract": "A broad range of strategies have been used to study Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (ACI). However, the wide scope of methods and scales used makes it difficult to quantitatively compare result from different studies.\nIn this paper, we propose a method of aerosol-cloud interaction monitoring based on widely available remote sensing instruments and easily applicable at many different observatories. This method provides a way of identifying cases where a change in the aerosol environment causes a change in the cloud. In this scheme we attempt to use (as far as possible) the observed signal from lidar and radar. For an aerosol proxy we use the attenuated backscatter (sensitive to aerosol concentration) and to obtain information about changes in the cloud we use the radar reflectivity factor (sensitive to cloud droplet size and concentration). Assuming a positive dependence between the number concentration of cloud droplets and the number concentration of aerosol we expect that an increase of the attenuated backscatter coefficient will correspond to a small increase of the radar reflectivity factor (due to the increase of cloud droplets concentration). However, the slope of this correlation will vary. A number of factors, such as meteorology or cloud drop microphysical properties, can influence changes in a cloud. For that reason we put a constraint on the liquid water content using liquid water path information from microwave radiometers. This limitation ensures that the variability in the cloud will be primarily due to changes in microphysical properties associated with the variation in aerosols. Further, we limit the cases only to non-precipitating, low-level stratiform and stratocumulus clouds without drizzle. \nAlthough this method is based on a synergy of instruments, we use widely available systems for an efficient evaluation of the aerosol influence on the cloud. The main advantages of this scheme are the use of direct observables from widely spread remote sensing instruments and the lack of assumptions about the microphysical properties of the clouds. We plan to implement this framework over the cloud profiling sites of the ACTRIS network in Europe to enable monitoring of the ACI close to real-time. We believe that obtaining data in the same format over multiple regions will result in a better understanding of the ACI.",

            "abstract": "Interannual variability in North Indian Ocean surface temperature is traditionally viewed as a passive response to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) via the atmospheric bridge. This view is being challenged by new studies showing a double peak evolution of North Indian Ocean response to ENSO in sea surface temperature (SST). The first peak, concurrent with El Nino, is readily explained by the atmospheric bridge from the Pacific but the second peak in the post El Nino summer is due to local ocean-atmosphere interactions. First, El Nino excites downwelling ocean Rossby waves in the tropical South Indian Ocean, persisting the El Nino-induced warming. Second, the North Indian Ocean warming excites an anomalous atmospheric anticyclone spanning the tropical Northwest Pacific and the North Indian Ocean. The attendant anomalous easterlies in turn help sustain the ocean warming by reducing the prevailing southwest monsoon. The circular argument signifies the two-way interaction that persists El Nino anomalies through the summer over the Indo-Northwest Pacific. When initialized in spring, this coupled mode of summer is highly predictable. Numerical experiments and hindcasts with coupled models support this mode.\nAnalysis of a long ship track across the North Indian Ocean shows that this summer mode and its correlation with ENSO display pronounced interdecadal modulations, pronounced when ENSO amplitude is large (after the 1970s and at the turn of the 20th century). This coupled mode poses new problems of physical oceanography.",

            "abstract": "Breaking waves and bores inject large amounts of turbulence into the water column as vortices, which can travel downward and entrain sand from the bed. Coastal evolution models rarely include the effect of this surface-induced turbulence on sand suspension and subsequent transport to predict surf-zone morphodynamics. Here, we analyze turbulence and suspension measurements beneath non-breaking waves and plunging breakers, collected during the field-scale BARDEXII laboratory experiment using a vertical array of 3 ADVs and 7 OBSs. The array was positioned at a single cross-shore location, but, because of changes in wave conditions and water levels, experienced different degrees of wave breaking. Results show a phase-coupling for both turbulence kinetic energy and sand concentration with the short-wave orbital motion during all conditions, with the highest values when the cross-shore velocity is onshore directed. The vertical turbulence flux under plunging breakers also depends on wave phase, with a downward and upward flux during offshore and onshore directed wave orbital motion, respectively. The plunging jet hits the water surface in the wave trough, resulting in a downward turbulence flux during the offshore directed wave orbital motion. The upward flux during the onshore directed wave orbital motion might represent the injected air bubbles rising to the water surface. This upward flux coincides with the peak in suspension, which, accordingly, reaches higher in the water column than beneath non-breaking waves. Besides a phase-coupling with the short-wave orbital motion, turbulence kinetic energy and sand concentration were also modulated on an infragravity timescale, with high values during the offshore directed infragravity flow. The effect of surface-generated turbulence on the direction and magnitude of short- and infragravity-induced cross-shore sand fluxes will also be discussed.

SERVIR integrates satellite observations, ground-based data and forecast models to monitor and forecast environmental changes and to improve response to natural disasters. Through the use of DSSs whose “front ends” are physically based models, the SERVIR activity provides a natural testbed to determine the extent to which NMME monthly to seasonal projections enable scientists, educators, project managers and policy implementers in developing countries to better use probabilistic outlooks of seasonal hydrologic anomalies in assessing agricultural / food security impacts, water availability, and risk to societal infrastructure. The multi-model NMME framework provides a “best practices” approach to probabilistic forecasting.\nThe NMME forecasts are generated at resolution more coarse than that required to support DSS models; downscaling in both space and time is necessary. The methodology adopted here applied model output statistics where we use NMME ensemble monthly projections of sea-surface temperature (SST) and precipitation from 30 years of hindcasts with observations of precipitation and temperature for target regions. Since raw model forecasts are well-known to have structural biases, a cross-validated multivariate regression methodology (CCA) is used to link the model projected states as predictors to the predictands of the target region. The target regions include a number of basins in East and South Africa as well as the Ganges / Baramaputra / Meghna basin complex. The MOS approach used address spatial downscaling. Temporal disaggregation of monthly seasonal forecasts is achieved through use of a tercile bootstrapping approach. We interpret the results of these studies, the levels of skill by several metrics, and key uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Recent seismological observations have highlighted increasing foreshock activity preceding the failure of large earthquakes. Foreshock sequences are the signature of a precursory slip during the nucleation of earthquakes, as observed both prior the Tohoku-Oki Mw 9.0 and the recent Iquique 2014 Mw 8.1 earthquakes. However, foreshocks are not systematic and the reason why they occur remains poorly understood. Recent advances in laboratory experiments allow to mimic seismic ruptures and to study the earthquake nucleation phase. Here, we track the occurrence of foreshocks prior to stick-slip instabilities in crustal rocks.\nHere we present the results of 6 experiments on saw cut granite samples submitted to triaxial loading under in-situ upper crustal condition that provide additional clues to understand the physical processes of foreshock dynamics. We obtained a catalog of more than 200 stick-slip cycles, composed of loading period and mainshock. Thirty STick-slip Events (STE) are preceded by a foreshock sequence. The moment and location of the 900 measured foreshocks are obtained using acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. We systematically observed that (i) the static friction coefficient, (ii) the stress drop and, consequently, (3) the moment magnitude (and total seismic slip) of the mainshock increases with increasing σn.\nIn our experiments, an exponential acceleration of the precursory slip is systematically observed, but foreshocks are only observed when the normal stress becomes greater than 55MPa. This threshold corresponds to the normal stress above which the nucleation length becomes comparable to the size of typical fault asperities. In these conditions, the total cumulative moment of the foreshock sequence also increases exponentially up to failure, and the fault surface evolves like a cascading asperity model. This exponential growth implies that the nucleation phase has a characteristic time, i.e. that the foreshock sequence duration and moment release scales with the size of the main asperity which is eventually going to rupture.",

            "abstract": "Surface-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements have significant potential for monitoring dynamic hydrologic processes at multiple scales in time and space. At early times during infiltration into a soil, the zone behind the wetting front may act as a low-velocity waveguide that causes dispersion of GPR waves, thereby making interpretation of the data using standard methods difficult. In this work, we show that the dispersion is dependent upon the distribution of water within the waveguide, which is controlled by soil hydrologic properties. Simulations of infiltration were performed by varying the n-parameter of the Mualem-van Genuchten equation using HYDRUS-1D; the associated GPR data were simulated to evaluate the influence of dispersion. We observed a notable decrease in the “shingling” effect in the GPR data associated with wave dispersion as the sharpness of the wetting front profile decreased. Given the sensitivity of the dispersion effect to the wetting front profile, we also evaluated whether the water content distribution can be determined through inversion of the dispersive GPR data. We found that a global grid search combined with the simplex algorithm was able to estimate the average water content when the wetted zone is divided into 1-2 effective layers. This approach was incapable, however, of representing the gradational nature of the water content distribution behind the wetting front. In contrast, the shuffled complex evolution algorithm was able to constrain a piece-wise linear function to closely match the shallow gradational water content profile. In both the layered and piece-wise linear case, the sensitivity of the dispersive data dropped sharply below the wetting front, which in this case was around 20 cm for a 1000MHz GPR survey. This study demonstrates that dispersive GPR data has significant potential for capturing the early-time dynamics of infiltration that cannot be obtained with standard GPR analysis approaches.",

            "abstract": "Cassini entered in Saturn’s orbit in July 2004. In ten years, more than 100 targeted flybys of Titan have been performed. We focus our study on the comprehensive analysis of the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer data set acquired between 2004 and 2014, with a particular emphasis on the atmospheric polar features. First evidences for a vast ethane cloud covering the North Pole have been detected as soon as the second targeted flyby in December 2005 [1]. The first detailed imaging of this north polar feature with VIMS was obtained in December 2006, thanks to a change in inclination of the spacecraft orbit [2]. At this time, the northern lakes and seas of Titan were totally masked to the optical instruments by the haze and clouds, whereas the southern pole was well illuminated and mostly clear of haze and vast clouds. Subsequent flybys revealed that the vast north polar feature was progressively vanishing around the equinox in 2009 [2,3,4], in agreement with the predictions of Global Circulation Models [5]. It revealed progressively the underlying lakes to the ISS and VIMS instruments. First evidences of an atmospheric vortex growing over the South Pole occurred in May 2012, with a high altitude feature detected at each flybys since then. In this study, we have computed individual global maps of the north and south poles for each of the 100 targeted flybys, using VIMS wavelengths sensitive both to clouds and surface features. This allows a more complete monitoring of the evolution of the north polar cloud than was previously done before using a selection of individual flybys only. It also provides a detailed investigation of what is currently acting over the South Pole. [1] Griffith et al., Science, 2006. [2] Le Mouélic et al., PSS, 2012. [3] Rodriguez et al., Nature, 2009.

            "abstract": "The Aysén fjord, 65 km long and east-west oriented, is located at 45.4ºS and 73.2ºW in Chilean Patagonia. It has a maximum water depth of 345 m. It collects the inputs of Aysén, Pescado, Condor and Cuervo rivers, which drain the surrounding Patagonian Andes. The fjord is crossed by the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault Zone, a seismically active trench parallel intra-arc fault system. On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake triggered numerous subaerial and submarine landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the subaerial landslides reached the water mass, generating tsunami-like displacement waves that flooded the adjacent coastlines, withlocal >50 m high run-ups, causing ten fatalities and damage to salmon farms.\nThe research cruise DETSUFA on board BIO Hespérides in March 2013, aiming to characterise the landslides and their effects, mapped with great detail the submerged morphology of the fjord. Multibeam data display deformation structures created by the impact of the landslides in the inner fjord floor. Landslide material descended and accelerated down the highly sloping fjord flanks, and reached the fjord floor at 200 m water depth generating large, 10-m-deep impact depressions. Fjord floor sediment was pushed and piled up in arcuate deformation areas formed by 15-m-high compressional ridges, block fields and a narrow frontal depression. Up to six >1.5 km2 of these structures have been identified.\nIn addition, the cruise mapped the outer fjord floor beyond the Cuervo ridge. This ridge, previously interpreted as a volcanic transverse structure, most probably acted as a limit for grounding ice in the past, as suggested by the presence of a melt-water channel. The fjord smoothens and deepens to more than 330 m forming an enclosed basin, before turning SW across a field of streamlined hills of glacial origin. Three volcanic cones, one of them forming Isla Colorada and the other two totally submerged and previously unknown, have been mapped in the outer fjord. The largest one is 160 m high, 1.3 km in diameter and tops at 67 m water depth. This high-resolution data set illustrates a wide set of geohazards in the recent lively geological history of Aysén fjord.",

In this study, we report preliminary results on the near-infrared phase function observed with the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since December 2013, LOLA has been collecting passive radiometry (reflected sunlight) in the northern hemisphere where the spacecraft altitude is too high for normal altimetric ranging. In this mode, LOLA acts as a 4-pixel radiometer with pixel size ~60 m, integration time of 1/28th sec (every ~60 m along-track), and signal-to-noise ratio ~50 per pixel in a single “exposure” at low latitudes. We report on the passive radiometric calibration, and compare the LOLA near-infrared phase function to that at similar and smaller wavelengths measured with other instruments. The unique capability of LOLA to also actively measure the normal albedo from the received pulse energies during altimetric ranging provides a crucial anchor point for the passively-derived phase function that is not easily obtained with typical imagers. Finally, we explore what constraints can be placed on the parameters of physically-motivated phase function models. This work will ultimately provide insight on the wavelength dependence of the phase function, for which the theoretical understanding is presently incomplete.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow (Q) estimation in ungauged catchments is one of the greatest challenges facing hydrologists. We used observed Q from approximately 7500 small catchments (<10,000 km2) around the globe to train neural network ensembles to estimate temporal Q distribution characteristics from climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments. In total 17 Q characteristics were selected, including mean annual Q, baseflow index, and a number of flow percentiles. Training coefficients of determination for the estimation of the Q characteristics ranged from 0.56 for the baseflow recession constant to 0.93 for the Q timing. Overall, climate indices dominated among the predictors. Predictors related to soils and geology were the least important, perhaps due to data quality. The trained neural network ensembles were subsequently applied spatially over the ice-free land surface including ungauged regions, resulting in global maps of the Q characteristics (0.125° spatial resolution). These maps possess several unique features: 1) they represent purely observation-driven estimates; 2) are based on an unprecedentedly large set of catchments; and 3) have associated uncertainty estimates. The maps can be used for various hydrological applications, including the diagnosis of macro-scale hydrological models. To demonstrate this, the produced maps were compared to equivalent maps derived from the simulated daily Q of five macro-scale hydrological models, highlighting various opportunities for improvement in model Q behavior. The produced dataset is available for download.",

            "abstract": "Submarine canyons are instrumental in transporting sediment from coastal regions to deep-sea fans. Mean grain size, distribution, and sorting have been used to characterize these deposits, but they provide little information on where sediment transport was initiated or the delivery processes involved. Fortunately, the entrained biological constituents have unique environmental signatures that are more precise proxies for source areas than are mineral grains alone. They may identify a single biofacies deposit (SBD) resulting from local sediment transport such as storm waves, peak river discharge, breaking of internal waves, canyon wall sloughing, or hemipelagic deposition, or a displaced, multiple biofacies deposit (MBD) containing several biofacies where sediment is transported from one biofacies to another, is caught behind a slump that acts as a dam, remains there long enough for the local fauna to become established, and then this combined assemblage is transported further downslope when the dam breaks. Multiple episodes of this “staged” storage-and-release process occur sequentially so as to move the sediment progressively down the canyon. Rarely, exceptionally large triggers such as earthquakes, intense storm disturbances, and catastrophic failure of canyon walls result in full canyon flushing events, entraining numerous biofacies during a single rapid descent. These events can be differentiated in recent deposits by the presence of living specimens representing distinct biofacies or in historic records by dating individual biofacies within a turbidite.\nA 19,000 year record from the Ascension-Monterey Canyon system (core S3-15G, 36°23.53'N, 123°20.52'W; 3491 m) captured hemipelagic mud interspersed with turbiditic sand and silt transported to lower bathyal depths. The relative abundance of displaced benthic foraminifera was found to correlate positively with grain size (75% in cross-bedded turbiditic sands, 39% in laminated turbiditic sands, and 15% in turbiditic muds) and the 65 MBDs recovered originated from the estuarine/inner shelf to the upper middle slope. Sediment bypassing was evident and possibly full canyon flushing as well. Identifying allochthonous biological sediment constituents is a powerful tool in the investigation of sediment transport in submarine canyons.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive risk assessment framework was built to develop proactive risk reduction measures for Vulcano Island, Italy. This framework includes identification of eruption scenarios; probabilistic hazard assessment, quantification of hazard impacts on the built environment, accessibility assessment on the island and risk perception study. Vulcano, a 21 km2 island with two primary communities host to 900 permanent residents and up to 10,000 visitors during summer, shows a strong dependency on the mainland for basic needs (water, energy) and relies on a ~2 month tourism season for its economy. The recent stratigraphy reveals a dominance of vulcanian and subplinian eruptions, producing a range of hazards acting at different time scales. We developed new methods to probabilistically quantify the hazard related to ballistics, lahars and tephra for all eruption styles. We also elaborated field- and GIS- based methods to assess the physical vulnerability of the built environment and created dynamic models of accessibility.\nResults outline the difference of hazard between short and long-lasting eruptions. A subplinian eruption has a 50% probability of impacting ~30% of the buildings within days after the eruption, but the year-long damage resulting from a long-lasting vulcanian eruption is similar if tephra is not removed from rooftops. Similarly, a subplinian eruption results in a volume of 7x105 m3 of material potentially remobilized into lahars soon after the eruption. Similar volumes are expected for a vulcanian activity over years, increasing the hazard of small lahars. Preferential lahar paths affect critical infrastructures lacking redundancy, such as the road network, communications systems, the island’s only gas station, and access to the island’s two evacuation ports. Such results from hazard, physical and systemic vulnerability help establish proactive volcanic risk mitigation strategies and may be applicable in other island settings.",

The aim of our study is to apply statistical array-based approaches to processing of these records. We use the methods mainly brought from the random matrix theory in order to give a statistical description of seismic wavefields recorded at the Earth’s surface. We estimate the array covariance matrix and explore the distribution of its eigenvalues that contains information about the coherency of the sources that generated the studied wavefields. With this approach, we can make distinctions between the signals generated by isolated deterministic sources and the \"random\" ambient noise. We design an algorithm that uses the distribution of the array covariance matrix eigenvalues to detect signals corresponding to coherent seismic events. We investigate the detection capacity of our methods at different scales and in different frequency ranges by applying it to the records of two networks: (1) the seismic monitoring network operating on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano at La Réunion island composed of 21 receivers and with an aperture of ~15 km, and (2) the transportable component of the USArray composed of ~400 receivers with ~70 km inter-station spacing.",

Ponds trapped under a layer of refrozen ice have been observed in the Arctic and our model results, confirmed by observations, show that the latent heat stored in the ice due to their presence slows the basal sea ice growth for over a month after a sea ice lid appears on their surface.\nIn this work we study the ice/water temperature profile in the trapped pond system and its evolution until the pond freezes and show the impact of the presence of a trapped pond on sea ice growth. We have carried out this study by developing a three layer, one-dimensional model of temperature and salinity evolution to study the refreezing process. We show some preliminary results obtained by including this new process in the CICE model and in particular, the impact that the increased pond salinity and the refrozen pond persistence have on the sea ice basal growth.",

            "abstract": "The main challenge in groundwater problems is the reliance on large numbers of unknown parameters with wide rage of associated uncertainties. To translate this uncertainty to quantities of interest (for instance the concentration of pollutant in a drinking well), a large number of forward flow simulations is required.\nTo make the problem computationally tractable, Josset et al. (2013, 2014) introduced the concept of functional error models. It consists in two elements: a proxy model that is cheaper to evaluate than the full physics flow solver and an error model to account for the missing physics. The coupling of the proxy model and the error models provides reliable predictions that approximate the full physics model's responses. The error model is tailored to the problem at hand by building it for the question of interest. It follows a typical approach in machine learning where both the full physics and proxy models are evaluated for a training set (subset of realizations) and the set of responses is used to construct the error model using functional data analysis. Once the error model is devised, a prediction of the full physics response for a new geostatistical realization can be obtained by computing the proxy response and applying the error model.\nWe propose the use of functional error models in a Bayesian inference context by combining it to the Nested Sampling (Skilling 2006; El Sheikh et al. 2013, 2014). Nested Sampling offers a mean to compute the Bayesian Evidence by transforming the multidimensional integral into a 1D integral. The algorithm is simple: starting with an active set of samples, at each iteration, the sample with the lowest likelihood is kept aside and replaced by a sample of higher likelihood. The main challenge is to find this sample of higher likelihood. We suggest a new approach: first the active set is sampled, both proxy and full physics models are run and the functional error model is build. Then, at each iteration of the Nested Sampling algorithm, the proposed geostatistical realization is first evaluated through the approximate model to decide whether it is useful or not to perform a full physics simulation. This improves the acceptance rate of full physics simulations and opens the door to iteratively test the performance and improve the quality of the error model.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a critical component of the regional and global water and energy cycle. It controls the exchanges of water, energy and carbon between land surface and the atmosphere and has significant impact on the accuracy of numerical weather predictions (NWP). To meet the near real time soil moisture data needs, NOAA NESDIS has developed a soil moisture environmental data record (EDR) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 on board the 1st Global Climate Observation Mission for Water Cycle (GCOM-W1) of JAXA. The level2 soil moisture EDR is also merged with other satellite soil moisture observations via NESDIS Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) so that users at NCEP could assimilate all the available satellite soil moisture observations for NWP model accuracy. This presentation will describe the AMSR2 soil moisture EDR and how it is merged with similar soil moisture retrievals from ESA’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites of EUMETSAT, and Naval Research Lab’s WindSat satellite. Qualities of these merged and individual satellite soil moisture data sets are evaluated against the in situ soil moisture measurements of various ground observation networks such as NOAA’s Climate ",

            "abstract": "Micro-seismic data shows that hydraulic fracture propagation is a complex process. When hydraulic fractures interact with pre-existing natural fractures, it can result in a complex fracture network. The interaction depends on in-situ stresses, rock and natural fracture mechanical properties, approach angle and hydraulic fracture treatment parameters. Most simulation studies treat natural fractures as frictional interfaces with cohesive properties. However, from core observation, partially cemented and fully cemented natural fractures are widely present and it is not clear that whether they fit the common description or not.\nIn this study, semi-circular bending experiments are utilized to examine the fracture propagation paths. Synthetic hydrostone samples with embedded inclusions of different mechanical properties are used to mimic rock and cemented natural fractures. Simulation results are generated using finite element software ABAQUS. The extended finite element method (XFEM) capability of ABAQUS allows the fracture initiation and propagation along a solution dependent path without the need for re-meshing. The simulation results are used to explain the experimental observations.\nIn a series of experiment and modeling work, we assess the influence of the fracture approach angle, inclusion strength, and inclusion thickness on fracture propagation. Current results indicate the fracture propagation direction is strongly influenced by pre-existing inclusions. The propagating fractures tend to cross the inclusion when the approach angle is high and divert into the inclusion when the approach angle is low. The crossing surface is thus not a clean cut, but with a jog distance that depends on the inclusion thickness and approach angle. Results imply that if hydraulic fractures have lower approach angles to pre-existing natural fractures, the ultimate fracture network is going to have higher complexity. The thickness of natural fractures can also add to the complexity.",

            "abstract": "The abundance of redox active Fe minerals has the potential to alter the storage and loss of C, contribute to gaseous N emissions, and control P retention in upland tropical forest soils. High concentrations of short-range order Fe minerals led to Fe(II) production rates of 26-206 µg g d-1 under short-term low redox conditions (Chacón et al. 2006, Liptzin and Silver 2009, Dubinsky et al. 2010). Potential C mineralization from Fe(II) reduction was 34-263 g CO2-C m-2 y-1, C losses equivalent to approximately 10-60 % of annual litterfall production in this forest. Decreased acidity during Fe reduction can destabilize soil aggregates and lead to C losses. Iron is rapidly reoxidized during aerobic periods, which can subsequently lead to C stabilization via complexation reactions. Fe oxidation can also stimulate C losses via pH-driven dissolved organic C production and directly via Fenton reactions. In laboratory experiments, rates of CO2 production were strongly linearly correlated with Fe(II) loss under aerobic conditions, increasing by 0.51 ± 0.02 µg CO2-C g soil h-1 respired for each mg of Fe(II) g-1 soil oxidized or sorbed (Hall and Silver 2013). Iron oxidation has also been linked to dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ leading to N retention in ecosystems. Fe(III) reduction coupled with NH4+ oxidation (Feammox) can lead to N losses as dinitrogen gas (N2) or nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Estimates suggest that Feammox resulted in gaseous N losses of 1-4 kg N ha-1 y-1 (Yang et al. 2012), rates equivalent to total denitrification in this forest. Oxidized Fe can strongly bind P decreasing it’s availability to plant roots. While this is commonly cited as a potential limitation to net primary production in tropical forests, it also helps to retain P in ecosystems with high rainfall and potential leaching losses. Microbial biomass P availability increased significantly with Fe(II) production, suggesting the P mobilized during Fe(II) reduction was rapidly immobilized into biological pools (Liptzin and Silver 2009). Data suggest that Fe-redox cycling may decrease P limitation to NPP, and help maintain forest nutrient stocks. In summary, our results highlight the biogeochemical significance of Fe cycling in upland soils environments and its important role in the dynamics of humid tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "The equatorward ventilation of Southern Hemisphere extratropical water masses to the low latitude thermocline has been proposed as a window through which the high latitude ocean can modulate tropical climate on anything from decadal to orbital timescales. This hypothesis is founded largely on the observation that tropical thermocline waters originate mostly in the Southern Hemisphere and that computer simulations suggest property anomalies in these source regions can advect through the intermediate ocean, “the ocean tunnel” to influence tropical SST. However, few observational records of extratropical ocean changes are available to assess their impacts on multi-decadal and longer timescales. Here we add to the observational record using new decadally resolved planktonic and benthic foraminiferal isotopic records spanning MIS 3 (20-50 ka) from the Chilean slope ODP Site 1233 that is located on the northern margin of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its seafloor lies in the core of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). Thus the site is ideally situated to reconstruct both near surface and AAIW variability in the high southern latitudes. On centennial to millennial timescales, changes in intermediate water properties track those in the near surface albeit with a reduced amplitude—confirming the idea that changes in the extratropical ocean effect the oceanic tunnel on these timescales. The new benthic and plantic foraminiferal isotope results demonstrate that variations in intermediate ocean properties and climate of the southeast Pacific closely align with those recorded in the EPICA ice core from Dronning Maud Land. Such abrupt, synoptic scale changes in Antarctic climate and dynamics will have potentially widespread climatic and biogeochemical consequences along the downstream flowpath of AAIW. The broad coherence of the observed Antarctic signal supports the concept of hemispheric thermal asynchrony on millennial timescales, and the extension of this climate signal into the intermediate ocean demonstrates that AAIW is extremely sensitive and responds rapidly to climate variability in its source region on a broad spectrum of timescales.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical observations suggest that the formation of hydrous phyllosilicate-bearing rocks such as serpentinites favor aseismic slip on the plate interface. I review our current understanding of deformation of serpentines and similar phyllosilicates in the first 100 km of subduction and discuss some pending questions on measurements and modeling of the behavior and properties of the complex serpentinite rocks. Experimental studies suggest that serpentines have low enough mechanical strength to act as a \"stabilizer\" of stable creep, but the actual strength of serpentinites will depend on the exact nature of the crystallographic structure and fabric of the stable serpentine variety. Low-temperature, flat-layered lizardite has strong anisotropy in strength. Lizardite-serpentinite strength will depend crystal-preferred orientation (CPO), with isotropic texture having high strength (>300 MPa) and foliated serpentinites having small strength (<100 MPa), independent of temperature, pressure, and strain rate. Thus, the transition between brittle and plastic (or stable creep) behavior may result from progressive deformation. High-temperature serpentine antigorite has a complex corrugated-layered structure, and complex deformation modes were evidenced from experimental studies. Mechanical strength shows a strong stress dependence, suggesting dislocation-creep, and low temperature dependence, suggesting plastic behavior. Extrapolation of experimental results to natural strain rates suggests that antigorite-serpentinites have low strength (<100 MPa or lower), and will favor stable-creep. However, the extrapolation relies on mechanical flow laws that may not apply to serpentine. Electron microscopy observations reveals dislocation-like deformation mechanisms that are not sufficient to explain global deformation of antigorite aggregates, and that are likely accompanied by dissolution-precipitation at low natural strain-rates. Establishing reliable flow laws relevant to the subduction interface in the 30-100 km depth range will require further experimental investigations of such mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The representation of convective processes, particularly deep convection in the tropics, remains a persistent problem in climate models. In fact structural biases in the distribution of tropical rainfall in the CMIP5 models is hardly different than that of the CMIP3 versions. Given that regional climate change at higher latitudes is sensitive to the configuration of tropical forcing, this persistent bias is a major issue for the credibility of climate change projections. In this study we use model output from integrations of the NASA Global Earth Observing System Five (GEOS5) climate modeling system to study the evolution of biases in the location and intensity of convective processes. We take advantage of a series of hindcast experiments done in support of the US North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) initiative. For these experiments a nine-month forecast using a coupled model configuration is made approximately every five days over the past 30 years. Each forecast is started with an updated analysis of the ocean, atmosphere and land states. For a given calendar month we have approximately 180 forecasts with daily means of various quantities. These forecasts can be averaged to essentially remove “weather scales” and highlight systematic errors as they evolve.\n Our primary question is to ask how the spatial structure of daily mean precipitation over the tropics evolves from the initial state and what physical processes are involved. Errors in parameterized convection, various water and energy fluxes and the divergent circulation are found to set up on fast time scales (order five days) compared to errors in the ocean, although SST changes can be non-negligible over that time. For the month of June the difference between forecast day five versus day zero precipitation looks quite similar to the difference between the June precipitation climatology and that from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). We focus much of our analysis on the influence of SST gradients, associated PBL baroclinicity enabled by turbulent mixing, the ensuing PBL moisture convergence, and how changes in these processes relate to convective precipitation bias growth over this short period.",

            "abstract": "Equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) are three-dimensional structures of depleted plasma density that are often observed in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere. They are initiated near the magnetic dip equator, in the bottomside of the F layer, and develop with time, upward in altitude and poleward in latitude (into both hemispheres), taking the form of longitudinally-narrow, vertically-extended wedges that penetrate deep into the topside of the F layer. Moreover, these structures drift zonally as they evolve in time. Much of what is not yet known about EPBs stems from our inability (1) to capture spatial descriptions of these structures, and (2) to monitor their evolution as a function of time. An objective of this presentation is to report the existence and availability of total electron content (TEC) data from densely-clustered networks of GPS receivers that are capable of providing time-continuous descriptions of EPBs with both high spatial resolution and broad geographical coverage. The networks include the Malaysia Real-Time Kinematics GNSS Network (MyRTKnet), Sumatera GPS Array (SUGAR) network and International GNSS Service (IGS) located in Southeast Asia (SEA). These networks contain 127 GPS receivers with average spacing of about 50 to 100 km. With the ability to resolve space-time ambiguities, we are able to follow the temporal evolution of EPB structures over an extended longitude sector (90 to 120 degrees, East longitude). We will present results from a case study (April 5, 2011) in which 16 EPBs were detected in longitude and tracked in time. We show, for the first time, that the births of 10 out of 16 observed EPBs coincided with the time of passage of the solar terminator across the longitude of birth. The distance between birth locations varied between 100 and 550 km with 10-minute interval. These EPBs were found to persist for 50 minutes to 7 hours, while drifting eastward at a speed of 92 to 150 ms-1. The finding that as many as 16 EPBs can be generated in a continuous sequence over 30 degree of longitude is new. The implications of these findings in terms of seeding and amplification will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The recent Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) White House Open Data Policies (2013) have required Federal agencies to establish formal catalogues of their science data holdings and make these data easily available on Web sites, portals, and applications. As an organization, the USGS has historically excelled at making its data holdings freely available on its various Web sites (i.e., National, Scientific Programs, or local Science Center). In response to these requirements, the USGS Core Science Analytics, Synthesis, and Libraries program, in collaboration with DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Mercury Consortium (funded by NASA, USGS, and DOE), and a number of other USGS organizations, established the Science Data Catalog (http://data.usgs.gov) cyberinfrastructure, content management processes/tools, and supporting policies. The USGS Science Data Catalog led the charge at USGS to improve the robustness of existing/future metadata collections; streamline and develop sustainable publishing to external aggregators (i.e., data.gov); and provide leadership to the U.S. Department of Interior in emerging Open Data policies, techniques, and systems.\nThe session will discuss the current successes, challenges, and movement toward meeting these Open Data policies for USGS scientific data holdings. A retrospective look at the last year of implementation of these efforts within USGS will occur to determine whether these Open Data Policies are improving data access or limiting data availability.\nTo learn more about the USGS Science Data Catalog, visit us at http://data.usgs.gov/info/about.html",

            "abstract": "Rosetta’s module Philae will soon land on 67P CG nucleus, giving unprecedented insight about a comet nucleus, its composition and interior. The CONSERT instrument is one of the 20 scientific instruments of the mission. It’s a bistatic two-modules radar, one on the orbiter, one on the lander. They generate EM waves that are transmitted through the nucleus. The signal is therefore delayed and attenuated by the nucleus materials and possible inhomogeneities. An accurate measurement and processing of these signals, repeated along the orbit, will allow us to perform a tomography, and for the first time, map the dielectric properties of a comet nucleus internal structures .\nOur approach for the resolution of this inverse problem is to use a custom built software called SIMSERT, which simulates the end-to-end experiment, using a ray-tracing algorithm. This tool is the key to prepare CONSERT operation and perform signal analysis. Given a comet shape and a landing site, we have conducted simulations to understand, quantify and get rid of the biases due to the discretization of the shape model.\nThe first inversion using the comet shape model given by OSIRIS and NavCam teams , will assume a propagation in an homogeneous medium. The first goal is to identify and correct artefacts due to the surface interface. The second goal is to evaluate the coherency of the different permittivity estimations given by inverting the latter model on the signal measured at different positions along the orbit. Then it is likely that, based on the first investigations, more sophisticated models (rubble pile, strata) and inversions will be required. A comparative approach between the simulated data and the CONSERT data, will lead to permittivity maps of the nucleus, that are coherent with the observation, with a certain probability. These maps, the first of this type, will provide unprecedented information about the internal structure, the accretion history and the nucleus time evolution.",

            "abstract": "Prelaunch polarization characterization indicates that the polarization sensitivity in bands M1-M4 of the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Joint Polar Satellite System–1 (JPSS-1, J1) is higher than the performance specifications. It is important to understand its impacts on the sensor data records (SDR) for reliable environment data records retrieval. This study focuses on assessments of the impacts of J1 VIIRS polarization sensitivity on bands M1-M4 SDRs, especially M1, (0.411μm) in which degree of linear polarization (DoLP) due to Rayleigh scattering and instrument polarization sensitivity are more profound than other bands. In this study, we adopts a MODIS polarization correction method proposed by Meister et al. (\n2005\n) for J1 VIIRS. Polarization impact (in percent) is defined as (Im-It)/It*100, where Im is J1 measured top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Itis the true TOA reflectance measured by an ideal instrument without polarization sensitivity. J1 VIIRS was assumed to have the same along track and along scan patterns and local equator crossing time as that of the Suomi NPP VIIRS. Clear-sky Stokes vectors for the Rayleigh component were simulated using the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vector Code, version 1 (6SV) for representative NPP VIIRS orbits over the Pacific Ocean. J1 VIIRS prelaunch polarization sensitivity data, including polarization amplitude and phase angle for each band, HAM-side, detector, and scan angle, were obtained from the NASA VIIRS Calibration Support Team.\nFigure 1 shows band M1 DoLP derived from 6SV simulated Stokes vectors for a NPP VIIRS orbit over the Pacific Ocean on April 17, 2014 and the impacts of J1 polarization sensitivity on TOA reflectance for the granule over the MOBY site. The impact on band M1 TOA reflectance can be as large as ~4% at the end of scans (western side of the bottom right image), where DoLP reaches ~70% and the J1 polarization amplitude is close to 6%. Moreover, large striping (~4%) can also be observed at the same region in the granule due to HAM-side and detector level polarization sensitivity differences. The method will be applied to bands M2-M4 and more representative granules over ocean.",

We find that at sites with statistically significant trends, 5th percentile ozone concentrations have generally increased by 0.5-1 ppb/year and 95th percentile ozone concentrations have generally decreased by 1-2 ppb/year. Both increasing and decreasing trends are observed in mid-range ozone (median and mean concentrations), with urban sites being more likely to show increasing trends and suburban/rural sites being more likely to show decreasing trends. Regional and seasonal differences in these trends are also explored. In general, these results indicate that as anthropogenic NOx emissions have decreased, the ozone distribution has been compressed, leading to less spatial and temporal variability in high and low percentile concentrations.",

            "abstract": "A national system of field inventory plots is the primary data source for the annual assessment of US forest carbon (C) stocks and stock-change to meet reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The inventory data and their role in national carbon reporting continue to evolve. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service is charged with conducting the field inventory of US forest C. The FIA program employs remotely sensed imagery to define forest and nonforest plots which are systematically distributed approximately every 2,428 ha across the conterminous US. More than 125,000 plots in the current field inventory have at least one forested condition where field crews measure tree- and site-level attributes (e.g., diameter and tree height) at regular temporal intervals. A subset of forested plots is measured for additional variables related to forest non-tree C pools (e.g., downed woody materials, understory vegetation, and soils). The FIA program does not directly measure forest C stocks. Instead, a combination of empirically derived C estimates (e.g., standing live and dead trees) and models (e.g., understory C stocks related to stand age and forest type) are used to estimate forest C stocks. A series of recent refinements in FIA estimation procedures have sought to reduce the uncertainty associated with the national C inventory by: 1) refining forest floor C estimates with in situ data, 2) updating the live belowground and understory C pools modeling approaches, 3) refining objective delineations between woodland and forest land uses, and 4) revising managed land delineations. The results of these studies in the context of forest C accounting and future refinements are discussed in the context of UNFCCC reporting.",

            "abstract": "The international space weather enterprise relies heavily on in situ plasma, particle and magnetic field measurements from U. S. weather satellites. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the launch of the first U. S. geostationary weather satellite (SMS-1), which carried the direct ancestor of the current GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) suite. The GOES space weather observations support the issuance of real-time alerts by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The publicly-available archive of space weather observations at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) includes NOAA geostationary observations since 1974 and POES/MetOp and Air Force DMSP polar-orbiting observations since 1978 and 1982, respectively. This archive supports the retrospective aspect of the space weather enterprise, which includes model development and anomaly resolution efforts. Over the last several years, NGDC has made a concerted effort to improve its data services in cooperation with the broader space weather community. These improvements include (1) taking over the processing of existing products, (2) creating science-quality versions of existing products, (3) developing new products, (4) improving the distribution of these products, and (5) validating products via on-orbit cross-comparisons. Complementing this retrospective role, NGDC is also responsible for the next-generation GOES-R space weather instrument science and is working as part of the GOES-R calibration/validation group to ensure that these new instruments and their products meet NOAA’s requirements. This presentation will survey NGDC’s efforts in each of these areas, including (1) POES/MetOp SEM-2 fluxes and radiation belt indices, (2) GOES fluxes with data quality flags and error bars, (3) in situ products from GOES-R(S,T,U), (4) cooperative distribution efforts with the NASA Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) and the Space Physics Environmental Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and (5) inter-calibrations of solar energetic proton fluxes and of magnetospheric electron fluxes.",

Mo is\npresent as a minor or a trace element in uranium ores under two main oxidation states: +IV\nand +VI. Mo has seven stable isotopes (92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 and 100). In natural systems,\nMo and Mo isotopes were shown to fractionate during redox reactions. Because Mo\nrepresents an impurity difficult to separate in the nuclear fuel cycle, it has the potential to be\nused as an indicator of the origins of uranium concentrates, in the framework of nuclear\nforensics.\nThis work focuses on developing an enhanced separation method for Mo from a\nuranium-rich matrix (uranium ore, uranium concentrate) in order to analyze the mass\nfractionation induced by processes typical of the nuclear fuel cycle. Purification of Mo for\nisotope ratio measurements is performed with a three-step separation on ion-exchange resins,\nwith yields between 45 and 82%. Matrix and isobaric interferences (Zr, Ru) were reduced in\ngeological and uranium standards, such as U/Mo ≤ 2*10-4, Zr/Mo ≤ 1*10-3, Ru/Mo ≤ 6*10-4\nand Fe/Mo ≤ 4*10-3. Mo isotopic compositions were measured on a Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS\nequipped with Jet cones, for a concentration of 30 ng/ml. The achieved sensitivity is\n~1200-1800 V/ppm with interferences below 10 mV and an overall reproducibility of 0.02 ‰\non the δ98Mo values. A double spike, with 97Mo and 100Mo, was added to the samples before\nthe purification. It allows for correction of the chemical and instrumental mass fractionations,\nwithout requiring a quantitative yield. For igneous rocks, δ98Mo values range between -0.55\nand -0.03 ‰, relative to the NIST-SRM 3134 molybdenum standard. Fractionation among\nuranium ore concentrates is higher, with δ98Mo ranging between 0.02 and -2.84 ‰.",

            "abstract": "The sizes and shapes of ice particles in tops of convective storms have a significant impact on their radiative properties. Ice crystal sizes and shapes likely vary with altitude, environmental conditions and convective strength, but these relationships are not well characterized. The rich dataset of the NASA SEAC4RS field campaign offers unique perspectives to further identify variations of ice crystal sizes and shapes and their relations to environmental and dynamical conditions. Here we focus on data acquired with the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), which was mounted on the high-altitude ER-2 aircraft during SEAC4RS. RSP’s unique multi-angular, multi-wavelength total and polarized reflectance measurements allow retrieval of ice effective radius, the aspect ratio of components of ice crystals, the crystal distortion level and ice asymmetry parameter, as well as cloud optical thickness and cloud top height. Using RSP data, as well as data from the eMAS and CPL sensors and in situ probes, we explore the statistical variation of ice properties retrieved during SEAC4RS in tops of convective systems. The data indicates that, in general, ice crystal populations consistent with plate-like components with aspect ratios near 0.4 are prevalent at cloud tops. The asymmetry parameter is around 0.76-0.8 and generally decreases with increasing cloud top height, mainly because the ice crystal distortion increases with height. Below about 12 km height, the effective radius decreases with increasing altitude, as previously shown for convective clouds using satellite data, but at higher levels the SEAC4RS data indicate a transition to effective radii increasing with cloud top height. Here we explore some possible explanations for this transition, related to its approximate coincidence with the level of minimum stability and the homogeneous freezing level, either of which could affect ice crystal formation and evolution. Additionally, we will demonstrate some of the variability in ice crystal size, shape and asymmetry parameter at different locations and atmospheric conditions observed during SEAC4RS.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrate bearing sands behave like sands once the hydrate has dissociated, but could exhibit a substantial increase in the shear strength, stiffness and dilatancy as the degree of hydrate saturation increases. A new critical state model was developed that incorporates the spatially mobilized plane (SMP) concept, which has been proven effective in modeling mechanical behavior of sands. While this new model was built on the basic constructs of the critical state model, important enhancements were introduced. The model adopted the t-stress concept, which defined the normal and shear stress on the SMP, in describing the plastic behavior of the soil. In this connection the versatile Matsuoka-Nakai yield criterion was also employed, which defined the general three dimensional yield behavior. The resulting constitutive law was associated in the t-stress space, but became non-associated in the conventional p-q stress space as it should be for sands. The model also introduced a generalized degree of hydrate saturation concept that was modified from the pioneering work of the Cambridge group. The model gives stress change when the sands are subjected to straining, and/or to hydrate saturation changes. The performance of the model has been found satisfactory using data from laboratory triaxial tests on reconstituted samples and core samples taken from Nankai Trough, Japan. The model has been implemented into FLAC3D. A coupling example with the multiphase flow code, TOUGH+, is presented which simulates the mechanical behavior of a sample when the surrounding temperature has been raised, and the hydrate undergoes state change and no longer resides in the stability zone.",

            "abstract": "Water, food and energy is three sacred treasures that are necessary for human beings. However, recent factors such as population growth and rapid increase in energy consumption have generated conflicting cases between water and energy. For example, there exist conflicts caused by enhanced energy use, such as between hydropower generation and riverine ecosystems and service water, between shale gas and ground water, between geothermal and hot spring water. This study aims to provide quantitative guidelines necessary for capacity building among various stakeholders to minimize water-energy conflicts in enhancing energy use. Among various kinds of renewable energy sources, we target baseload sources, especially focusing on renewable energy of which installation is required socially not only to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions but to stimulate local economy. Such renewable energy sources include micro/mini hydropower and geothermal. Three municipalities in Japan, Beppu City, Obama City and Otsuchi Town are selected as primary sites of this study. Based on the calculated potential supply and demand of micro/mini hydropower generation in Beppu City, for example, we estimate the electricity of tens through hundreds of households is covered by installing new micro/mini hydropower generation plants along each river. However, the result is based on the existing infrastructures such as roads and electric lines. This means that more potentials are expected if the local society chooses options that enhance the infrastructures to increase micro/mini hydropower generation plants. In addition, further capacity building in the local society is necessary. In Japan, for example, regulations by the river law and irrigation right restrict new entry by actors to the river. Possible influences to riverine ecosystems in installing new micro/mini hydropower generation plants should also be well taken into account. Deregulation of the existing laws relevant to rivers and further incentives for business owners of micro/mini hydropower generation along with current feed-in tariff are required if our society choose an option to enhance the renewable energy.",

            "abstract": "Improved characterization of aerosol absorption is a pressing need for improving estimates of climate forcing by aerosols. Measurements of aerosol absorption are difficult to make with the accuracy and precision demanded by climate science. While several different approaches have been employed and new techniques have emerged, none can yet be considered a true ‘gold standard’. Instruments that use filter-based methods have been the most widely used and are the basis of historic records. However, several studies using direct photoacoustic techniques have shown that filter-based measurements can be biased relative to these direct measurements. It has been demonstrated that this bias depends strongly on aerosol chemical composition, specifically concentration of organic mass. The wealth of information in the extensive set of historical filter-based data demands that this bias be diagnosed and corrected. A correction is critical for proper evaluation and development of chemical transport models, improved retrievals from remote sensing measurements, and integrating aerosol absorption surface and sub-orbital in situ measurements with knowledge gained from these other approaches.\nWe have performed an intercomparison of absorption coefficients from a photoacoustic and two filter-based instruments with co-located organic mass concentrations from continuous, half-hourly averaged measurements over six months at a remote, continental site in the US (ARM SGP). The results show a bias in the filter-based measurements with organic concentration that is consistent with previous studies. Previous results come from controlled lab studies or field campaigns where absorption coefficients and organic concentrations are high and may represent aerosol close to the source. The current study is important in that these quantities are much lower and the aerosol likely more aged, representing a larger portion of the global conditions, yet shows a similar bias. This site provides other measures of aerosol properties that are used to evaluate the results and provide an estimate of the error in radiative forcing that this bias would produce if indeed it were common across various aerosol regimes.",

            "abstract": "In November 2014 NASA will launch the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission carrying an L-band radiometer and radar sensor to observe surface soil moisture globally. This new type of instrument requires the development of innovative retrieval algorithms that are able to account for the different surface contributions to the satellite signal and at the same time can optimally exploit the synergy of active and passive microwave data. In this study, a neural network (NN) based retrieval algorithm has been developed using the example of active microwave observations from ASCAT and passive microwave observations from AMSR-E. In a first step, different preprocessing techniques, aiming to highlight the various contributions to the satellite signal, have been investigated. It was found that in particular for the passive microwave observations, the use of multiple frequencies and preprocessing steps could help the retrieval to disentangle the effects of soil moisture, vegetation and surface temperature. A spectral analysis investigated the temporal patterns in the satellite observations and thus assessed which soil moisture temporal variations could realistically be retrieved. The preprocessed data was then used in a NN based retrieval to estimate daily volumetric surface soil moisture at the global scale for the period 2002-2013. It could be shown that the synergy of data from the two sensors yielded a significant improvement of the retrieval performance demonstrating the benefit of multi-sensor approaches as proposed for SMAP. A comparison with a more traditional retrieval product merging approach furthermore showed that the NN technique is better able to exploit the complementarity of information provided by active and passive sensors. The soil moisture retrieval product was evaluated in the spatial, temporal and frequency domain against retrieved soil moisture from WACMOS and SMOS, modeled fields from ERA-interim/Land and in situ observations from the International Soil Moisture Network. In all cases, the NN soil moisture estimates showed a good ability to capture the spatial and temporal structures. Additionally, it could be shown that the NN technique yields model-compatible SM estimates and thus constitutes a useful tool for satellite data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "We present conservative and reactive transport experiments in a refraction index-matched, three-dimensional, water-saturated porous medium, using a pH indicator as the reactant to follow chemical reactions. The measurements were matched with a particle tracking (PT) modeling approach requiring a minimal set of fitting parameters. The magnitude of reaction during transport through the porous medium can be related to the color change of the pH indicator, via detailed high resolution image analysis, with sequential imaging of the flow cell. The setup yields measurements of the temporally evolving spatial (local) concentration field. The current experiments focused on point injection of a pH-sensitive reactive tracer into a macroscopically uniform flow field containing water at a pH different from that of the injected tracer. Parallel experiments employing a conservative tracer demonstrated the transport to be mildly non-Fickian. A PT model was then used to quantify the spatial and temporal migration of both the conservative and reactive tracer plumes. The PT simulations account for non-Fickian transport within a continuous time random walk framework; model parameters related to the non-Fickian transport were determined from the conservative tracer experiments. An additional term accounting for chemical reaction was established solely from analysis of the reactant concentrations, and significantly, no other fitting parameters were used to quantify the reactive transport experiment. The measurements and analysis emphasize the localized nature of transport and reaction, caused by small-scale concentration fluctuations. In particular, an \"extinction radius\" for pH-controlled reactive transport processes was defined, which delineates the region in which reactions occur rapidly. The small-scale preferential flows, their relation to the non-Fickian transport, and their influence on reaction dynamics in the system, were also identified.",

In the last decade or so we have been able to track CMEs in white light near the Sun by coronagraphs and through the inner heliosphere with wide-field viewing heliospheric imagers. Many Earth-directed CMEs have now been observed by solar and HI instruments and in some cases their signatures have been detected in situ at Earth/L1 by ACE or Wind and/or by one or both STEREO spacecraft. STEREO has a Space Weather Group which has used these Sun-to-STEREO/L1 data sets to make near-real time forecasts of CMEs using a variety of techniques. We discuss these results for several selected events. Recently, a new STEREO processing pipeline has been developed that removes background noise to allow improved tracking of CME structures from the Sun to 1 AU. We will discuss the tracking and modeling of CMEs and their internal structures such as magnetic clouds using these new data, and how such techniques can be used to improve space weather prediction.",

The R1 and R2 peaks of topaz shift at average rates of 0.30 nm/GPa and 0.22 nm/GPa, respectively, implying that the deformation of the Cr3+ octahedra increases with pressure. Three peaks are fit under each R line of topaz at both room and high pressure, and these peaks are associated with different Al sites into which the Cr substitutes. The shift of the R lines in topaz under pressure is remarkably linear, which appears to be a general feature of many Cr3+-bearing oxides: the underlying cause of this linearity may lie in anharmonic coupling with lattice vibrations. In this context, we also characterize the frequency shifts of two vibronic peaks within topaz. The R1 and R2 peaks of kyanite shift at 0.37 nm/GPa and 0.88 nm/GPa respectively. Two peaks are fit under R1 and three peaks are fit under R2 of kyanite at both room and high pressure; this result is also consistent with three different Cr3+ sites in this material. The R lines in kyanite are notably optically anisotropic, depending strongly on crystallographic orientation: this is most strongly manifested in the R2 peak. The Cr3+ luminescence in these materials provides a sensitive probe of pressure-dependent shifts in the local geometry of the Al-sites in these materials, which are analyzed in the context of previous single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements.",

            "abstract": "The mineral composition, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and the rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in methane-derived authigenic carbonates collected from the Gulf of Cadiz were used to trace fluid sources and provide information on the associated biogeochemical processes during their formation. These samples are composed by a detrital fraction (mainly composed by quartz and clays) cemented by authigenic carbonates: aragonite and Mg-calcite, pure Mg-calcite, or dolomite and Mg-calcite. The δ13C values of the samples vary between -45.78‰ and -9.72‰ VPDB and δ18O values range from 3.67‰ to 6.92‰ VPDB. The δ13C composition is indicative of the methane-derived (probably from thermogenic gas or a mixed of thermogenic and biogenic gas) source of these carbonates. The total REE content (ΣREE) of these seep carbonates range from 13 to 31 ppm and average ΣREE values of 21 ppm, with most of samples lower than the typical marine carbonate value of ~28 ppm. This result suggests that the REE composition of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates is controlled primarily by the migrated methane-rich fluids from which they have precipitated. The results that the REE enrichment of the samples containing dolomite and Mg-calcite minerals is higher than samples with aragonite also suggest that the authigenic mineral composition and the formation setting are important factors on the REE concentration. The shale-normalized REE patterns of the seep carbonates show no abnormality or slight positive Ce anomalies, suggesting that the formation of these seep carbonates occurs in anoxic condition. The correlation results of Ce/Ce* and LaN/SmN, Ce/Ce* and DyN/SmN, Ce/Ce* and ΣREE have also suggested that the REE characteristics of most seep carbonate samples preserve the original redox conditions of their formation and that late diagenesis has little effect on the REE. Therefore, it is feasible to assume that these methane-derived authigenic carbonates represent primary carbonate phases and that they have not undergo significant diagenesis and that their geochemical and isotopic signatures reflect mainly their formation processes.",

            "abstract": "Normal activity at Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy) can be broadly divided into (1) puffing, where small amounts of gas are emitted without pyroclasts at a rate of ~1 per second; and (2) \"normal\" explosions, where gas and pyroclast mixtures are expelled up to several hundred meters high (at rates of 1-10 events per hour).\nIn May 2014, we monitored Stromboli's active vents with high speed visible-light and thermal infrared cameras. At vents in the SW, central and NE craters, puffing was clearly visible, emitting hot gas plumes lasting less than 0.2 s and sometimes spaced by less than 0.1 s, causing frequent event overlap. The initial ascent velocity of the gas was ~10 m/s, typical of a jet phase produced by burst of a slightly overpressurized bubble. The variability of the emission point within a vent suggested that these bubbles were smaller than the vent radius. The size of individual puffs estimated from the radiant energy of the plume was variable, but limited by an upper bound depending on the vent characteristics.\nMeanwhile, \"normal\" explosions occurred at intervals of a few minutes. The high ejection velocity of the pyroclasts (up to 400 m/s) and the duration of the explosions (5-30 s) suggested that explosions came from large and highly pressurized slugs arriving at the \"free surface\".\nExplosion onsets were well defined by the emission of the first, fast, pyroclasts. However, in most cases, precursory gas was recorded up to 10 s before pyroclast release. The absence of pyroclasts and the initial ascent velocity of gas indicated that these emissions corresponded to puffing-like activity. On the other hand, their size were greater than regular puffs (sometimes by more than one order of magnitude) and frequently increased with time. This suggested that these precursory puffs were strongly influenced by the rising slug about to burst.\nSimilarly, after the last pyroclast ejection, large and low-velocity gas release events were occasionally observed, and interpreted as a coda due to the magma disturbance generated by the explosion. Precursors and coda can be used to estimate the changes in the pressure field produced by the rise and burst of slugs.",

Satellite studies show strong seasonality of aerosol optical depth (AOD) peaking in summer and collocated with biogenic emissions, suggesting strong organic aerosol (OA) influence. In contrast, surface station measurements show a weaker seasonal cycle, primarily driven by sulfate. Previous studies have attempted to reconcile this apparent disconnect between the satellite and surface data by hypothesizing various sources of aerosol aloft. Here we interpret data from the SEAC4RS aircraft campaign in 2013, together with EPA AQS surface station measurements and MODIS and AERONET AOD, in a high-resolution version of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) with detailed ozone-aerosol chemistry. We use the aircraft observations to examine the consistency between the satellite and surface aerosol data. We quantify the contributions of anthropogenic, biogenic, and open fire sources to the different aerosol species, and examine relationships between species and their precursors as constraints on emissions and chemistry. This provides new insights on the factors that control aerosol concentrations, seasonality, and long-term trends in the Southeast US.",

            "abstract": "Redox-sensitive major and trace elements in iron formations and black shales have been developed as proxies to reconstruct paleoenvironmental history in deep time [1, 2]. Many Proterozoic successions, however, contain abundant limestone and dolomite, and so carbonate-based redox proxies could help greatly to expand the paleoredox record in time and space. Most paleoenvironmental research on sedimentary rocks focuses on individual stratigraphic successions; here, however, we adopt a complementary strategy, analyzing a large suite of Mesozoic, Paleozoic, and Precambrian samples that enables us to make global statistical statements about elemental abundances through time. Here we explore the use of Zn/Fe ratios as proxies to trace the evolution of redox profiles in marine basins, based on analysis of major and trace element concentrations in micro-drilled carbonate rocks that are well characterized in terms of stratigraphy, environmental setting, and petrology.\nConsistent with previous studies, we observed a two step increase of mean Zn/Fe ratios in carbonates through Earth history: at the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event and during the later Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event. Diagenetic alteration is always an issue for carbonate rocks, and so we carefully screened these carbonates for possible late diagenetic effects and hydrothermal alteration. Individual samples may still bear a trace element signature of early diagenesis, but our statistical approach indicates that despite diagenetic issues, meaningful trends can be discerned in the data. It is unlikely that changes in depositional environment, secular evolution of the mantle, and/or directional change in continental inputs greatly influenced the observed trace element behavior. Therefore, Zn/Fe ratios in shallow marine carbonates have the potential to provide a useful tracer for the redox evolution of the oceans and the rise of atmospheric O2.\n",

We are working with stakeholders from the El Salvador Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN); National University of Costa Rica (UNA); the Costa Rica Ministry of the Environment, Energy, and Telecommunications (MINAET); and Costa Rica National Meteorological Institute (IMN), who are leaders in air quality monitoring and management in the Mesoamerica region. Focusing initially on these institutions will build sustainability in regional modeling activities by developing air quality modeling capability that can be shared with other countries in Mesoamerica. The air quality models are based on the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and incorporate meteorological inputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, as well as national emissions inventories from El Salvador and Costa Rica. The models are being optimized for urban air quality, which is a priority of decision-makers in Mesoamerica. Once experimental versions of the modeling systems are complete, they will be transitioned to servers run by stakeholders in El Salvador and Costa Rica. The numerical air quality models will provide decision support for stakeholders to identify 1) high-priority areas for expanding national ambient air monitoring networks, 2) needed revisions to national air quality regulations, and 3) gaps in national emissions inventories. This project illustrates SERVIR’s goal of the transition of science to support decision-making through capacity building in Mesoamerica, and it aligns with the Group on Earth Observations’ health societal benefit theme. This presentation will describe technical aspects of the development of the models and outline key steps in our successful collaboration with the Mesoamerican stakeholders, including the processes of identifying and engaging decision-makers, understanding their requirements and limitations, communicating status updates on a regular basis, and providing sufficient training for end users to be able to utilize the models in a decision-making context.",

A readvance in the Weddell Sea region can reconcile two outstanding problems: (i) the present-day widespread occurrence of seemingly stable ice streams grounded on beds that deepen inland; and (ii) the inability of models of glacial isostatic adjustment to match present-day uplift rates. By combining a suite of ice loading histories that include a readvance with a model of glacial isostatic adjustment we report substantial improvements to predictions of present-day uplift rates, reconciling problematic observations of land sinking. We suggest retreat behind present grounding lines occurred when the bed was lower, and isostatic recovery has since led to shallowing, ice sheet re-grounding and readvance. Some sections of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be advancing unstably.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological model performance is usually not as acceptable as expected due to limited measurements and imperfect parameterization which is attributable to the uncertainties from model parameters and model structures. In applications, a general assumption is hold that model parameters are constant in a stationary condition during the simulation period, and the parameters are generally prescribed though calibration with observed data. In reality, but the model parameters related to the physical or conceptual characteristics of a catchment will travel in nonstationary conditions in response to climate transition and land use alteration. The travels or changes of parameters are especially evident for long-term hydrological simulations. Therefore, the assumption of using constant parameters under nonstationary condition is inappropriate, and it will deliver errors from the parameters to the outputs during the simulation and prediction. Even though a few of studies have acknowledged the parameter travel or change, little attention has been paid on the estimation of changing parameters.\nIn this study, we employ an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) based method to trace parameter changes in real time. Through synthetic experiments, the capability of the EnKF-based is demonstrated by assimilating runoff observations into a rainfall-runoff model, i.e., the Xinanjing Model. In addition to the stationary condition, three typical nonstationary conditions are considered, i.e., the leap, linear and Ω-shaped transitions. To examine the robustness of the method, different errors from rainfall input, modelling and observations are investigated. The shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm is applied under the same conditions to make a comparison.\nThe results show that the EnKF-based method is capable of capturing the general pattern of the parameter travels even for high levels of uncertainties. It provides better estimates than the SCE-UA method does by taking advantages of real-time tracing and accounting for various sources of uncertainties in hydrologic simulations. Therefore, the EnKF-based method is suitable for hydrological modelling in a changing environment.\nKeywords: Parameter estimation; Nonstationary condition; Xinanjiang model; ensemble Kalman filter, data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "We report the results of simple laboratory experiments aimed at mimicking the generation, migration, and expulsion process of oil or gas from soft clayey sediments, triggered by thermal decomposition of organic matter. In previously published work, we showed that the injection of fluids into a soft sediment layer confined within a quasi-2D Hele-Shaw cell led to the transition from a viscous fingering invasion regime to a viscoelastic fracturing regime. The transition is controlled by the ratio of the characteristic times for the invasion process and for the structural relaxation in the sediment, respectively (Deborah number). Here we show that expulsion is a discontinuous quasi-periodic process, driven by the elastic energy stored in the embedding layers.\nWe report also about two sets of experiments aimed at understanding the conditions in which fluid generation from multiple sources can generate a highly connected network of fractures for expulsion. In a first set of experiments, a Hele-Shaw cell with multiple injection points and multiple outlets was used. It is shown that, due to attractive elastic interactions between cracks, a network spontaneously forms as soon as invasion proceeds in the viscoelastic regime. On the contrary, no network of migration paths is forming in the viscous fingering regime, due to the effective repulsion of the fluid channels.\nIn the second set of analog experiments, we used a thermostated mini-Hele-Shaw cell, the gap of which was filled with a strong clay mud in which microcrystals of reactive organic matter (azoisobutyronitrile, AIBN) are dispersed, or with a mud prepared with clay particles on which the organic matter was pre-impregnated. AIBN decomposes around 70°C, releasing nitrogen gas. It was again observed that, depending on the viscoelastic properties of the clay matrix, gas evolution occurs either by formation and coalescence of bubbles, or by formation of a percolating network of fractures. The length of the fracture network is initially linearly related to the Total (reactive) Organic Matter content. The expulsion process is remarkably effective in the fracturing regime (close to 100 percent), even at vey low TOC (below 0.5 percent). The relevance of these experiments for oil and gas migration in natural conditions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific / North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern is a prominent low frequency mode of variability in the Northern Hemisphere that is most pronounced in the boreal winter. However, the PNA can exert significant daily to weekly variability and influence weather patterns over the Midwest during the spring and summer months. In this study, we use the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis to demonstrate the link between the PNA teleconnection pattern and the Great Plains Low-Level Jet (GPLLJ). The negative phase of the PNA, which is associated with lower heights over the Great Plains and ridging in the Southeast U.S., enhances the GPLLJ by increasing the pressure gradient within the GPLLJ on daily to monthly timescales. We show that strong GPLLJ events predominantly occur when the PNA index is negative. Strong GPLLJ events with a very negative PNA index (< -1) are associated with longer wavelength planetary waves that are more persistent and increase the duration of GPLLJ events. As a result, strong GPLLJ events associated with a very negative PNA index contribute to a greater number of heavy precipitation events over the North Central U.S. by enhancing the meridional transport of moisture into the Upper Midwest and driving greater moisture convergence north of the GPLLJ maximum over extended periods. A significant majority of the greatest 5-day North Central precipitation events in the Climate Prediction Center Daily Precipitation dataset occur when the PNA index is negative, with most strong precipitation events having a very negative PNA. The PNA is typically the most negative 1-4 days in advance of heavy precipitation events. This finding may help improve short- to medium-range predictability of Upper Midwest heavy rainfall events.",

We analyze and compare the horizontal and vertical distribution of dissolved methane within these lakes during different time periods: the stratified period in summer, the autumn overturn, the winter mixing period, and the period from spring to summer stratification. The horizontal distributions of dissolved methane within the lakes suggest that the relation between surface area and maximum water-depth is a key factor determining the heterogeneity of methane concentrations in the surface water. During most of the year littoral zones are the main source of the methane that is emitted to the atmosphere except for the overturn periods. The vertical distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen within the different seasons affect the vertical distribution of dissolved methane and thus the methane budget within lakes. Anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the intense mixing during overturn periods are key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes.",

            "abstract": "Flux of groundwater to surface water is often of great interest for the determination of the groundwater dependency of ecosystem services, such as maintenance of wetlands and of baseflow as a contributor to stream channel storage. It is difficult to measure. Most methods are based on coarse mass balance estimates or seepage meters. One drawback of these methods is they are not entirely spatially explicit. The exit gradient is commonly used in engineering studies of hydraulic structures affected by groundwater flow. It can be simply defined in the groundwater modeling context as the ratio of the difference between the computed head and the land surface elevation, for each computational cell, to the thickness of the cell, as it varies in space. When combined with calibrated groundwater flow models, it also has the potential to be useful in watershed scale evaluations of groundwater dependency in a spatially explicit way. We have taken advantage of calibrated models for the Calapooia watershed, Oregon, to map exit gradients for the watershed. Streams in the Calapooia are hydraulically well connected with groundwater. Not surprisingly, we found large variations in exit gradients between wet and dry season model runs, supporting the notion of stream expansion, as observed in the field, which may have a substantial influence on water quality. We have mapped the exit gradients in the wet and dry seasons, and compared them to regions which have been mapped in wetland surveys. Those classified as Palustrine types fell largest in the area of contribution from groundwater. In many cases, substantially high exit gradients, even on average, did not correspond to mapped wetland areas, yet nutrient retention ecosystem services may still be playing a role in these areas. The results also reinforce the notion of the importance of baseflow to maintenance of stream flow, even in the dry summer season in this Temperate/Mediterranean climate. Exit gradient mapping is a simple, yet potentially very useful and underutilized tool for measuring groundwater dependency in watershed scale ecosystem services studies, and could potentially be used to predict effects due to groundwater stresses resulting from water withdrawals.\nThis is an abstract of a proposed presentation and does not necessarily reflect EPA policy.",

            "abstract": "Crystallization has been one of the most important topics in a wide array of fields because of its importance to biology, atmospheric science, material science, etc. Unlike vapor-liquid nucleation, crystallization has an added level of complexity because the nucleation process can form anything from a perfectly ordered single crystal to an amorphous solid. \nWhen a nucleating cluster consists of a few dozen molecules, a large majority of the particles are exposed on the surface of the cluster unlike in the bulk phase where the majority of the particles are contained within the interior. As a consequence a cluster must attempt to minimize the surface area while simultaneously maximizing the intermolecular interactions within the cluster in order to maintain stability. The ideal bulk phase configuration is often less stable due to these factors and will not form directly from the gas/liquid phase. Instead the clusters can adopt many non-crystalline structures due to their incredibly high stability at these small cluster sizes. Once these non-crystalline clusters aggregate enough molecules they can attempt to transition from the non-crystalline structure into an ordered crystalline structure; however, if there is a sizable free energy barrier for this crystalline transition the cluster can become trapped in these states and subsequently the formation of an ordered crystal will be unfeasible. This of course can yield physical properties that are significantly different from that of the bulk.\nThis talk will discuss the simulational study of the underlying nucleation mechanics and their role in the formation of atmospheric ice. The focus will be on the formation of energy traps at small cluster sizes and how these traps are avoided by reducing the conformational degrees of freedom.",

            "abstract": "Sap flow sensors are common to assess the contribution of tree transpiration to ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET). Thermal dissipation (TD) is one of the most popular methods for sap measurements but the insertion of TD probes in the tree stems imply wounding of the wood tissue and a consequent alteration of the sap flow. But the determination of sap flux density (SFD) is based on an empirical function developed for freshly drilled holes and it does hence not account for the wound effect.\n Here we investigate the effect of wound healing on sap flow measurements with TD probes. Our objectives were (1) the establishment of correction factors to account for the wound effect and (2) the determination of the point in time after installation when the correction factors become applicable. For that we performed an experiment in which TD probes were installed successively in diffuse- and ring-porous trees (Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, resp.) during the growing season. The trees were logged in fall and additional sensors were installed afterwards in the logged stems. SFDs measured by the different TD sensors were compared with gravimetric estimates in the laboratory.\n Gravimetric flow compared well with SFD estimates from freshly installed sensors without wound formation, with only a slight underestimation by the TDs. In contrast, older sensors, submitted to wound reactions, underestimated SFD by up to 40%. However, sensors with 5, 11 and 22 week old wounds showed no significant differences, which implies that wound healing occurs in the first weeks after scission. Similar sap flow underestimations due to wound effects were observed in both species, oak and beech.\n This study highlights the relevance of accounting for tree wound reactions for accurate estimation of tree transpiration based on thermal dissipation sensors. We provide a correction factor for the classical Granier TD sensors that can be used from the first weeks after installation in similar species. This enables more accurate estimation of tree transpiration at the stand level and eliminates confounding effects with tree responses due to changing environmental conditions over the season.",

            "abstract": "Sierra Nevada snowpack provides over 60 percent of California’s freshwater supplies. The drought of 2014 has been unprecedented in the state’s history, and followed below-average precipitation for the hydrologic years 2012 and 2013. Record-low precipitation has resulted in minimal Sierra Nevada snow pack and runoff, and massive reductions in reservoir storage, which has triggered widespread drought adaptation measures for one of the world’s largest economies. We assessed the impacts of the 2014 drought on vegetation processes in the headwaters of the Owens River, which is one of the main watersheds for the city of Los Angeles. We monitored water relations, photosynthesis, growth and Leaf Area Index of tree, shrub, herb, and grass species. In order to better understand the effects of drought, we examined responses to watering manipulations, long-term snow fences, elevation gradient analysis, and comparisons to previous wetter years. 1 April 2014 snow pack depth was 330 mm (average for 1928 – 2012 = 1344 mm, CV = 49%). Despite widespread mortality of Pinus jeffreyi saplings (mean 1.5 m tall) at 2300 m, older trees as well as saplings of Pinus contorta showed new growth. There were no significant differences in water potential (Ψ) for the two conifer species in a wet year (2006, 1 April snow depth = 2240 mm) vs. 2014. Water potential for P. contorta in 2014 was higher at 2900 m than at 2300 m but photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (gs), were not different. By contrast, Ψ, A, gs, Vcmax and Jmax for the widespread shrub Artemisia tridentata increased along a gradient from 2100 m to 2900 m in 2014. Watering only significantly increased these photosynthetic parameters at the lowest, driest elevation. At the middle elevation, Leaf Area Index in 2014 was about 20% of the 2006 value for the N-fixing shrub Purshia tridentata. Results show reductions in photosynthesis and growth for some species but not others in response to the severe drought conditions of 2014. The ability to tolerate drought may be due to utilization of deep water for some species, or an ability to survive and grow on very little precipitation for other species. Incorporation of functional group survival, photosynthesis and growth responses to severe, ongoing drought stress should help to improve global models of carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "To gain a better understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall over the Churchill River basin, this study was undertaken. The research incorporates gridded precipitation data from the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) system. CaPA has been developed by Environment Canada and provides near real-time precipitation estimates on a 10 km by 10 km grid over North America at a temporal resolution of 6 hours. The spatial fields are generated by combining forecasts from the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model with precipitation observations from the network of synoptic weather stations. CaPA’s skill is highly influenced by the number of weather stations in the region of interest as well as by the quality of the observations. In an attempt to evaluate the performance of CaPA as a function of the density of the weather station network, a dual-stage design algorithm to simulate CaPA is proposed which incorporates generated weather fields. More specifically, we are adopting a controlled design algorithm which is generally known as Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The advantage of using the experiment is that one can define reference precipitation fields assumed to represent the true state of rainfall over the region of interest. In the first stage of the defined OSSE, a coupled stochastic model of precipitation and temperature gridded fields is calibrated and validated. The performance of the generator is then validated by comparing model statistics with observed statistics and by using the generated samples as input to the WATFLOOD™ hydrologic model. In the second stage of the experiment, in order to account for the systematic error of station observations and GEM fields, representative errors are to be added to the reference field using by-products of CaPA's variographic analysis. These by-products explain the variance of station observations and background errors.",

            "abstract": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT; hmt.noaa.gov) conducts research on the meteorological and microphysical processes contributing to orographically enhanced precipitation. Some of HMT’s precipitation research has been focused on a shallow rainfall process driven by collision-coalescence that often is undetected by the National Weather Service’s operational scanning radar network, especially in the Western U.S., but that can produce rain rates that are capable of creating floods. Originally it was believed that this shallow rainfall process would occur more prevalently over the coastal mountain ranges than over the Sierra Nevada, since the higher mountains of the Sierra would force deeper atmospheric ascent and produce deeper precipitating cloud systems that extend well above the melting level. This notion was disproved when it was recently discovered that a site in the northern Sierra had nearly as large of a contribution to seasonal rainfall from this shallow rainfall process, on average, as did a habitually wet site in the coast range of Sonoma County north of San Francisco. This work examines this apparent paradox using observations collected during HMT and CalWater field campaigns. In particular, a case study from CalWater is used to highlight the interaction between a landfalling atmospheric river (AR) and the Sierra Barrier Jet (SBJ). The gap in coastal terrain associated with the San Francisco Bay area is shown to allow unprocessed, moisture-enhanced flow in the AR to reach the northern Sierra site, where the SBJ provides a lifting mechanism to create enhanced orographic precipitation as compared to a site in the southern Sierra, where AR-associated dynamics are weaker and AR flow is modified by upstream coastal terrain.",

            "abstract": "To assess historical loads of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and suspended sediment (SS) from the non-tidal Chesapeake Bay watershed (NTCBW), we have analyzed long-term seasonal trends of flow-normalized loads at the fall-line of nine major tributaries that account for over 90% of NTCBW streamflow. Seasonal comparisons revealed that (1) nutrient and sediment loads have been generally highest in Jan-Mar and lowest in Jul-Sep, and (2) decadal-scale trends have generally followed similar patterns in all seasons, with some important exceptions. Generally, total N load from NTCBW has dropped since the late 1980s, but particulate nutrients and SS have risen since the mid-1990s. The majority of this rise was from the Susquehanna River and relates to diminished trapping of SS during extreme events at Conowingo Reservoir. Substantial rising trends in SS were also observed, however, in the other rivers. Moreover, the summed magnitudes of rise in particulate P loading in other tributaries are of similar magnitude as those for the Susquehanna. Dissolved nutrient loadings have dropped in the upland (Piedmont-and-above) rivers, but dissolved nutrients loadings have risen in two small rivers that are within the Coastal Plain and affected by lagged groundwater input. These two rivers may be most representative of Coastal Plain watersheds that feed some major tidally influenced regions that are not otherwise accounted by this study. Finally, analysis of fractional contributions revealed that the seven upland rivers yielded surprisingly steady fractions of N, suggesting consistency of N input and N-modulation across the watershed. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of integrated and comparative evaluations of historical data and highlights the importance of maintaining long-term water-quality monitoring at multiple watershed locations.",

This combination provides students with a multi-faceted background in climate education. The combination of GLOBE(Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) and NASA provide students with a multi-faceted experience into climate data and education, explicitly connecting NGSS with big data using GLOBE protocols as a mainstay curriculum component. GLOBE, created by the NSF, NASA, NOAA and the U.S. State Department, engages students through environmental data collection and connects them to scientists, and other schools around the world. GLOBE visualizations introduce the concepts of data presentation to capitalize on our natural pattern recognition abilities. The MY NASA DATA project extends students’ data collection experiences into the realm of big data and remote sensing, providing curated, interactive animations targeting grades K–12. Correlating GLOBE data to NASA data validates remote sensing concepts. We present a learning progression from graphing of local data, expanding through the mesoscale and global scale. Students are challenged to identify gaps in the GLOBE database, create models to fill the gaps, and to validate their models using NASA data.",

            "abstract": "The global water cycle is exhibiting dramatic changes as global temperatures increase resulting in increases in: drought extremes, flooding, alterations in storm track patterns with protracted winter storms, and greater precipitation variability. The mechanisms driving these changes can be difficult to assess, but the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation water isotopes (δ18O, δ2H, d-excess) provide a means to help understand these water cycle changes. However, extended temporal records of isotope ratios in precipitation are infrequent, especially in the US.\nIn our study we analyzed precipitation isotope ratio data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire that has the longest US precipitation isotope record, to determine: 1) the monthly composited averages and trends from 1967 to 2012 (45 years); ; 2) the relationships between abiotic properties such as local temperatures, precipitation type, storm tracks and isotope ratio changes; and 3) the influence of regional shifts in moisture sources and/or changes in N Atlantic Ocean water conditions on isotope values. The seasonal variability of Hubbard Brook precipitation isotope ratios is consistent with other studies, as average δ18O values are ~ -15‰ in January and ~ -5 ‰ in July. However, over the 45 year record there is a depletion trend in the δ 18O values (becoming isotopically lighter with a greater proportion of 16O), which coupled with less change in δ 2H leads to increases in d-excess values from ~ -10‰ around 1970 to greater than 10‰ in 2009. These changes occurred during a period of warming as opposed to cooling local temperatures indicating other processes besides temperature are controlling long-term water isotope traits in this region. We have evidence that these changes in precipitation isotope traits are controlled in large part by an increases in moisture being sourced from a warming N Atlantic Ocean that is providing evaporated, isotopically-depleted precipitation to the region. Thus, the warming of the N Atlantic Ocean appears to influence the climate and the precipitation isotopes of Northeastern coastal regions and could be a larger water source to watersheds in this North American region.",

            "abstract": "The seismic sequence that struck the Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna in May 2012 consisted of seven main events of magnitude greater than 5 followed by numerous aftershocks. The strongest earthquakes occurred on May 20 (M=5.9) and May 29 (M=5.8) near the border between Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna. The epicenters of the main events are aligned in east-west direction in a segment of approx. 50 km just south of the Po river. The area was considered a low to medium seismicity: the seismic hazard in the epicentral area, and in the whole damaged area, was estimated to be less than 0.15 g PGA for 10% exceedance in 50 years.\nSignificant damage occurred over an area greater than 1000 km2, which is extremely large for earthquakes of magnitude less than 6, bearing in mind the low vulnerability level of the structures. As seen in detailed geological investigations the degree of damage and its areal extent is largely attributable to the particular conditions of the soil. We focus on the relationship between damage and soil conditions in the area of Oltrepò Mantovano, situated between the Po River and the epicentral area. The soil is largely composed of Quaternary deposits of sands, silty-clay and clay with a very deep bedrock (greater than 100 m) and Vs30 generally less than 500 m/s. According to the cards Aedes (official forms of the Italian Government to assess the state of damage of buildings) houses declared uninhabitable because of the earthquake were mainly concentrated in a few small towns: Moglia, Gonzaga, Quistello and San Giacomo delle Segnate (located approximately at 20 km, 27 km, 20 km and 14 km from the epicenters of the two main shocks, respectively) which reported 73% of the total of all uninhabitable buildings; Moglia 27 %, Gonzaga 14%, Quistello 20% and San Giacomo delle Segnate 12%. The hydrographic system has evolved considerably since the Middle Bronze Age with the result that the area is characterized by a complex geomorphology with the presence of fluvial paleochannels, fluvial ridges and abandoned river channels where numerous cases of soil liquefaction have been observed. The May 2012 earthquake has highlighted a close relationship between the sites where the damage was concentrated and the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the area.",

            "abstract": "Forests play a critical role in the atmosphere’s oxidation chemistry because of their broad global extent and their prodigious emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). The high hydroxyl (OH) reactivity of these BVOCs causes much of the initial chemistry to occur near the forest. Some OH measurements in forests are much greater than calculated with models, leading to close examination of the BVOC oxidation mechanisms and the possibility of significant OH recycling. The 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) provides a rigorous test of the BVOC oxidation mechanisms and OH recycling with its extensive measurement suite that was positioned in an Alabama forest for six weeks. OH measurements made with the Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) are compared to photochemical box models constrained with other simultaneous measurements in order to test the understanding of this forest photochemistry. In this work, we use a global sensitivity analysis (Random Sampling – High Dimensional Model Representation) to examine the sensitivity of the differences between the modeled and measured OH to the model mechanism and inputs. In this presentation, we will discuss the model reactions and inputs that have the most influence on the modeled OH and its difference with measured OH and will provide recommendations for reducing model and measurement uncertainty.",

In this work, we investigate several in situ remediation techniques for the removal of tar from porous media. Batch and column experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of mobilization, solubilization, and chemical oxidation remediation approaches. Alkaline (NaOH), surfactant (Triton X-100), and polymer (xanthan gum) agents were used in various combinations to reduce tar-water interfacial tension, increase flushing solution viscosity, and increase the solubilities of tar components. Base-activated sodium persulfate was used alone and in combination with surfactant to chemically oxidized tar components. The effectiveness of each method was assessed in terms of both removal of PAHs from the system and reduction of dissolved-phase effluent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations. In column studies, alkaline-polymer (AP) and alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) solutions efficiently mobilized 81-93% and 95-96% of residual PAHs, respectively, within two pore volumes. The impact of AP flushing on dissolved-phase PAH concentrations was relatively low; however, the concentrations of several low molar mass PAHs were significantly reduced after ASP flushing. Surfactant-polymer (SP) solutions removed over 99% of residual PAHs through a combination of mobilization and solubilization, and reduced the post-remediation, dissolved-phase total PAH concentration by 98.4-99.1%. Degradation of residual PAHs by base-activated sodium persulfate was relatively low (30-50%), and had little impact on dissolved-phase PAH concentrations.",

The aim was to study the processes that influence the Tropical Tropopause layer (TTL), the major route for troposphere to stratosphere transport. The field campaign was based mainly in Guam (13.5oN, 144.8oE) and had three components: the ATTREX project organized by NASA and based around the Global Hawk; the NCAR-led CONTRAST campaign based around the Gulfstream V (HIAPER) aircraft; and CAST with the NERC FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft. Together, the three aircraft were able to make detailed measurements of atmospheric structure and composition from the ocean surface to 20 km. The BAe-146 made a total of 25 flights between 1 oS-14 oN and 130 – 155 oE. The 146 was used to sample at low altitudes (below 8 km) with much of the time spent in or close to the marine boundary layer. This strategy meant that the region of main inflow into the strong convection was sampled thoroughly. Concentrations of the following chemicals were measured in situ: CO, O3, NO2, NO, CO2, CH4, N2O, H2O, a range of halocarbons including CH2Br2, CHBr3 and CH3I; and reactive halogen species including BrO, BrCl, HOBr and IO. The CAST team also made ground-based measurements at the ARM site on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea during February 2014. Ozonesondes were deployed daily, and measurements of ozone, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O and halocarbons were made at the ground. Halocarbon measurements were also made at other West Pacific sites.",

            "abstract": "Continents on Earth periodically assemble to form supercontinents, and then break up again into smaller continental blocks (the Wilson Cycle). Highly developed but realistic numerical models cannot resolve if continents respond passively to mantle convection or whether they modulate flow. Our simplified numerical model addresses this problem: A thermally insulating continent floats on a stress-free surface for infinite Prandtl number cellular convection with constant material properties in a chamber 8 times longer than its depth. The continent moves back and forth across the chamber driven by a “continental drift convection cell” of a form not previously described. Subduction exists at the upstream end with cold slabs dipping at an angle beneath the moving continent. Fluid moves with the continent in the upper region of this cell with return flow near the bottom. Many continent/subduction regions on Earth have these features. The drifting cell enhances vertical heat transport by approximately 30% compared to a fixed continent, especially at the core-mantle boundary, and significantly decreases lateral mantle temperature differences. However, continent drift or fixity has smaller effects on profiles of horizontally averaged temperature. Although calculations are done at Rayleigh numbers lower than expected for Earth’s mantle (2x105 and 106), the drift speed extrapolates to reasonable Wilson Cycle speeds for larger Ra.",

The study was conducted based on query reports produced by National Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics (INAMET) 1968 to 2014 with emphasis to the work presented by Moreira (1968), that defined six seismogenic zones from macro seismic data, with highlighting is Zone of Sá da Bandeira (Lubango)-Chibemba-Oncócua-Iona. This is the most important of Angola seismic zone, covering the epicentral Quihita and Iona regions, geologically characterized by transcontinental structure tectono-magmatic activation of the Mesozoic with the installation of a wide variety of intrusive rocks of ultrabasic-alkaline composition, basic and alkaline, kimberlites and carbonatites, strongly marked by intense tectonism, presenting with several faults and fractures (locally called corredor de Lucapa).

We also analyzed technical reports on the seismicity of the middle Kwanza produced by Hidroproekt (GAMEK) region as well as international seismic bulletins of the International Seismological Centre (ISC), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and these data served for instrumental location of the epicenters. All compiled information made possible the creation of the First datbase of seismic data for Angola, preparing the map of seismicity with the reconfirmation of the main seismic zones defined by Moreira (1968) and the identification of a new seismic zone Porto Amboim in the coastal portion of Kwanza basin sedimentary.",

The radioisotope 129I (T1/2 = 15.7 Myrs) derived from235U and 239Pu processing at LANL is locally detected in groundwater above background concentrations. This isotope provides a unique tracer for groundwater investigations conducted at LANL that helps to identify source releases linked to groundwater-flow paths in aquifers subject to binary and ternary mixing of natural- and industrial-derived waters containing chromate and other chemicals. Bromide, chlorate, chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, sulfate, and tritium were associated with multiple outfalls at LANL and, therefore, do not provide unique chemical signatures identifying a specific point of release or source. Natural and anthropogenic ratios of 129I/127I measured in groundwater samples collected at LANL were quantified using accelerator mass spectrometry at Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory, Purdue University. Anthropogenic ratios of 129I/127I range from 1,531 X 10-15 to 10,323 X 10-15 within perched-intermediate groundwater present in volcanoclastic and basalt aquifers (210 – 216 m depth). Anthropogenic ratios of 129I/127I range from 359 X 10-15 to 4,350 X 10-15 within the regional aquifer (280 m depth) consisting of volcanoclastic sediments of variable hydraulic properties. Local background ratios of 129I/127I have a narrow range of 171 X 10-15 to 378 X 10-15 in the regional aquifer. Dissolved iodide measured in groundwater at LANL is stable dominantly as iodate. Background concentrations of dissolved iodate (0.1 to 33.2 nM) are less variable compared to anthropogenic iodate (8.0 to 246 nM) in groundwater at the site. Variability in concentrations of anthropogenic iodate is controlled by heterogeneous source releases of iodate over time and non-uniform mixing of groundwater in the different aquifers.",

Here, we combine body wave arrival times with surface wave dispersion measurements and gravity observations to develop a combined 3D P- and S-wave velocity model for the crust and upper mantle of Colombia. P- and S-wave arrival times were obtained for local earthquakes from instruments in the Colombian National Seismic Network. Rayleigh wave dispersion curves were inverted for using a subset of network stations and larger local earthquakes. Gravity observations were extracted from the global satellite-based model EGM2008.\nPreliminary results using body waves only show reduced velocities beneath the volcanic arc in the upper 25 km of the crust. Crustal velocities are also reduced from the 1D starting model beneath the Eastern Cordillera in the northern half of the country. Relocations of intermediate-depth seismicity clearly indicate a discontinuity in the slab centered 5° N latitude, where the southern portion of the slab is ~200 km trenchward of the northern portion, coincident with the termination of arc volcanism and in recent years interpreted as due to a slab tear [Vargas and Mann, 2013]. Seismicity below 100 km depth in the southern portion of the subduction zone­­­ is surrounded by a ~100-km-thick region of elevated velocities, associated with the subduction of the Nazca Plate, and embedded within a broader region of reduced velocities. The northern portion of the subduction zone at 100 km depth and below is characterized by a broad region of elevated velocities, which may be consistent with a slab of an old, thickened Caribbean Plate origin. The overlapping of the edges of the Nazca and Caribbean slabs may contribute to the seismicity of the Bucaramanga nest.",

            "abstract": "Lowering MESSENGER’s periapsis altitude has provided the opportunity to image the surface of Mercury at higher resolution than was possible during the earlier orbital phase of the mission. In images obtained at spatial scales as good as ~3 m/pixel, small thrust-fault scarps have been detected. The small scarps found thus far are less than 10 km in length and have only tens of meters of relief, much smaller than the large lobate scarps that are the dominant contractional tectonic landform on Mercury and have been attributed to cooling and contraction of the planetary interior. The small scarps on Mercury are nonetheless comparable in scale to similar small scarps documented on the Moon. High-resolution MESSENGER images also reveal that the small scarps crosscut small impact craters (<100 m in diameter). Transected small craters <100 m in diameter on the Moon are Copernican (<~800 My) in age, broadly equivalent to the Kuiperian period on Mercury. Their low relief, lack of superposed small craters, and pristine appearance support the inference that these scarps are geologically young, because small landforms on Mercury will not survive for billions of years under steady meteoroid bombardment. Lunar lobate scarps comparable in scale could be less than 50 My old on the basis of estimated rates of infilling of small, shallow graben in the back-scarp terrain. The impact flux on Mercury is estimated to be a factor of ~3 greater than on the Moon, so the rate of degradation of small landforms on Mercury is expected to be comparably greater. In addition to the detection of small, young scarps, MESSENGER is acquiring images of large lobate scarps from low altitudes. Disturbed and crosscut small impact craters (<100 m in diameter) have been found in high-resolution images on the northwest segment of Carnegie Rupes, indicating recent activity on thrust-fault segments associated with older, prominent scarps. The young, small fault scarps and small-diameter craters crosscut by both small and large scarps are evidence that the contraction of Mercury has continued to geologically recent time and is likely ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Climate reconstructions from paleoflora, paleosols, and stable isotopes (δ18O and δD) of authigenic minerals reveal episodes of cooling and drying across southwestern North America during the late Cenozoic (since 23 Ma). This climate transition has been attributed to a number of factors including: 1) global cooling due to drawdown of atmospheric CO2, accompanied by enhanced meridional and tropical zonal SST gradients and the development of polar icecaps; 2) vegetation turnover with deciduous trees, and xerophytic shrub- and grass-lands replacing warm-temperate forests; and, 3) multiple orogenic events that reshaped the continent, uplifting the Rockies and Sierra Nevada Mountains and creating the Basin and Range province. Although studies have investigated some of these potential climate factors, comprehensive comparisons among them and against proxies, especially stable isotope records, are still lacking.\nWe performed a series of seven experiments with a water isotope-enabled global climate model (ECHAM5-JSBACH-wiso) and different boundary conditions in order to identify the influence of these drivers on the late Cenozoic climate transition. Our results indicate that regional cooling is primarily a response to global cooling. The factors that drive hydrological changes, however, differ by region. Expansion of grasslands leads to reduction of precipitation by up to 100 mm/yr and δ18O enrichment of soil water by 1-2‰ across the Great Plain region. In the Basin and Range Province, tectonic subsidence gives rise to as much as a 3‰ enrichment in soil water and reduction of precipitation by up to 200 mm/yr. Across the southwestern coast and Sierra Nevada Mountains, drying primarily results from reduction of the zonal SST gradient. Our results demonstrate the utility of water isotopes for investigating past hydrological regimes, and suggest that a combination of factors conspired to drive late Cenozoic hydrological changes.",

            "abstract": "Multi-point studies of the auroral acceleration region (AAR) by the Cluster spacecraft has enabled a number of open issues on the auroral acceleration to be addressed and revealed. Data from AAR crossings of Inverted-V aurora, by the C1 and C3 spacecraft at different altitudes, enabled a detailed reconstruction of the acceleration potential and a verification of its stability on a five min time scale. The relative role of quasi-static and Alfvénic acceleration behind aurora are addressed in two event studies. In one of these, the two processes are shown to operate jointly on the plasma population within the polar cap boundary. In the other, the electron energy flux producing multiple arcs within a surge is found to be generally dominated by the quasi-static contribution. Acceleration features and the FAC closure associated with surge-horn aurora crossed by the Cluster fleet were derived in another event study. A study of the density distribution within the auroral cavity, showed for all included events, exponential density decreases, relative to the ambient densities, from the mid to top of the AAR. In another study, cavities were found to extend well beyond the top of the AAR. Finally, statistical high-latitude electric field and plasma density distributions are presented based on 10 years of Cluster data collected between 2 and 4 RE altitudes. Intense electric fields appear in two altitude regimes on the nightside, separated by a gap at 2.8 RE. The upper altitude fields were interpreted to be Alfvénic and the lower altitude fields quasi-static, related to the AAR. The gap in the electric field intensity indicates a partial closure of the potentials in the lower region, with similarities to model results of reflected Alfvén waves and earlier reported observations",

            "abstract": "Mass anomalies in the Earth's mantle associated with thermal and compositional heterogeneities or with deflected boundaries between layers of different density produce stresses, which initiate mantle convection, plumes, subduction and deformations of the lithosphere. In particularly, the upper mantle plays a key role in controlling surface tectonics. Therefore, knowledge of density heterogeneity of the upper mantle is principal for understanding its dynamics and ongoing tectonic processes. This is particularly important for a complicated region such as Eurasia, where nearly all types of tectonic settings are present. There exist three main problems in construction of 3-D density models of the upper mantle. First, it is necessary to remove before hand the effect of the crust, which substantially masks the upper mantle gravity field. Second, the gravity effects of thermal and compositional density variations should be separated. And finally, the inverse gravity problem is usually underdetermined. In the present study we attempt to create a density model of the upper mantle based on improved interpretation methods and updated initial data sets. The impact of the crust to the observed gravity is estimated based on a new crustal model (Stolk et al., 2013). After removing this effect, we estimate the residual mantle anomalies of the gravity field. In the same way we estimate the residual topography, which is the second principal constraint used in the inversion. The impact of the mantle below 350 km is determined and removed based on recent mantle flow models. 3D density model of the lithosphere and upper mantle is constructed in an iterative inversion with tomography data. Contrary to most of previous studies, the thermal and compositional models are self-consistent. Many principal features of the compositional variations are not resolved by seismic tomography. The obtained density and thermal models can be used to model ongoing tectonic processes. Stolk W., Kaban M.K., Beekman F., Tesauro M., Mooney W.D., Cloetingh S. (2013).

            "abstract": "A test site for CO2 geological storage is situated in Hontomín (Spain) with a reservoir rock that is mainly composed of limestone. During and after CO2 injection, the resulting CO2-rich acid brine gives rise to the dissolution of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) and gypsum (or anhydrite at depth) may precipitate since the reservoir brine contains sulfate. Experiments using columns filled with crushed limestone or dolostone were conducted under different P-pCO2 conditions (atmospheric: 1-10-3.5 bar; subcritical: 10-10 bar; and supercritical: 150-34 bar), T (25, 40 and 60 ºC) and input solution compositions (gypsum-undersaturated and gypsum-equilibrated solutions). We evaluated the effect of these parameters on the coupled reactions of calcite/dolomite dissolution and gypsum/anhydrite precipitation. The CrunchFlow and PhreeqC (v.3) numerical codes were used to perform reactive transport simulations of the experiments.\nUnder the P-pCO2-T conditions, the volume of precipitated gypsum was smaller than the volume of dissolved carbonate minerals, yielding an increase in porosity (Δporosity up to ≈ 4%).\nA decrease in T favored limestone dissolution regardless of pCO2 owing to increasing undersaturation with decreasing temperature. However, gypsum precipitation was favored at high T and under atmospheric pCO2 conditions but not at high T and under 10 bar of pCO2 conditions. The increase in limestone dissolution with pCO2 was directly attributed to pH, which was more acidic at higher pCO2.\nIncreasing pCO2, carbonate dissolution occurred along the column whereas it was localized in the very inlet under atmospheric conditions. This was due to the buffer capacity of the carbonic acid, which maintains pH at around 5 and keeps the solution undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite along the column.\n1D reactive transport simulations reproduced the experimental data (carbonate dissolution and gypsum precipitation for different P-pCO2-T conditions). Drawing on reaction rate laws in the literature, we used the reactive surface area to fit the models to the experimental data. The values of the reactive surface area were much smaller than those calculated of the geometric areas.",

            "abstract": "Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) announced the national plan for Korea’s future electric power supply (2013 – 2027) in 2013. According to the plan, the national demand for electricity will be increased by 60% compared to that of 2010 and primary energy sources for electric generation will still lean on the fossil fuels such as petroleum, LNG, and coal, which would be a potential threat to air quality of Korea. This study focused on two subjects: (1) How the spatial distribution of the primary air pollutant’s emissions (i.e., NOx, SOx, CO, PM) will be changed and (2) How the primary emission changes will influence on the national ambient air quality including ozone in 2027. We used GEOS-Chem model simulation with modification of Korean emissions inventory (Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS)) to simulate the current and future air quality in Korea. The national total emissions of CO, NOx, SOx, PM in year 2027 will be increased by 3%, 8%, 13%, 2%, respectively compared to 2010 and there are additional concern that the future location of the power plants will be closer to the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), where there are approximately 20 million population vulnerable to the potentially worsened air quality. While there are slight increase of concentration of CO, NOx, SOx, and PM in 2027, the O3 concentration is expected to be similar to the level of 2010. Those results may imply the characteristics of air pollution in East Asia such as potentially severe O3 titration and poorer O3/CO or O3/NOx ratio. Furthermore, we will discuss on the impact of transboundary pollution transport from China in the future, which is one of the large factors to control the air quality of Korea.",

In addition to numerical checks of the code, we investigate the influences of the following effects: magnetic field configuration, solar EUV flux input, and atmospheric density/temperature profiles. In particular, we explore the causes of the extremely high photoelectron fluxes, resulting into two linear dependent trends on solar EUV proxy, measured by the Mars Global Surveyor MAGnetometer/Electron Reflector (MGS MAG/ER) in late 2001-early 2002 (Mars year 25). Studies have shown the relation between these high fluxes and the global dust storm that occurred in the same time period. This modeling work further explores the physical explanations of this relation. Our preliminary results suggest that an increase in CO2 density in the upper thermosphere (150-300 km altitude) is necessary to match the observed changes in photoelectron flux at the MGS altitude of ~400 km.",

            "abstract": "The upcoming high-resolution SWOT altimetry satellite will provide an unprecedented description of the ocean dynamic topography for studying sub- and meso-scale processes in the ocean. But there is still much uncertainty on the signal that will be observed. There are many scientific questions that are unresolved about the observability of altimetry at vhigh resolution and on the dynamical role of the ocean meso- and submesoscales. In addition, SWOT data will raise specific problems due to the size of the data flows. These issues will probably impact the data assimilation approaches for future scientific or operational oceanography applications.\nIn this work, we propose to use a high-resolution numerical model of the Western Pacific Solomon Sea as a regional laboratory to explore such observability and dynamical issues, as well as new data assimilation challenges raised by SWOT.\nThe Solomon Sea connects subtropical water masses to the equatorial ones through the low latitude western boundary currents and could potentially modulate the tropical Pacific climate. In the South Western Pacific, the Solomon Sea exhibits very intense eddy kinetic energy levels, while relatively little is known about the mesoscale and submesoscale activities in this region. The complex bathymetry of the region, complicated by the presence of narrow straits and numerous islands, raises specific challenges. So far, a Solomon sea model configuration has been set up at 1/36° resolution.\nNumerical simulations have been performed to explore the meso- and submesoscales dynamics. The numerical solutions which have been validated against available in situ data, show the development of small scale features, eddies, fronts and filaments. Spectral analysis reveals a behavior that is consistent with the SQG theory. There is a clear evidence of energy cascade from the small scales including the submesoscales, although those submesoscales are only partially resolved by the model.\nIn parallel, investigations have been conducted using image assimilation approaches in order to explore the richness of high-resolution altimetry missions. These investigations illustrate the potential benefit of combining tracer fields (SST, SSS and spiciness) with high-resolution SWOT data to estimate the fine-scale circulation.",

            "abstract": "Mantle plumes have been increasingly studied in the past years, yet they remain not well understood. The Polynesian plume that displays the entire isotopic range known for OIB, provides new perspectives into the global understanding on mantle plume activity on Earth. Here we present new geochemical (whole rock and olivine) and isotopic analyses on samples from Gambier Island, one of the Pitcairn chain islands in Polynesia. Most samples come from a temporal sequence and display small but significant geochemical and isotopic variations. Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic data do not vary much (e.g., 206Pb/204Pb ≈ 19.00 and 87Sr/86Sr ≈ 0.703290) and are very different from the EMI-type values reported for Pitcairn Island and seamounts.\nUsing in situ olivine analyses and REE modeling, we constrain the composition of the mantle source (10% recycled oceanic crust and 90% surrounding peridotite), how both components melt (25-30% for the pyroxenite produced from the oceanic crust and 2-7% for the surrounding peridotite) and by combining these data with published experimental studies, we find that the temperature of Gambier source is rather low temperature compared to other mantle plumes such as Hawaii. We also constrain the age and the nature of the recycled oceanic crust using the isotopic data. The data require the presence of about 3% sedimentary material associated to recycled oceanic basalt and its age is constrained at about 1.5 Ga. A marked Nb-Ta positive anomaly together with elevated Ce/Pb ratios are other indices of the presence of recycled oceanic basalt in the mantle source. Given that these features resemble typical HIMU lavas but that the 1.5 Gy age of the recycled crust is too young to create the extreme Pb isotopic compositions that characterize the HIMU basalts, Gambier Island can be considered as a “young HIMU” island.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that biologically driven redox reactions, fueled by sedimentary lenses enriched in detrital organic matter, play major roles in maintaining the persistent uranium groundwater plume in the subsurface at the U.S. Department of Enery’s Rifle, CO field research site. Biogeochemical cycling of C, N, Fe, and S is highly active in these organic-rich naturally reduced zones (NRZs), and uranium is present as U(IV). The speciation of these elements profoundly influences the susceptibility of uranium to be reoxidized and remobiliized and contribute to plume persistence. However, uranim speciation in particular is poorly constrained in these sytems.\nTo better evaluate the importance of NRZs to uranium mobility and plume persistence at the Rifle site, the DOE-BER-funded SLAC SFA team has characterized vertical concentration profiles and speciation of uranium, iron, sulfur, and NOM in well bores at high spatial resolution (4 inch intervals). Up to 95% of the sedimentary uranium pool was found to be concentrated in NRZs, where it occurs dominantly as non-crystalline forms of U(IV). Uranium accumulation and the presence of the short-lived sulfide mackinawite (FeS) at NRZ-aquifer interfaces indicate that NRZs actively exchange solutes with the surrounding aquifer. Moreover, sediment textures indicate that NRZs are likely to be abundant in riparian zones throughout the upper Colorado River basin (U.S.A.), which contains most of the contaminated DOE legacy uranium ore processing sites in the U.S. These results suggest that NRZ-uranium interactions may be important to plume persistence regionally and emphasize the importance of understanding molecular-scale processes.",

            "abstract": "Global climate during the Late Miocene (11.61–5.33 Ma) is thought to have been generally warmer and wetter than at present day. The Northern Hemisphere was characterised by nearly ice-free conditions (with respect to the extent of the Greenland ice sheet) and some of the main marine gateways were undergoing opening or closure (e.g. Central American gateway, Bering Strait, and Indonesian Throughflow). Vegetation distribution was also generally more extensive than it is today, both at high and low latitudes.\nThere is geological evidence of orbitally-forced cyclicity in sedimentary sections throughout the globe, especially in marginal basins such as the Mediterranean Sea. In the Late Miocene the entire North African catchment drained in the Eastern Mediterranean, constituting the main fresh water input into the basin, regulated by the North African monsoon. In addition, the Tibetan Plateau underwent substantial uplift throughout this time period, which strengthened the Asian monsoon system.\nThe Late Miocene therefore represents an ideal scenario to investigate the impact of orbital forcing on the North African and Asian monsoon systems, the establishment of their teleconnections, and the associated vegetation changes. There still is considerable uncertainty in the reconstructed atmospheric CO2 levels for this time period, due to the patchy distribution (both spatially and temporally) of the available proxy record. Hence, we also explore the sensitivity of global climate to changing CO2 levels with different orbital configurations.\nWe carried out a new series of 22 fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation numerical simulations, run at evenly spaced intervals (1kyr) through a full late Miocene precession cycle (~6.5 Ma), using a full-complexity general circulation model (HadCM3L).\nThese model results show substantial changes to sea surface temperatures and regional atmospheric circulation on sub-precessional time scales. This triggers responses in the North African and Asian monsoon systems, which modify their timing, onset, intensity and seasonality. This has important consequences for vegetation distribution, with highly intensified precipitation patterns at times of minimum precession (maximum insolation) resulting in a greening of both the Sahel and Indian regions.",

            "abstract": "When Voyager 1 spacecraft crossed the termination shock on 16th December 2004, the energy spectra of anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) could not have been produced by steady state diffusive shock acceleration. However, over the next few years, in the declining phase of the solar cycle, the spectra began to evolve into the expected power-law profile. Energetic particle transport coefficients, such as diffusion and drift, and also ACR source strength tend to increase with declining levels of solar activity. In this work, we propose that the solar cycle had an important effect on the “unrolling” spectra in the heliosheath at Voyager 1. To investigate the spectral evolution of ACRs, a magentohydrodynamic background model with stationary solar-wind inner boundary conditions will be used to model the transport of helium and oxygen ions. We use a backward-in- time stochastic integration technique where phase-space trajectories are integrated until the so called “injection energy” is reached. Our simulation results will be compared with Voyager 1 observations from 2005 to 2012.",

            "abstract": "We present the detection of dark regions in the jovian sub-auroral H3+ emission, first observed in recent December 2012 observations of Jupiter's aurora using CRIRES/VLT and confirmed to be stable on long timescales using a re-analysis of auroral images taken by J. Connerney and T. Satoh as a part of their 1995-2000 NSFCam/IRTF observations of the aurora.\nWhile the auroral region of Jupiter has been studied in great detail, the region equatorward of this has long been thought of as a gently gradated boundary region, with reduced emission towards Jupiter's equator. However, this new detection reveals what appears to be highly localised variable emission: dark regions with sharp boundaries and distinct shapes, offset from the auroral region. These dark features are broadly stable in both magnetic longitude and latitude over timescales of more than fifteen years, and yet vary in small-scale morphology over timescales of less than a month. This changing H3+ emission could represent the localised destruction of H3+, producing a reduction in H3+ density or, alternatively, a cooling of the co-located neutral atmosphere may be reducing the thermalised H3+ emission.\nHowever, what planetary process drives such changes is not clear. These unexplained features cannot be weather systems propagating from lower altitudes, as lower altitude weather systems generally drift along latitudinally bound bands, and these features are fixed in longitude over seasonal timescales. This strongly suggests a magnetospheric origin for the dimming. Perhaps the lack of emission is comparable to the 'Ring Rain' features seen in Saturn's equatorial regions. However, since these dark spots are confined to specific longitudes, unlike the bands of emission seen at Saturn, and their morphology appears to change with time, it is difficult to assign a magnetospheric source that would cause such a reduction in either H3+ density or temperature. Alternatively, the darkening may represent previously unobserved dynamics within the sub-auroral upper atmosphere, driven, and held in place, by auroral processes, resulting in thermospheric weather that is stable on long timescales. Either of these strongly suggests a long-term control of the non-auroral upper atmosphere of Jupiter by the surrounding space environment.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Mw 6.2 Khaki-Shonbe earthquake occurred in the Simply Folded Belt of the Zagros Mountains, Iran. This is the largest earthquake in the Zagros since the November 1990 Mw 6.4 Furg (Hormozgan) thrust faulting event, and therefore the largest in the period for which dense InSAR ground displacements are available. It is also the biggest seismic event to have occurred in the Simply Folded Belt since the March 1977 Mw 6.7 Khurgu earthquake. This earthquake therefore potentially provides valuable insights into a range of controversies: (1) the preponderance of earthquake faulting in the crystalline basement versus the sedimentary cover and the potential importance of lithology in controlling and limiting seismic rupture; (2) the nature of surface folding and whether or not there is a one-to-one relationship between buried reverse faults and surface anticlines; and (3) the presence or absence of large pulses of aseismic slip triggered by mainshock rupture.\nWe combine seismological solutions and aftershock relocations with satellite interferometric ground displacements and observations from the field to determine the geometry of faulting and its relationship with the structure, stratigraphy and tectonics of the Central Zagros. The earthquake rupture involved reverse slip on two along-strike southwest dipping fault segments, the rupture initiating at the northern and bottom end of the larger north-west segment. These faults verge away from the foreland and towards the high range interior, contrary to the fault geometries depicted in many structural cross-sections of the Zagros. The slip measured on the reverse segments occurred over two mutually exclusive depth ranges, 10–5 km and 4–2 km, resulting in long (16 km), narrow (7 km) rupture segments. Conversely, aftershocks are found to cluster in the depth range 8–16 km, beneath the main rupture segment. This indicates only significant reverse slip and coseismic shortening in the sedimentary cover, with the slip distribution likely to be lithologically controlled in depth by the Hormuz salt at the base of the sedimentary cover, and the Kazhdumi Formation mudrocks at upper-levels (5 km), and aftershocks constrained largely beneath the main coseismic rupture planes.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism for producing fast coronal mass ejections/eruptive flares (CME/EFs) is hotly debated. Most models rely on ideal instability/loss of equilibrium or magnetic reconnection; these two categories of models predict different relationships between CMEs and flares. Discriminating between them requires continuous, high-resolution observations and state-of-the-art numerical simulations that enable the relative timing of key stages in the events to be determined. With the advent of SDO, STEREO, and massively parallel supercomputers, we are well poised to tackle this major challenge to our understanding of solar activity. In recent work (Karpen et al. 2012), we determined the timing and location of triggering mechanisms for the breakout initiation model (Antiochos et al. 1999), using ultra-high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh refinement and high-cadence analysis. This approach enabled us to resolve as finely as possible the small scales of magnetic reconnection and island formation in the current sheets, within the global context of a large-scale solar eruption. We found that the explosive acceleration of the fast CME occurs only after the onset of rapid reconnection at the flare current sheet formed in the wake of the rising CME flux rope. In the present work, we discriminate between ideal and resistive mechanisms for fast CME/EFs using a combination of state-of-the-art observations and simulations. We compare flare reconnection rates, measured from flare ribbon UV brightenings observed by SDO/AIA and magnetograms from SDO/HMI, with the height evolution of CME fronts and cores, measured from STEREO/SECCHI EUV and coronagraph images. We also calculate these quantities from numerical simulations and compare them to observations, as a new test of the breakout initiation model.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the formation of large magmatic reservoirs is a key issue for the evaluation of possible strong volcanic eruptions in the future. Many geological observations of exposed past volcanic systems and geodynamic models have indicated that large magmatic reservoirs can build up over long periods of time, with small increments that promote vertical dykes and horizontally oriented sill intrusions. The typical size of such intrusions beneath presently active volcanoes is too small to be imaged with most geophysical methods. Here we show that large layered intrusion complexes at depth can be detected by measurements of the seismic anisotropy caused by the fine-scale layering. We have used data obtained from 42 stations between May and October 2008 on the Toba caldera complex (north Sumatra, Indonesia) to construct a 3D seismic model of the crust with using ambient noise tomography method. Approximately ~500 Rayleigh and Love waves were extracted from cross correlations of continuous records. Their group velocities were measured at periods between 5 and 19 s and, after a 2D regionalization, inverted into local 1D shear velocity profiles (VSH from Love and VSV from Rayleigh waves) using a Monte-Carlo method based on the Neighborhood Algorithm. All 1D profiles were combined into a final 3D model that shows a strong radial anisotropy below the Toba caldera at depths greater than 7 km. A plausible explanation of these observations is the presence of a large magmatic sill complex in the crust below 7 km in depth. Our data support the concept of the long-term incremental building up of magma bodies that leads to the largest volcanic eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Geological CO2 sequestration at a pilot-plant scale is going to be performed at Hontomín (Spain). The Hontomín caprock is made up of marly shale, with an average composition (wt. %) of 71.2% calcite, 9.7% quartz, 7.1% illite, 6.5% albite, 2.8% clinochlore and trace amounts of gypsum, anhydrite and pyrite. The reservoir solution is rich in NaCl and sulfate (I = 0.6 M), being in equilibrium with respect to calcite and gypsum. The present study aims at evaluating the interaction between the shale and the CO2-rich solution of Hontomín under in situ conditions (pTotal = 150 bar, pCO2 = 61 bar and T = 60 °C). In particular, we focused on (i) the role of injected solution composition (S-free and S-rich solutions), (ii) the importance of mineral dissolution and precipitation processes and (iii) the effect of flow rate (0.2, 1 and 60 mL min-1) on the rock hydrodynamic properties.\nUnder the experimental conditions, in both types of solution, dissolution of calcite, clinochlore and albite and precipitation of clays occurred, whereas precipitation of gypsum only took place in S-rich solution. In the S-free solution experiments, face and uniform dissolution was observed at low and high flow rate, respectively, but fracture permeability remained fairly constant independently of the flow rate. In the S-rich solution experiments, the fracture permeability decreased remarkably at the lower flow rates (kfinal/kinitial ≤ 0.03) due to precipitation of gypsum and clay minerals. However, at the highest flow rate, uniform dissolution occurred and the fracture permeability increased slightly (kfinal/kinitial = 4) as dissolution of calcite predominated over gypsum precipitation.",

            "abstract": "As the number of magnetometer stations and data processing power increases, just how auroral power relates to geomagnetic observations becomes a quantitatively more tractable question. This paper compares Polar UVI auroral power observations during 1997 with a variety of geomagnetic indices. Local time (LT) versions of the SuperMAG auroral electojet (SME) are introduced and examined, along with the corresponding upper and lower envelopes (SMU and SML). Also, the East-West component, BE, is investigated. We also consider whether using any of the local indices is actually better at predicting local auroral power than a single global index. Each index is separated into 24 LT indices based on a sliding 3-h MLT window. The ability to predict – or better reconstruct – auroral power varies greatly with LT, peaking at 1900 MLT, where about 75% of the variance (r2) can be predicted at 1-min cadence. The aurora is fairly predictable from 1700 MLT – 0400 MLT, roughly the region in which substorms occur. Auroral power is poorly predicted from auroral electrojet indices from 0500 MLT – 1500 MLT, with the minima at 1000-1300 MLT. In the region of high predictability, the local variable which works best is BE, in contrast to long-standing expectations. However using global SME is better than any local variable. Auroral power is best predicted by combining global SME with a local index: BE from 1500-0200 MLT, and either SMU or SML from 0300-1400 MLT. In the region of the diffuse aurora, it is better to use a 30 min average than the cotemporaneous 1-min SME value, while from 1500-0200 MLT the cotemporaneous 1-min SME works best, suggesting a more direct physical relationship with the auroral circuit. These results suggest a significant role for discrete auroral currents closing locally with Pedersen currents.",

            "abstract": "Energy Balance Approach (EBA) has been demonstrated to be an efficient method to estimate the regional terrestrial water storage changes from GRACE via in situ geopotential difference observations directly computed using the GRACE Level 1B data. The primary purpose of this study is to overcome several limitations in previous EBA by demonstrating an improved EBA to obtain a more precise estimation of in situ geopotential difference, which would be able to preserve both the low- and high-frequency gravity signals and also improve the temporal resolutions. Consequently, this method would yield a full scale, i.e., both regional and global water storage change, including world’s aquifers. To achieve this goal, we developed an innovative approach to incorporate GRACE inter-satellite range-rate observations into energy conservation equation, which is realized by a so-called alignment equation, together with a technique to estimate the reference orbits for the GRACE twin-satellites. We will present our results for both global and regional GRACE solutions using the improved EBA for water storage change estimates with enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions over selected terrestrial hydrologic basins and large aquifers.",

            "abstract": "The Source Phenomenology Experiment (SPE) was a series of nine chemical explosions within a mine in Arizona. Its purpose was to collect seismic waveforms from these explosions for the purposes of resolving the equivalent elastic seismic source model. Ground motion data from the SPE are analyzed in this study to assess the uniqueness of the source representation of these contained explosions as well as the ability to resolve the trade-off between yield and depth when the geology or physical parameters of the source region may have a range of possible values. In this study, the p-wave velocities (Vp) are well constrained but the accompanying s-wave velocities (Vs) are less constrained. In order to assess the effects of source depth of burial (DOB) and Vs model on the seismic moment tensors, Green’s functions (Gf) were computed for different DOB as well as different Vs models holding the Vpmodel constant. The Gf for the 16, near-source stations were calculated focusing on observations in the 150-680 m range. The compensated linear vector dipole and explosion components of the new Gf are compared to quantify the possible effects of DOB and Vs on the source representation. Gf with variable DOB and Vs are convolved with the Mueller-Murphy isotropic source function to produce synthetic seismograms at a range of azimuths in order to assess tradeoffs. Noise is added to the synthetics to investigate their impact on the full recovery of the seismic moment tensor. Inversions, with real and synthetic data, are conducted where covariance matrices and condition numbers are formulated to evaluate the effects of station distance and azimuthal coverage on seismic moment tensor recovery. These procedures guide additional analysis of the observational data to quantify the practical resolution of physical phenomenology accompanying these contained explosion sources.",

            "abstract": "The cloud optical thickness (τ) and droplet effective radius (re) are two key cloud parameters retrieved by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). These MODIS cloud products are widely used in a broad range of earth system science applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the failed cloud τ and/or re retrievals for liquid-phase clouds over ocean in the Collection 6 MODIS cloud product. The main findings from this study are summarized as follows:\n MODIS retrieval failure rates for marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds have a strong dependence on the spectral combination used for retrieval (e.g., 0.86 + 2.1 µm vs. 0.8 + 3.7 µm) and the cloud morphology (i.e., “good” pixels vs. partly cloudy (PCL) pixels). Combining all clear-sky-restoral (CSR) categories (CSR=0,1 and 3), the 0.86 + 2.1 µm and 0.86 + 3.7 µm spectral combinations have an overall failure rate of about 20% and 12%, respectively (See figure below). The PCL pixels (CSR=1 & 3) have significantly higher failure rates and contribute more to the total failure population than the “good” (CSR=0) pixels.\nThe majority of the failed retrievals are caused by the re  too large failure, which explains about 85% and 70% of the failed 0.86 + 2.1 µm and 0.86 + 3.7 µm retrievals, respectively. The remaining failures are either due to the re too small failure or τ retrieval failure.\nThe geographical distribution of failure rates has a significant dependence on cloud regime, lower over the coastal stratocumulus cloud regime and higher over the broken trade-wind cumulus cloud regime over open oceans.\nEnhanced retrieval failure rates are found when MBL clouds have high sub-pixel inhomogeneity , or are located at special Sun-satellite viewing geometries, such as sunglint, large viewing or solar zenith angle, or cloudbow and glory angles, or subject to cloud masking, cloud overlapping and/or cloud phase retrieval issues.\nAbout 80% of the failure retrievals can be attributed to at least one or more potential reasons mentioned above. Collocated radar reflectivity observations from CloudSat suggest that the remaining 20% are unlikely to be retrieval artifacts, but reflection of true cloud microphysics, i.e., the true is either truly very small or very large.",

            "abstract": "The USDA Southwest (SW) Climate Hub was created in February 2014 to develop risk adaptation and mitigation strategies for coping with climate change effects on agricultural productivity. There are seven regional hubs across the country with three subsidiary hubs. The SW Climate Hub Region is made up of six states: New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California and Hawaii (plus the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands). The SW Climate Hub has a subsidiary hub located in Davis, California. The Southwest region has high climatic diversity, with the lowest and highest average annual rainfall in the U.S.(6.0 cm in Death Valley, CA and 1168 cm at Mt. Waialeale, HI). There are major deserts in five of the six states, yet most of the states, with exception of Hawaii, depend upon the melting of mountain snowpacks for their surface water supply. Additionally, many of the agricultural areas of the SW Regional Hub depend upon irrigation water to maintain productivity. Scientific climate information developed by the Hub will be used for climate-smart decision making. To do this, the SW Regional Hub will rely upon existing infrastructure of the Cooperative Extension Service at Land-Grant State Universities. Extension service and USDA-NRCS personnel have existing networks to communicate with stakeholders (farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners) through meetings and workshops which have already started in the six states. Outreach through the development of a weather and climate impact modules designed for seventh grade students and their teachers will foster education of future generations of rural land managers. We will be synthesizing and evaluating existing reports, literature and information on regional climate projections, water resources, and agricultural adaptation strategies related to climate in the Southwest. The results will be organized in a spatial format and provided through the SW Hub website (\nhttp://swclimatehub.info\n) and peer-reviewed articles.",

            "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis is used, for example, to identify parameters which induce the largest variability in model output and are thus informative during calibration. Variance-based techniques are employed for this purpose, which unfortunately require a large number of model evaluations and are thus ineligible for complex environmental models.\nWe developed, therefore, a computational inexpensive screening method, which is based on Elementary Effects, that automatically separates informative and non-informative model parameters.\nThe method was tested using the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) with 52 parameters. The model was applied in three European catchments with different hydrological characteristics, i.e. Neckar (Germany), Sava (Slovenia), and Guadalquivir (Spain). The method identified the same informative parameters as the standard Sobol method but with less than 1% of model runs. In Germany and Slovenia, 22 of 52 parameters were informative mostly in the formulations of evapotranspiration, interflow and percolation. In Spain 19 of 52 parameters were informative with an increased importance of soil parameters.\nWe showed further that Sobol' indexes calculated for the subset of informative parameters are practically the same as Sobol' indexes before the screening but the number of model runs was reduced by more than 50%.\nThe model mHM was then calibrated twice in the three test catchments. First all 52 parameters were taken into account and then only the informative parameters were calibrated while all others are kept fixed. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies were 0.87 and 0.83 in Germany, 0.89 and 0.88 in Slovenia, and 0.86 and 0.85 in Spain, respectively. This minor loss of at most 4% in model performance comes along with a substantial decrease of at least 65% in model evaluations.\nIn summary, we propose an efficient screening method to identify non-informative model parameters that can be discarded during further applications. We have shown that sensitivity analysis keeps its information content even after screening. We could further demonstrate no loss of model performance after screening and subsequent calibration. However, total model evaluations could be reduced by at least 50% in both applications.",

            "abstract": "Southwest Asia, which contains the nations of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, is a water-stressed and semi-arid region that receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall during November-April. The cold season climate of Southwest Asia is strongly influenced by tropical Indo-Pacific variability on intraseasonal, interannual, and decadal time scales, much of which can be attributed to sea surface temperature (SST) variations. A decade of dry conditions, and many of the driest years within the observational record since 1940, occurred during the 2000s, which resulted in adverse socioeconomic impacts, including widespread famine in the region. Here, we examine: 1) the historical context of the 2000s drought over Southwest Asia in terms of the atmospheric forcing of precipitation and their influences on soil moisture and runoff and 2) the potential predictability of future seasonal and decadal hydrologic extremes.\nThe synchronous SST forcing of Pacific Decadal variability in the negative phase and a warm west Pacific Ocean throughout the 2000s resulted in persistent atmospheric circulations responsible for reduced Southwest Asia precipitation. The Pacific SSTs forced anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Southwest Asia, which displaced the climatological storm track northward and interacted with the mean climate, resulting in subsidence and reduced precipitation. These atmospheric conditions over Southwest Asia were extraordinary, having never occurred for such an extended time in the observational record. During La Niña events, the aforementioned atmospheric circulations were intensified, resulting in three of the driest years since 1940.\nWe utilize model based soil moisture and runoff as well as observed streamflow data for analyzing 2000s drought events and examine the contribution of initial hydrologic state in seasonal scale drought predictability in this region.",

            "abstract": "Andean uplift and the collision of North and South America are thought to have major implications for the diversification of the Neotropical biota. However, few studies have investigated how these geological events may have influenced diversification. We present a multilocus phylogeny of 102 Protieae taxa (73% of published species), sampled pantropically, to test hypotheses about the relative importance of dispersal, vicariance, habitat specialization, and biotic factors in the diversification of this ecologically dominant tribe of Neotropical trees. Bayesian fossil-calibrated analyses date the Protieae stem at 55 Mya. Biogeographic analyses reconstruct an initial late Oligocene/early Miocene radiation in Amazonia for Neotropical Protieae, with several subsequent late Miocene dispersal events to Central America, the Caribbean, Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and the Chocó. Regional phylogenetic structure results indicate frequent dispersal among regions throughout the Miocene and many instances of more recent regional in situ speciation. Habitat specialization to white sand or flooded soils was common, especially in Amazonia. There was one significant increase in diversification rate coincident with colonization of the Neotropics, followed by a gradual decrease consistent with models of diversity-dependent cladogenesis. Dispersal, biotic interactions, and habitat specialization are thus hypothesized to be the most important processes underlying the diversification of the Protieae.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of output from climate model ensembles, such as CMIP3 and CMIP5, has greatly expanded access to future projections, but there is no accepted blueprint for how this data should be interpreted. Decision makers are thus faced with difficult questions when trying to utilize such information: How reliable are the multi-model mean projections? How should the changes simulated by outlier models be treated? How can raw projections of temperature and precipitation be translated into probabilities? The multi-model average is often regarded as the most accurate single estimate of future conditions, but higher-order moments representing the variance and skewness of the distribution of projections provide important information about uncertainty. We have analyzed a set of statistically downscaled climate model projections from the CMIP3 archive to conduct an assessment of extreme weather events at a level designed to be relevant for decision makers. Our analysis uses the distribution of 13 GCM projections to derive the inter-model standard deviation (and coefficient of variation, COV), skewness, and percentile ranges for simulated changes in extreme heat, cold, and precipitation during the middle and late 21st century for the A1B emissions scenario. These metrics help to establish the overall confidence level across the entire range of projections (via the inter-model COV), relative confidence in the simulated high-end versus low-end changes (via skewness), and probabilistic uncertainty bounds derived from a bootstrapping technique. Over our analysis domain centered on the United States Midwest, some primary findings include: (1) Greater confidence in projections of less extreme cold than more extreme heat and intense precipitation, (2) Greater confidence in the low-end than high-end projections of extreme heat, and (3) Higher spatial and temporal variability in the confidence of projected increases of heavy precipitation. In addition, our bootstrapping procedure provides a fairly easy way for decision makers to estimate the probability of future changes in the frequency of extreme weather events based on user-defined percentile thresholds.",

            "abstract": "Naturally emitted from the oceans, iodine compounds efficiently destroy atmospheric ozone and reduce its positive radiative forcing effects in the troposphere. Emissions of inorganic iodine have been experimentally shown to depend on the deposition to the oceans of tropospheric ozone, whose concentrations have significantly increased since 1850 as a result of human activities. A chemistry-climate model is used to quantify the current ocean emissions of inorganic iodine and assess the impact that the anthropogenic increase of tropospheric ozone has had on the natural cycle of iodine in the marine environment since pre-industrial times. Results included in this communication indicate that the human-driven enhancement of tropospheric ozone has doubled the oceanic inorganic iodine emissions following the reaction of ozone with iodide at the sea surface. The consequent build-up of atmospheric iodine, with maximum enhancements of up to 70% with respect to preindustrial times in continental pollution outflow regions, has in turn accelerated the ozone chemical loss over the oceans with strong spatial patterns. We suggest that this ocean-atmosphere interaction represents a negative geochemical feedback loop by which current ocean emissions of iodine act as a natural buffer for ozone pollution and its radiative forcing in the global marine environment.",

            "abstract": "The effects of climate change are being revealed at alarming rates in the Arctic and Boreal regions of the planet. NASA’s Terrestrial Ecology Program has launched a major field campaign to study these effects over the next 5 to 8 years. The Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) will challenge scientists to take measurements in the field, study remote observations, and even run models to better understand the impacts of a rapidly changing climate for areas of Alaska and western Canada.\nThe NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has partnered with the Terrestrial Ecology Program to create a science cloud designed for this field campaign – the ABoVE Science Cloud. The cloud combines traditional high performance computing with emerging technologies to create an environment specifically designed for large-scale climate analytics. The ABoVE Science Cloud utilizes (1) virtualized high-speed InfiniBand networks, (2) a combination of high-performance file systems and object storage, and (3) virtual system environments tailored for data intensive, science applications. At the center of the architecture is a large object storage environment, much like a traditional high-performance file system, that supports data proximal processing using technologies like MapReduce on a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Surrounding the storage is a cloud of high performance compute resources with many processing cores and large memory coupled to the storage through an InfiniBand network. Virtual systems can be tailored to a specific scientist and provisioned on the compute resources with extremely high-speed network connectivity to the storage and to other virtual systems.\nIn this talk, we will present the architectural components of the science cloud and examples of how it is being used to meet the needs of the ABoVE campaign. In our experience, the science cloud approach significantly lowers the barriers and risks to organizations that require high performance computing solutions and provides the NCCS with the agility required to meet our customers’ rapidly increasing and evolving requirements.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Cyclone (TC) Yasi was a rapidly intensifying, category 5 storm that made landfall in Queensland, Australia on February 3rd, 2011. An ensemble of physics sensitivity simulations of TC Yasi using WRF v3.4.1 on a 12-km nested domain demonstrates that the choice of cumulus scheme dominates the outcome of the simulated intensity, trajectory and timing of the cyclone. The choice of microphysics parameterization, planetary boundary layer, surface drag coefficient, and ocean mixed layer scheme had smaller effects. The Modified Tiedtke scheme preferentially activates shallow convection, producing an accurate planetary boundary layer and profile of dry and moist air. However, deep convection and storm intensity are hindered. Thus the scheme produces the most accurate trajectory and landfall location but underestimates intensity and depth of the storm. Conversely, the Kain-Fritsch scheme initiates more deep convection and suppresses shallow convection, allowing storm deepening and intensification. However, subsidence from this convection scheme results in dry air entrainment aloft and a more shallow and moist boundary layer than observed. This scheme more accurately simulates depth and intensity but the trajectory and landfall location are too far south. In all ensemble runs, the simulated event reached maximum intensity over the open ocean and dissipated towards landfall, contrary to Yasi’s observed lifecycle. In order to represent potential warming of the East Australian Current (EAC) not resolved in the previous experiments, idealized simulations were performed where a 1°x1° resolution auxiliary sea surface temperature dataset was assimilated into the surface (lower boundary) forcing and 1°K was added to the coastal lagoon. This warming improves the simulated evolution and maintenance of intensity towards landfall and implies that additional warming can fuel further intensification. As the speed, volume transport and temperature of the EAC are predicted to increase with climate change, there are important ramifications for the life cycle of TCs in the area and for coastal settlements in the path of future storms.",

            "abstract": "After more than a century of research, a clear understanding of the physical processes involved in sediment transport problems is still lacking. In particular, modeling of intergranular interactions and fluid-particle interactions in bedload transport need to be improved. In this contribution, we propose a simple numerical model coupling a Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the grain dynamics with a simple 1D vertical fluid phase model inspired from the two-phase approach [1] in order to contribute to this open question. The Reynolds stress is parameterized by a mixing length model which depends on the integral of the grain volume fraction. The coupling between the grains and the fluid phase is essentially achieved through buoyancy and drag forces. The open source DEM code Yade [2] is used with a linear spring-dashpot contact law that allows the description of the behavior of the particles from the quasi-static to the dynamical state. The model is compared with classical results [3] and with particle-scale experimental results obtained in the quasi-2D flume at IRSTEA, Grenoble [4]. We discuss the closures of the model and the sensitivity to the different physical and numerical parameters.\n[1] Revil-Baudard, T. and J. Chauchat.

            "abstract": "NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) mission successfully launched on July 2, 2014. OCO-2 measures spectra of reflected solar radiation from the Earth’s surface, which are used to derive high precision column-averaged CO2 mole fractions (XCO2). OCO-2 will alternate between nadir and glint mode every 16 days (233 orbits) with occasional target observations primarily for calibration and validation. Nadir mode typically has better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over land and the highest probability of avoiding clouds, but poor SNR over water. Glint mode yields good SNR over water (from the specular reflectance of solar radiation) and land, but glint observations are more susceptible to encountering clouds due to their longer paths through the atmosphere, especially at high solar zenith angles. Is there a quantifiable benefit to cycling between nadir and glint more frequently or increasing the fraction of observations from either mode? This question is investigated by generating synthetic OCO-2 observations for the baseline observing sequence (16-day nadir/glint) and by more frequent alternation (per orbit). Observation distributions (after application of filters) demonstrate the different coverage obtained by the two observing scenarios on a 16-day scale. A forward CO2 simulation of the Environment Canada Carbon Assimilation System (EC-CAS) is designated as the ‘truth’ in an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) and sampled with the observational coverage from each observing sequence, yielding two sets of synthetic XCO2 observations. The GEOS-Chem CO2 adjoint is used to evaluate the ability of the different synthetic datasets to constrain surface CO2 fluxes. The combination of two model systems in this OSSE enables assessment of the sensitivity of the fluxes to transport errors as well as biases in the OCO-2 observations, leading to a more robust overall assessment of the strengths and weakness of the two observing sequences.",

Calcite dissolution and gypsum precipitation are expected to occur when injecting CO2 in a limestone reservoir with sulfate-rich resident brine. If the reservoir is fractured, these reactions will take place mainly in the fractures which serve as conduits for flow of fluids. As a consequence, the structure of the fractures will vary leading to changes in their hydraulic and transport properties. In this study, a set of percolation experiments which consisted of injecting CO2-rich solutions through limestone fractured cores were performed under P = 150 bar and T = 60 ºC. Different flow rates ranging from 0.2 to 60 mL/h and sulfate-rich and sulfate-free solutions were used.\nVariation in fracture volume induced by calcite dissolution and gypsum precipitation was measured by means of X-ray computed microtomography (XCMT) and aqueous chemistry. An increase in flow rate led to an increase in volume of dissolved limestone per unit of time, which indicated that calcite dissolution in the fracture was transport controlled. Moreover, the dissolution pattern varied from face dissolution to wormhole formation and uniform dissolution by increasing the flow rate (i.e., Pe from 1 to 346). Fracture permeability always increased and depended on the forming dissolution pattern.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing observations of CO2 offer the opportunity to reduce uncertainty in global carbon flux estimates. However, a number of studies have shown that inversion flux estimates are strongly influenced by errors in model transport. We will present results from modeling studies designed to quantify how such errors influence simulations of surface and column CO2 mixing ratios. These studies were conducted using the Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS-5) Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) and the implementation of a suite of tracers associated with errors in boundary layer, convective, and large scale transport. Unlike traditional tagged tracers which are emitted by a certain process or region, error tracers are emitted as air parcels are transported through the atmosphere. The magnitude of error tracer emissions is based on previously published ensembles of AGCM simulations with perturbations to subgrid convective and boundary layer transport, and on comparisons of several reanalysis products to estimate errors in large scale wind fields. Transport error tracers are simulated with several different e-folding lifetimes (e.g. 1, 4, 10, and 30 day) to examine differences between transient and persistent model errors. This quantification of transport error is then used in an illustrative Bayesian synthesis inversion to demonstrate how transport errors influence surface CO2 mixing ratios and how this translates into inferred biosphere flux error.",

            "abstract": "The colorless sulfur bacteria are non-photosynthetic chemolithotrophs that live at interfaces between nitrate, or oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide. In sulfidic settings such as cold seeps and oxygen minimum zones, these bacteria are thought to constitute a critical node in the geochemical cycling of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Many of these bacteria remain uncultivated and their metabolisms and physiologies are incompletely understood. Thiomargarita namibiensis is the largest of these sulfur bacteria, with individual cells reaching millimetric diameters. Despite the current inability to maintain a Thiomargarita culture in the lab, their large size allows for individual cells to be followed in time course experiments. Here we report on the novel use of a tetrazolium-based dye that measures the flux of NADH production from catabolic pathways via a colorimetric response. Staining with this dye allows for metabolism to be detected, even in the absence of observable cell division. When coupled to microscopy, this approach also allows for metabolism in Thiomargaritato be differentiated from that of epibionts or contaminants in xenic samples.\nThe results of our tetrazolium dye-based assay suggests that Thiomargarita is the most metabolically versatile under anoxic conditions where it appears capable of using acetate, succinate, formate, thiosulfate, citrate, thiotaurine, hydrogen sulfide, and perhaps hydrogen as electron donors. Under hypoxic conditions, staining results suggest the utilization of acetate, citrate, and hydrogen sulfide. Cells incubated under oxic conditions showed the weakest tetrazolium staining response, and then only to hydrogen sulfide and questionably succinate. These initial results using a redox sensitive dye suggest that Thiomargarita is most metabolically versatile under anaerobic and hypoxic conditions. The results of this assay can be further evaluated using molecular approaches such as transcriptomics, as well as provide cultivation strategies.",

            "abstract": "In the outer radiation belt, quasilinear diffusive radial transport of electrons assumes a superposition of very many tiny radial displacements. Recent test particle simulations have called into question the appropriateness of the quasilinear approximation. Specifically, magnetic impulses and drift-resonant phenomena may not constitute very many, and probably do not constitute tiny, radial displacements. Quasilinear, impulsive, and drift resonant radial transport processes all have different signatures in the drift phase structure of electrons. We present an initial case study of examples of the different categories of drift phase structure, with the aim of eventually performing a statistical characterization: how significant is each kind of transport during a storm, and how does the type of solar wind driver affect the distribution of radial transport mechanisms? We use data from the SCATHA and GOES missions whose orbits provide 100% residence time on the drift shells through which electrons must travel to reach the outer zone from the plasma sheet.",

            "abstract": "Deep convective storms greatly influence the vertical distribution of aerosols by transporting aerosols from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and by removing aerosols through wet scavenging processes. Model representation of wet scavenging is a major uncertainty in simulating the vertical distribution of aerosols due partly to limited constraints by observations. The effect of wet scavenging on ambient aerosols in deep mid-latitude continental convective clouds is studied for a severe storm case in the vicinity of the ARM Southern Great Plains site on May 29, 2012 during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Project (DC3) field campaign. A new budget analysis approach is developed to characterize the convective transport to the upper troposphere based on the vertical distribution of several slowly reacting and nearly insoluble trace gases (i.e., CO, acetone, and benzene). A similar budget framework is applied to aerosols combined with the known transport efficiency to estimate wet-scavenging efficiency. The chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Chem) simulates the storm initiation timing and structure reasonably well when compared against radar observations from the NSSL national 3-D reflectivity Mosaic data. Simulated vertical profiles of humidity and temperature also closely agree with radiosonde measurements before and during the storm. High scavenging efficiencies (~80%) for aerosol number (Dp < 2.5μm) and mass (Dp < 1μm) are obtained from the observations. Both observation analyses and the simulation show that, between the two dominant aerosol species, organic aerosol shows a slightly higher scavenging efficiency than sulfate aerosol, and higher scavenging efficiency is found for larger particle sizes (0.15 - 2.5μm versus 0.03 - 0.15μm). However, the model underestimates the wet scavenging efficiency (by up to 50%), in general, for both mass and number concentrations. The effect of neglecting secondary activation above cloud base on this underestimation is quantified by comparing the standard simulation with a simulation that includes a newly implemented secondary activation scheme. A new treatment of ice-borne aerosol is also coupled to the Morrison microphysical scheme in WRF-Chem to improve the representation of aerosol wet scavenging.",

            "abstract": "Significant advances have been achieved in generating soil moisture (SM) data products from satellite remote sensing and/or land surface modeling with reasonably good accuracy in recent years. However, the discrepancies among the different SM data products can be considerably large, which hampers their usage in various applications. The bias of one SM product from another data source is well recognized in the literature. Bias estimation and correction methods have been well documented for assimilating satellite SM product into land surface and hydrologic models. Nevertheless, understanding the characteristics of each of these SM data products is required for many applications where the most accurate data products are desirable. This study inter-compares SM data products from six different sources over the period of 2007 to 2010. Specifically, four microwave (MW) satellite based data sets (ECV, SMOPS, WINDSAT and ASCAT), one thermal infrared (TIR) satellite based product (ALEXI), and the Noah land surface model (LSM) simulations. The in-situ SM measurements from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD), which involves more than 600 ground sites from a variety of networks, are used to evaluate the accuracies of each of these six SM data products. In general, each of the six SM products is capable of capturing the dry/wet patterns over the study period. However, the absolute SM values among the six products vary significantly. SM simulations from Noah LSM are more stable relative to the satellite-based products. Both TIR and MW satellite based products are relatively noisier than the Noah LSM simulations. Even though MW satellite based SM retrievals have been predominantly used in the past years, SM retrievals the ALEXI model based on TIR satellite observations demonstrate skills equivalent to all the MW satellite retrievals. Among the four MW SM data products, the merged ECV product exhibits the highest correlation with both Noah LSM estimates and in-situ SM measurements while the blended product produced from SMOPS exhibits smaller biases and RMSEs than each of the individual products (ASCAT and WINDSAT).",

            "abstract": "To remain hot, permanent lava lakes require a continuous connection to a magma reservoir. Depending on the state of the conduit, changes in magma pressure could result in changes in the lake level (hydraulic head) or be accommodated elastically leading to surface deformation. Observing deformation is therefore key to understanding the plumbing system associated with lava lakes. However, the majority of the world’s lava lakes lie in difficult socio-economic or remote locations meaning that there are few ground-based observations, and it is often necessary to rely on satellite imagery.\nKarthala volcano experienced a sequence of eruptions in April 2005, Nov 2005, May 2006 and Jan 2007. The first 3 took place at the Choungou Chahale crater, which typically contains either a water or lava lake; the last formed a new pit crater to the north. Satellite thermal imagery (Hirn et al, 2008) does not show an anomaly during the first eruption, which had a phreatomagmatic component, but large thermal anomalies, associated with an ephemeral lava lake were detected during the Nov 2005 and May 2006 eruptions. The final eruption produced a smaller anomaly attributed to a minor lava flow.\nHere we present InSAR observations from 2004-2010. We find no significant deformation associated with the first three eruptions, but the January 2007 eruption was associated with ~25 cm of deformation near the volcano’s summit, characteristic of a dyke intrusion aligned with the northern rift zone. We also observe an unusual pattern deformation along the coast which may be attributed to rapid settling of soft sediment or recent volcanic deposits triggered by seismic activity.\nWe propose that the first eruption cleared the reservoir-summit connection and interacted with the water in Choungou Chahale. The following eruptions formed a lava lake, but without causing deformation. By the final eruption, the conduit had become blocked and magma intruded along the rift zone causing deformation but no thermal anomaly. The dyke intersected the surface at Choungou Chagnoumeni.\nAt Karthala volcano, no deformation is associated with lava lake activity, but when the conduit is blocked, magma intrudes along the rift zone causing deformation. This is in contrast to observations at Kileauea in Hawaii, where both lake level changes and deformation occur simultaneously.",

Thus developing a predictive capability for MeV electron levels as well as understanding the physics have been deemed critical for both space research and industry communities. In this work, we first demonstrate that a high cross-energy cross-pitch-angle coherence exists between the trapped ~MeV electrons and precipitating ~100s KeV electrons—observed respectively by Van Allen Probes and NOAA POES satellites in different orbits—by conducting a correlation survey on measurements from both high- and low-altitudes. Then, based upon the results, we further test the possibility of using a linear prediction filter model, driven by POES observations from low-Earth-orbits, to predict the energization of MeV electrons after geomagnetic storms, as well as the evolving distributions of MeV electrons in real time. Finally, to account for this high coherence, we provide our hypothesis based upon theoretical calculations and numerical simulations for individual events using diffusion codes with realistic particle and wave inputs from missions including Van Allen Probes. Results from this study unveil new knowledge on radiation belt dynamics, add new science significance to a long existing space infrastructure, and provide practical and useful tools to the whole space community.",

            "abstract": "Modulated HF heating of the ionosphere in the presence of natural ionospheric current sources has been used as a method to generate electromagnetic ELF/VLF waves since the 1970's. In the ~1-5 kHz band, the amplitude and phase of the received ELF/VLF signal depends on the amplitude and phase of the conductivity modulation generated throughout the HF-heated ionospheric body, as well as on the signal propagation parameters (i.e., the attenuation and phase constants) between each of the current sources and the receiver. Recent signal processing advances have produced an accurate ELF/VLF time-of-arrival (TOA) analysis technique that differentiates line-of-sight and ionospherically-reflected signal components, determining the amplitude and phase of each component observed at the receiver. This TOA method requires a wide bandwidth (> 2.5 kHz) and therefore is relatively insensitive to the frequency-dependent nature of ELF/VLF wave propagation. In this paper, we present an improved ELF/VLF TOA method that is capable of providing high frequency resolution. The new analysis technique is applied to experimental observations of ELF/VLF signals generated by modulated heating at HAARP. We present measurements of the amplitude and phase of the received ELF/VLF signal as a function of frequency and compare the results with the predictions of an HF heating model.",

            "abstract": "Afforestation is a viable and widely practiced method of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, recent studies have projected inadvertent consequences of planting forests over previously non-forested land. Because of a change in surface albedo from more reflective grasslands, crops, and tundra, the relatively darker forest canopy can cause an increase in net radiation at the surface, resulting in localized warming. This effect is further enhanced in far northern latitudes where the prevalence of snow cover exacerbates the albedo difference during the winter months. Using a dynamic vegetation model with model enhancements to accurately simulate the growth cycle of conifer vegetation, simulations were run over the northern latitudes of the US and Canada, with additional analysis focusing on Minnesota. The goal of this study is to examine the competing effects of enhanced carbon sequestration versus localized surface warming. This analysis can assist in determining where forests may be a benefit to the global climate (i.e., where carbon sequestration exceeds increased net radiation and surface warming). Using the State of Minnesota as an example, this approach is used to assess the efficacy of carbon sequestration to offset the projected increase in statewide greenhouse gas emissions, which are mandated to be reduced by 80% of 2005 levels by 2050. Our analysis suggests that over an 80-year time span, the average annual net ecosystem exchange of carbon would only offset 15% of 2005 emissions as a result of planting conifer forests over the entire state of Minnesota and lead to significant regional warming because of a lower surface albedo. Additionally, results show that the optimal time frame in which carbon sequestration exceeds the detrimental biophysical effects is on the order of 45-55 years, thus suggesting that large-scale land management (i.e., planting and harvesting) would be required every century to maintain a climate benefit. These results can provide needed information to policymakers evaluating carbon sequestration strategies.",

Ionospheric observations of total electron content during the current solar cycle have shown that variability associated with meteorological forcing is important during solar minimum, and can have significant ionospheric effects during solar medium to maximum conditions. Numerical models can be used to study the comparative importance of geomagnetic and meterological forcing.\nThis study focuses on the January 2013 Stratospheric Sudden Warming (SSW) period, which is associated with a very disturbed middle atmosphere as well as with moderately disturbed solar geomagntic conditions. We employ the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) with a nudging scheme using Whole-Atmosphere-Community-Climate-Model-Extended (WACCM-X)/Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS5) results to simulate the effects of the meteorological and solar wind forcing on the upper atmosphere. The model results are evaluated by comparing with observations e.g., TEC, NmF2, ion drifts. We study the effect of the SSW on the wave spectrum, and the associated changes in the low latitude vertical drifts. These changes are compared to the impact of the moderate geomagnetic forcing on the TI-system during the January 2013 time period by conducting numerical experiments. We will present select highlights from our study and elude to the comparative importance of the forcing from above and below as simulated by the TIME-GCM.",

Satellite and ground observations were used to derive NOx trends, which were compared with the emissions data used by NAQFC indicating improved agreement over large metropolitan areas in the US. Updates to the chemical mechanism are being tested for operational implementation.\nRecent testing of PM2.5 predictions is relying on National Emission Inventory (NEI) inputs augmented by real time sources from wildfires and dust storms.

            "abstract": "Satellite imagery covers volcanoes globally throughout their eruptive cycles, independent of ground-based monitoring and thus InSAR can give information on both intrusive and extrusive processes at a large number of volcanoes in a range of tectonic settings. Not all deformation is followed by an eruption, nor are all eruptions preceded by measureable deformation. In many cases volcanic deformation is linked to magma intrusion, instability of the volcanic edifice or changes in the hydrothermal system.\nHere we provide a summary of global observations of volcano deformation and carry out a probabilistic analysis of the link between deformation and eruption. We show that, of the 198 volcanoes systematically observed for the past 18 years, 54 deformed, of which 25 also erupted. In terms of assessing eruption potential, this substantial proportion of deforming volcanoes that also erupted (46%), together with the very high proportion of non-deforming volcanoes that did not erupt (94%) shows that deformation status represents ‘strong’ evidential worth. From the perspective of the growth of continental crust, it demonstrates that roughly half of all deformation-generating episodes occurred at volcanoes with no recent eruptions.\n Next, using a larger catalogue of 540 volcanoes observed for 3 years, we demonstrate how this eruption–deformation relationship is influenced by tectonic, petrological and volcanic factors. Deformation and eruption are most directly linked (a higher PPV) for hotspot regions (0.33), basaltic (0.29) and andesitic compositions (0.34) and most weakly linked for rhyolite/dacite compositions (0.17), calderas (0.25) and rift settings (0.13). This indicates that tectonic setting and crustal stress state play primary roles in determining the proportion of subsurface and extrusive events.\nSatellite technology is rapidly evolving and routine monitoring of the deformation status of all volcanoes from space is anticipated, meaning probabilistic approaches will increasingly inform hazard decisions and strategic development, and could also be used to inform the debate on continental growth.",

Occasionally, the coupled evolution between weather systems and jet streaks produce extreme wave activity along the waveguide permitting strong jet streaks to meander to latitudes they are not typically found. This talk will examine such occurrences, specifically, when strong tropopause jet streaks are present over the North Pole. A climatological (1979-2013) analysis suggests that the annual frequency of strong tropopause jet wind speeds over the pole is decreasing with time. This talk will examine the seasonality of North Pole tropopause jet streak occurrence and the potential link to the Arctic Dipole pattern.

            "abstract": "The style of oceanic detachment faulting varies both along and away from the ridge axis. We examine the characteristics of detachment footwalls using regional bathymetry data and high-resolution data collected by AUV Sentry near 16.5N at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The distance of the fault termination from the volcanic axis combined with the slope of the emerging detachment footwall has been used to infer the subsurface shape of the fault. In fact, the location of the termination and slope of the fault near the termination reflect the volume of volcanic infill at the ridge axis. The termination will be far from the volcanic axis where the volume of lava is sufficient to cover the fault surface and conversely, the termination will be closer to the axis in areas where volcanic eruptions are small. In areas of large volcanic infill where lavas have flowed onto the shallow-dipping fault surface, Sentry bathymetry data show that the volcanic morphology of the hanging wall is extremely deformed. As a detachment extends and moves away from the axis the high-resolution bathymetry data show that landslides develop on some detachments but not others, possibly reflecting the underlying lithology. We observe that a massif with km-scale corrugations, probably underlain by competent gabbros, does not show significant mass wasting. At another detachment, where altered lower crustal and upper mantle rocks were sampled, headwall scars with relief of < 30 m are observed only a few km from the termination. Farther off-axis on crust > 1 Ma, high-resolution bathymetry data show a landscape profoundly affected by landslides. Large sections of the surface have collapsed producing large headwall scars with relief of up to 200 m. Adjacent semicircular collapses leave spurs between them that are elongated close to the slip direction. The spurs have wavelengths of a few km and could be misinterpreted as relict corrugations from the regional bathymetry.",

            "abstract": "Recent concerns about wetland restoration have highlighted the potential conflict of the hydrological and ecological benefits of wetlands and greenhouse gas emissions particularly methane. Therefore it is pivotal to quantify emission rates and effects of meteorological, hydrological and ecological drivers of methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in wetlands. Fast methane (CH4) gas analyzers are now enabling continuous ecosystem scale measurements and assessment. We have set up two eddy flux stations – one in a natural and one in a restored tidal salt marsh in the Meadowlands of New Jersey (MNJ). Continuous methane fluxes were measured with the LI7700 over two growing seasons at the restored site and one season at the natural wetland site. Additional measurements with chambers were conducted at several locations in each site. In October 2012, hurricane Sandy caused a tidal surge 1.6 m above high tide, increasing salinity and water level for two hours at the sites. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions were highly variable in space and time over the two growing season. Whereby, there was a significant correlation between the CO2 fluxes in the two sites with each other, the temporal dynamics of methane fluxes in each of the sites was not correlated with the other site, suggesting small-scale site-specific controls on methane emissions, but ubiquitous controls on carbon dioxide uptake and release. At both sites methane production and emission is highest during the growing season. In general, ecosystem scale methane emissions at the natural wetland site were lower than at the restored wetland site in 2013. Before and after hurricane Sandy, carbon dioxide fluxes at the restored site were comparable, but slightly decreased at the natural wetland site, signaling great resilience in the system due to external perturbations. Methane emission as measured with the eddy covariance technique as well as the chamber technique increased at the restored site from 2012 to 2013 consistent with an increase in dissolved organic carbon belowground, potentially signaling an effect of hurricane Sandy.",

            "abstract": "Animal production exerts significant demand on land, water and food resources and is an extensive means by which humans modify natural systems. Demand for animal source foods has more than tripled over the past 50 years due to population growth and dietary change. To meet this demand, livestock intensification (e.g. concentrated animal feeding operations) has increased and with it the water, nitrogen and carbon footprints of animal production. However, grass-fed systems continue to contribute significantly to overall animal production. To date, little is known about the contributions of grass- and grain-fed systems to animal calorie production, how this has changed through time and to what extent these two systems are sensitive to climate. Using a calorie-based approach we hypothesize that grain-fed systems are increasing in importance (with serious implications for water and nutrient demand) and that rangeland productivity is correlated with rainfall. Our findings show that grass-fed systems made up the majority of animal calorie production since 1960 years but that the relative contribution of grain-fed system has increased (from 27% to 49%). This rapid transition towards grain-fed animal production is largely a result of changing diets demand, as we found the growth of grass-fed production only kept pace with population growth. On a regional scale, we find that Asia has been the major contributor to the increase in grass-fed animal calorie production and that Africa has undergone the most drastic transition from grass-fed to grain-fed dependence. Finally, as expected we see a positive relationship between rangeland productivity and precipitation and a shift from dairy- to meat-dominated production going from drier to wetter climates. This study represents a new means of analyzing the food security of animal products and an important step in understanding the historic trends of animal production, their relation to climate, their prospects for the future and their implications for freshwater resources and nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "Since 2009, seasonal field campaigns have been conducted by the 7 Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) project throughout the Maritime Continent to study the lifecycle and meteorological impacts of aerosol particles. However given the complex interactions between air, land and sea in the region, aerosol impact studies are significantly confounded by a host of meteorological phenomena. At the same time, aerosol and other compositional studies add a new perspective on atmospheric processes. In this presentation we briefly outline aerosol lifecycle connections to the phases of ENSO, IOD, and the MJO as observed in measurements made through networks and intensive operations periods. However, our focus is on the ramification of these observations on aerosol-cloud relationships at more regional and local levels. Connections between the MJO and tropical cyclone formation as well as the advection of lower free tropospheric dry layers frame aerosol-convection relationships. The frequent formation of trans-MC squall lines and their associated cold pools significantly modifies common conceptual models of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction. We close with a list of suggested tropical meteorology research topics and questions which we believe are most relevant to understanding atmospheric composition in this region.",

In the past, raw data were collected first in the field and then processed back in the laboratory to achieve fully corrected publication-ready flux results. This post-processing consumed significant amount of time and resources, and precluded researchers from accessing near real-time final flux results.\nA new automated measurement system with novel hardware and software designs was developed, tested, and deployed starting late 2013. The major advancements with this automated flux system include:\n1) Enabling logging high-frequency, three-dimensional wind speeds and multiple gas densities (CO2, H2O and CH4), low-frequency meteorological data, and site metadata simultaneously through a specially designed file format\n2) Conducting fully corrected, real-time on-site flux computations using conventional as well as user-specified methods, by implementing EddyPro Software on a small low-power microprocessor\n3) Providing precision clock control and coordinate information for data synchronization and inter-site data comparison by incorporating a GPS and Precision Time Protocol.\nAlong with these innovations, a data management server application was also developed to chart fully corrected real-time fluxes to assist remote system monitoring, to send e-mail alerts, and to automate data QA/QC, transfer and archiving at individual stations or on a network level.\nCombination of all of these functions was designed to help save substantial amount of time and costs associated with managing a research site by eliminating the post-field data processing, reducing user errors and facilitating real-time access to fully corrected flux results. The design, functionality, and test results from this new eddy covariance measurement tool will be presented.",

The nature of its changes within a changing climate, and the connection of these changes to cloud-climate feedbacks, however, are not well-understood at present. The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) climatology, an updated version of the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) CLWP dataset, seamlessly blends observations from many different passive microwave sensors over the past 26 years in order to create a robust, long-term record of CLWP. With this dataset, we are able to observe trends and interannual variability in CLWP with some degree of statistical significance. Present day climate models (those comprising the CMIP3 and CMIP5 collections) aim to accurately represent cloud feedbacks and, directly related to this, capture interannual variability in several different cloud variables including CLWP. In this work, we present the long-term evolution of CLWP in a few characteristic regions around the globe using the MAC-LWP dataset, and compare it to the simulated evolution of CLWP in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models.

We extend the recently developed climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) to the middle atmosphere (MCFRAM) to quantify the temperature changes contributed from the external forcing and different feedback processes in the middle atmosphere climate system. The MCFRAM is applied to two sets of data to diagnose the middle atmosphere climate sensitivity. One is the temperature and ozone fields measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometer and the other is the model output fields derived from the Goddard Earth Observing System chemistry-climate model (GEOSCCM). It is found that the globally averaged partial temperature change due to all radiative processes is approximately equal to the observed temperature change, ranging from −0.5 K near 20 km to −1.5 K near 70 km from the solar maximum to the solar minimum, with the largest partial temperature change being due to the variation of the input solar flux. The temperature responses to variations of CO2, O3 and solar flux have distinctly different spatial structures. The seasonality of the middle atmosphere climate sensitivity is also presented using MCFRAM diagnosis based on the output fields by various ensemble runs of the GEOSCCM.",

            "abstract": "Detailed, high quality, marine total field magnetic data has been recently acquired over parts of the South Atlantic ocean off the southwestern margin of South Africa. These data display a pattern of well-defined, NW-SE striking linear magnetic anomalies along the margin that can be traced with confidence over distances > 150 km. The anomalies are interpreted to be M-series seafloor spreading anomalies M9 to M11, which are consistent with the initiation of seafloor spreading around 135 Ma (Late Valanginian). Corresponding M-series anomalies M9 and M10 have previously been reported for the conjugate South American margin offshore Argentina, however the presence of the M11 series SE of the Cape Lineament suggests an earlier opening of the southern South Atlantic basin than previously recognized.\nBreaks in the continuity of the linear anomaly pattern, observed in map view, have generally NE-SW trends and are considered sites of possible fracture zones. One such discontinuity, which we have termed the “Cape Lineament” (CL), marks a significant change in crustal character and Cretaceous depositional history, as revealed by gravity data and seismic reflection data respectively. Crust NW of CL appears to be characterized by greater thicknesses and the presence of seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs), whereas crust SE of CL has more “normal” oceanic thicknesses and SDRs that are either absent or more limited in areal extent. Although linear magnetic anomalies are observed both NW and SE of CL, anomalies to the SE display a better correlation with those predicted by our seafloor spreading model.",

An understanding of the transport of PUIs in the heliosphere is important.\nHere, we solve the transport equation to examine the detailed spatial evolution of the PUI distri-\nbution in supersonic solar wind. The effects of second-order Fermi process, i.e. velocity diffusion,\nconvection with the solar wind, adiabatic cooling and continual injection of newly born PUIs are\nall included. We analyze the transition of PUIs at the heliospheric termination shock (TS) and\ndescribe the heliosheath PUI distribution taking into account ongoing velocity diffusion. A three-\ndimensional, MHD-kinetic model for flows of a thermal plasma, neutral atoms and PUIs has been\ndeveloped. The flow of the plasma is modeled using solutions to MHD equations. The PUI transport\nmodule analyzes the spatial variation of the PUI distribution function as a separate component, on\na kinetic level. We perform a comparison of our numerical results with observations made by New\nHorizons, Ulysses and Voyager. Fluxes of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) with energies of about\n0.2-6 keV originating through charge exchange of H atoms with the compressed solar wind and\nwith PUIs behind the TS and arriving at 1 AU are calculated. Our results are directly comparable\nwith the actual IBEX distributed ENA sky maps. A comparison of our numerical results with\nmeasurements performed by IBEX will allow us to answer the challenging question: how the PUI\ndistribution affects the ENA fluxes from the heliosheath?",

            "abstract": "The Weddell Sea basin is of particular significance for understanding climate processes, including the generation of ocean water masses and their influence on ocean circulation as well as the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheets. Seismic stratigraphic and drill data from the Weddell Sea and the margin have provided much direct evidence concerning ice sheet evolution and sediment transportation processes. More than 250 seismic lines and ODP Leg 113 drilling sites are applied to gain the age control of the sedimentation. Using these constraints, we calculate grids to depict the depths, thicknesses and sedimentation rates of pre-glacial (145-34 Ma), transitional (34-15 Ma) and full-glacial (15 Ma to present) units. These grids allow us to compare the sedimentary regimes of the pre-glacially dominated and glacially dominated stages of Weddell Sea history. We further calculate paleobathymetric grids at 15 Ma, 34 Ma, and 120 Ma by using a backstripping technique. The paleobathymetric grid of 15 Ma has been applied for the climate model test, which shows that the Weddell gyre centre was southward shifted. This result is consistent with the warm period of the middle Miocene with relatively less see ice and higher temperature in the Weddell Sea.\nA case study has been focused on a series of iceberg erosional and current reworked features like the giant elongate mounded sediment drifts and mass transporting deposits (MTDs) along the continental margin of the southeast Weddell Sea from the middle Miocene to the present. The giant sediment drifts are ascribed to the large catchments area with the fast (paleo) ice streams associated with Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf and bottom water. A remarkable increase in MTDs in the late Miocene and middle Pliocene strata is related to ice dynamics, overpressure of rapid sediment accumulation and the steep topographic gradients. Our studies and data also provide the significant contribution for the future drilling plans in the Weddell Sea.",

            "abstract": "Gasoline spills in surface waters generally volatilize due to their low miscibility and high volatility. However, biofuel blends may contain ethanol, a compound completely miscible in water. As hazardous components of gasoline are more soluble in ethanol than in water, the presence of ethanol increases the solubilization of these components, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), in surface water. Furthermore, many of these spills may occur in water bodies that have sediments that are historically contaminated with persistent organic contaminants such as organochlorine pesticides. High concentrations of ethanol in the water column, along with solubilized components of gasoline, may increase the desorption of organochlorine pesticides from the sediment. Thus spills of ethanol/gasoline fuel blends have the potential of increasing concentrations of hazardous compounds in rivers and lakes, resulting in increased risk for human and ecological exposure.\nUsing UNIFAC to calculate activity coefficients, one can predict the enhancement of the solubility of pesticides in the aqueous phase as the ethanol fraction increases. Moreover, by predicting the solubility of pesticides in both the aqueous phase and an organic liquid phase, one can construct ternary phase diagrams that show the partitioning behavior of pesticides as a function of ethanol fraction. Such information is useful in estimating the amount of desorption from contaminated sediments that may occur in the presence of biofuel spills. In order to confirm the predicted values, experiments have been conducted to measure the impact of ethanol on the partitioning coefficients of pesticides.",

            "abstract": "An updated database of earthquake focal mechanisms is compiled for the Sicilian region (southern Italy) and surrounding off-shore areas where the Nubia-Eurasia convergence coexists with the very-slow residual rollback of the Ionian subducting slab. High-quality solutions selected from literature and catalogs have been integrated with new solutions estimated in the present work using the Cut And Paste (CAP) waveform inversion method. In the CAP algorithm (Zhao and Helmberger, 1994; Zhu and Helmberger, 1996), each waveform is broken up into Pnl and surface wave segments, which are weighted differently during the inversion procedure. Integration of the new solutions with the ones selected from literature and official catalogs led us to collect a database consisting exclusively of waveform inversion data relative to earthquakes with minimum magnitude 2.6. The seismicity and focal mechanism distributions have been compared with crustal motion and strain data coming from GNSS analyses. For this purpose GNSS-based observations collected over the investigated area by episodic measurements (1994-2013) as well as continuous monitoring (since 2006) were processed by the GAMIT/GLOBK software packages (Herring et al., 2010) following the approach described in Palano et al. (2011). To adequately investigate the crustal deformation pattern, the estimated GNSS velocities were aligned to a fixed Eurasian reference frame. The good agreement found between seismic and geodetic information contributes to better define seismotectonic domains characterized by different kinematics. Moving from the available geophysical information and from an early application of FEM algorithms, we have also started to investigate stress/strain fields in the crust of the study area including depth dependence and relationships with rupture of the main seismogenic structures.",

            "abstract": "California is amongst the top rice producing states in the USA, and more than 95 percent of California’s rice is grown in the Sacramento Valley. Based on older literature, the rice water requirement (ETc), ranges between 914 and 1,100 mm. In this study, the actual rice water requirement was measured using the residual of the energy balance method over three paddy rice fields during 2011-2013 seasons in the Sacramento Valley. Net radiation and ground heat flux density were measured, and both eddy covariance (EC) and the surface renewal (SR) technique were employed to determine the sensible heat flux density. The surface renewal method uses high frequency temperature measurements from fine wire thermocouples above the canopy. Mean amplitude and duration of the ramps over half hour periods were determined using a structure function and the characteristics are employed to estimate the direction and magnitude of sensible heat flux using the ratio of the amplitude to the ramp duration as the change in temperature per unit time and the volumetric heat capacity of the air to estimate the magnitude of the heat flux. In the study, 76.2 mm diameter chromel-constantan thermocouples were used to measure high frequency temperature at 10 Hz.\nThe results indicate that there is considerable variability in rice water use both spatially and temporally. The average three-year measured ET of the experimental fields located in Butte County was 734 and 725 mm; and in Colusa County was 771 mm. A typical crop coefficient (Kc) curve was derived from the measured ETc and reference ET (ETo) data. Spatial estimates of monthly climate data from the Sacramento Valley were used to calculate monthly mean ETo, and smooth curve fits of the monthly data gave estimates of typical daily ETo. The daily ETc was calculated as the product of ETo and Kc, and seasonal ETc was calculated by summing the daily ETc values. The results reveal that the seasonal rice ETc was less than earlier estimates. Surface renewal equipment is relatively inexpensive and it provides rice growers with remote monitoring of water consumption by tracking ETc of the paddy fields; and hence assists them to improve rice water use efficiency. The information provided here is useful for determining volumes of water for water transfers and insuring adequate water supplies for optimal production.",

            "abstract": "Drought has cascading effects on the environment, economy and society. Seasonal water deficits resulting from natural variability in rainfall coupled with increased demands have severe implications for the adequacy of water storage in both surface and groundwater stores. Managers need better estimates of potential shortfalls in supply due to droughts of varying severity and duration. While global and national drought indicators exist, none directly connect existing or projected water demand to the potential deficit during the drought. They are essentially supply based. However, the temporal patterns of both demand and supply ultimately determine the stress or impact. Consequently, assessment of risk for various sectorial operations could be much better informed if appropriate stress indices were developed for drought conditions relative to current and projected demands, and their likelihood assessed for future climate scenarios.\nThe present research addresses this methodological gap by (1) developing new drought indices that consider both water supply and current or projected sectorial demands, and (2) developing insights into the large-scale climatic drivers for forecasting drought onset, duration and severity up to one season ahead for climate informed adaptive risk assessment and long-term planning.\nWe present an application at a county level for the conterminous United States considering more than 60 years of rainfall data as the renewable supply, and water demand patterns for 3 sectors (agricultural, industrial, and domestic use). The demand data are available at the county level. Consequently, we use the county rather than river basins as the unit of analysis. The county is also a spatial resolution consistent with political decision making. The index is useful for indicating whether small or large surface storage will suffice, or whether the extent of groundwater storage or external transfers, or changes in demand are needed to achieve a sustainable solution.",

            "abstract": "Ice streams are regions of fast flow within ice sheets that can exhibit variability on time scales ranging from years to millennia. Observations and model reconstructions indicate that ice streams likely played a major role in the most recent deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The variability of these ice streams may have dictated the spatiotemporal progression of deglaciation, as some ice sheet domes may have been more sensitive to dynamic changes in ice stream activity.\nWe analyze the behavior of both idealized and realistic ice sheet configurations to determine the role of ice streams in setting ice sheet steady states and the spatiotemporal sequence of deglacial transitions. We also examine the way in which climate feedbacks could have amplified the response of ice streams to Milankovitch forcing, thereby initiating ice sheet collapse. We use the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), by itself and coupled to an energy balance atmospheric model. The presence of ice streams dramatically alters steady-state ice sheet configurations, allowing for the existence of thin, widely extended margins. There is a marked transition from binge-purge-like ice stream variability (that is believed to have occurred as part of Heinrich events during the last glacial period) to steady ice stream flow as climate (temperature, precipitation) is varied over a range corresponding to glacial variability. This qualitative transition in ice sheet dynamics amplifies small changes in external forcing (e.g. Milankovitch cycles) sufficiently to activate strong climate feedbacks. We discuss how the reorganization of ice sheet configuration, through changes in ice sheet extent and elevation, may favor certain climate feedbacks (e.g. ice-albedo and lapse rate feedbacks). We also relate these analyses to observations of Laurentide deglaciation and discuss implications for the future of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.",

This will comprise data from both a statistical and a dynamic downscaling process, each interpolated to the SRS.\nWe require variables most relevant to operational activities at the site (such as the US Forest Service’s forest management program), and select temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity as being most relevant to energy and water resource requirements, fire and forest ecology, and facility and worker safety. We then develop projections of the means and extremes of these variables, estimate the effect on site operations, and develop long-term mitigation strategies. For example, given that outdoor work while wearing protective gear is a daily facet of site operations, heat stress is of primary importance to work planning, and we use the downscaled data to estimate changes in the occurrence of high temperatures.\nFor the statistical downscaling, we use global climate model (GCM) data from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project, version 5 (CMIP-5), which was used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). GCM data from five research groups was selected, and two climate change scenarios – RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 – are used with observed data from site instruments and other databases to produce the downscaled projections.\nWe apply a quantile regression downscaling method, which involves the use of the observed cumulative distribution function to correct that of the GCM. This produces a downscaled projection with an interannual variability closer to that of the observed data and allows for more extreme values in the projections, which are often absent in GCM data.\nThe statistically downscaled data is complemented with dynamically downscaled data from the NARCCAP database, which comprises output from regional climate models forced with GCM output from the CMIP-3 database of GCM simulations. Applications of the downscaled climate projections to some of the unique operational needs of a large DOE weapons complex site are described.",

Coupled with poverty, these factors intensify local communities’ vulnerability to climate change. This study highlights the Arun watershed in eastern Nepal as a case study to evaluate how local communities in high altitude regions are managing their water for domestic and agricultural needs while coping with extreme events, such as floods and landslides. Remotely-sensed precipitation, snowpack and glacial extent data from the past decade are combined with preliminary results from extensive field-based community surveys in the Arun watershed. The analysis of remotely-sensed data will describe seasonal trends in water availability, glacial lake growth, and the spatial variation of these trends within the basin. These hydrologic changes will be linked to the human survey analysis, which will provide an understanding of locals’ perceptions of water challenges and the current water management strategies within the basin. Particular attention will be given to a comparison between the eastern and western tributaries of the Arun River, where the catchments are mainly rain-fed (eastern) versus glacial-fed (western). This contrast will highlight how different hydrologic scenarios evidenced from remote-sensing data motivate diverse human water management responses as defined in field surveys. A particular focus will be given to management decisions related to agriculture expansion and hydropower development. This synthesis of remote-sensing and social research methodologies provides a valuable perspective on coupled human-hydrologic systems.",

            "abstract": "The Idaho National Laboratory (INL)-developed Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE; www.mooseframework.org), is an open-source, parallel computational framework for enabling the solution of complex, fully implicit multiphysics systems. MOOSE provides a set of computational tools that scientists and engineers can use to create sophisticated multiphysics simulations. Applications built using MOOSE have computed solutions for chemical reaction and transport equations, computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat conduction, mesoscale materials modeling, geomechanics, and others.\nTo facilitate the coupling of diverse and highly-coupled physical systems, MOOSE employs the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method when solving the coupled nonlinear systems of equations arising in multiphysics applications. The MOOSE framework is written in C++, and leverages other high-quality, open-source scientific software packages such as LibMesh, Hypre, and PETSc. MOOSE uses a “hybrid parallel” model which combines both shared memory (thread-based) and distributed memory (MPI-based) parallelism to ensure efficient resource utilization on a wide range of computational hardware.\nMOOSE-based applications are inherently modular, which allows for simulation expansion (via coupling of additional physics modules) and the creation of multi-scale simulations. Any application developed with MOOSE supports running (in parallel) any other MOOSE-based application. Each application can be developed independently, yet easily communicate with other applications (e.g., conductivity in a slope-scale model could be a constant input, or a complete phase-field micro-structure simulation) without additional code being written. This method of development has proven effective at INL and expedites the development of sophisticated, sustainable, and collaborative simulation tools.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the characteristics of normal faulting between the trench and outer rise in the subducting Pacific plate through analysis of high-resolution multi-beam bathymetry and geophysical data and geodynamic modeling. Analysis of multi-beam bathymetry data reveals significant variations in normal faulting characteristics along the Mariana trench: (1) The vast majority of the observed surface normal faulting scarps are observed to be sub-parallel to the local strike of the Mariana trench axis, indicating that the orientation of normal faults is predominantly controlled by subduction-related stresses rather than by pre-existing abyssal hill fabrics. (2) Trench-parallel normal fault scarps become apparant as the subducting plate approaches the outer rise of the Mariana trench, indicating that normal faulting initiates in this region. (3) Along the Mariana trench, the Challenger Deep region is associated with the greatest trench depth and largest average values of normal fault throw, while regions with seamounts near the trench axis show the smallest average values of fault throw. To explore the mechanisms that control normal faulting in a subducting plate, we perform numerical simulations of elasto-plastic plate subjected to tectonic loading, bending, and horizontal forces from slab pull. Modeling results suggest that bending-induced extensional stresses in the upper plate reaches maximum values near the outer rise, consistent with the onset of normal faulting in this region. However, bending alone does not predict the continued growth of normal faults toward the trench. We hypothesize that this additional fault growth could be related to (1) tectonic stresses induced by steep topographic slopes; and/or (2) slab pulling forces that are originated in the upper mantle due to the negative buoyancy of a subducted slab but are transmitted to the shallower part of the lithospheric plate prior to its subduction.",

            "abstract": "Floodplains and sinuous rivers have a close relationship with each other, mutually influencing their evolutions in time and space. The heterogeneity in erosional resistance has a crucial role on meander planform evolution. It depends on external factors, like land use and cover, but also on the composition of the floodplain, which is due to the ancient geological composition and to the processes associated to long-term river migration. In particular, banks erosion and deposition cause a variation of the superficial composition of the soil, therefore the river patterns are influenced by the previous trends. Based on some recent works, the aim of this contribution is to collect numerical information on the relations between meander migration and the heterogeneity of floodplains caused by oxbow lakes. Numerical simulations have been performed to analyze the temporal and spatial behavior of meanders with a range of values of the erosional resistance of the plain. These values are set as a function of some factors: the characteristic grain size of sediment transported by the flow, the deposition age of the sediments, the eventual presence of vegetation on the banks. The statistical analysis of characteristic geometrical quantities of meanders are able to show the dependence of the simulation results on the meander history. In particular we try to answer to the following questions: how do the rivers affect themselves during their spatial and temporal evolution, modifying the distribution of the floodplain erodibility? Do the migration history plays a main role on the meanders migration modeling?",

This paper discusses a \none-dimensional example of such enhancement.\nThe uncertainty algorithm discretizes the original and retrieved radiances.\nIt uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to solve the discrete linear\nequations. The discretized values populate a square matrix representing\nthe joint probability distribution between the original radiances and the\nretrieved ones. This matrix forms a finite complete probability scheme.\nThe algorithm first computes the marginal densities for the original radiance\nbins and the retrieved ones.

The cumulative conditional probability\nthen provides the basis for computing credible intervals.\nA single image does not provide a large enough sample to create \nreliable estimates of credible intervals. A Monte Carlo simulation \nprovides multiple similar images. These increase the populated cells \nin the joint probability matrix.\nThere are three interesting results from these estimates.\nFirst, the character of the SVD spatial basis set depends on the \noverlap of the PSFs. With complete separation of the PSF kernals, \nthe spatial basis acts like delta-function sampling. If \ninterpolation guesses values between the samples, it may produce \nretrievals that do not follow the original spatial variation. That \nincreases the width of the credible intervals. If the kernals \noverlap heavily, the SVD spatial basis vectors resemble Fourier \nseries having a spatially varying frequency. The retrievals can \nexhibit Gibb's phenomenon when this happens.\nSecond, the prior distribution selected for the experiment is \ndecidedly non-Gaussian. The marginal distribution for ``clear'' bars \nis disjoint from the distribution for ``cloudy'' ones. No original \nradiance has the mean value. The algorithm provides sensible \ncredible intervals that clearly identify when the PSF's resolve the \nbars.\nThird, the example retrievals illustrate Bayesian learning.

Plasmasheet electron injection, both due to enhanced convection and substorm dipolarization, provides a source population for generation of whistler mode chorus and seed population for local acceleration. We now have available ~22 months of unprecedented measurements in energy and pitch angle resolution of electrons spanning the energy range from injected plasmasheet to multi-MeV electrons from the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft in near-equatorial plane elliptical orbits, with apogee at 5.8 Re; and two Balloon Array for Relativistic Radiation Belt Electron Losses (BARREL) campaigns during January-February 2013 and 2014, each establishing a longitudinal array of precipitation measurements extending to relativistic energies via measured Bremsstrahlung x-rays. In addition to this arsenal of data, a set of modeling tools has been developed to examine dynamics of electrons in the magnetosphere. These tools calculate electron trajectories in time-dependent magnetohydrodyanmic (MHD) fields using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global MHD model coupled with the Rice Convection Model to determine the E and B field response to solar wind drivers. With these tools we can follow electron dynamics including response to Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves which cause radial transport and energization for inward radial gradient as well as enhanced loss to the magnetopause for outward gradient.\nThese tools have been applied to date to the large equinoctial storms of fall 2012, spring and fall 2013, in addition to moderate storms during BARREL balloon campaigns in both winters 2013 and 2014. Isolated substorm response can clearly be identified for the latter, while plasmasheet injection of electrons during periods of strong convection sets the stage for local acceleration by whistler mode chorus during the equinoctial storm event studies.",

            "abstract": "Pavlof Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula began to erupt on August 14, 2007 after an 11 year repose. Pavlof is the most active volcano in the Aleutians, with over 40 eruptions in historical times. The 2007 eruption began with low-frequency earthquakes and thermal anomalies. Strombolian activity occurred from a newly formed vent on the SE flank of the volcano. The plume reached 20,000 ft during the peak of the eruption on August 29th and 30th. Seismic activity, monitored by a network of 5 local instruments, consisted of low-frequency events, explosion quakes, volcanic tremor, and lahar-generated signals. Here we focus on explosion quakes. The first explosion quake occurred August 14th at 2:54pm UTC and the last on September 13th at 3:14pm UTC. Explosion events were often embedded in continuous tremor, but could be distinguished by the ground-coupled air waves, which appeared as a high-frequency spike superimposed on the lower-frequency ground waves. Rates were as high as 19 explosion quakes per minute. We establish whether systematic changes in explosion rates, signal properties, and ground-coupled air-wave amplitudes correlate with the height and ash content of the plume. First order trends show a positive correlation between increased explosion quake rates, increased amplitudes, and plume height. In addition, we investigate how atmospheric conditions such as wind speed and direction affect the recording of the ground-coupled air-wave. The time differences in the airwaves at different stations are consistent with the acoustic speed of 340 m/s, but show variations of up to 0.6 s depending on wind speed and direction. Eruptions at Pavlof typically have little or no seismic precursors; this combined with the low visibility common to the area results in Pavlof being dangerous to the many aviation routes that transverse this airspace. It is the goal of this study to determine the conditions under which explosion quake data may be reliably used for more effective monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Shield volcanoes are a common feature of basaltic volcanism. Their volcanic activity is often confined to a summit crater area and rift systems, both characterized by constructive (scoria and cinder cones; lava flows) and destructive (pit craters; caldera collapse) phenomena. Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) shield volcano (La Réunion Island, Indian Ocean) is an ideal place to study these differences in eruptive behaviour. Besides the frequent eruptions in the central Enclos Fouqué caldera, hundreds of eruptive vents opened along three main rift zones cutting the edifice during the last 50 kyrs. Two short rift zones are characterized by weak seismicity and lateral magma transport at shallow depth (above sea level). Here we focus on the third and largest rift zone (15km wide, 20 km long), which extends in a north-westerly direction between PdF and nearby Piton des Neiges volcanic complex. It is typified by deep seismicity (up to 30 km), emitting mostly primitive magmas, testifying of high fluid pressures (up to 5 kbar) and large-volume eruptions. We present new field data (including stratigraphic logs, a geological map of the area, C-14 dating and geochemical analyses of the eruption products) on one of the youngest (~6kyrs) and largest lava field (Trous Blancs eruption). It extends for 24km from a height of 1800 m asl, passing Le Tampon and Saint Pierre cities, until reaching the coast. The source area of this huge lava flow has been identified in an alignment of four previously unidentified pit craters. The eruption initiated with intense fountaining activity, producing a m-thick bed of loose black scoria, which becomes densely welded in its upper part; followed by an alternation of volume rich lava effusions and strombolian activity, resulting in the emplacement of meter-thick, massive units of olivine-basalt alternating with coarse scoria beds in the proximal area. Activity ended with the emplacement of a dm-thick bed of glassy, dense scoria and a stratified lithic breccia, marking the pit crater foundering. Interestingly, this final stage compares well with the formation of pit craters on Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. Reoccurring of similar activity on the NW rift represents a major source of risk, for this now densely populated region (more than 150,000 people living in the affected area).",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence showing that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone can have a significant impact on the interannual variability and long- term trend of the tropospheric chemistry and radiation budget. Traditional diagnostics of STE ozone flux consider the ozone budget of the lowermost stratosphere by coupling the residual circulation and ozone. However, this method can only provide information of the hemispheric mean ozone flux, and therefore it does not distinguish the exchange of ozone into the tropics from the exchange of ozone into the midlatitudes that may have different tropospheric impacts.\nThis present study extends the traditional approach from the entire lowermost stratosphere to individual isentropic layers in the lower stratosphere, and therefore distinguishes the meridional location of STE. The specified dynamics (SD) version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is used for the estimate of isentropic STE flux. The diagnosed meridional structure of ozone flux is generally consistent with studies with other methods (e.g., tracer trajectories or the budget of tropospheric ozone). Different seasonal cycles of ozone STE are found at different isentropic surfaces, emphasizing different tropospheric impacts from ozone STE over different meridional regions. For isentropes between 350K and 380K, net troposphere-to-stratosphere ozone STE flux peaks in summer. For isentropes between 330K and 350K, the net ozone STE flux peaks in summer too, but it is from stratosphere to troposphere. For isentropes between 280K and 330K, larger net stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone STE flux is found in the Northern Hemisphere and peaks in spring, whereas little seasonal variability is detected in the Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, the diagnostic enables a partition that links the variability in the STE flux to specific dynamic processes. In particular, the air mass STE flux component associated with the isentropic mixing is found temporally consistent with the variation of the effective diffusivity, along with the migration of the subtropical jet. At the edge of the jet where zonal winds are weaker, effective diffusivity is larger suggesting a larger air mass stirring by mixing, which results in the simulated larger air mass STE flux due to isentropic mixing.",

            "abstract": "The western US has long been challenged with the need to manage surface water systems due to the reoccurrence of drought. Most observers associate challenges with western water with two factors. First, the growth and development of large population centers including Las Vegas, Phoenix and southern California (San Diego, Los Angeles) and second, these population centers are in arid regions where precipitation and water supply is limited. However, research has revealed that the Colorado River, which supplies water for over 25 million people, was significantly over allocated when the “Law of the River” (Colorado River Compact of 1922) was implemented. This over allocation of the river was due to a lack of historic (observed) streamflow data and was discovered when paleo streamflow reconstructions (using tree ring data) were developed. In the southeast US, tree ring data has been used to reconstruct the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). However, very limited research has been performed in the southeast US on developing paleo reconstructions of hydrologic variables such as streamflow, precipitation and soil moisture. The reconstruction of streamflow would allow drought to be quantified (duration, magnitude, severity, return period) and thus put into perspective the 2007-2009 drought that impacted Lake Lanier (Chattahoochee River) and much of the southeast. This research will investigate hydrologic data sources (unimpaired streamflow, precipitation, soil moisture) in the southeast US in conjunction with available tree ring datasets. A preliminary evaluation relating these hydrologic datasets to moisture sensitive tree ring datasets will be performed to determine the potential success of developing paleo reconstructions of hydrologic variables. Results of this research may include determining which hydrologic variable (unimpaired streamflow, precipitation, soil moisture) results in the best skill; the best (most skillful) hydrologic season or seasons to reconstruct; which species of tree is most effective (retained) in reconstruction models; and where is there a need for additional data (tree ring chronology) collections.",

            "abstract": "The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) serves as the primary vertical reference control for the conterminous United States and Alaska. Implemented in 1991, this datum has been shown to disagree at over a meter with global gravity models (GGM’s) based on GRACE products. However, the resolution of such models was limited to about 600 km and larger scales for comparisons with GPS-derived ellipsoid heights on leveled benchmarks. In this study, GGM’s based on GOCE Release 5 are assessed. Given the increased resolution of these models, scales down to 150 km, an improved estimate of the systematic differences with NAVD 88 is possible. Such a model would serve as an a priori estimate of errors and greatly aid in development of hybrid geoid height models used to transform GPS observations into estimates of orthometric heights above NAVD 88. The National Geodetic Survey develops hybrid models using least squares collocation, which presupposes that the data are centered and stochastic and not systematic. In 2022, NGS will develop a replacement for NAVD 88 and future error models, such as the one presented here, will serve as a mechanism for datum transformation for backward compatibility to NAVD 88.",

            "abstract": "Many of the world’s operational forecast centers are taking advantage of aerosol data assimilation as a means of improving aerosol forecasts and climatological reanalyses. However, each center has pursued its own methodology, ranging from 2 to 4D variational and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) methods. This diversity in methods and aerosol modeling approaches has challenged the development of best practices in utilizing satellite aerosol data, particularly for narrow swath or high information content data streams such as from MISR and CALIOP. In this work, a series of experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the EnKF from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) against 2D and 3D variational counterparts within the US Navy’s Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) framework. Examples are drawn from the boreal summertime 2013 period to take advantage of field datasets provided by the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) and Southern Oxidant Aerosol Study (SOAS) campaigns. The EnKF experiments consider ensemble draws from meteorology fields and source functions, as well as multiplicative inflation and adaptive inflation for overcoming sampling errors. The experiment results indicate that source function draws are necessary for producing ensemble spread near-source regions and for producing realistic correlation fields for spreading information, especially in the vertical. The meteorology ensembles were found to be important for transport events, indicating a need for both source and meteorology ensembles. Relative to the 2DVar, EnKF had comparable performance in the midlatitudes at AERONET sites with the added benefit of spreading information in a more realistic manner. In the tropics, the 2DVar outperformed the EnKF, even with the inclusion of inflation methods, due to limited spread in the meteorology ensembles. This points to the need for a hybrid assimilation system that takes advantage of the power of the variational methods to impact the state fields combined with the ability of the EnKF to realistically spread information. In addition to AOD assimilation, the defined EnKF setup is used to explore the inclusion of lidar datasets for constraint of aerosol vertical profiles and comparison to 3DVar.",

            "abstract": "Many questions remain on the detailed morphology of mantle convection patterns. While high resolution P wave studies show a variety of subducted slab behaviors, some stagnating in the transition zone, others penetrating into the lower mantle (e.g. Fukao & Obayashi, 2013), low velocity structures – the upwelling part of flow – are more difficult to resolve at the same scale. Indeed, depth extent and morphology of the low velocity roots of hotspot volcanoes is still debated, along with the existence of \"mantle plumes\".\nUsing spectral element waveform tomography, we previously constructed a global, radially anisotropic, upper mantle Vs model (SEMum2, French et al., 2013) and have now extended it to the whole mantle by adding shorter period waveform data (SEMUCB-WM1, French & Romanowicz, GJI, in revision). This model shows long wavelength structure in good agreement with other recent global Vs models derived under stronger approximations (Ritsema et al. 2011; Kustowski, et al. 2008), but exhibits better focused, finer scale structure throughout the mantle.\nSEMUCB-WM1 confirms the presence in all major ocean basins of the quasi-periodic, upper mantle low velocity anomalies, previously seen in SEMum2. At the same time, lower mantle low velocity structure is dominated by a small number (~15 globally) of quasi-vertical anomalies forming discrete \"column\"\" rooted at the base of the mantle. Most columns are positioned near major hotspots, as defined by buoyancy flux, and are wider (~800-1000 km diameter) than expected from the thermal plume model – suggestive of thermo-chemical plumes, which may be stable for long times compared to purely thermal ones.\nSome columns reach the upper mantle, while others deflect horizontally near 1000 km – the same depth where many slabs appear to stagnate. As they reach the transition zone, the wide columnar structure can be lost, as these \"plumes\" appear to meander through the upper mantle, perhaps entrained by more vigorous, lower viscosity, convection. Most \"plumes\" in the Pacific LLSVP region appear as isolated columns rising from the CMB, such as beneath Hawaii (rooted near a known ultra low velocity zone, Cottaar & Romanowicz, 2012). Conversely, the African LLSVP region appears more massive up to mid-mantle depths, with isolated \"plumes\" at its borders, including that beneath Iceland.",

            "abstract": "Technological advances and access to global markets have changed the rate at which resource exploitation takes place. The environmental impact of the rapid development and distribution of resources such as minerals and hydrocarbons has led to a greater potential for significant stress on water resources both in terms of quality and quantity. How and where those impacts manifest is crucial to determining appropriate risk management strategies. North East British Columbia has an abundance of shale gas reserves that are anticipated to be exploited at a large scale in coming years, primarily for export as liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, there is growing concern that fracking and other activities related to shale gas development pose risks to water quality and quantity in the region. Water lies at the center of the water-energy-food nexus, with an accelerating water demand for fracking and industrial operations as well as for domestic, environmental and agricultural uses. Climate change is also anticipated to alter the hydrologic regime, posing added stress to the water resource. This case study examines the water-energy-food nexus in the context of a region that is impacted by a rapidly developing resource sector, encompassing water demand/supply, climate change, interaction between deep aquifers and shallow aquifers/surface waters, water quality concerns related to fracking, land use disturbance, and community impacts. Due to the rapid rate of development, there are significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of the water resource. Currently agencies are undertaking water resource assessments and establishing monitoring sites. This research aims to assess water security in North East British Columbia in a coordinated fashion through various partnerships. In addition to collecting baseline knowledge and data, the study will evaluate risk and resilience indicators in relation to water security. A risk assessment framework specific to the shale gas development context will be developed to evaluate the various components of risk spatially and temporally. Resilience is currently being assessed through a comprehensive examination of the current regulatory and policy regime.",

            "abstract": "The high cost of hydro-meteorological data acquisition, communication and publication systems along with limited qualified human resources is considered as the main reason why hydro-meteorological data collection remains a challenge especially in developing countries. Despite significant advances in sensor network technologies which gave birth to open hardware and software, low-cost (less than $50) and low-power (in the order of a few miliWatts) sensor platforms in the last two decades, sensors and sensor network deployment remains a labor-intensive, time consuming, cumbersome, and thus expensive task. These factors give rise for the need to develop a affordable, simple to deploy, scalable and self-organizing end-to-end (from sensor to publication) system suitable for deployment in such countries.\nThe design of the envisioned system will consist of a few Sensed-And-Programmed Arduino-based sensor nodes with low-cost sensors measuring parameters relevant to hydrological processes and a Raspberry Pi micro-computer hosting the in-the-field back-end data management. This latter comprises the Python/Django model of the CUAHSI Observations Data Model (ODM) namely DjangODM backed by a PostgreSQL Database Server. We are also developing a Python-based data processing script which will be paired with the data autoloading capability of Django to populate the DjangODM database with the incoming data. To publish the data, the WOFpy (WaterOneFlow Web Services in Python) developed by the Texas Water Development Board for ‘Water Data for Texas’ which can produce WaterML web services from a variety of back-end database installations such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL will be used. A step further would be the development of an appealing online visualization tool using Python statistics and analytics tools (Scipy, Numpy, Pandas) showing the spatial distribution of variables across an entire watershed as a time variant layer on top of a basemap.",

            "abstract": "Southeast Africa is a region of complex tectonic inheritance, combining early Archean cratonic blocks – the Zimbabwe and Kaapvaal cratons – and several collision belts ranging in age from ~2.6Ga (Limpopo Belt) to the Pan-African Orogeny, 800-500 Ma ago (Zambezi Belt, Mozambique Belt). Mesozoic rifting was the last tectonic event to leave an imprint in the lithosphere of the region. Tertiary deformation is mild and related to the extensional regime of the East African Rift System (EARS) further north. Instrumental seismology started in Johannesburg in 1910 (Saunders et al., 2008). Ambraseys and Adams (1991) conducted a reappraisal of the seismicity of Sub-Saharan Africa from 1900 to 1930, and the compilations by Krige and Maree (1948) and Gutenberg and F. Richter (1949) are main sources for the two subsequent decades. The available data can be considered complete since 1900 for magnitudes above M6 (Ambraseys and Adams, 1991), although major epicentral errors are likely to affect the early decades. Earthquakes above this threshold in the region to the south of Lake Malawi and to the east of the Okavango Rift are reported in 1919 (MS6.5, NE South Africa), 1932 (MS6.8, Natal Bay), 1940 (MS6.2, SE Mozambique), 1951 (MS6.0, Central Mozambique), 1957 (M6.0, Central Mozambique), again in 1957 (M6.2, Central Mozambique), 1958 (M6.0, Southern Zimbabwe), 1959 (M6.1, Southern Zambia) and 2006 (M7.0, Central Mozambique). The four M>6 earthquakes from 1957 to 1959 configure a cluster in time, followed by a shutdown (at M>6) that was to last nearly five decades. While a coincidence is unlikely, a causal link is challenged by the large spatial scatter of about 500 km. However, the fact that the four earthquakes occurred on the border of the Zimbabwe craton may provide a clue to the mechanism promoting the clustering. We combine these data with recent seismicity results (Fonseca et al., 2014) to discuss possible factors controlling the seismotectonics of the region.",

The wave activity was stimulated by a gradual 4-hour rise and subsequent sharp increases in solar wind pressure. Intense hydrogen band, linearly polarized Pc 1 wave activity (up to 25 nT p-p) with very similar time variations also appeared for over 4 hours at both Van Allen Probes, located ~8 and ~9 hours east of Halley. Waves appeared when these spacecraft were outside the plasmapause, with densities ~5-20 cm-3. Ten passes of NOAA-POES and METOP satellites near the northern hemisphere footpoint of the Van Allen Probes (over Siberia) show the presence of 30-80 keV subauroral proton precipitation. This is the longest-duration and most intense Pc1 event we have yet observed with the Van Allen Probes. The combination of its duration, intensity, and large local time extent (from before 02 to nearly 14 hours MLT) suggests that it might have a significant effect on the ring current, and possibly even electrons in the outer radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) is responsible for running and maintaining the Diagnostic Cloud Forecast (DCF) model to support DoD missions and those of their external partners. The DCF model generates three-dimensional cloud forecasts for global and regional domains at various resolutions. Regional domains are chosen based on Air Force mission needs. DCF is purely a statistical model that can be appended to any numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Operationally, AFWA runs the DCF model deterministically using GFS data from NCEP and WRF data that are created in-house. In addition, AFWA also runs an ensemble version of the DCF model using the Mesoscale Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS).\nThe deterministic DCF uses predictor variables from the WRF or GFS models, depending on whether the domain is regional or global, and statistically relates them to observed cloud cover from the World-Wide Merged Cloud Analysis (WWMCA). The forecast process of the model uses an ordinal logistic regression to predict membership in one of 101 groups (every 1% from 0-100%). The predicted group membership then is translated into a cloud amount. This is performed on 21 pressure levels ranging from 1000 hPa to 100 hPa. Cloud amount forecasts on these 21 levels are used along with the NWP geopotential height forecasts to estimate the base and top heights of cloud layers in the vertical. DCF also includes routines to estimate the amount and type of cloud within each layer. Forecasts of total cloud amount are verified using the WWMCA, as well as independent sources of cloud data.\nThis presentation will include an overview of the DCF model and its use at AFWA. Results will be presented to show that DCF adds value over the raw cloud forecasts from NWP models. Ideas for future work also will be addressed.",

            "abstract": "Small mountainous rivers along the west coast margin of North America display intense seasonal contrasts in runoff, with event-scale peaks in particulate transport associated with winter-time floods. In-situ observations and rapid-response sampling along a typical river-estuary system (Alsea River/Bay, Oregon) were carried out to investigate variations in the magnitude and composition of particulate organic matter transported across the estuary at seasonal, tidal and event scales. Marked contrasts in the overall concentration of particulate organic matter in the estuary are observed during different river discharge conditions (base flow to 3-yr flood), with distinct trends associated with contrasting tidal stage (spring/neap). Elemental, isotopic and biomarker analyses of individual samples reveal large differences in the provenance (phytoplankton, vascular plants, soil) and composition of organic materials mobilized under different discharge/tidal conditions. Continuous, in-situ measurements of current, salinity, temperature and turbidity, combined with the compositions from individual samples allow us to determine instantaneous material fluxes into and out of Alsea Bay. We use these data to derive net fluxes during wintertime conditions and assess the role of floods in the retention and transport of particulate organic matter across the estuarine interface.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of interseismic strain accumulation and fault creep traditionally relies on GPS, alignment arrays and creepmeters, providing precise, but only horizontal and spatially sparse measurements. These measurements are often extrapolated into a model of the expected long-wavelength deformation, and InSAR data are adjusted to align with this modeled background displacement field. Thus, the InSAR data contributes only to characterization of short-wavelength deformation features. Here, we use InSAR to resolve small-amplitude long-wavelength displacements without an a priori model of deformation.\nWe perform InSAR time-series analysis of ERS and Envisat data to resolve the 1992-2011 ground deformation in the San Francisco Bay Area. We rely on multiple viewing geometries to isolate vertical and horizontal deformation and validate our InSAR velocity field by analyzing adjacent tracks and comparing with GPS, alignment arrays, and creepmeter measurements. We ultimately aim at characterizing creep and strain accumulation rates on the Calaveras Fault. Because the Calaveras Fault separates urban areas from vegetated hillslopes, keeping coherence across the fault can be challenging. Accordingly, we rely on an alternative Small Baseline Subset time series method, in which the image-pair selection is based on the percentage of coherent pixels in each interferogram in an area that spans the fault.\nOur InSAR velocity field agrees well between adjacent tracks and the InSAR horizontal deformation agrees within ±1 mm/yr with the BAVU3 GPS velocity field. Additionally, InSAR-derived surface creep rates on the Hayward and Calaveras faults are in good agreement with local creep measurements. We thus demonstrate that InSAR enables resolving vertical and horizontal deformation partitioning in the Bay Area for signals as small as 2 mm/yr over both short- and long-wavelengths. We confirm that most of the interseismic deformation is horizontal, the vertical deformation being mostly due to hydrological effects. We provide new estimates of along-fault creep rate variations for the Calaveras Fault, demonstrating that long-term slip rates can be determined from InSAR alone. Finally, relying on InSAR and repeating earthquake data we develop a model of the sub-surface slip distribution along the Calaveras Fault.",

            "abstract": "Many recent models attribute the origin of the Merensky Reef and massive chromitites of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa to replenishment of a magma chamber by phenocryst-rich magmas (crystal slurries). In particular, the emplacement of chromite-rich slurries from the staging chamber is currently thought to be responsible for the formation of massive chromitites of the Bushveld Complex. There are, however, first-order observations that are not compatible with this popular idea. One of the key features of the Merensky Reef and almost all layers of massive chromitites is their close association with so-called potholes, the circular to elliptical depressions with gently to steeply inclined sidewalls that are transgressive relative to their footwall rocks. Portions of magmatic stratigraphy are totally absent from the footwall rocks in pothole areas. Here we summarize abundant field evidence from several localities of the Eastern and Western Bushveld Complex that provide strong support to an idea that these portions of footwall rocks were thermally and partly mechanically eroded away by new magma pulses refilling the chamber. To be able to erode the footwall rocks so effectively, the new magmas must have been superheated upon emplacement into the chamber (no phenocrysts in the magmas). Otherwise the phenocrysts will immediately settle to the floor of the chamber to form a blanket protecting footwall rocks from the thermal erosion. The geological observations thus suggest that the origin of the Merensky Reef and massive chromitites must be tackled in the frame of the models that involve the emplacement of superheated, rather than phenocryst-laden magmas. The important lesson to be drawn from this study is that the field observations are still one of the primary tools for the rigorous testing of our hypotheses in modern igneous/ore petrology.",

            "abstract": "The spatially explicit biogeochemical model Forest-DNDC was used to estimate carbon dynamics with disturbances and climate change in secondary semidry forests in Yucatan Peninsula. The model was validated using observations from 276 field plots in a 350 km2 region of semi-deciduous forest surrounding the intensive monitoring site at Kaxil Kiuic, and it performed well with high performance efficiency (E=0.79, R2=0.83). The simulation results showed substantial spatial differences in biomass in the forests due to historical disturbance patterns and heterogeneous forest environments. The simulated impacts of the disturbances that occurred from 1998-2010 revealed an estimated loss of total biomass carbon storage of 154.7 Gg due mainly to about 12 km2 of forestland loss. The results from disturbance scenarios indicate that disastrous storms, which are not uncommon in the Yucatan Peninsula, can substantially impact carbon storage in a short time. However, warming can produce a long-term impact on carbon sequestration, due principally to the decrease in biomass carbon at a mean rate of over 100 kg ha-1yr-1 with an increase in temperature by 1 degree Celsius. The forests in this area are highly sensitive to warming due to a semidry climate where the evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation. Even if each degree of warming increase is accompanied by an increase in precipitation of 10%, the significant impact of warming cannot be dismissed.",

            "abstract": "Accurate modeling of planetary interiors requires that the pressure-volume-temperature properties of phases present within the body be well understood. The high-pressure polymorphs of H2O have been studied extensively, due to the abundance of ice phases in icy moons and likely vast number of extra-solar planetary bodies, with only select studies evaluating impurity-laden ices. In this study, ice formed from a 1.6 mole percent KCl-bearing aqueous solution was studied up to 33 GPa and 650 K, and the incorporation of K+ and Cl- into the ice VII structure was documented. The compression data at 300 K were fit with a third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state and yielded K, K/, and V0 of 24.7±0.9 GPa, 4.44±0.09, and 39.17±0.15 Å3, respectively. Thermal expansion coefficients were also determined for several isothermal compression curves at elevated temperatures, and a P-V-T equation of state will be presented. The melting of ice VII with incorporated K+ and Cl- was determined up to 625 K and 10.6 GPa and was fit by using a Simon-Glatzel equation. The melting curve is systematically depressed relative to the melting curve of pure H2O by approximately 45 K and 80 K at 4 and 11 GPa, respectively. Interestingly, a portion of the K+ and Cl- contained within the ice VII structure was observed to exsolve with increasing temperature and pressure. This suggests that an internal differentiating process could concentrate a K-rich phase deep within H2O-rich planets, and we speculate that this could supply an additional source of heat through the radioactive decay of 40K. Birch (1951; JGR, 56, 107-126) has estimated that 40K contributes 2.7 µcal/g.year for each wt.% of K, and our results suggest at least 3.33 wt.% can be incorporated into the structure of ice VII, thus making it a source of heat rather than just a conductive layer. In conclusion, our data illustrate a mechanism that may concentrate K at depth and impact the supposed pressure and temperature within moderate to large sized H2O-rich planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that intense seismic activity might generate upward electromagnetic (EM) perturbations that can be detected by ground-based and low altitude spaceborne measurements. For instance, DEMETER satellite (2004-2010) very low frequency (VLF) wave observations pointed out a statistically significant decrease of the measured ionospheric wave intensity a few hours before large shallow earthquakes (EQs). This result would confirm the existence of a lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling before the occurrence of an impending significant EQ. Swarm offers a great opportunity to study EM perturbations possibly related to seismic activity because it is a multi-satellite low Earth orbit (LEO) mission with a unique space-time configuration able to measure both electric and magnetic fields at various altitudes in the topside ionosphere. Here, we are analyzing, using various signal processing techniques, Swarm measurements shortly before and after large shallow EQs (magnitude above 7 and depth < 40 km) that occurred in the first year of the mission and report on the initial results of our analysis.",

            "abstract": "We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to evaluate sensitivities and patterns in freshwater availability due to projected climate and land use changes in the Brahmaputra basin. The daily observed discharge at Bahadurabad station in Bangladesh was used to calibrate the model and analyze uncertainties with SUFI-II algorithm for 1988-1997, and to validate the model for 1998-2004. The R2, NS, and biases were, respectively, 0.85, 0.85, and -3.2% during calibration, and 0.89, 0.88, and -4.4% during validation for basinwide simulations of monthly streamflow. The sensitivities and impacts of projected climate and land use changes on basin hydrological components were simulated and analyzed relative to a baseline scenario of 1988-2004. Sensitivity analysis identified a doubling of CO2 concentration to 660 ppm caused average annual evapotranspiration (ET) to decrease by 12%, resulting in increases in water yield by 5%, streamflow by 6%, and groundwater recharge by 8%. With an increase in temperature, annual average ET was predicted to increase, while responses of water yield and streamflow varied by season. An increase in precipitation caused proportional increases in water yield, streamflow, and groundwater recharge, but led to only minor impacts on ET. Annual average water yield, soil water content, ET, streamflow, and groundwater recharge were predicted to increase with higher seasonal variability in response to climate and land use change projections for the A1B and A2 scenarios generated from downscaled CGCM3.1 and IMAGE, respectively. Water yield, soil water content, streamflow, and groundwater recharge were predicted to increase with a strong increasing trend during August to October, indicating exacerbated flood potential, while during May to July, the hydrological components–except soil water content–were predicted to decrease with a strong decreasing trend, indicating enhanced drought potential throughout the 21st century. Overall, results indicated that the model could provide reasonable predictions of monthly basinwide freshwater availability, therefore, could facilitate strategic decision making through scenario generation that integrates climate change adaptation and hazard mitigation policies to ensure optimized allocation of water resources under a variable and changing climate",

            "abstract": "Recent studies disclosed that interplanetary shocks not only raise global auroral activity, but also cause significant tail disturbances, ranging from ULF wave excitation to abrupt cross-tail current sheet thinning and current density increase, generation of burst bulk flows and dipolarization fronts, and to magnetic reconnection enhancement. In addition, shocks can also cause significant deformation of the magnetotail at ~60 Re and beyond. In this paper we study a shock event using ARTEMIS in situ observations and OpenGGCM MHD simulations. The two ARTEMIS spacecraft were located near the tail current sheet and lobe center at (-60, 1, -5Re_GSM) when the shock arrived and recorded an abrupt tail compression leading to significant enhancements in the plasma density, temperature, magnetic field strength, and cross-tail current density, as well as to tailward flows. However, ~10 min later, the spacecraft entered the sheath solar wind unexpectedly. Two hypotheses are considered: either the tail was cut off by the high solar wind ram pressure (~25-30 nPa), or the compressed tail was pushed aside by the appreciable Vy solar wind flow component imposed by the shock. OpenGGMC simulation results confirmed the second hypothesis and disclosed that for this event the magnetic pressure played a dominant role at X=-60 Re for the compression. In addition to the shock normal direction and shock compression, the anisotropic (transverse) magnetic pressure also contributed to the significant reduction of the lobe Y dimension. Therefore, during this 10 min interval, the lobe center moved dawnward by ~12 Re and the tail width in Y was reduced from 40 to 26 Re, which eventually exposed ARTEMIS to the sheath solar wind. Comparisons of plasma and magnetic parameters between ARTEMIS in situ observations and simulations showed a satisfied consistence.",

            "abstract": "We use a suite of reconstructed water year (WY; October through September) streamflow for 12 river basins in the western United States to reconstruct gridded water year precipitation over a similar western US domain. The streamflow values were reconstructed based on moisture sensitive tree ring records and we used values published in the peer-reviewed literature. A set of Principal Components (PC) of the streamflow reconstructions were calibrated against a complementary PC set from an ~120-year long instrumental record of WY precipitation west of ~90˚W to yield a 407 year reconstruction at each gridpoint. We were motivated to assess the rarity of the current extreme 3-year drought in the Southwest US—particularly in California. Hence, our analysis focuses largely on the moisture side of the water balance, although of course, streamflow is an integrator of both evapotranspiration and precipitation. Nevertheless, the strong calibration and validation statistics obtained in our study (and notably for California and Nevada) suggest that WY streamflow in much of the West is mainly driven by precipitation variability. The current WY drought (2013-14) and three year (2012-2014) extended drought is ranked in the instrumental record for California itself as the driest such period since 1895. In our longer reconstructed record of California and adjacent western Nevada, the current dry episode—exceeding one year's mean total in three years—is similar to only three other such occurrences over the past 440 years, centered on 1654, 1795, and 1930. Analyses of anomalous mid-tropospheric (700 hPa) circulation features over the instrumental period (since 1895) show the presence of persistent anticyclonic flow over, near, and to the west of the US Pacific coast during the driest WYs. Some differences in the location and spatial structure of the anomalous Northeast Pacific ridge are evident and these are discussed in the context of low-frequency climate variability and change.",

The forcing is 3-hourly atmospheric output from the Navy’s Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS). The boundary conditions are provided by the 1/8o Global NCOM model. In addition, 8 semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal components and monthly climatological discharges of 37 rivers are included. The model assimilates satellite altimeter data, AVHRR SST and synthetic temperature and salinity profiles from the Modular Ocean Data Assimilation System (MODAS). The model output is filtered to remove tides and saved as daily averages. From out analysis we find large inter-annual variability in the strength of the South Equatorial Counter Current and in the subsurface temperature cold anomaly associated with Seyshelles-Chagos thermocline ridge. The cold anomaly was significantly reduced in 2007 during which had a rare co-occurrence of La Nina and positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions. Year to year variability in the equatorial currents affects the Somali Current and the time of development and strength of the Great Whirl during the southwest monsoon.",

This simulation seeks to balance the radiative forcing from an instantaneous quadrupling of the CO2 concentration by an increase in the albedo of the global oceans. This design is a highly idealized representation of marine cloud brightening proposals.\nG1ocean-albedo requires an increase in global ocean albedo between 140 and 153%, depending upon the model. Models show that although top of atmosphere net radiative flux remains at 0 under G1ocean-albedo, global mean temperature increases by approximately 0.5 K. This is in contrast to experiment G1, in which solar irradiance was reduced to compensate for the radiative forcing of quadrupled CO2; in G1, global mean temperature was unchanged for the duration of the simulation.\nSimilarly to experiment G1, G1ocean-albedo results in a positive temperature anomaly (as compared to the preindustrial control simulation) in high latitudes of approximately 1.0 K and a negative anomaly over the tropical oceans of approximately 0.5 K. Land temperatures are also increased on average by over 1 K. These features are attributed to feedbacks in the high latitudes, as well as changes in the land-ocean contrast. There is a Southward shift in the ITCZ associated with changes in the hemispheric temperature differences.",

            "abstract": "CHUVA, meaning “rain” in Portuguese, is the acronym for the Cloud processes of tHe main precipitation systems in Brazil: A contribUtion to cloud resolVing modeling and to the GPM (GlobAl Precipitation Measurement). The CHUVA project has conducted six field campaigns; the last campaign was held in Manaus in 2014 jointly with GoAmazon and ACRIDICON. CHUVA's main scientific motivation is to contribute to the understanding of cloud processes, which represent one of the least understood components of the weather and climate system. This study will briefly describe the CHUVA project and the main scientific results obtained in the Amazon region. Specifically, we will describe the results of one year radar observation of Manaus rainfall and the relationship with black carbon. The results indicate that the aerosol influence on precipitating systems is modulated by the atmospheric instability degree. For stable atmospheres, the higher the aerosol concentration, the lower the precipitation over the region. On the other hand, for unstable cases, higher concentrations of particulate material are associated with more precipitation, elevated presence of ice and larger rain cells, which suggests an association with long lived systems. Also we will describe some preliminary results obtained during GoAmazon describing the cloud and rainfall size distribution (DSD). The DSD was adjusted to the gamma function using the momentum method and disposed in the three-dimensional space of the gamma parameters: the intercept, the shape and the width. Each point in this three-dimensional space corresponds to a specific DSD and the ensemble of points describes all regimes of precipitation in Amazon. Based in this Gamma space we will discuss the characteristics of the rainfall regime and anthropogenic features.",

            "abstract": "Impact of the groundwater on plant transpiration constitutes an important but not well understood aspect of the interactions between groundwater and the land surface, vegetation and atmosphere. The lack of understanding can be attributed to the limited observations and the complex nature of the problem as the mechanisms and processes involved are many and often tightly coupled. This study addresses such issues by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity Plus (VIC+) land surface model (LSM) in conjunction with a series of numerical experiments. The VIC+ model considers impacts of the hydraulic redistribution (HR), plant storage, photosynthesis, and groundwater table (GWT) dynamics on plant transpiration, and the interactions between plant transpiration and subsurface processes. Several groups of numerical experiments are performed using different combinations of precipitation conditions, vegetation types, soil types, groundwater table depths (GWTDs) and treatment of the HR process. We have found, in water limited climates, vegetation type, soil type and the HR process have strong impacts on transpiration – GWTD relationships. In particular when the HR is significant, such as in drier climates, the inclusion of HR process in the modeling is essential in establishing the correct relationship between the plant transpiration and GWTD, where an omission would result in a more linear-like relationship. In addition, under certain conditions, there exists a transition zone in the relationship between plant transpiration and GWTD, where transpiration drops abruptly as the groundwater table declines. Moreover, plant transpiration and groundwater become disconnected as the groundwater table declines further and lies below the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "The present study examines the role of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) in the observed extreme precipitation changes along the southeast coast of Brazil (-18°S to -25°S). This area is under the influence of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS) and its main feature, the SACZ, which together are related to extreme precipitation events during the wet season (Oct-Mar). Previous studies suggest that one possible change in convergence zones behavior due to climate change is an increase in precipitation intensity at their central portion at the expense of moisture advected from their margin. By analyzing extremes in daily precipitation during the wet season based on more than 70 years of rain gauge data, we identified a positive trend in the intensity of precipitation and a reduction in the number of rainy days over the north portion of southeast coast. Further south, the tendency was for an overall increase in total precipitation. This spatial pattern in extreme precipitation trends along the coast is likely linked to changes in the characteristics of the SACZ. In this study we investigate decadal variations in the SACZ intensity, location and persistence using a multivariate daily index obtained with combined EOF analysis. The variables considered are zonal and meridional winds, temperature and specific humidity at low levels, derived from two different reanalysis datasets: NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 and CFSR. The extent and spatial variability of the SACZ is investigated with daily Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR). The focus of this analysis is on intense SACZ events according to the SACZ index. Mechanisms associated with the decadal variability of the SACZ are also explored and include changes in sea surface temperature, the low–level Jet east of the Andes, and changes in circulation and moisture transport over South America and the South Atlantic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Water deficit is the main factor responsible for soybean yield gap in Southern Brazil and tends to increase under climate change scenarios. Alternatives need be identified in order to create options to reduce the yield gap. One alternative is the selection of soybean cultivars with traits associated to drought tolerance. Thus, the aim of this study, via use of crop models, is to evaluate genetic traits that can help to improve soybean yield under climate change scenarios in Southern Brazil by improving the crop tolerance to water deficit. For this, the CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model was used to simulate soybean yield in Southern Brazil and evaluate yield with altered genetic traits. The first step was to calibrate the model for a Brazilian soybean cultivar, using results from irrigated and rainfed experiments conducted in different sowing dates and locations in Southern Brazil. The CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean estimated a mean yield of 3551 (SD = 1439) kg ha-1, while the mean observed yield was 3313 (SD = 1105) kg ha-1. The mean error was 238 kg ha-1 (7.2%), mean error absolute was 765 kg ha-1 (23%) and modeling efficiency was 0.27, with a good relationship between observed and simulated yield (Figure 1). The model was able to estimate soybean yield for different levels of soil water available during the crop season. The next steps of the project are to manipulate the coefficients related with rooting depth extension, early stomata closure at high soil water contents, transpiration limited to a maximum rate, and N2 fixation drought tolerance in the model in order to identify their impact on yield under current and future climate scenarios in all soybean production regions in Southern Brazil. The soybean yield from different changed traits will be evaluated in order to define guidelines for breeding programs, allowing the saving of resources and time in the new cultivars development process, focused on adaptation to climate change.",

Volcanogenic air pollutants known to cause the most serious impact are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Some studies into the potential for volcanic emissions to produce chronic diseases in humans indicate that areas of major concern include respiratory problems, particularly silicosis (Allen et al. 2000; Baxter et al. 1999; Buist et al. 1986), psychological stress (Shore et al. 1986), and chemical impacts of gas or ash (Giammanco et al. 1998). Sulphur Springs Park in Saint Lucia has a very high recreational value with >200,000 visitors annually, while the nearby town of Soufrière has >8,400 residents. Residents and visitors have raised concerns about the volcanic emissions and its health effects. As part of the volcanic surveillance programme undertaken by the UWI, Seismic Research Centre (SRC) in Saint Lucia, a new monitoring network has been established for quantifying the ambient SO2 in air, to which staff and visitors at the volcanic park are exposed to. The implementation and continued operation of this network has involved the training of local personnel in the active field sampling and analytical techniques required for the assessment of ambient SO2 concentrations, using a low cost monitor as well as commercial passive samplers. This approach recognizes that environmental hazards are a usual part of life and productive livelihoods, and to minimize post-disaster response and recovery it is beneficial to promote preparedness and mitigation, which is best achieved at the local level with community involvement. It is also intended that the volcanic emissions monitoring network could be used as a method to establish and maintain community-based initiatives that would also be helpful when volcanic threat manifests.",

Elevated particulate Fe is evident at depth (>300m) downstream of the Kerguelen plateau, suggesting input of particulate Fe from plateau sediments may fuel surface productivity in this region. Cu, Ni, and Pb are elevated in surface waters centered around 40S, suggesting an anthropogenic signature potentially influenced by local atmospheric deposition or advection into the interior of the basin by the South Indian Ocean Current. In the south Indian Ocean, particulate matter composition reflects high biological production as evidenced by elevated particulate P concentrations in surface waters, with a sharp delineation apparent between high particulate Ca concentrations within the ‘great calcite belt’ (30–55S) and high particulate Si and Zn concentrations in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean associated with diatom productivity. We will also present particulate trace metal data from CLIVAR zonal transect I5 between South Africa and Australia (May-May 2009) that is currently being analyzed.",

These waves are also known to be highly variable on almost all measured time-scales, thus their influence on the middle and upper atmosphere likely varies on the same time-scales. Several published works have reported the influence of the 11-year solar sunspot cycle on atmospheric gravity waves in the middle atmosphere, generally using 1 solar cycle of observations. These studies disagree on the magnitude and sign of the change in gravity wave amplitudes in response to the solar cycle. Here, the impacts of the 11-year solar cycle on gravity waves are investigated using two 50-year WACCM simulations. For these 50-year simulations, we output all gravity wave components, and it allows us to separate gravity wave responses by their sources and phase speeds. Our results show that the largest 11-year solar cycle signals on gravity wave drag exist at high-latitudes in winter from the stratosphere to the lower thermosphere.",

            "abstract": "The 28 March, 2014 M 5.2 La Habra earthquake occurred on a northeast striking, northwest dipping left-lateral oblique thrust fault at the northeastern margin of the LA Basin, where regional right-lateral shear is accommodated by major northwest trending faults of the Peninsular Ranges, and north-south shortening is accommodated by north-dipping thrust faults and east-west trending folds of the Transverse Ranges. The La Habra mainshock location and focal mechanism is northwest of but sub-parallel to the Puente Hills thrust fault. Relocated seismicity highlights a northeast-trending rupture plane consistent with the magnitude and focal mechanism of the event. NASA’s UAVSAR L-Band radar instrument was flown for north and south looking lines before the earthquake on 22 January 2014. The north looking line was reflown three days after the earthquake on 31 March, 2014, and the south looking line was reflown a week later on 4 April 2014. The UAVSAR Repeat Pass Interferogram (RPI) products show deformation consistent with the location of the mainshock beneath the town of La Habra. The results also show considerable aseismic northward horizontal deformation with minor uplift in the West Coyote Hills, south of the relocated seismicity. Inversion of the combined interferograms is consistent with south dipping low-angle (7°) shallow slip that corresponds to bedding plane attitudes and a mapped unconformity. The entire West Coyote Hills show 37 mm of modeled northward slip with an additional 34 mm of modeled slip concentrated near the Coyote Hills Park northeast of the intersection of Rosecrans Avenue and North Gilbert Street. A narrow band of shortening was also observed with UAVSAR, and confirmed with on-the-ground field observations, at the Trojan Way Kink Band, nearly one fault dimension southwest of the main rupture.",

Specifically, we focus on three common modeling decisions: (i) number of models, (ii) multimodel combination approach, and (iii) lead time for prediction. The analysis scheme includes a multimodel ensemble forecasting algorithm based on nonparametric regression, a set of alternatives for the options previously pointed, and a selection of probabilistic verification methods for ensemble forecast evaluation. The usefulness of this framework is tested through an example application aimed to generate spring/summer streamflow forecasts at multiple locations in Central Chile. Results demonstrate the high impact that subjectivity in decision-making may have on the quality of ensemble seasonal hydroclimatic forecasts. In particular, we note that the probabilistic verification criteria may lead to different choices regarding the number of models or the multimodel combination method. We also illustrate how this objective analysis scheme may lead to results that are extremely relevant for the case study presented here, such as skillful seasonal streamflow predictions for very dry conditions.",

            "abstract": "Forests of the U.S. have been subject to repeated invasions of destructive insects and diseases imported from other continents. Like other disturbances, these pests can produce short-term ecosystem effects due to tree mortality, but unlike other disturbances, they often target individual species and therefore can cause long-term species change in the forest. Because tree species vary in their influence on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, pest-induced species change can radically alter the biogeochemistry of a forest. In this paper we use both data and modeling to examine how pest-induced species change may alter the C and N cycling in forests of the eastern U.S. We describe a new forest ecosystem model that distinguishes individual tree species and allows species composition to shift over the course of the model run. Results indicate that the mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) by hemlock woolly adelgid and its replacement by faster-growing species such as black birch (Betula lenta) will reduce forest floor C stocks but increase productivity as the birch become established. Decline of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) from beech bark disease and its replacement by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is likely to decrease soil C storage and increase N leaching from the ecosystem. Responses to other invasive pests will also be discussed. The magnitude of these species-specific effects on C and N cycling is in many cases larger than direct effects expected from changes in climate and atmospheric N deposition, indicating that species change should be included in models that predict forest ecosystem function under future environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "The large amounts of data generated by volcano observatories, especially during volcanic crises, can present a challenge for rapid analysis of changing event behaviour. Statistical analysis of seismic events, e.g. spectral analysis and identification of waveform families (i.e. multiplet analysis) can be useful tools in characterising the seismicity and can provide another layer of information for volcano observatories. Additionally, multiplet analysis of existing data from key eruptions can reveal patterns of behaviour that are not evident from individual event metrics (e.g. locations, amplitudes, frequency content etc.). However, large scale multiplet analysis has previously been hindered by the computational limitations associated with cross-correlation of large data sets. Event classification remains crucial to volcano monitoring and to retrospective analysis of key eruption data, but such methods are often not straightforward to implement. We present a program, PEAKMATCH, which can be used for spectral and multiplet analysis of large data sets, and can be used for simple automatic classification of volcanic events. Our optimised cross-correlation approach can efficiently handle the cross-correlation of hundreds of thousands of events making large-scale multiplet studies a reality. Much of the crucial information for classifying an event lies in the frequency domain and by using spectral ratios and cluster analysis we are able to automatically classify events without an extensive training period. We apply our method to seismic data from Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat from the end of the last extrusion period in February 2010 until January 2014 to characterise the multiplet behaviour during an extended period of quiescence. We observe notable changes in multiplet behaviour surrounding the period of ash venting in March 2012.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes and the governing geomorphic processes that shape them have been described in a conceptual framework of process domains. At a coarse scale, process domains are segregated between hillslope, colluvial, and alluvial processes, which can be distinguished by governing erosional processes and partitioned by local slope-drainage area relationships. In landscapes that have experienced dramatic topographic alteration such as the mountaintop coal-mining (MTM) region of central Appalachia, the resulting modified environment may be considered a synthetic landscape. Such a landscape has process domains that are decoupled from prior landscape evolution trajectories. In particular, landslide and debris flow processes, which are a predominant geomorphic agent in these steep mountain systems and a primary sediment delivery mechanism to the downstream fluvial network, may be eliminated from this landscape and detectable through changes in slope-area relationships. We evaluate differences in slope-area relationships using 10-m DEMs between two time periods, pre-mined and post-mined. At five study site located within the MTM region in the central Appalachian Mountains, US, we compare slope-area changes to adjacent unmined landscapes over the same time periods. Distinct differences exist in the character of slope-area relationships between unmined and MTM sites and local slopes are systematically and considerably reduced in all process zones of mined sites. In particular, there is an expansion of the unchanneled valley zone through either an individual or simultaneous upslope shift into the hillslope region and downslope shift into the debris flow region. In addition, local slopes are markedly reduced (33% to 44%) in the post-mined period relative to the pre-mined period at all sites and are generally below the threshold required to trigger landslides and debris flows. The consequence of altered erosion processes in this upper portion of the catchment, particularly the potential elimination of landslide and debris flow processes, is a downstream river network starved of its primary sediment source. Decreases in sediment supply will translate to increases in hydraulic driving forces with the fluvial network and increased bank erosion and bed incision processes.",

Their sustainable management is therefore crucial. Due to the complexity of vegetation dynamics, the impacts of climate change and land use on savannas are highly uncertain. Here, we use a dynamic vegetation model, the aDGVM, to project how climate change and fire management influence vegetation in northern Australian savannas in 2100. We show that under future climate conditions, vegetation can store more carbon than under ambient conditions, despite substantial changes in fire regimes. Changes in rainfall seasonality influence future carbon storage but do not turn vegetation into a carbon source, suggesting that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of vegetation change. The application of prescribed fires with varying return intervals and burning season, influences vegetation dynamics and fire induced carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon sequestration is maximized with early dry season fires and long fire return intervals, grass productivity is maximized with late dry season fires at an intermediate fire return intervals. The study has implications for management policy across Australian savannas because it can contribute to identifying fire management strategies that optimize grazing yield, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This knowledge is crucial to maintain important ecosystem services of Australian savannas.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, has encountered a significant number of poorly-sorted and very well-lithified sandstones along its traverse on the floor of Gale Crater. We use images from the hand-lens imager (MAHLI) and elemental chemistry from the ChemCam laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument (LIBS) and the alpha-particle x-ray spectrometer (APXS) to begin to constrain the diagenetic history of these sandstones, including lithification and possible later dissolution. Investigation of MAHLI images reveals that the sediments are poorly-sorted and show very low apparent porosity, generally less than ~5%. However, in some cases, such as the Gillespie Lake sandstone identified in Yellowknife Bay, this apparent porosity includes a significant fraction of void spaces larger than typical sediment grain sizes (~30% by number or 75% of void spaces by area). One possible explanation of these larger pits is that they represent recent removal of soft intraclasts by eolian abrasion. Another possibility is that later diagenetic fluids caused dissolution of more soluble grains, and production of secondary porosity. Investigation into the elemental chemistry of the sandstones has shown that they have a relatively unaltered basaltic bulk composition in spite of possessing a variety of secondary minerals and amorphous material, indicating isochemical diagenetic processes. The chemistry and mineralogy of the cement is not immediately evident based on the initial analyses; there is not a high percentage of salts or evaporative minerals that may easily cement near-surface sandstones. Furthermore, these sandstones lack textures and compositions consistent with pedogenic processes, such as calcrete, silcrete, or ferricrete. Instead, they may record burial and cementation at depth. Cement composition may be constrained through comparison to terrestrial basaltic sandstones, and studying chemical variations along ChemCam and APXS transects of the rocks.",

While GEOS-5 is regularly applied in seasonal-to-decadal climate simulations, and medium range weather prediction and data assimilation, GEOS-5 is also readily adaptable for application as a global mesoscale model in pursuit of global cloud resolving applications. Recent computing advances have permitted experimentation with global atmospheric models at these scales, although production applications like the 7km-G5NR have remained limited.\nBy incorporating a non-hydrostatic finite-volume dynamical core with scale aware physics parameterizations, the 7km-G5NR produces organized convective systems and robust weather systems ideal for producing observations for existing and new remote sensing instruments. In addition to standard meteorological parameters, the 7km-G5NR includes 15 aerosol tracers (including dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and organic carbon), O3, CO and CO2. The 7km-G5NR is driven by prescribed sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice, daily volcanic and biomass burning emissions, as well as high-resolution inventories of anthropogenic sources.\nWe will discuss the technical challenges of producing the 7km-G5NR including the nearly 5 petabytes of full resolution output at 30-minute intervals as required by the OSSE developers, and modifications to the standard GEOS-5 physics to permit convective organization at the ‘grey-zone’ resolution of 7km. Highlights of the 7km-G5NR validation will focus on the representation of clouds and organized convection including tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective complexes, and mid-latitude cyclones; and the impact of cloud radiative effects on the optical depth retrieval of aerosols and carbon species.",

These factors have been utilized to create a number of educational and outreach products to bring subsurface microbes to non-scientist audiences in creative and innovative ways. The Adopt a Microbe curriculum for middle school students provides hands-on activities and investigations for students to learn about microbes and the on-going research about them, and provides opportunities to connect with active expeditions. A new series of videos engages non-scientists with stories about research expeditions and the scientists themselves. A poster and associated activities explore the nature of science using a microbiologist and her research as examples. A new e-book for young children will engage them with age-appropriate text and illustrations. These projects are multidisciplinary, involve science and engineering practices, are available to all audiences and provide examples of high level and meaningful partnerships between scientists and educators and the kinds of products that can result. Subseafloor microbiology projects such as these, aimed at K-12 students and the general public, have the potential to entice the interest of the next generation of microbe scientists and increase general awareness of this important science.",

            "abstract": "Mixing controls volcanic plume behavior. Our understanding of mixing therefore places a critical limit on our capacity to manage volcanic plume hazards. Researchers have investigated mixing for two situations: volcanic plumes with rise times that are long or short relative to the eruption duration. The plumes generated in these two situations are then modeled as thermals or maintained plumes, respectively. The case in the middle, when plume rise times are comparable to the eruption durations, is not often considered. This third class is appropriate to discrete eruptions, such as Strombolian- or Vulcanian-style eruptions, which last a few seconds or tens of seconds and generate relatively small plumes. Here we use numerical experiments to show that mixing occurs differently in this third eruption class because of dynamic features that are distinct from the long- and instantaneous-duration end members. In this presentation we focus on the effect of eruption duration on mixing in the inertia-driven or jet-like phase of ascending volcanic plumes. Our simulation results reveal that air entrainment rates increase after the eruption ends, resulting in enhanced overall mixing in jets from shorter-duration eruptions. Models developed for the other two mixing situations do not predict these results. New models are required for volcanic plumes with rise times comparable to their durations in order to reliably estimate their behavior for hazard management purposes.",

            "abstract": "In the semiarid Coquimbo Region of Chile, high-altitude glaciers and seasonal snow are important sources of freshwater for irrigated agriculture and urban consumption. Due to the aridity of the environment, losses due to sublimation are large which means that accurate melt modelling is essential in order to reliably estimate streamflow. Since 2008, the CEAZA glaciology group has been studying the energy and mass balance of the largest glacier in the catchment, the Tapado Glacier using field and remote sensing measurements, and numerical modelling. The Tapado glacier system (30°08' S, 69°55' W) is a complex assemblage of uncovered and debris-covered ice located at the head of the Elqui basin between 4500 and 5536 m a.s.l. Energy balance modelling studies at the site have been limited in scope due to the development of ice pinnacles or penitentes on snow and ice surfaces. These features complicate energy distribution across the surface, due to modifications of parameters such as albedo. In this paper, we use time-lapse photography and automatic weather station (AWS) measurements to investigate how the development of penitentes impacts the spatial and temporal variability of albedo across the glacier surface and whether terrestrial photography is appropriate for use at such locations. Oblique photographs obtained from a high vantage point were georeferenced using a high resolution digital elevation model available for the entire glacier and its environs. By comparing the photographic data with point albedo measurements made at an AWS, distributed albedo maps were produced. Preliminary results suggest that distributed albedo values may be underestimated by the formation and development of penitentes during the ablation season. Moreover, it was observed that the evolution of the snow line during summer was not only topographically controlled but also modified by occasional convective snowfalls. Time-lapse photography provided to be a cost-effective tool for monitoring remote and high-altitude glaciers at high temporal resolution.",

            "abstract": "Surface waters are an important pathway for the transport of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from terrestrial watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is thought to be more bioavailable than particulate Hg and has been found to be strongly correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in numerous watersheds. The ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable from site to site, which we hypothesize is strongly dependent on local environmental factors such as atmospheric deposition and soil organic carbon (SOC). Sixteen watersheds throughout the United States were used in this study to determine the relationship between the ratio of HgD:DOC, Hg wet deposition, and SOC. The Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) and Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) were used to determine SOC values while HgD:DOC values were obtained from previous studies. Hg wet deposition was reported by the Mercury Deposition Network. There was no correlation found between atmospheric mercury wet deposition and HgD:DOC (r2 = 0.04; p = 0.44) but SOC was able to explain about 71% of the variation in the HgD:DOC ratio (r2 = 0.71; p < 0.01). A mathematical framework was developed to explain the power-law relationship between SOC and HgD:DOC based on soil carbon pools. The framework infers that the amount of Hg adsorbed to SOC does not increase in proportion to SOC at high SOC levels and points towards a Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively deep carbon pools. Overall, this study identifies SOC as a first-order control on the association of HgD and DOC and indicates that globally available SOC datasets can be utilized to predict Hg transport in stream systems.",

            "abstract": "Recent seismic studies have revealed complex structures near 660-km depth. In order to understand the effects of composition and temperature, we measured the depth and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel and post-garnet boundaries at the pressure-temperature conditions of 600-700 km depths in pyrolitic compositions: (1) MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (MAS) and (2) CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-FeO (CMASF).\nGlass starting materials were mixed with either gold or platinum powder (10 wt%) for laser coupling and internal pressure scale. Cold compressed foils of the mixtures were loaded in the diamond-anvil cell together with Ar or KCl for thermal insulation and pressure transmission. X-ray diffraction patterns were measured for the samples in the diamond-anvil cell at in situ high pressure and high temperature combined with double side laser heating at beamlines 13-IDD (GSECARS) and 16-IDB (HPCAT) in the Advanced Photon Source. Within 5 to 8 minutes of heating, stable crystalline phase assemblages were formed and persisted with further heating for 20 to 30 minutes. A total of 160 heating cycles were conducted at different pressures and temperatures, providing tight constrains on the phase boundaries.\nOur data show that the post-spinel transition occurs at 23.6-24.5 GPa and 1850 K with a Clapeyron slope of -2.5(4) MPa/K if the Pt pressure scales are used, consistent with the seismic observation of the 660 discontinuity. The post-garnet boundary occurs at 24.2-27.5 GPa and 1900 – 2450 K. We found that the Clapeyron slope of the post-garnet transition increases with Fe: from 2.4 MPa/K for MAS to 6.2 MPa/K for CMASF. Below 1900 K, garnet disappears near the post-spinel boundary within the resolution of our measurements. Our new data supports the notion that the 660 discontinuity is dominated by the post-spinel phase transition below 1900 K while dominated by the post-garnet phase transition above 1900 K. However, our data indicate much larger Clapeyron slope of the post-garnet transition, suggesting much more significant impact of the transition for the seismically observed topography of the 660 discontinuity and dynamics of the mantle plumes.",

Currently, satellite remote sensing measurements of CO2 are available from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS), Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES). Traditionally, data from these different missions are distributed separately from one another and they each possess different data formats, making it cumbersome for researchers to access, analyze, and perform inter-comparison.\nWe present an effort at JPL to design a web-based science data environment (co2.jpl.nasa.gov) that allows users to access and utilize CO2 data from GOSAT, AIRS, OCO-2, TES, and the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) in a single user-friendly interface. The features of the data environment include the ability to download full mission-specific CO2-related Level 2 data files or to customize them based on location, time, data variable, version, and format. An important feature of the JPL CO2 data environment is that it allows generation of customized Level 3 products and provides detailed documentation on the mission specifications along with technical data information. These tools are designed to allow users streamlined access to relevant remote sensing and ground-based CO2 datasets in order to facilitate research on atmospheric CO2.",

Here we combine annual Landsat disturbance history with single date IKONOS stereo imagery to estimate the change in forest canopy height with the intention of understanding rates of forest regeneration and C accumulation in the CONUS. We produced canopy height models (CHMs) by differencing digital surface models derived from stereo pairs with national elevation data. CHM data were also derived from Goddard’s airborne LiDAR Hyper-spectral and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) and linearly correlated to forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data to develop above ground live dry wood biomass coefficients. We used these coefficients to approximate C sequestration rates and through this approach we captured forest regeneration rates. A slow rate of regeneration was found in Florida of 0.30 m yr‒1 RMSE 7 m, where agro-forestry is less common. We found fast rates of regeneration in the southeastern US of 0.53 m yr‒1 RMSE < 4.3 m where large tracks of loblolly pine are routinely managed and harvested. Aboveground live dry wood biomass accumulated from 162 gCm‒2yr‒1 in Florida to 506 gCm‒2yr‒1 in South Carolina. We evaluated the accuracy of our estimates by comparing to field measurements of growth, airborne LiDAR data, and independent model estimates of C accumulation. Landsat disturbance history and existing stereo archives could provide an independent empirical data source to help constrain C-cycle models in forested ecosystems and reduce our uncertainties about the North American C sink.",

            "abstract": "The CMIP5 archive contains future climate projections from over 50 models provided by dozens of modeling centers from around the world. Individual model projections, however, are subject to biases created by structural model uncertainties. As a result, ensemble averaging of multiple models is often used to add value to model projections: consensus projections have been shown to consistently outperform individual models. Previous reports for the IPCC establish climate change projections based on an equal-weighted average of all model projections. However, certain models reproduce climate processes better than other models. Should models be weighted based on performance? Unequal ensemble averages have previously been constructed using a variety of mean state metrics. What metrics are most relevant for constraining future climate projections? This project develops a framework for systematically testing metrics in models to identify optimal metrics for unequal weighting multi-model ensembles. A unique aspect of this project is the construction and testing of climate process-based model evaluation metrics. A climate process-based metric is defined as a metric based on the relationship between two physically related climate variables—e.g., outgoing longwave radiation and surface temperature. Metrics are constructed using high-quality Earth radiation budget data from NASA's Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument and surface temperature data sets. It is found that regional values of tested quantities can vary significantly when comparing weighted and unweighted model ensembles. For example, one tested metric weights the ensemble by how well models reproduce the time-series probability distribution of the cloud forcing component of reflected shortwave radiation. The weighted ensemble for this metric indicates lower simulated precipitation (up to .7 mm/day) in tropical regions than the unweighted ensemble: since CMIP5 models have been shown to overproduce precipitation, this result could indicate that the metric is effective in identifying models which simulate more realistic precipitation. Ultimately, the goal of the framework is to identify performance metrics for advising better methods for ensemble averaging models and create better climate predictions.",

The detector consists of adjacent and separated target and neutron-capture layers. The IBD events, which result in a neutron and a positron, take place in the target layers. These layers are thin enough so that the neutrons escape without scattering elastically. The neutrons are detected in the thicker neutron-capture layers. The location of the IBD event is determined from the energy deposited by the positron as it slows in the medium and from the two gamma rays that come from the positron annihilation. Since the neutron recoils in the direction of the antineutrino's motion, a line may then be drawn between the IBD event location and the neutron-capture location to approximate the antineutrino's velocity. In some events, we may even measure the positron's velocity, which further increases our ability to reconstruct the antineutrino's direction of motion.\nOur method significantly improves upon previous methods by allowing the neutron to freely travel a long distance before diffusing and being captured. Moreover, our design is a straightforward modification of existing antineutrino detectors; a prototype could easily be built with existing technology. We verify our design through Monte Carlo simulations in Geant4, using commercially-available boron-loaded plastic scintillators for the target and neutron-capture layer materials. We are able to discriminate from background using multiple coincidence signatures within a short, ~microsecond time interval. We conclude that the detector could likely operate above ground with minimal shielding.",

            "abstract": "When we talk about tropical cyclones (TCs), the first things that come to mind are strong winds and storm surge affecting the coastal areas. However, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 59% of the deaths caused by TCs since 1970 is due to fresh water flooding. Heavy rainfall associated with TCs accounts for 13% of heavy rainfall events nationwide for the June-October months, with this percentage being much higher if the focus is on the eastern and southern United States.\nThis study focuses on the evaluation of precipitation associated with the North Atlantic TCs that affected the continental United States over the period 2007 – 2012. We evaluate the rainfall associated with these TCs using four satellite based rainfall products: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA; both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing technique (CMORPH). As a reference data we use gridded rainfall provided by CPC (Daily US Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Precipitation). Rainfall fields from each of these satellite products are compared to the reference data, providing valuable information about the realism of these products in reproducing the rainfall associated with TCs affecting the continental United States.\nIn addition to the satellite products, we evaluate the forecasted rainfall produced by five state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UK Met Office (UKMO), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC). The skill of these models in reproducing TC rainfall is quantified for different lead times, and discussed in light of the performance of the satellite products.",

            "abstract": "The groundwater system at Los Alamos, New Mexico encompasses a complex shallow mountain-block and mountain-front zone; intermediate-depth perched zones located east of the mountain front; and an extensive regional aquifer occupying the Rio Grande rift. In the study area, groundwater-flow paths in the regional aquifer are generally from the northwest to southeast that laterally extend 17 km before discharging to the Rio Grande. This system is unconfined and variable mixing occurs at greater distances east of the primary recharge zones. Since 1943, the regional aquifer has been mined for industrial processes and residential use and consumption at Los Alamos. A large data set for groundwater-age and inorganic solutes has been assembled for the intermediate-depth perched zones and regional aquifer, which provides a potential archive record of paleoclimate-change occurring during the past 10,000 years. Groundwater ages range from modern groundwater to approximately 9,700 years before present. Unadjusted radiocarbon-age results for groundwater samples collected from 58 background-monitoring wells and 10 springs correlate well with natural chloride and perchlorate concentrations and δ18O values. Background concentrations of dissolved perchlorate and chloride increase with increasing groundwater age and residence time. Values of δ18O are slightly heavier in groundwater samples having increasing age, suggesting that warmer climatic conditions occurred 10,000 years before present. Perchlorate and δ18O datasets correlate the strongest with average groundwater age, showing Pearson correlations of 0.81 and 0.71, respectively. The Pearson correlations for chloride to age and perchlorate to chloride are 0.62 and 0.81, respectively. Overall, this dataset suggests that climatic cooling has gradually occurred in north-central New Mexico during the Holocene, and does corroborate previous Holocene climate-change studies conducted in the southwestern United States.",

            "abstract": "While the study of Martian meteorites can provide detailed information about the crust and mantle composition and evolution, remote-sensing observations, through the merging of compositional and geological data, allow highlighting planetary-scale trends of the Martian crustal evolution [1,2]. Recently, the analysis of the global distribution of mafic minerals [3] has put new constraints on the Martian crust formation and evolution. One of the major results is a past global event of olivine-bearing fissural volcanism that has filled craters and low depressions in the southern highlands and a large part of the Northern plains during the late Noachian/early Hesperian. Petrologic models show that this sudden increase of the olivine content at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary could be the result of a rapid thickening of the lithosphere at the end of the Noachian era [4]. A recent study based on the OMEGA/MEx data has shown that the spectral properties of the shergottites are similar to those of some Noachian and Hesperian terrains [5]. To contrary, the Nakhla spectral properties are very different from those of the observable surface and could be representative of Amazonian terrains buried under dust. These results are best explained with an old age of the shergottites [6] and with the present understanding of the evolution of magma composition at a planetary scale [7]. On the other hand, if shergottites are young [8], the similarities between the shergottites and ancient terrains implies that exceptional conditions of melting with respect to the ambient mantle (e.g., hot spots or water-rich mantle source) were responsible for the formation of these samples [9].

            "abstract": "Estuaries provide critical habitat for many economically and culturally important species. In the Pacific Northwest, intertidal and subtidal areas provide critical habitat for production of native and commercial oysters (Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida and Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, respectively) that in turn provide refuge and rearing habitat for Dungeness Crab, Metacarcinus magister. Environments ranging from subtidal through freshwater zones provide nursery areas for juvenile salmonids at different development stages in their life history. Most Oregon estuaries have been significantly altered by humans over the past century, reducing the quantity and diversity of available habitats. Management agencies have responded with projects to restore and enhance estuarine habitats. Unfortunately, future climate change and sea-level rise could render many current restoration projects ineffective over time. Planning for habitat restoration that keeps pace with climate change will be critical to the sustainable production of seafood and maintenance of ecosystem function. However, land managers and citizens lack the spatially-explicit data needed to incorporate the potential effects of climate change and sea-level rise into planning for habitat improvement projects in estuarine areas. To meet this need, we developed simple models using LiDAR to characterize the geomorphologies of multiple Oregon estuaries. We were able to map the margin of current mean high tide, and contour intervals associated with different potential increases in mean high tide. Because our analysis relied on digital data, we compared three types of digital data in one estuary to assess the utility of different data sets in predicting changes in estuary shape. For each estuary, we assessed changes in the amount and complexity of edge habitats. The simple modeling approach we applied can also be used to identify areas that may be most amenable to pre-emptive restoration actions to mitigate or enhance habitats under future climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Climate in West Africa is under the influence of the West African monsoon circulation and mineral dust emitted from the Sahara desert (which is the world’s largest source of mineral dust emission). Dust aerosols alter the atmospheric radiative fluxes and act as cloud condensation nuclei in the process of emission, transportation and deposition. However, our understanding regarding how dust aerosols influence the present-day and future climate of West Africa is very limited. In this study, a regional climate model RegCM4.3.4-CLM4.5 is used to investigate the potential climatic effects of dust aerosols both in present (1981-2000) and future (2081-2100) periods over WA. First, the model performance and dust climatic effects are evaluated. The contribution of dust climatic effects under RCP8.5 scenario and their confounding effects with land use change are assessed. Our results indicate that the model can reproduce with reasonable accuracy the spatial and temporal distribution of climatology, aerosol optical depth and surface concentration over WA. The shortwave radiative forcing of dust is negative in the surface and positive in the atmosphere, with greater changes in JJA and MAM compared to those in SON and DJF. Over most of West Africa, cooling is the dominant effect on temperature. Their impact on precipitation features a dipole pattern, with decrease in the north and increase in the south of West Africa. Despite the dust-induced decrease of precipitation amount, dusts cause extreme precipitation to increase.\nTo evaluate the uncertainties surrounding our modeling results, sensitivity experiments driven by ICBC from MIROC-ESM and CESM and their dynamic downscaling results are used for comparisons. Results from these sensitivity experiments indicate that the impact of dust aerosols on present and future climate is robust.",

            "abstract": "We discuss recent changes in estimates of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI, formerly \"solar constant\") and the energy budget. This more accurate value of TSI implies a more accurate estimate of the Sun's luminosity, and lifetime. We highlight the historic closing of the calibration gap between the suite of TSI instruments, due largely to comparisons made with a cryogenic Transfer Radiometer Facility (TRF) located at the University of Colorado, built by UCO/LASP with support from NASA and NIST. The resulting continuous record of TSI promises to be a milestone in improving understanding of the Sun's impact on Earth's climate. Climate models are sensitive not only to TSI, but also to variations in the Spectral Solar Irradiance (SSI), and the vertical profiles of temperature and ozone are especially sensitive to SSI variations. Variations in SSI need further study before they may be considered as firmly established as TSI variations, which themselves remain controversial, despite a strengthening consensus over the SORCE epoch. The TSIS SIM has recently undergone comprehensive end-to-end calibration in the LASP SSI Radiometry Facility (SRF) utilizing the NIST SIRCUS laser system covering 210–2400 nm for SSI, a facility not yet available when SORCE launched in 2003. With SORCE follow-on missions such as the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS), we anticipate narrowing uncertainties in SSI variability that will be important to improving our understanding of the climate responses to solar forcing. The long-term goal of improving the ability to monitor Earth's energy balance, and the energy imbalance that drives global warming, will need continued improvements in the measurement of both shortwave solar and longwave earth-emitted radiation.",

Today few of Zion’s nearly 3 million annual visitors appreciate that the gentle and inviting, flat valley floor amidst great sandstone cliffs owes its origin to a massive landslide. In addition to representing an extreme-magnitude natural hazard with potentially devastating consequences, we also point out the constructive geomorphic and anthropogenic significance of large rock avalanches in this steep desert landscape. We combine new mapping of rock avalanche and related lacustrine deposits to reconstruct topography before and after the landslide, comment on failure kinematics, and determine new, refined volume estimates for the event. Cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of deposited rock avalanche boulders allows us to date the landslide, determine subsequent rates of deposit erosion, and propose potential triggering mechanisms. Evidence suggests that boulders from across the slide surface were deposited simultaneously, yielding similar exposure ages and indicating a single massive and catastrophic rock slope failure. Rich anthropogenic use of the slide-dammed canyon attests to the long-lasting and diverse impacts of large rock avalanches.",

The climactic phase lasted for about one day and was classified as subplinian to small-moderate with plumes between 9-12 km above the vent and Mass Flow Rate (MFR) on the order of 107 kg/s. The first 10 days of the eruption had MFR values >106 kg/s and were followed by several months of low-intensity plumes. Plume dynamics and rise were strongly affected by wind during the whole eruption, with negligible up-wind spreading. Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) due to column collapse were mostly observed on June 4th-5th when wind velocity was lowest and MFR highest, suggesting that PDC generation can be reduced by wind advection. Individual phases of the eruption range between VEI 3-4, while the cumulative deposit associated with June 4th-7th, 2011, is associated with a VEI 5 and a minimum magnitude of 4.8. Crosswind cloud spreading and deposit dispersal of the first few days could be best described by a linear combination of gravitational spreading and turbulent diffusion, with velocities between 1-10 m/s and diffusion coefficients that are consistent with measured values for atmospheric diffusivity. Downwind cloud spreading could be best described by a linear combination of gravitational intrusion and wind advection, with velocities between 17-45 m/s. Our results show how gravitational spreading can be significant even for small-moderate eruptions strongly advected by wind and with relatively low Richardson number and low MFR.",

Our aim is to have an easily-implemented statistical approach which borrows strength across locations via a spatial model. We use a spatial hierarchical model and employ a two-stage approach for inference. In the first inference stage we obtain individual Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) parameter estimates at each station, and the associated uncertainty covariance matrices; the second stage applies Bayesian methods to determine the true parameter estimates, and the residual spatial dependence. Finally, universal kriging allows us to interpolate spatially and estimate the GEV parameters at unobserved locations. A further development of the model makes use of the climate space, rather than geographical space, to improve the parameter estimates (Cooley et al. 2007).\nWe then use this statistical model to examine the relative influence of a single anomalous extreme (September 2013) on return period estimates for daily precipitation extremes at Boulder and other locations along the Front Range and the consequences that this sensitivity could have on engineered structures lying within the floodplain.\nCooley, D., Nychka, D., & Naveau, P.

            "abstract": "The speciation and reactivity of metals and metal sulfides within the buoyant plume is critical to determining the ultimate fate of metals emitted from hydrothermal vents. The concentration, size fractionation, and partitioning of trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Zn, Cd, Pb) were determined within the first meter of the rising plume at three vent fields (TAG, Snakepit, and Rainbow) along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At Rainbow, total Fe concentrations exceed total sulfide concentrations by an order of magnitude, whereas at the other two sites, total Fe and total sulfide concentrations are nearly equal. At all three sites, Mn and Fe are primarily in the filtered (< 0.2 µm) fraction and Cu, Co, Zn, Cd, and Pb are mainly in the unfiltered fraction. At TAG and Snakepit, unfiltered copper is correlated with unfiltered cobalt, and unfiltered zinc is correlated with unfiltered cadmium and lead. At Rainbow, unfiltered zinc, cadmium and lead are correlated, but unfiltered copper and cobalt are not, indicating precipitation dynamics at Rainbow are different than those at TAG and Snakepit due to bulk geochemical differences, including a higher iron to sulfide ratio. A sequential HCl/HNO3 leaching method was used to distinguish metals present in pyrite and chalcopyrite in both unfiltered and filtered samples. Significant portions of unfiltered Cu and Co were extracted in HNO3, whereas unfiltered Zn, Cd, and Pb were extracted in HCl. Up to 95 % of filtered Cu, Co, and Zn, up to 80% Cd, and up to 60 % Pb are only extractable in HNO3, indicating that a significant portion of metals < 0.2 µm are incorporated into a recalcitrant fraction such as nanoparticulate pyrite or chalcopyrite.",

            "abstract": "The tremor detectors developed for accurately locating tectonic tremor in Cascadia [Armbruster et al., JGR 2014] have been applied to data from the HINET seismic network in Japan. The best results were obtained in the Tokai region with stations ASU, ASH and TYE having relatively close spacing (11-18 km). 330 days with active tremor, 2004-2014, near these stations were found on the daily epicentral distributions of tremor on the HINET web site. The detector sees numbers of detections per day comparable to minor tremor episodes in Cascadia. Major tremor episodes in Cascadia are associated with geodetic signals stronger than those seen in Japan. If the tremor is located by constraining it to the plate interface, a pattern of persistent sources is seen, with some intense sources. This is similar to what was seen in Cascadia. In southwest Shikoku 139 days with tremor were identified. Stations UWA, OOZ and IKT see tremor with persistent patterns and strong sources but with approximately one fifth as many detections per day on active days, compared to ASU-ASH-TYE. The web site tremor distributions show activity here as strong as in Tokai. We believe the lesser number of detections in Shikoku is primarily the result of wider station spacing, 19-30 km, than in Tokai, although there may be other factors. Yabe and Ide [EPS 2013] detect and locate tremor in Kyushu on July 17-18 2005 and December 4-6 2008. A detector with stations NRA, SUK and KTM, station spacing 21-22 km, sees tremor which resembles minor episodes in Cascadia. The relative arrival times are consistent with their locations. We conclude that the methods developed in Cascadia will work in Japan but the typical spacing of HINET stations, ~20 km, is greater than the optimum distance found in analysis of data from Cascadia, 8 to 15 km.",

            "abstract": "Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) explorations in the area of the 1891 Foerstner submarine eruption (Pantelleria, Italy) during cruise NA-018 of the E/V Nautilus has provided the first examination of the vent site of a basaltic balloon-forming eruption. Ultra high-resolution bathymetric mapping defined a mound-like vent morphology in water depths of ~250 meter, constructed dominantly of highly vesicular scoriaceous fragments with minor pillow lava flows. The formation of floating basaltic balloons that reached the surface of the Strait of Sicily during the eruption is attributed to a hybrid Strombolian eruption mechanism that involved pre-concentration of volatiles into gas-rich portions of magma beneath the vent. An important difference of this Strombolian mechanism compared to its subaerial counterpart is the occurrence of buoyant magma discharge in the submarine environment caused by localized high gas contents. The added buoyancy flux modifies the fluid dynamic configuration of magma venting on the seafloor allowing for detachment of highly-inflated parcels of gas-rich magma. Some of these parcels contain large gas cavities that are enveloped in a partially quenched shell and maintain sufficient buoyancy to rise to the sea surface as a basaltic balloon. The majority of the vesicular magma maintains only partial positive buoyancy or negative buoyancy and is explosively fragmented to form large quantities of decimeter-scale fragments that accumulate close to the vent. Formation of the basaltic balloons is thus considered a somewhat accidental process that involves a subset of the total erupted volume of magma during the eruption. Suitable conditions for balloon formation include low magma viscosity, pre-concentration of gas, and moderate pressures (i.e.water depth). The dampening effect of seawater greatly reduces the dispersal of pyroclasts resulting in a mound-like vent morphology compared to subaerial scoria cones typically associated with Strombolian activity.",

            "abstract": "A new total ozone-based ozone profile climatology has been created for use in satellite and/or ground based ozone retrievals. This climatology was formed by combining data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) with data from balloon sondes and binned by zone and total ozone. Because profile shape varies with total column ozone, this climatology better captures the ozone variations than the previously used seasonal climatologies, especially near the tropopause. This is significantly different than ozone climatologies used in the past as there is no time component. The MLS instrument on Aura has excellent latitude coverage and measures ozone profiles daily from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere at ~3.5 km resolution. Almost a million individual MLS ozone measurements are merged with data from over 55,000 ozonesondes which are then binned as a function of total ozone. The climatology consists of average ozone profiles as a function of total ozone for six 30 degree latitude bands covering altitudes from 0-75 km (in Z* pressure altitude coordinates). This new climatology better represents the profile shape as a function of total ozone than previous climatologies and shows some remarkable and somewhat unexpected correlations between total ozone and ozone in the lower altitudes, particularly in the lower and middle troposphere. These data can also be used to infer biases and errors in either the MLS retrievals or ozone sondes.",

            "abstract": "Until 2008, abiotic methane in land-based serpentinized ultramafic rocks was documented (including gas and C- and H- isotope compositions) only at sites in Oman, Philippines, New Zealand and Turkey. Methane emanates from seeps and/or hyperalkaline water springs along faults and is associated with molecular hydrogen. These were considered to be very unusual and rare occurrences of gas. Now, methane is documented for peridotite-based springs or seeps (in ophiolites, orogenic massifs or intrusions) in US, Canada, Costa Rica, Greece, Italy, Japan, New Caledonia, Portugal, Spain and United Arab Emirates. Gas flux measurements are indicating that methane can also flux as invisible microseepages from the ground, through fractured peridotites, even far removed from seeps and springs. Methane C-isotope ratios range from -6 to -37 permil (VPDB) for dominantly abiotic methane. The more 13-C depleted values, e.g., California, are likely mixed with biotic gas (microbial and thermogenic gas). Methane H-isotope ratios cover a wide range from -118 to -333 permil (VSMOW). The combination of C- and H-isotopes clearly distinguish biotic from abiotic methane. Radiocarbon (14-C) analysis from bubbling seeps in Italian peridotites indicate that the methane is fossil (pMC <0.2), i.e., older than 50,000 years, similar to the Chimaera seeps in Turkey. So, methane observed in the hyperalkaline waters cannot be produced in the same waters because these are only a few thousands years old. The low temperatures of land-based peridotites (generally <100 °C at depths of 3-4 km) also constrain methane production. We discuss some hypotheses concerning gas generation in water vs. dry systems, i.e., in deeper, older, waters or in unsaturated rocks). We also discuss low vs. high temperatures, i.e., at the present-day low T conditions or at higher temperatures eventually occurring in the early stages of peridotite emplacement on land.",

            "abstract": "Cloud processing of CCN spectra is described by Hudson and Noble (2014) and Noble and Hudson (2014). Bimodal CCN spectra have also been observed in 4 Southern Hemisphere (SH) cloud research projects: SOCEX1, July 1993 and 2, Jan-Feb, 1995 and ACE1, Nov-Dec, 1995 all off Tasmania and INDOEX, Feb-Mar, 1999 Indian Ocean (Fig.). However, as in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) bimodal CCN spectra are interspersed with monomodal spectra, which indicates that cloudy boundary layers are not as well-mixed as conventional wisdom. Hoppel minima between the modes provide estimates of cloud effective supersaturations (Seff). Unlike DMA measurements particle composition/hygroscopicity (κ) is not needed for these Seff estimate because CCN are measured in terms of S. However, these Hoppel Seff often tend to be lower than Seff obtained by comparing below cloud CCN spectra with nearby cloud droplet concentrations (Nc). These Seff differences may be due to less cloud processing by smaller cloud droplets. However, this may be a smaller issue in the SH due to larger droplets in cleaner air masses. Furthermore, SH Seff may also tend to be higher for the same reason. This might reduce the Seff differences of the two types of estimates compared to the more polluted NH. SH/NH comparisons of detailed differential CCN spectra can provide an important baseline for preindustrial aerosol. Relative differences between the contribution of chemical and physical cloud processing between hemispheres also provide important baseline characteristics. Chemical processing enhance the indirect aerosol effect (IAE) by moving CCN to lower critical S (Sc), which increases droplet concentrations (Nc) whereas physical processing reduces IAE by inherently reducing CCN (Noble and Hudson 2014). The extent of cloud processing is as important as CCN sources.\nHudson and Noble 2014, this meeting.\nNoble and Hudson 2014, this meeting.",

            "abstract": "Chaos Crags, located in Lassen Volcanic National Park, is a series of 6 rhyodacite domes that exhibit dramatic evidence of magma mixing. Mafic enclaves from the Chaos Crags form two distinct textural groups: a finer-grained group containing abundant plagioclase crystals from the host rhyodacite, and a coarser-grained group generally lacking host phenocrysts. Enclave samples were collected from Dome B of the Chaos Crags with the intent of obtaining complete suites of the two textural groups. Geochemical data for the enclaves shows a weak correlation between texture and geochemistry. Notably, the geochemical data also shows two distinct chemical trends that appear to represent mixing with two different felsic components. The dominant trend shows mixing between the host rhyodacite and the mafic end member. The second trend is interpreted to result from mixing between the mafic end member and a cryptic felsic component that is distinct from the host rhyodacite. Modeling of major oxides, selected trace elements and rare earth elements suggests that, although the two clusters of enclaves mix towards different felsic end members, they appear start from the same mafic end member, which has a composition of approximately: SiO2 51.84%, CaO 10.45%, K2O 0.69%, P2O5 0.10%, MgO 5.35%, Na2O 2.8%, FeO 8.25%, Fe2O3 1.84%, Al2O3 19.47% and TiO2 0.76%, a composition common in the Lassen region. Preliminary modeling results indicate that, at 75% SiO2, the cryptic felsic component has a composition of: K2O 5.25%, P2O5 1.2%, Na2O 8.25%, Al2O3 14.65%, Fe2O3 0.18%, FeO 0.88% and TiO2 1.46%, with negligible amounts of CaO and MgO. At 70% SiO2 this composition is approximately: K2O 4.3%, P2O5 0.95%, Na2O 7.05%, Al2O3 15.66%, TiO2 1.31%, FeO 2.51% and Fe2O3 0.55% with negligible amounts of CaO and MgO. It is likely that this previously unrecognized mixing trend represents crustal contamination of the mafic end member. A suite of samples with compositions intermediate between these two trends is also present.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of seafloor compliance, the deformation under long period (typically 30-300 s) ocean wave forcing, are primarily sensitive to crustal shear velocity structure. We analyze seafloor compliance from data collected from a subset of 50 broadband Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS) deployed at the Eastern Lau spreading center (ELSC) from 2009 to 2010. The ELSC is a 400-km-long back-arc spreading center lying closely to the Tonga subduction trench in the southwestern Pacific. Seafloor morphology, crustal seismic structure and lava composition data show rapid variations along the ridge as the ridge migrates away from the volcanic arc front to the north, indicating a decreasing influence of the subducting slab.\nWe calculate seafloor compliance functions by taking the spectral transfer function between the vertical displacement and pressure signal recorded by the 4-component OBSs, which are equipped with differential pressure gauges (DPGs). In the ridge perpendicular direction, compliance amplitude vary by more than an order of magnitude from the ridge crest to older seafloor covered by sediment. Along the spreading ridge, compliance measured from on-axis sites increases southwards, indicative of a decrease in the upper crustal shear velocity possibly due to increasing porosity and a thickening extrusive layer [Jacobs et al., 2007; Dunn et al., 2013]. We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to invert the compliance functions for crustal shear velocities at various locations along the ELSC.",

Although the projected effects of extreme events and land use change on hydrology have been resonably well studied, the impacts on urban water quality have not been widely examined due in part to the scale mismatch between global climate models and the spatial scales required to represent urban hydrology and water quality signals. Here we describe a grid-based modeling system that integrates the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) and urban water quality module adpated from EPA’s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Using the model system, we evaluate, for four partially urbanized catchments within the Puget Sound basin, urban water quality under current climate conditions, and projected potential changes in urban water quality associated with future changes in climate and land use. We examine in particular total suspended solids, toal nitrogen, total phosphorous, and coliform bacteria, with catchment representations at the 150-meter spatial resolution and the sub-daily timestep. We report long-term streamflow and water quality predictions in response to extreme precipitation events of varying magnitudes in the four partially urbanized catchments. Our simulations show that urban water quality is highly sensitive to both climatic and land use change.",

            "abstract": "For gravimetric observation systems on mobile platforms (land/sea/airborne), the Low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) issue is the main barrier to achieving an accurate, high resolution gravity signal. Normally, low-pass filters (Childers et al 1999, Forsberg et al 2000, Kwon and Jekeli 2000, Hwang et al 2006) are applied to smooth or remove the high frequency “noise” - even though some of the high frequency component is not necessarily noise. This is especially true for aerogravity surveys such as those from the Gravity for the Redefinition of the American Vertical Datum (GRAV-D) project. These gravity survey flights have a spatial resolution of 10 km between tracks but higher resolution along track. The along track resolution is improved due to the lower flight height (6.1 km), equipment sensitivity, and improved modeling of potential errors. Additionally, these surveys suffer from a loss of signal power due to the increased flight elevation. Hence, application of a low-pass filter removes possible signal sensed in the along-track direction that might otherwise prove useful for various geophysical and geodetic applications. Some cutting-edge developments in Wavelets and Artificial Neural Networks had been successfully applied for obtaining improved results (Li 2008 and 2011, Liang and Liu 2013). However, a clearer and fundamental understanding of the error characteristics will further improve the quality of the gravity estimates out of these gravimetric systems. Here, instead of using any predefined basis function or any a priori model, the idea of Factor Analysis is first employed to try to extract the underlying factors of the noises in the systems. Real data sets collected by both land vehicle and aircraft will be processed as the examples.",

In future, while robust decrease of CAO duration dominates in most of the North America, the decrease over northwestern U.S. was found to have much smaller magnitude than the surrounding regions. We found statistically significant increase of the sea level pressure over gulf of Alaska, leading to the advection of cold air to northwestern U.S.. By shifting the probability distribution of present temperature towards future warmer conditions, we identified the changes in large scale circulation contribute to about 50% of the enhanced sea level pressure. Using the high resolution regional climate model results, we found that increases of existing snowpack could potentially trigger the increase of CAO in the near future over the southwestern U.S. and Rocky Mountain through surface albedo effects. By the end of this century, the top 5 most extreme historical CAO events may still occur and wind chill warning will continue to have societal impacts over North America in particular over northwestern United States.",

            "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the long wavelength shape of a longitudinal river profile is mainly controlled by uplift rate history and moderated by erosion, both of which can vary as a function of time and space. Thus, knowing the shape of a river and adequately parametrizing the erosional processes, it is feasible to retrieve spatial and temporal patterns of regional uplift rate by applying an inversion scheme. Here, a damped, non-negative, least-squares algorithm is used to model a drainage inventory from South America. The aim is to determine the uplift history of this continent. ~1800 river profiles were extracted from a digital elevation model of South America and their fidelity was checked using satellite imagery. The inverse problem is then solved by minimizing the misfit between observed and predicted river profiles as a function of uplift rate, which is allowed to vary smoothly as a function of time and space. Erosional processes are modelled using an advection-diffusion formulation, which includes both detachment-limited and transport-limited forms of erosion. The parameter space of the erosional model is constrained using independent observations of uplift and incision rate histories from different locations across South America. Residual misfit between observed and calculated rivers is small, demonstrating that coherent signals occur on different river profiles and uplift events across South America can be resolved. Inversion results suggest, for instance, rapid growth of the Andes from an elevation of ~2 km to ~4 km within the last 20 Ma. Youthful uplift occurred in the northern Andes, whereas the central and southern Andes appear to have grown mainly within the last 10 Ma. The Borborema Province also experienced uplift (1–2 km) during the last 20 Ma. Calculated uplift histories are consistent with independent spot measurements of uplift constrained by, for example, thermochronology, stable-isotope altimetry and carbonate-clastic sedimentation offshore.",

            "abstract": "Cloud droplets form on preexisting aerosol particles, so in pristine air with low particulate concentrations, the number concentration of cloud droplets is constrained by their availability. The size and concentration of these cloud droplets plays a significant role in determining cloud albedo. Over the Southern Ocean (35S-55S), which is far removed from continental or anthropogenic aerosol sources, cloud droplet number density (Nd) is controlled by natural oceanic aerosol such as sea salt or phytoplanktonic sources. While the Southern Ocean cloud albedo plays a significant role in determining global climate sensitivity, there is not a strong consensus on what these sources are and how strongly they affect Nd and, consequently, cloud albedo. Here we show from observations that Nd is correlated with chlorophyll-a, a proxy of ocean primary productivity, and that the marine biogenic aerosol calculated using the framework of Burrows et al. (2014) and modeled sulfate aerosol from the Aerocom multi-model median product explain more than half of the variability in observed Nd. We attribute enhancement of Nd over regions of high biological activity to high concentrations of sulfate aerosol at lower latitudes (35-45 S) and to organic matter in sea spray aerosol at higher latitudes (45-55 S). The enhancement in reflected shortwave owing to biogenic sources influencing Nd is estimated using offline radiative transfer performed in the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5).",

Estimated slip up to 8–9 m was concentrated in a region southeast of the hypocenter, and overall, the slip distribution shows spatial correspondence with regions of asperities estimated from geologic data in northern Chile. Tens of thousands of open cracks throughout coastal regions of northern Chile, including several thousand that were freshly opened by the Pisagua earthquake sequence, preserve a record of coseismic stress throughout the past million years. Inversion of these inferred stress orientations for megathrust slip, representing a cumulative or average earthquake on the northern Chilean subduction zone, reveals two concentrations of slip: one coincident with the hypocenter and the other located close to the peak slip estimated from seismic waveform and geodetic inversions from the 2014 event. This suggests that the rupture of various asperities in northern Chile in earthquakes with a 125–150 year recurrence interval may occur repeatedly over neotectonic time scales. Geologic evidence of earthquake-related forearc deformation and the consistency in earthquake rupture patterns that it implies complement the growing body of geophysical data aimed at characterizing the spatiotemporal signatures of seismic cycle processes on the world’s megathrusts.",

Principle components include training participants to assess risk, from hazard to vulnerability, and communicate effectively with government agencies, media, public and private sectors before, during and after natural disasters. Nine weeks of training involve 5 weeks of lectures in Geneva (in English), 2 weeks of field immersion and 2 weeks of exams. Participant experience culminates in completion of an independent research memoir carried out over an additional 6 months.\nThe course is divided into five modules: the risk management module, which includes humanities and social sciences and brings together a multi-disciplinary team of experts to provide participants with tools they can use to assess hazard, vulnerability and risk and provide solutions to risk management issues in their own countries; and four thematic risk modules, i.e., volcanic risk, seismic risk, landslide risk, and flood and climate related risk. As part of the volcanic risk module we also carry out a role-play exercise at the elementary school in Vulcano Island, Italy in collaboration with the Italian Civil Protection with the double goal of sensitizing the CERG-C participants on the importance of training hazard and risk at an early stage in people’s life as well as to raise awareness in the local population on topics such as the evaluation of volcanic hazards and risk, management of a volcanic crisis, and the importance of the collaboration between citizens and official institutions, such as the Civil Protection.\nThe CERG-C has been training international graduate students and practitioners since 1988 on a yearly basis. To date, 350 participants have been trained from 80 countries, representing a great contribution to the development of national capacities in natural risk assessment and management.",

Existing parameterisations of the circulation and mixing of such inflows are often based on the entrainment of ambient fluid into the underflowing gravity currents. However, recent observations have suggested that uni-directional entrainment into a gravity current does not fully describe the transfer between such gravity currents and the ambient water.\nLaboratory experiments visualised peeling detrainment from the gravity current occurring when the ambient fluid was stratified. A theoretical model of the observed peeling detrainment was developed to predict the temperature profile in the basin. This new model gives a better approximation of the temperature profile observed in the experiments than the pre-existing entraining model. The model can now be developed such that it integrates into operational models of lake basins.",

The NASA ER-2 flew in this campaign as a GPM simulator with radars and radiometers that covered the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) frequencies. The main goal for the ER-2 high spatial and temporal resolution data sets to be used for GPM algorithm validation and improvement. Goddard Space Flight Center provided 3 nadir-pointing radars that covered X- through W-band. The High-altitude Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP) provided Ku and Ka-band measurements that are similar to GPM’s DPR. In addition, the W-band Cloud Radar System (CRS) and ER-2 X-band Radar (EXRAD) were on board. The 4 frequencies provide opportunity for developing consistent retrieval algorithms as well as to expand the dynamic range (i.e., particle size) of the retrievals. There were a total of 15 science flights during IPHEx that measured a variety of land-based and oceanic precipitation, with may convective, stratiform, and cloud targets. This presentation will provide preliminary observations and analyses from the IPHEx ER-2 radars. It will discuss planned retrieval algorithms and data analyses.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion and deposition play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, constituting an important driver of atmospheric CO2. Clarification of the net effect of landscape evolution on the C cycle may be achieved using coupled fully-distributed modelling of hydro-geomorphic and biogeochemical processes.\nWe developed a distributed model of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics within an existing coupled physically-based hydro-geomorphic model (tRIBS - Erosion) to simulate the effects of soil erosion and deposition on C dynamics at basin scale. The SOC mass balance is analytically formulated at each cell using temporally variant, continuous vertical profiles of SOC content and SOC production and oxidation rate constants derived from SOC turnover characteristics. Landscape evolution feedbacks on C dynamics include the redistribution of eroded SOC, and the alteration of the SOC production and oxidation throughout the corresponding vertical profiles due to geomorphic perturbations. At each time step, model outputs include lateral and vertical C fluxes, and SOC content, at each soil column.\nWe applied the model to the Calhoun Experimental Forest in South Carolina, which constitutes a forest recovering from agricultural land degradation prior to the mid-20th century. To test performance we carried out a point comparison against a spreadsheet-based model, SOrCERO (Soil Organic Carbon, Erosion, Replacement, and Oxidation) of SOC dynamics, which estimates effects of SOC erosion and altered SOC production and oxidation on CO2 release at an eroding profile. At a point, time integrated results from the two models were comparable. The proposed model has the additional advantage of being able to quantify C sinks and sources across the landscape in a spatially explicit manner, by systematically accounting for topographic controls on C dynamics. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the alteration of SOC production and oxidation due to landscape evolution and management practices exert a strong control on soil-atmosphere C exchange.",

            "abstract": "A 3D groundwater-flow model was developed using MODFLOW and MODPATH particle tracking to simulate movement of water through a 293-m public-supply well under unpumped and pumped conditions. The well, located in the Rialto-Colton groundwater basin in Southern Calif., penetrates two water-bearing units, separated by a low-permeability layer, and has been inactive for 8 years as a result of perchlorate contamination; field data show 13 kg of perchlorate is redistributed annually through the well from the upper to the lower unit. The local-scale (13.7 km2) model included one pumping well and was calibrated to wellbore flow and head data. The parameter-estimation software, PEST, was used to estimate hydraulic conductivities (K) for each of 18 homogeneous and isotropic model layers. The PEST problem was ill-posed, which was partially mitigated by applying singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization. Prior information included lithology from drillers’ logs and approximate regional water-level gradients. The model simulated: 1) unpumped wellbore flow and contaminant redistribution from the upper, contaminated unit to the lower, uncontaminated unit; and 2) pumped wellbore flow and contaminant recapture. Model results indicated that a vertical head gradient of about 1% could vertically redistribute the perchlorate through the unpumped well. The longitudinal extent of the redistributed contaminant plume in the direction of the regional horizontal gradient was strongly dependent on the calibrated K values. In addition, the simulated horizontal distribution of contaminants in the transverse direction matched observed concentrations collected from a nearby well at various depths. Under pumped conditions, 67% of the tracked particles were recaptured within 10 years of resuming pumping at 13,250 L/min. Sensitivity analyses revealed that perchlorate recapture estimates are unaffected by small uncertainties in K or the regional gradient imposed by the boundary conditions.",

They support purposes, such as irrigation, hydropower generation, and flood control, which can substantially change water fluxes at the land surface and redistribute the storage of surface water in space and time. Although most developed countries have sophisticated observing systems for many variables in the natural surface water cycle, long-term and consistent records that focus on water management and human impacts on the global water cycle are much more limited, and most land surface models ignore water management activities. We describe a continental-scale model of reservoir storage, which is combined with a soil moisture deficit-based irrigation scheme within the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale hydrological model to simulate the effects of water management in the major river basins of the world. The model is forced with merged NCEP/NCAR and satellite meteorological data at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees latitude-longitude, for the period 1948 to 2010. A total of 167 of the largest reservoirs in the world with a total storage capacity around 3900 km3 (nearly 60% of the global total reservoir storage) are simulated. We successfully predict the monthly reservoir storage time series for most of a set of 23 global reservoirs for which observed storage is available either via in situ or satellite remote sensing measurements. We evaluate, on a continental and global basis, the magnitude of inter-seasonal and inter-annual reservoir storage variations in comparison with other terms in the land surface water cycle, including Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "The Sabratah Basin is situated on the continental margin of Africa. In this presentation we use a series of grids of 3D seismic data, supported by potential field data, to document the structure and evolution of the basin. Although the basin is thought to be underlain by Paleozoic rocks, the oldest encountered in wells are Triassic in age. These are continental passing upwards into evaporites, a sequence thought to represent the progressive subsidence of the margin during major Mesozoic extension related to the opening of the Tethyan Ocean. Continued subsidence through the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous led to the deposition of marine sequences. The basin deepens towards the northeast, as the crust thins in the same direction. Crustal thinning in this direction is supported by an increase from southwest to northeast in the gravity. However, since the Late Cretaceous, there has been compression between Africa and Europe as a result of the Alpine collision, causing the inversion of the former extensional features, and creating en echelon folds trending ENE-WSW and segmented by en echelon northwest trending right-lateral faults. The geometries we observe are consistent with a right lateral shear roughly parallel to the continental margin. The Bouguer gravity anomaly map of the Sabratah Basin has relatively a smooth gradient with gravity increasing seaward to the northeast. The strong southwest-to-northeast increase in gravity values is probably related to the seaward swallowing of Moho as the crust thins in the that direction. This gradient is interrupted by two local gravity anomalies associated with magnetic anomalies and bounded the Sabratah basin, the WNW trending Jarrafa anomaly to the NE and to the SW the NS trending Jeffara anomaly with varying amplitudes. The high density and magnetisation of the source bodies indicates that they probably comprise mafic igneous rock. The depth to magnetic source estimated by source parameter imaging (SPI) and Euler Deconvolution techniques indicates that, the base of the magnetic bodies may be controlled by the depth of the Curie isotherm.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has identified a connection between the strength of low-level trade wind inflow from the relatively dry southeastern Pacific basin and the position of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). This circulation-precipitation relationship has been noted in composite analysis applied to reanalysis data as well as to output from current generation climate models, although the causality is ambiguous. Additionally, given that prior studies exhibit deep vertical structures associated with changes to low-level inflow east of the SPCZ, the relationship between low-level inflow variability and the propagation of upper level mid-latitude synoptic disturbances into the SPCZ remains unclear. Thus, forcing models with prescribed circulation and moisture anomalies may be instructive for untangling the dynamic and thermodynamic contributions to such interactions, as well as their potential causality. To that end, we use the Quasi-equilibrium Tropical Circulation Model 2 (QTCM2), an intermediate complexity model with a separate boundary layer of fixed height imposed at the base of the free troposphere, to explore the response of the SPCZ, and more broadly convection across the South Pacific, to perturbed low- and upper-level circulation and moisture fields east of its climatological position. Preliminary results suggest a strong precipitation response to strengthened low-level trade wind inflow, hypothesized to be the result of increased convergence in the climatological SPCZ, with an associated decrease in Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) precipitation. Conversely, there is a limited precipitation response to weakened low-level trade wind inflow despite a notable (2-3 g kg-1) increase in specific humidity, suggesting the climatological low-level inflow is already associated with the necessary moisture threshold for deep convection. Ultimately, these results suggest dynamics play a stronger role than thermodynamics in the interaction as modeled by QTCM2.",

            "abstract": "Elevated chloride and bromide in oil and gas wastewaters that are released to the environment are one of the major environmental risks in areas impacted by shale gas development [Olmstead et al.,2013]. In addition to direct contamination of streams, the potential for formation of highly toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water in utilities located downstream from disposal sites poses a serious risk to human health. Here we report on the occurrence of iodide in oil and gas wastewater. We conducted systematic measurements of chloride, bromide, and iodide in (1) produced waters from conventional oil and gas wells from the Appalachian Basin; (2) hydraulic fracturing flowback fluids from unconventional Marcellus and Fayetteville shale gas, (3) effluents from a shale gas spill site in West Virginia; (4) effluents of oil and gas wastewater disposed to surface water from three brine treatment facilities in western Pennsylvania; and (5) surface waters downstream from the brine treatment facilities. Iodide concentration was measured by isotope dilution-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, which allowed for a more accurate measurement of iodide in a salt-rich matrix. Iodide in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas produced and flowback waters varied from 1 mg/L to 55 mg/L, with no systematic enrichment in hydraulic fracturing fluids. The similarity in iodide content between the unconventional Marcellus flowback waters and the conventional Appalachian produced waters clearly indicate that the hydraulic fracturing process does not induce additional iodide and the iodide content is related to natural variations in the host formations. Our data show that effluents from the brine treatment facilities have elevated iodide (mean = 20.9±1 mg/L) compared to local surface waters (0.03± 0.1 mg/L). These results indicate that iodide, in addition to chloride and bromide in wastewater from oil and gas production, poses an additional risk to downstream surface water quality and drinking water utilities given the potential of formation of iodate-DBPs in drinking water.\nOlmstead, S.M. et al.

Within High Mountain Asia (HMA), there is no mechanism that is more important in contributing to water supply during winter, and therefore it is important that we create a baseline climatology of these disturbances and further explore variability over time. Eulerian methods of investigating variance of fields related to WWD at synoptic scales are typically employed as a general measure of storm track activity. However, Eulerian statistics cannot convey important information regarding the specifics of individual systems, nor can the attributes of a cyclone be taken directly. Thus, a Lagrangian method of automatically tracking WWD, which can provide complementary information about individual systems and allows us to investigate track activity, is desired. Currently, there is no technique that adequately captures WWD, which often propagate along relatively low latitudes, encounter highly variable topography, exhibit strong tropical influences, and are highly asymmetric.\nIn this study, we utilize the atmospheric wave signature of WWD in upper-level geopotential height to identify individual systems responsible for HMA precipitation and track their life cycles. This provides a valuable link between the large-scale climate, transient disturbances, and hydrologic processes within HMA, and allows us to evaluate WWD on a per-case basis while considering all factors that relate these systems to precipitation in the mountains. This framework enables us to consider the relative contribution of dynamically forced orographic precipitation in HMA associated with cyclone intensity and wind speed, as well as the contribution of convective instability, which may facilitate heavy precipitation with weak mechanical forcing of air over topography. Our individual event perspective aids in understanding the non-linear relationship between the strength of an extra-tropical cyclone, the characteristics of interacting air-masses over the Indian subcontinent, and the amount of precipitation received in HMA.",

            "abstract": "Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) has been used to monitor subsurface biogeochemical processes in a variety of lab and field studies. However, there are several competing mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the SIP effect. This work targets the influence of ion sorption to mineral surfaces as a controlling factor on SIP utilizing a pH dependent surface adsorption experiment. In this experiment we use silica gel as an idealized medium where the number of available sites for cation sorption, which in this case is limited to Na+ and H+ ions, is influenced by changes in pH via protonation/deprotonation of silanol groups. The experiment uses 22Na as an in situ tracer as the radioactive decay of this nuclide can be continuously and non-invasively monitored using sensors placed outside of a column. The experiment was conducted by continuously pumping a 0.01M NaCl solution spiked with of 1µCi/L 22Na in to the column under three pH conditions (pH 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0). In the experiment, we observed an increasing number of gamma counts caused by the accumulation of sorbed 22Na in the column as we increased the pH from 5.0 to 6.5, and finally to 8.0. Simultaneously, we observed a linearly correlated (R2 = 0.99) rise in the imaginary conductivity response of the SIP measurements. Using the triple layer electrochemical polarization model for grain polarization to simulate our experimental SIP responses, we found that the estimated surface site density is within a factor of two of that estimated from the mass accumulation of sodium. Since the accumulation of sodium on the silica gel surface is responsible for both the increase in gamma radiation and the change in the electrical response, these observations support the theory that mobile ions in the Stern layer of mineral surfaces provide the primary control on SIP signals in silicate materials.",

In case of multiphase flow, however, the presence of interfaces greatly complicates the dynamics of fluid displacement, leading to abrupt and spontaneous fluid redistribution (e.g., Haines jumps). We use numerical simulations (based on the solution of the Navier Stokes equation and on the Volume-Of-Fluid method) to investigate the role of inertia during these events and assess their impact on macroscopic quantities.\nWe demonstrate that the characteristic velocity of the reconfiguration events is in general unaffected by the injection rate: it is solely determined by the released amount of surface energy. Local velocities largely exceed typical injection velocity. We performed an energy-based analysis of this process and we demonstrate that inertia dominates the reconfiguration dynamics, leading to damped oscillations with their own timescale. In complex media, the oscillations are so frequent and so persistent that they affect the fluid distribution and, consequently, the work done by the external forces, which is related to macroscopic quantities such as relative and unsaturated permeabilities.",

            "abstract": "Designing and monitoring of geothermal systems is a complex task which requires a multidisciplinary approach. Deep geothermal reservoir models are prone to greater uncertainty, with a lack of direct data and lower resolution of surface geophysical methods. However, recent technical advances have enabled the potential use of permanent downhole vertical resistivity arrays for monitoring fluid injection. As electrical resistivity is sensitive to temperature changes, such data could provide valuable information for deep geothermal reservoir characterization.\nThe objective of this study is to assess the potential of time-lapse cross-borehole ERT to constrain 3D realizations of geothermal reservoir properties. The synthetic case of a permeable geothermal reservoir in a sedimentary basin was set up, as a confined deep and saline sandstone aquifer with intermediate reservoir temperatures (150ºC), depth (1 km) and 30m thickness. The reservoir permeability distribution is heterogeneous, as the result of a fluvial depositional environment. The ERT monitoring system design is a triangular arrangement of 3 wells at 150 m spacing, including 1 injection and 1 extraction well. The optimal number and spacing of electrodes of the ERT array design is site-specific and has been assessed through a sensibility study. Dipole-dipole and pole-pole electrode configurations were used.\nThe study workflow was the following: 1) Generation of a reference reservoir model and 100 stochastic realizations of permeability; 2) Simulation of saturated single-phase flow and heat transport of reinjection of cooled formation fluid (50ºC) with TOUGH2 software; 3) Time-lapse forward ERT modeling on the reference model and all realizations (observed and simulated apparent resistivity change); 4) heuristic optimization on ERT computed and calculated data. Preliminary results show significant reduction of parameter uncertainty, hence realization space, with assimilation of cross-borehole ERT data. Loss in sensitivity of ERT between boreholes is compensated here by the stochastic modeling approach, rather than using a deterministic inversion scheme. Our results suggest stochastic reservoir simulations, together with assimilation of cross-borehole ERT data, could be useful tools for design and monitoring of deep geothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface reservoir modelling, whether for groundwater, storage or oil/gas production relies on geophysical data for determining structure, rocks and fluid variations. The traditional approach depends on stochastic inversion of the geophysical image into subsurface models. However, in addition to geophysical data a wealth of geological information is available from analog or previous studies. Most of this information is ignored, and inversions resort to more mathematically-inspired priors often based on covariance models. In this presentation, using a real field application, we propose a method to validate a rich geological prior with geophysical data without the need for costly inversions. The result of this work is a wide, but geologically-realistic prior that can then be used in subsequent stochastic inversions. To achieve this, we propose to validate plausible geological models (from analog studies) with the observed geophysical data through a global, pattern-based measure of dissimilarity. This global dissimilarity measure is defined between the forward simulated geophysical response of a large variety of geologically plausible models and the observed field data. The proposed dissimilarity measure relies on a comparison of the wavelet decompositions between observed and forward simulated geophysical responses. The difference in frequency distribution of the wavelet coefficients is used via a JS-divergence measure to define the dissimilarity between all the subsurface models and the observed data.\nThe proposed approach is applied to a real field offshore reservoir in West Africa, where a 3D seismic cube is available. The uncertain geological parameters defined for this case are the rock physic model, the infill channels size, depth, sinuosity, the proportion of sand/shale and the stacking patterns.",

            "abstract": "Export of nitrogen from different watersheds across the United States is receiving increasing attention due to the impairment of water quality in receiving water bodies. Researchers have indicated that different land uses exerted a substantial influence on the water quality. Nitrogen loadings on the watershed scale are being studied in many large ecosystems, such as the Baltimore Ecosystem and Arizona Ecosystem, but only a few focuses in a smaller scale such as catchment scale. Characterization of the land use in catchment scale can better explain the observed environmental phenomena under the watershed scale and enrich the related watershed studies. Nitrogen fluxes have been studied at Lake Alice watershed in Gainesville, Florida with a focus on the rarely studied catchments such as sports fields with intensive fertilization management (SFC), urban area with reclaimed water irrigation (RWC) and urban area without irrigation (CC). The entire study started from May 2013. Discharge was monitored in the three catchments by transducers every 5 minutes. Regular biweekly grab samples in the three catchments were used to estimate the baseflow N loads, composite samples in 13 storms were collected to estimate the stormflow N loads. The results showed that in the baseflow, the average NO3-N concentration in SFC was 12.19 mg/l, which was significantly different from the urban catchments. Also there was a significant difference between the NO3-N concentrations in RWC (1.17 mg/l on average) and CC (0.60 mg/l on average). A separate log-log relationship was developed between discharge and N loads to estimate the baseflow N loads and stormflow N loads. It showed that baseflow contributed more N loads than stormflow in the three catchments in the annual N load. In conclusion, the recreational catchment received the greatest N load compared to the other catchments, so it should be the priority catchment when it comes to adopting nutrient management practices in the Lake Alice watershed.",

            "abstract": "We use large ensembles of coupled model experiments to assess the contribution of observed variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to AMOC variability and to Northern Hemisphere climate variations over the period 1901-2013. We use multiple versions of GFDL coupled models, and conduct ensembles of simulations in which the ocean component of the coupled model is forced with anomalous NAO related fluxes of heat, water, and momentum. The spatial pattern of these fluxes is derived based on the regression of ECMWF-Interim reanalysis fluxes versus observed NAO variations. The flux patterns are modulated in time according to observed variations over 1901-2013, idealized sinusoidal variations with periods from 2 to 100 years, or abrupt changes.\nWe first show that NAO-induced AMOC changes have a significant impact on hemispheric-scale temperature variations. For example, aspects of the widespread Northern Hemisphere cooling of the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as rapid warming in the 1980s and 1990s, are reproduced in these NAO-forced simulations. The hemispheric temperature changes occur in response to the observed switch from a strong negative phase of the NAO to a strong positive phase of the NAO, with associated weakening and strengthening of the AMOC. The NAO-induced AMOC changes translate into hemispheric scale temperature variations by modulating poleward oceanic heat transport, which is amplified through climate feedbacks involving shortwave radiation fluxes. For example, a warmed North Atlantic reduces sea ice and snow cover, thereby leading to enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation and further warming.\nIn a more idealized setting we show that the AMOC responds most clearly to NAO forcing with timescales comparable to, or longer than, the inherent AMOC variability of the model. This dependence is important in evaluating the impact of the NAO on decadal-scale temperature variations. Further, model adjustment to the imposed NAO forcing shares many aspects with the internal AMOC variability of the model, including modulation of Labrador Sea convection and the propagation of density anomaly signals.",

Motivated by the fact that temporal earthquake aperiodicity was observed off Kamaishi just after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, we perform numerical simulations of chain reactions due to postseismic slip of large earthquakes on the basis of rate- and state-dependent friction laws. Our results show that, (i) temporal aperiodicity can be well reproduced in the case of the aging-law rather than the slip- and Nagata-laws, (ii) the reason why the greater and smaller earthquakes off Kamaishi temporarily occurred may be explained by the difference between overall and partial rupturing of an asperity, (iii) the observed perturbation of the activated earthquake hypocenters mostly in the ESE-WNW direction may reflect the fact that the large postseismic slip of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake propagated from east-southeast to west-northwest off Kamaishi, (iv) the observed region of repeating earthquake quiescence may reflect strong plate coupling of megathrust earthquakes.",

Sci. Lett. 386, 149–160: termed the LSD model) provides two main advantages over previous scaling models: identification and quantification of potential sources of bias in the earlier models, and the ability to generate nuclide-specific scaling factors easily for a wide range of input parameters. The new model also provides a flexible framework for exploring the implications of advances in model inputs.\nIn this work, the scaling implications of two recent time-dependent spherical harmonic geomagnetic models spanning the Holocene will be explored. Korte and Constable (2011, Phys. Earth Planet. Int. 188, 247–259) and Korte et al. (2011, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 312, 497–505) recently updated earlier spherical harmonic paleomagnetic models used by Lifton et al. (2014) with paleomagnetic measurements from sediment cores in addition to archeomagnetic and volcanic data. These updated models offer improved accuracy over the previous versions, in part to due to increased temporal and spatial data coverage. With the new models as input, trajectory-traced estimates of effective vertical cutoff rigidity (RC- the standard method for ordering cosmic ray data) yield significantly different time-integrated scaling predictions when compared to the earlier models. These results will be compared to scaling predictions using another recent time-dependent spherical harmonic model of the Holocene geomagnetic field by Pavón-Carrasco et al. (2014, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 388, 98–109), based solely on archeomagnetic and volcanic paleomagnetic data, but extending to 14 ka.\nIn addition, the potential effects of time-dependent atmospheric models on LSD scaling predictions will be presented. Given the typical dominance of altitudinal over latitudinal scaling effects on cosmogenic nuclide production, incorporating transient global simulations of atmospheric structure (e.g., Liu et al., 2009, Science 325, 310–314) into scaling frameworks may contribute to improved understanding of long-term production rate variations.",

            "abstract": "Geochronology provides a direct test of many models pertaining to the nature of Cryogenian climate change. Here we present new U-Pb and Re-Os geochronological constraints on Sturtian glacial deposits from Zambia, Arctic Alaska, Mongolia, South China, and throughout Laurentia. We present these new ages in stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical context to integrate data from other key localities, such as Namibia and Australia, and to construct a new age model for the Cryogenian Period. We find that there is no evidence for a global, pre-717 Ma glaciation. Instead, Sturtian glacial deposits appeared on all of these cratons by 717 Ma following widespread basaltic volcanism. We then review the nature and duration of the >50 Myr long Sturtian glacial epoch. In many localities, strata deposited during this interval are characterized by two massive diamictite units separated by diamictite-free, siliciclastic strata. These intervening clast-poor deposits are commonly interpreted to represent an interglacial period, however, alternatively they formed during a long-lived glaciation as newly rifted margins subsided and detached from the ice-grounding line. In the aftermath of the Sturtian glaciation, high sedimentation rates made up for lost time, and filled pent-up accommodation space, creating thick Cryogenian non-glacial interlude deposits on many margins. We discuss implications for geochemical cycles and the interpretation of carbon isotope anomalies.",

            "abstract": "All digital images are corrupted by noise. In most solar imaging, we have the luxury of high photon counts and low background contamination, which when combined with carful calibration, minimize much of the impact noise has on the measurement. Outside high-intensity regions, such as in coronal holes, the noise component can become significant and complicate feature recognition and segmentation. We create a practical estimate of noise in the AIA images across the detector CCD. A Poisson-Gaussian model of noise is well suited in the digital imaging environment due to the statistical distributions of photons and the characteristics of the CCD. Using the dark and flat field calibration images, the level-1 AIA images, and readout noise measurements, we construct a maximum-a-posteriori estimation of the expected error in the AIA images. These estimations of noise not only provide a clearer view of solar features in AIA, but they are also relevant to error characterizations of other solar images.",

Here, we investigate their regional ice mass balance using a time series of satellite and airborne data combined with model output products from the Regional Atmospheric and Climate Model (RACMO). Our dataset includes laser altimetry from NASA’s ICESat-1 satellite mission and from Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne surveys, satellite radar altimetry data from ESA’s Envisat mission, time-variable gravity data from NASA/DLR’s GRACE mission, surface mass balance products from RACMO, ice velocity from a combination of international synthetic aperture radar satellites and ice thickness data from OIB. We find a record of ice mass balance for the ASE where all the analyzed techniques agree remarkably in magnitude and temporal variability. The mass loss of the region has been increasing continuously since 1992, with no indication of a slow down. The mass loss during the common period averaged 91 Gt/yr and accelerated 20 Gt/yr2. In 1992-2013, the ASE contributed 4.5 mm global sea level rise. Overall, our results demonstrate the synergy of multiple analysis techniques for examining Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance at the regional scale.

            "abstract": "Laser altimeters have been primarily utilized with orbiter spacecraft. Recently, the Mercury Laser Altimeter on MESSENGER successfully operated at Mercury during two flybys and thousands of highly-elliptical orbits, and contributed greatly towards improved understanding of the innermost planet. We show that a laser altimeter instrument on a flyby tour mission such as the planned NASA Europa Clipper can constrain key geophysical parameters when supported by variable-frequency altimetric measurements over repeated ~145°-long arcs across the surface. Previous work by Park et al. (2011, GRL) showed through covariance analysis that a similar trajectory could yield the gravity tidal Love number k2 to good accuracy (0.05). Here, we conduct a full simulation of a 45-flyby trajectory in the Jupiter system with Europa as primary target. We consider reasonable tracking coverage and noise level (dominated by plasma noise), as well as gravity (degree 50) and topography (200m resolution supplemented by realistic fractal noise at shorter wavelengths), informed by relevant existing data (Galileo, Cassini). The simulation is initialized at pessimistic values, with C20, C22, k2, and h2 in error of 90%, 90%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. All other gravity coefficients up to degree 3 have zero a priori values. Assumed altimetric data sampling and noise are derived from the tour trajectory and the instrument performance described by Smith et al. (this meeting). This variable-frequency laser altimeter can greatly improve the surface coverage (for shape recovery) and the number of altimetric crossovers, the best measurement type to constrain the tidal surface deformation.\nWe find from our simulation that the addition of altimetry data significantly improves the determination of the gravity tidal Love number k2 and enables the recovery of the body tidal Love number h2. Low-degree gravity and topography are most important to constrain the interior structure of Europa. Scientific objectives of a mission such as Europa Clipper can be made more robust and even furthered with a laser altimeter.",

            "abstract": "Many hillslope processes - physical, chemical, and biological - depend on subsurface temperature and water availability. As the subsurface temperature field varies both in space and through climate cycles, the dominant processes of mobile regolith production and transport and the rate at which they act will vary. These processes include the chemical weathering of minerals, cracking of rocks through frost action and tree roots, presence and impact of vegetation on soil cohesion, location and activity of burrowing and trampling animals, frost creep, and solifluction. In order to explore the interplay between these processes across a landscape and over geologic time, we develop a pseudo-three-dimensional subsurface thermal model within the Landlab landscape evolution modeling framework, driven by an associated spatially explicit radiative surface boundary condition.\nWe begin with the analytical solution for conduction in a medium with uniform thermal properties and progress to a numerical model that acknowledges variable material properties, water content, and phase change. At the surface we incorporate spatial and temporal variations in incoming short-wave radiation due to elevation, latitude, aspect, shading and orbital variations. Outgoing long-wave radiation is taken to depend on the surface temperature and may be modified by allowing back-radiation from the atmosphere.\nWith these tools we target variations in regolith production and motion over the long timescales on which hillslopes evolve. We implement a basic parameterization of temperature-dependent chemical and physical weathering linked to mobile regolith generation. We incorporate multiple regolith transport processes including heave, creep, solifluction, tree throw, and animal burrowing. We incorporate material tracking to trace the chemical evolution of regolith as it moves downslope. Our intention is not to parameterize all operative processes, but to include sufficient detail to identify how the different processes interact. We address questions that include: What governs contrasts in process rate on pole-ward vs. equator-ward slopes? Under what conditions should we expect temporal transitions between transport-limited and weathering-limited erosion? How does the legacy of past climate impact later hillslope activity?",

            "abstract": "One of the risks associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing technologies for energy development is the potential release of hydraulic fracturing-related fluids into surface waters or shallow aquifers. Many of the organic additives used in hydraulic fracturing fluids are individually biodegradable, but little is know on how they will attenuate within a complex organic fluid in the natural environment. We developed a synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid based on disclosed recipes used by Marcellus shale operators to evaluate the biodegradation potential of organic additives across a concentration (25 to 200 mg/L DOC) and salinity gradient (0 to 60 g/L) similar to Marcellus shale injected fluids. In aerobic aqueous solutions, microorganisms removed 91% of bulk DOC from low SFF solutions and 57% DOC in solutions having field-used SFF concentrations within 7 days. Under high SFF concentrations, salinity in excess of 20 g/L inhibited organic compound biodegradation for several weeks, after which time the majority (57% to 75%) of DOC remained in solution. After SFF amendment, the initially biodiverse lake or sludge microbial communities were quickly dominated (>79%) by Pseudomonas spp. Approximately 20% of added carbon was converted to biomass while the remainder was respired to CO2 or other metabolites. Two alcohols, isopropanol and octanol, together accounted for 2-4% of the initial DOC, with both compounds decreasing to below detection limits within 7 days. Alcohol degradation was associated with an increase in acetone at mg/L concentrations. These data help to constrain the biodegradation potential of organic additives in hydraulic fracturing fluids and guide our understanding of the microbial communities that may contribute to attenuation in surface waters.",

There is increasing concern that climate change may be worsening droughts in the West and particularly the Southwest. Thus, it is important to understand the role of natural variability and to place current conditions in a long-term context. We present a tree-ring derived reconstruction of regional-scale precipitation for the Southwestern USA over several millennia. A network of 48 tree-ring chronologies from California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado was used. All of the chronologies are at least 1,000 years long. The network was subjected to data reduction through PCA and a “nested” multiple linear regression reconstruction approach. The regression model was able to capture 72% of the variance in September-August precipitation over the last 1,000 years and 53% of the variance over the first millennium of the Common Era. Variance captured and spatial coverage further declined back in time as the shorter chronologies dropped out of the model, eventually reaching 24% of variance captured at 3250 BC. Results show regional droughts on decadal- to multi-decadal scales have been prominent and persistent phenomena in the region over the last several millennia. Anthropogenic warming is likely to exacerbate the effects of future droughts on human and other biotic populations.",

We explore these variations by determining source parameters for large earthquakes (M > 5.5) along the Oaxaca segment of the Mexico subduction zone, an area encompasses the wide range of activity noted above. We use waveform data for 36 earthquakes that occurred between January 1, 1990 to June 1, 2014, obtained from the IRIS DMC, generate synthetic Green’s functions for the available stations, and deconvolve these from the ­­­observed records to determine a source time function for each event. From these source time functions, we measured rupture durations and scaled these by the cube root to calculate the normalized duration for each event. Within our dataset, four events located updip from the SSE, USL, and NVT areas have longer rupture durations than the other events in this analysis. Two of these four events, along with one other event, are located within the SSE and NVT areas. The results in this study show that large earthquakes just updip from SSE and NVT have slower rupture characteristics than other events along the subduction zone not adjacent to SSE, USL, and NVT zones. Based on our results, we suggest a transitional zone for the seismic behavior rather than a distinct change at a particular depth. This study will help aid in understanding seismogenic behavior that occurs along subduction zones and the rupture characteristics of earthquakes near areas of slow slip processes.",

            "abstract": "The pre-collisional convergence history of India and Eurasia displays highly variable convergence rates, including anomalously high rates of ~120-180 mm/a between ~70 and 50 Ma. As the subduction zone forces play a key role in driving plate tectonic understanding the subduction zone configuration in the Tethyan ocean is essential to understand the observed variation in convergence rates. It has long been established that two subduction systems existed between India and Eurasia since the break up of Gondwana: An intra oceanic subduction system (in the equatorial part of the ocean) and a continental subduction system on the southern Eurasian margin. As relicts of both subduction systems are now incorporated in the Himalayan and Tibetan collision zone, reconstruction of the pre-collisional geometry and the timing of the collision between India and the different subduction system is challenging. However, in recent years it has become increasingly more obvious that India likely originally collided with the intra oceanic subduction system first and only subsequently with the Eurasia margin (e.g., Aitchison et al., 2007 JGR, Bouilhol et al, 2013 EPSL). In this presentation, we summarize the geological evidence that allows us to reconstruct the configuration of the subduction system in the Tehtyan ocean and the timing of the India-Arc and India Eurasia collision. These constraints guide 3D subduction zone models that are used to evaluate the role of two subduction zones for the variable India-Eurasia Convergence rates. Model convergence rates of up to 140 mm/yr are in agreement with observed rates from 120 Ma to present, except for a short-lived spike in rate at ~62-66 Ma, which may be attributed to the Reunion plume. The end of anomalously fast convergence is due to the entry of buoyant Indian continental lithosphere into this intra-oceanic subduction zone at 50 Ma and not to the collision of India with Eurasia, which had little effect before 40 Ma.",

            "abstract": "There has been limited focus on fine-scale land management change effects on forest carbon under future environmental conditions (climate, nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric CO2). Forest management decisions are often made at the landscape to regional levels before analyses have been conducted to determine the potential outcomes and effectiveness of such actions. Scientists need to evaluate plausible land management actions in a timely manner to help shape policy and strategic land management.\nIssues of interest include species-level adaptation to climate, resilience and vulnerability to mortality within forested landscapes and regions. Efforts are underway to improve land system model simulation of future mortality related to climate, and to develop and evaluate plausible land management options that could help mitigate or avoid future die-offs. Vulnerability to drought-related mortality varies among species and with tree size or age. Predictors of species ability to survive in specific environments are still not resolved. A challenge is limited observations for fine-scale (e.g. 4 km2) modeling, particularly physiological parameters. Uncertainties are primarily associated with future land management and policy decisions. They include the interface with economic factors and with other ecosystem services (biodiversity, water availability, wildlife habitat). The outcomes of future management scenarios should be compared with business-as-usual management under the same environmental conditions to determine the effects of management changes on forest carbon and net emissions to the atmosphere. For example, in the western U.S., land system modeling and life cycle assessment of several management options to reduce impacts of fire reduced long-term forest carbon gain and increased carbon emissions compared with business-as-usual management under future environmental conditions. The enhanced net carbon uptake with climate and reduced fire emissions after thinning did not compensate for the increased wood removals over 90 years, leading to reduced net biome production. Analysis of land management change scenarios at fine scales is needed, and should consider other ecological values in addition to carbon.",

            "abstract": "The importance of weather-driven renewable energies for the United States (and global) energy portfolio is growing. The main perceived problems with weather-driven renewable energies are their intermittent nature, low power density, and high costs. The National Energy with Weather System Simulator (NEWS) is a mathematical optimization tool that allows the construction of weather-driven energy sources that will work in harmony with the needs of the system. For example, it will match the electric load, reduce variability, decrease costs, and abate carbon emissions.\nOne important test run included existing US carbon-free power sources, natural gas power when needed, and a High Voltage Direct Current power transmission network. This study shows that the costs and carbon emissions from an optimally designed national system decrease with geographic size. It shows that with achievable estimates of wind and solar generation costs, that the US could decrease its carbon emissions by up to 80% by the early 2030s, without an increase in electric costs. The key requirement would be a 48 state network of HVDC transmission, creating a national market for electricity not possible in the current AC grid. These results were found without the need for storage. Further, we tested the effect of changing natural gas fuel prices on the optimal configuration of the national electric power system.\nAnother test that was carried out was an extension to global regions. The extension study shows that the same properties found in the US study extend to the most populous regions of the planet. The extra test is a simplified version of the US study, and is where much more research can be carried out. We compare our results to other model results.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of deep tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFE) have raised fundamental questions about the physics of quasidynamic rupture and the underlying fault zone processes. The presence of serpentinite at P-T conditions characteristic of deep tremor and LFE suggests that it may be an important element in complex fault slip, however, little is known about its hydrological and mechanical properties. Here, we report on experiments designed to investigate the frictional behavior of serpentinite recovered from outcrops (SO1 and SO2) and the SAFOD borehole (G27). XRD analyses reveal the presence of lizardite, kaolinite, talc and hydrotalcite in the SO1; lizardite, clinochlore and magnetite in SO2; and lizardite, quartz and calcite in G27. We powdered samples from intact blocks to a grain size <150 µm and sheared the resulting gouge in a double-direct shear configuration using a true triaxial deformation apparatus. Effective normal stress (σ’n = σn – Pp) was kept constant at values ranging from 2 to 40 MPa. Shear stress was applied via a constant load point displacement rate, and velocity was increased stepwise from 0.1 to 100 μm/s, after which a series of slide-hold-slides (SHS) were performed. We measured permeability normal to the shear direction and recovered samples for microstructural analysis. Mechanical strength varied from m=0.17 for SO1, m=0.33 for SO2 and m=0.53 for G27. Gouges exhibit an overall velocity strengthening behavior, with values approaching velocity neutral at the highest effective normal stress. SHS tests show positive healing rates for S02 and G27; whereas, SO1 samples exhibit zero or negative healing rates. Permeability decreases with increasing σ’n, with SO1 (k = 10-20m2) showing the lowest values. Microstructural observations revealed a well-developed R-Y-P fabric in SO1, which is not observed in SO2 and G27. We posit that the development of different shear fabrics controlled by mineralogy controls frictional and hydrological properties. In this context, when serpentinite is associated with other weak phyllosilicates minerals, at typical seismogenic depths, it can control the mode of failure along subduction zones and major plate boundary faults.",

            "abstract": "The glaciers of the tropical Andes constitute 99% of the world’s tropical glaciers. They primarily occur in Peru and Bolivia (90%) with smaller glaciers scattered across the peaks in Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Specific glaciers in the range have been studied in great detail, such as Bolivia's Zongo glacier and Peru's Quelccaya Ice Cap, but few studies of glacier recession across the full range have been published. We previously assessed glacier recession between c1987 and c2006 using manual classification techniques on Landsat imagery. We have now updated that study to the present (2013/2014), and and have incorporated automated techniques using support vector machines. The update to present allows us to examine both the variability in recession rates, and the current state of overall recession.\nThe primary issues in completing this analysis are accounting for snow cover (which can otherwise be easily misidentified as glacier), and developing a robust and semi-automated methodology to process the large number of individual images required. To avoid confusion with transient snow, we analysed 2-3 clear images at each epoch, with minimal visually apparent snow or glacier, and only labelled as glacier those pixels that were classified as glacier in the clear portions of each image. To automate the processing, we used support vector machines, trained with the extensive data we have available from our previous manual classification work.\nOur previous work indicated an overall recession of approximately 30% (or 700 km2 of glacier area loss) between c1987 and c2006. We will present updated figures from our new analysis, extending to 2013/2014.",

            "abstract": "A primary objective of land surface models (LSMs) is to accurately represent soil moisture to calculate realistic latent and sensible heat fluxes for use in atmospheric models. Soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) control the movement of soil water and thus evapotranspiration. Parameter values are typically selected using look up tables based on soil texture. This approach limits parameter values to those from small-scale laboratory measurements, and thus precludes the possibility that effective parameter values should be different at the scale of the model.\nWe calibrate four SHP parameters in the Noah LSM using 0-5 cm soil moisture measured at different scales: (1) individual soil moisture probes; (2) the average of ~20 in situ soil moisture probes distributed across a watershed; and (3) passive microwave-based soil moisture estimates from SMOS. All data are from three different USDA watersheds in Oklahoma. The DREAM algorithm is used to define the posterior distribution of each parameter conditioned on the following objective function: RMSE between the uppermost model level soil moisture (0-10 cm) and observed soil moisture. By comparing texture-based parameters with calibrated distributions from different scales and measurement techniques, we address the following: (1) How different are the calibrated parameters compared to those based on soil texture alone? (2) How do the parameters affect simulated soil moisture and fluxes? (3) Are parameter sets physically consistent?\nParameters found via calibration differ from texture-based values and improve the simulation of soil moisture for intervals not included in the calibration. For example, calibration to in situ and SMOS data reduced model error by 65% and 59%, respectively, when simulated values were compared to in situ data. Optimized simulations influence surface fluxes as well, changing average daily latent heat fluxes by up to 67% and 50 W/m2. Most parameters values fall within the range of laboratory measurements.",

GeoMapApp provides casual and specialist users alike with access to hundreds of built-in geoscience data sets covering geology, geophysics, geochemistry, oceanography, climatology, cryospherics, and the environment. Users can also import their own data tables, spreadsheets, shapefiles, grids and images. Simple manipulation and analysis tools combined with layering capabilities and engaging visualisations provide a powerful platform with which to explore and interrogate geoscience data in its proper geospatial context thus helping users to more easily gain insight into the meaning of the data. A global elevation base map covering the oceans as well as continents forms the backbone of GeoMapApp. The multi-resolution base map is updated regularly and includes data sources ranging from Space Shuttle elevation data for land areas to ultra-high-resolution surveys of coral reefs and seafloor hydrothermal vent fields. Examples of built-in data sets that can be layered over the elevation model include interactive earthquake and volcano data, plate tectonic velocities, hurricane tracks, land and ocean temperature, water column properties, age of the ocean floor, and deep submersible bottom photos. A versatile profiling tool provides instant access to data cross-sections. Contouring and 3-D views are also offered - the attached image shows a 3-D view of East Africa's Ngorongoro Crater as an example. Tabular data – both imported and built-in – can be displayed in a variety of ways and a lasso tool enables users to quickly select data points directly from the map. A range of STEM-based education material based upon GeoMapApp is already available, including a number of self-contained modules for school- and college-level students (http://www.geomapapp.org/education/contributed_material.html). More learning modules are planned, such as one on the effects of sea-level rise. GeoMapApp users include students, teachers, researchers, curriculum developers and outreach specialists.",

For example, the first direct evidence of wave-particle coupling as an acceleration mechanism for the solar wind was obtained from UVCS spectro-coronagraphic observations, yet the real limits on the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular ion temperatures (with respect to the magnetic field) in coronal holes and streamers is still unresolved. Another unresolved issue is the role of suprathermal seed particles in rapid diffusive shock acceleration of SEPs. Although the theory has been placed on firmer theoretical ground by recent in situinvestigations, observations of these suprathermal particles in the corona were never conclusively obtained with UVCS.\nAny follow-on UV Spectro-coronagraph must possess two improvements over UVCS in order to address the questions raised during the SOHO mission: 1) increased effective aperture and 2) improved spectrographic contrast (i.e. reduced scattered light). Technological developments in optics, optical design, UV detectors, composite structures, cleanliness control and electronics make it possible to achieve the requisite improvements in a next-generation UV spectro-coronagraph within the constraints of an affordable mission.

            "abstract": "Satellite missions specifically dedicated to soil moisture retrieval have become a reality in the past few years, with the launch of SMOS in 2009 and SMAP in 2014. While much of the work on applications around these missions has focussed on data assimilation systems for numerical weather prediction, there is also potential to use the data to support agricultural applications such as drought and flood assessment and yield forecasting. Previous work has examined the potential for using SMOS soil moisture for detecting spatial and temporal patterns of agroclimate risk, such as drought and excess wetness. This research builds upon that work through the examination of a data set with a longer reference period to determine if the dataset can be used as a baseline for detecting anomalies from normal conditions. Surface satellite soil moisture from a multi-sensor climate reference data set (1993 to 2010) and the SMOS surface soil moisture data (2010 – 2014) set were examined in hindsight to detect relevant trends for monitoring the climate conditions in agricultural regions of Canada. Soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies were examined against precipitation and temperature records over the relevant time periods, and compared against agroclimatic drought risk indicators, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index, the Standardized Precipitation Index and the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Condition anomalies. High impact events, including the 2002 drought in the Canadian Prairies, excess wetness in the southern Manitoba in 2009 and 2011 were evaluated in detail. The potential for using these data sets in near real time to support agricultural decision making will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of lower crustal viscosity are typically constrained by analyses of isostatic rebound, post seismic creep, and laboratory-derived flow laws for crustal rocks and minerals. Here we follow a new approach for calculating the viscosity structure of the lower continental crust. We use Perple_X to calculate mineral assemblages for different crustal compositions. Effective viscosity is then calculated using the rheologic mixing model of Huet et al. (2014) incorporating flow laws for each mineral phase. Calculations are performed along geotherms appropriate for the Basin and Range, Tibetan Plateau, Colorado Plateau, and the San Andreas Fault. To assess the role of crustal composition on viscosity, we examined two compositional gradients extending from an upper crust with ~67 wt% SiO2 to a lower crust that is either: (i) basaltic with ~53 wt% SiO2 (Rudnick and Gao, 2003), or (ii) andesitic with ~64% SiO2 (Hacker et al., 2011). In all cases, the middle continental crust has a viscosity that is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than that inferred for wet quartz, a common proxy for mid-crustal viscosities. An andesitic lower crust results in viscosities of 1020–1021 Pa-s and 1021–1022 Pa-s for hotter and colder crustal geotherms, respectively. A mafic lower crust predicts viscosities that are an order of magnitude higher for the same geotherm. In all cases, the viscosity calculated from the mixing model decreases less with depth compared to single-phase estimates. Lastly, for anhydrous conditions in which alpha quartz is stable, we find that there is a strong correlation between Vp/Vs and bulk viscosity; in contrast, little to no correlation exists for hydrous conditions.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of shallow magma reservoirs is complex as new mass is added intermittently and phase proportions (crystals, melt and bubbles) vary because of cooling or mass removal (eruptions). One requirement for eruptions to occur is that the crystal content during storage is low enough (< 0.4-0.6) such that the magma is mobile. Thermal modeling and geochemical data suggest these chambers are mobile only a very small fraction of their lifetime. Data from uranium-series disequilibria, crystal size distributions, and zoning of trace elements in crystals collected at Mount Hood (Oregon, USA) provide constraints on the thermal evolution of this system over the past 21 kyrs years and suggest <10% of this time the magma was mobile. This system also produced at least 3 significant eruptions over the last 10 kyrs based on the stratigraphic record (~220 and ~1500, and ~7700 years ago).\nHere we investigate the physical conditions of an open-system magma chamber that are in agreement with the thermal history inferred from the crystal record and with the eruption sequence. What are the magma recharge fluxes that are required to keep a system such as Mount Hood active but predominantly crystal-rich over the last 21 kyrs and what combination of processes produces the observed eruption frequency? To answer these questions we use an idealized magma chamber model to solve for the evolution of the thermodynamical state of the chamber (pressure, temperature, gas and crystal content) as new magma is injected into the chamber. Heat is lost to the surrounding colder crust, which responds visco-elastically to the pressure accumulated during recharge and volatile exsolution. If the crystal volume fraction is lower than 0.5 and chamber overpressure reaches 20 MPa we assume an eruption occurs. We analyze what type of injection (constant, periodic, magma lensing), injection rate, and magma chamber volume yields trends consistent with the timescales found at Mount Hood.",

            "abstract": "Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key drivers affecting aggradation and degradation of peatlands. Variations in WTD can alter the balance between gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) and so cause a peatland to change between a sink and a source of carbon. Process based mathematical modelling can provide insights on WTD-net ecosystem productivity (NEP) interactions over peatlands. We deployed a process-based ecosystem model ecosys to examine the WTD effects on variations in NEP of a fen peatland in Alberta, Canada. Our modelled results showed that a growing season (May-August) WTD drawdown of ~0.3m from 2004-2007 caused more rapid decomposition in deeper peat layers so that Re increased by ~180 g C m-2 growing season -1. However, similar increase in GPP (~ 170 g C m-2 growing season -1) under deeper WTD condition due to more rapid microbial and root growth, and hence more rapid mineralization and nutrient uptake, left no net effect of WTD drawdown on NEP. The modelled ecosystem was overall a large sink of C (~ 100 g C m-2 yr-1) over the study period of 2004-2009. However, gradually diminishing GPP by ~ 70 g C m-2 growing season -1 with progressively deeper WTD during 2008-2009 indicated that further drawdown of WTD could alter the source sink status of these peatlands. These modelled results were corroborated against hourly eddy covariance (EC) net CO2 fluxes, latent heat and sensible heat fluxes (R2~0.75, a→0, b→1); and annual estimates of EC-gap filled NEP and partitioned GPP and Re over the site from 2004-2009. Our findings indicated the needs for coupling of soil-plant-atmosphere schemes for gases, water, energy, carbon and nutrients in models to adequately simulate WTD effects on peatland C stocks.",

A detailed depth-profile of the grain size in the mantle is, however, unknown. To explore the possible depth-dependence of grain size, we use models of coupled core-mantle evolution that include the dynamic effect of surface tectonic plates. We developed an algorithm for modelling: 1) the surface yield stress in a dynamically consistent manner, and 2) the diffusion creep, that is based on the following ingredients: vacancy diffusion in perovskite, depth-dependent grain size, temperature and pressure. This algorithm is able to provide a fit to a wide set of geodynamical observations. Time-dependent convection simulations reveal that the thermal evolution of the mantle is very sensitive to depth-variations in the grain size. We also explore the important feedbacks of thermal convection on the evolution of Earth's mantle rheology.",

            "abstract": "Surface soil moisture affects latent and sensible heat fluxes, as well as setting the top boundary condition for water redistribution within the soil column. The fluctuations in surface soil moisture have been described in numerous modeling studies, but characterization based on measurements is lacking. We use a new soil moisture dataset based on reflected GPS signals to provide some constraints on rates of surface soil drying after a rain event.\nThe soil moisture time series used in this study are derived from GPS data collected at NSF’s EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) sites. The University of Colorado Boulder’s PBO H2O project estimates daily near-surface soil moisture (approximately 0-5 cm) from the interference pattern between the direct and ground-reflected GPS signals. The sensing footprint is ~1000 m2, and thus intermediate in scale between in situ and remotely sensed observations. Twelve sites from this network of more than 100 were used in this study.\nTo characterize the rate of soil drying, we fit exponential curves to daily soil moisture observations following ten isolated rainfall events at each site. Event sizes varied from 5 to 40 mm and were followed by 17 days without rain. The decay model fits the data quite well, with r2 values exceeding 0.85 in nearly all cases. For 95% of the events studied, the exponential decay constant (e-folding time) fell between 2 and 6 days. Precipitation amount is not correlated with drydown rates. Instead, the rate of soil drying is well-correlated with air temperature: the exponential constant decreases by 0.1 days per degree Celsius. We are currently investigating how other factors, such as soil type and vegetation, influence soil drying. This study highlights the utility of the PBO H2O soil moisture product. Surface soil moisture changes rapidly, and thus the dynamics of surface soil moisture cannot be accurately characterized using datasets based on less than daily measurements.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude and the rupture area of the Mw=8.2 April 1st, 2014 Pisagua earthquake suggests that northern Chile is still a mature seismic gap reaching the end of its megathrust cycle. The Pisagua earthquake exhibited foreshock activity with four Mw~6.4 earthquakes and an associated increase of seismicity offshore of Pisagua, that started on March 16th (Mw=6.7). The Pisagua area exhibits some tectonic singularities: (1) the crustal forearc deformation is seismically active; (2) it coincides with the influence zone related to the buoyant Iquique Ridge; and (3) it is also located at the maximum curvature of the Bolivian Orocline. Previous studies established the presence of abundant microseismicity in the upper part of the interplate contact, along some geometrical arrangements suggesting forearc fault-related seismicity. We analyzed the 2014 foreshock sequence using a 3D body wave velocity model obtained from the dense short period FONDECYT 1130071 and the broadband permanent IPOC networks. Although there is limited azimuthal coverage for the foreshock activity, it seems clear that most of them are located along the interplate contact. However, there were foreshocks also located along structures parallel to those that were previously identified eastward, almost perpendicular to the slab. Additionally, we invert regional moment tensors from full broadband waveforms to compute the best centroid depth of the foreshocks (Mw>4.5) recorded by the IPOC network. The centroid depth and focal mechanism agrees rather well with the spatial distribution of the located seismicity. Besides thrust faulting events occurred along the plate interface, shallow crustal events were also triggered within the overriding South America plate. After the 2010 Mw=8.8 Maule and 2011 Mw=9.3 Tohoku megathrust earthquakes, the activation of coastal forearc faults associated with intraplate shallow earthquakes (Mw~7) occurred, evidencing a relationship between the large earthquakes and the forearc faulting process. Considering that the 2014 Mw=8.2 earthquake did not fill the northern Chile seismic gap, and that there were foreshocks located in the offshore upper crust, we believe that there is an urgent need to understand not only the issues related to forearc-subduction deformation processes, but also to seismic hazard evaluations.",

As a consequence, rice grown on the flooded soils may take up arsenic and expose people eating the rice to this carcinogenic substance. Microbial activity will enhance or decrease the mobilization of arsenic depending on their metabolic pathways. Among the microbes naturally residing in the soil are denitrifying bacteria, sulfate reducers, metal reducers (Fe, Mn), arsenic reducers, methanogens, and fermenters, whose activity varies based on the presence of oxygen. The purpose of the experiment was to assess how different amendments affect the microbial activity and the arsenic mobilization during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism after flooding of naturally contaminated Cambodian soil.\nIn a batch experiment, we investigated how the relative metabolic rate of naturally occurring microbes could vary with different types of organic carbon. The experiment was designed to measure the effects of various sources of carbon (dried rice straw, charred rice straw, manure, and glucose) on the microbial activity and arsenic release in an arsenic-contaminated paddy soil from Cambodia under flooded conditions. All amendments were added based on the carbon content in order to add 0.036 g of carbon per vial. The soil was flooded with a 10mM TRIS buffer solution at pH 7.04 in airtight 25mL serum vials and kept at 25 °C. We prepared 14 replicates per treatment to sample both gas and solution. On each sampling point, the solution replicates were sampled destructively. The gas replicates continued on and were sampled for both gas and solution on the final day of the experiment. We measured pH, total arsenic, methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide at 8 hours, 1.5 days, 3.33 days, and 6.33 days from the start of the experiment.",

            "abstract": "At the transition between spring and summer, melt ponds form and evolve at the surface of Arctic sea ice, significantly modifying energy exchanges between the ice, atmosphere and ocean. Past observations have demonstrated that the fractional coverage of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice can vary widely over the course of a melt season, between years in the same location, and between regions. Here we present two years of melt pond observations from landfast, first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic, and analyze which physical mechanisms were responsible for considerable interannual variations in melt pond coverage. In general, the key factors affecting pond coverage were: (1) premelt surface topography, (2) the number of drainage features in the ice and locations of drainage channels, (3) the evolution of ice temperature, and (4) the surface energy balance. Terrestrial LiDAR measurements showed that the premelt topography was rougher in 2011 than in 2012, which led to interannual variations in maximum pond coverage and hydraulic head of 20 pp and 7 cm, respectively. A change in the meltwater balance (production minus drainage) caused the ponds to spread or recede over an area that was almost 90% larger in 2012 than in 2011. The LiDAR measurements also demonstrated that premelt topography was modified due to preferential melting under meltwater drainage channels. Some melt ponds in areas of low-lying premelt topography were unexpectedly drained as the ponds became elevated above deepening channels. Although the sea ice cover was 0.35 m thinner in 2012 than in 2011, ice interior temperatures remained colder later into June, delaying a transition in ice permeability that would allow vertical meltwater drainage from ponds. This permeability transition was observed in 2011 and contributed to a significant drop in pond coverage.\nFor more information see:\nLandy, J., J. Ehn, M. Shields, and D.

Furthermore, this time period provides an important baseline of natural climate variability prior to the industrial revolution.\nThis study aims to reconstruct Mid- to Late Holocene relative sea-level change in French Polynesia by examining coral reef records from ten islands, which represent ideal settings for accurate sea-level change studies because: 1) they can be regarded as tectonically stable during the relevant period (slow subsidence), 2) they are located far from former ice sheets (‘far-field’), 3) they are characterized by a low tidal amplitude, and 4) they cover a wide range of latitudes which produces significantly improved constraints on GIA (Glacial Isostatic Adjustment) model parameters.\nThe accurate reconstruction of sea-level change relies on absolute U/Th dating of in situ coral colonies and their accurate positioning via GPS RTK (Real Time Kinematic) measurements with a vertical and horizontal precision of ± 2.5 cm and ~1 cm, respectively. We focus mainly on the analysis of coral microatolls, which are sensitive low-tide recorders, as their vertical accretion is limited by the water level. Their growth patterns allow the reconstruction of low-amplitude and high-frequency sea-level changes on centennial to sub-decadal time scales.\nA sea-level rise of less than ~1 m is documented between 6 and 3–3.5 ka, and is followed by a gradual fall in sea level that started around 2 ka and persisted until the past few centuries. The reconstructed sea-level curve therefore extends the Tahiti sea-level curve [Deschamps et al., 2012, Nature, 483, 559-564], and is in good agreement with a geophysical model tuned to fit far-field deglacial records [Bassett et al., 2005, Science, 309, 925-928].",

            "abstract": "The high concentration of both large-scale agriculture and wind power production in the United States Midwest region raises new questions concerning the interaction of the two activities. For instance, it is known from internal boundary layer theory that changes in the roughness of the land-surface resulting from crop choices could modify the momentum field aloft. Upward propagation of such an effect might impact the properties of the winds encountered by modern turbines, which typically span a layer from about 40 to 120 meters above the surface. As direct observation of such interaction would require impractical interference in the planting schedules of farmers, we use numerical modeling to quantify the magnitude of crop-roughness effects.\nTo simulate a collocated farm and turbine array, we use version 3.4.1 of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The hypothetical farm is inserted near the real location of the 2013 Crop Wind Energy Experiment (CWEX). Reanalyses provide representative initial and boundary conditions. A month-long period spanning August 2013 is used to evaluate the differences in flows above corn (maize) and soybean crops at the mature, reproductive stage. Simulations are performed comparing the flow above each surface regime, both in the absence and presence of a wind farm, which consists of a parameterized 11x11 array of 1.8 MW Vestas V90 turbines.\nAppreciable differences in rotor-layer wind speeds emerge. The use of soybeans results in an increase in wind speeds and a corresponding reduction in rotor-layer shear when compared to corn. Despite the turbulent nature of flow within a wind farm, high stability reduces the impact of crop roughness on the flow aloft, particularly in the upper portion of the rotor disk. We use these results to estimate the economic impact of crop selection on wind power producers.",

            "abstract": "It is critical to reduce energy use and air pollutions in metropolitan areas because these areas usually serve as economic engines and have large, dense populations. Fossil fuel use and air-polluting emissions were analyzed in Beijing between 1997 and 2010 from both a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. From a bottom-up perspective, the key energy-intensive industrial sectors directly caused changes in Beijing’s air pollution by means of a series of energy and economic policies. From a top-down perspective, variation in industrial production caused increases in most emissions between 2000 and 2010, however, there were decreases in PM10 and PM2.5 emissions during 2005-2010. Population growth was found to be the largest driver of energy consumption and emissions between1997 and 2010. Energy use and air pollutant emissions were also found to outsource from Beijing to other regions in China. Policies for reducing urban energy consumption and emissions should consider not only the key industrial sectors but also socioeconomic drivers.",

            "abstract": "Even though ninety-five volume percent of all rocks are polymineralic, numerical experiments mainly use monomineralic materials to approximate rock behavior, presuming that the rheology is mainly controlled by the weakest or the most abundant mineral phase. This assumption can be debated in regards to natural observations, experimental and theoretical studies, which show that the bulk strength of rock depends on the proportion, shape, distribution, and strength ratio of the different minerals allowing for a mixt brittle-ductile rheological response.\nHere, we investigate how a polymineralic rheology affects the localization of deformation. We perform numerical metric scale shearing experiments varying the ratio of two mineral phases (feldspar and quartz), the temperature, and the strain rate. We identify four domains of deformation (brittle, semi-brittle, semi-ductile, and ductile) and three deformation types characterizing the degree of localization (localized (type I), anastomosing (type II) and delocalized (type III)). Type I deformation is expected when both phases behave in a brittle manner. In the semi brittle domain, both, brittle and ductile rheologies are mechanically active and all deformation types can be observed depending on the amount of the weak phase. In the ductile domain, deformation is independent of the phase ratio and type III is always observed. In the semi-ductile domain, both mineral phases should behave in a ductile manner. However, for a moderate amount of quartz, plagioclase exhibits brittle behavior and type II deformation is observed. It appears, therefore, that the insertion of a small amount of weak phase revert the mechanical behavior of the strong phase and lead to the formation of anastomosing shear zone (Type II) where fully ductile (Type III) behavior is expected. This highlights the importance of a bi-mineralic material on the deformation localization and furthermore on large scale deformation processes.",

The analysis is for the period 1982-2010. The satellite based Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data is used as proxy for observed rainfall and to validate the models. We examine rainfall patterns during the four main seasons in DJF, MAM, JAS, and OND. All models have spatially averaged values of standard deviation lower than that observed. Models are able to reproduce to some extent the main features of the precipitation variability maximum, but with deficiencies in the amplitudes and locations. The areas of highest variability are generally depicted, but there are significant differences among the models. Teleconnections in the models are investigated by first conducting an EOF in the precipitation anomaly fields and then perform a regression of the first or second EOF time series onto the global SST. For the OND and DJF seasons, the majority of the models show an ENSO teleconnection and consistent with the observations. The models’ raw simulations are examined and corrected using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). A new ensemble based on models corrected forecasts is then formed and the results are presented. Retrospective forecasts over a 10-year period are performed and the forecasts verifications presented.",

            "abstract": "Given the expected increase in pressure on land resources over the next century, there is a need to understand the total impacts of activities associated with land use and land cover change (LULCC). Here we quantify these impacts using the radiative forcing metric, including forcings from changes in long-lived greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone, aerosol effects, and land surface albedo. We estimate radiative forcings from the different agents for historical LULCC and for six future projections using simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model and Community Atmosphere Models and additional offline analyses. When all forcing agents are considered together we show that 45% (+30%, -20%) of the present-day (2010) anthropogenic radiative forcing can be attributed to LULCC. Changes in the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and aerosols from LULCC enhance the total LULCC radiative forcing by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to the forcing from CO2 alone. In contrast, the non-CO2 forcings from fossil fuel burning are roughly neutral, due largely to the negative (cooling) impact of aerosols from these sources.\nWe partition the global LULCC radiative forcing into three major sources: direct modification of land cover (e.g. deforestation), agricultural activities, and fire regime changes. Contributions from deforestation and agriculture are roughly equal in the present day, while changes to wildfire activity impose a small negative forcing globally. In 2100, deforestation activities comprise the majority of the LULCC radiative forcing for all projections except one (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5). This suggests that realistic scenarios of future forest area change are essential for projecting the contribution of LULCC to climate change. However, the commonly used RCP land cover change projections all include decreases in global deforestation rates over the next 85 years. To place an upper bound on the potential radiative forcing from LULCC we create a ‘worst-case scenario” in which all arable land is converted to agriculture by the year 2100. This scenario leads to a total radiative forcing of 4.3 Wm-2 (+/- 1 Wm-2) suggesting that well thought-out land policy is needed to minimize future increases in global anthropogenic radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the ambient noise transmission between 4 seismometer stations distributed on iceberg C16, Ross Sea, Antarctica. These stations were deployed for a 60-day period in 2003/4. The noise source was associated with constant collisions between C16 and a neighboring iceberg, B15A, which was continually being driven into the northeast edge of C16 by ocean tides. The most significant modes of ambient noise transmission were found to be (1) hydroacoustic modes that bounce off the seabed below the iceberg, and (2) flexural-gravity waves that involve the flexural rigidity of the ice layer. The technique used in the study (and in similar studies of the Amery Ice Shelf reported by Zhan and others) provides a new method for studying floating ice with high sensitivity to factors that control hydroacoustic propagation over long distances. It is possible that secular changes in the sub ice ocean layer (such as changes caused by decreasing ice thickness over time) can be observed using ambient noise correlation similar to that performed here. This suggests a way in which seismic observations can constrain variables that characterize how floating ice, and in particular floating ice shelves, buttress glaciers and ice streams that discharge into the ocean.",

            "abstract": "The coastal temperate bog forests of British Columbia, Canada, export high amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) relative to the global average. Little is known about the factors influencing the quantity and quality of DOM exported from these forests or the role of this terrestrially-derived DOM in near-shore marine ecosystems. The objectives of this study are to better understand patterns and controls of DOM being exported from bog forest watersheds and its potential role in near-shore marine ecosystems. In 2013, the Kwakshua Watershed Ecosystems Study at Hakai Beach Institute (Calvert Island, BC) began year-round routine collection and analysis of DOM, nutrients, and environmental variables (e.g. conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen) of freshwater grab samples from the outlets of seven watersheds draining directly to the ocean, as well as near-shore marine samples adjacent to freshwater outflows. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied across watersheds (mean= 11.45 mg L-1, sd± 4.22) and fluctuated synchronously with seasons and storm events. In general, higher DOC was associated with lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA254; mean= 4.59 L mg-1 m-1, sd± 0.55). The relationship between DOC and SUVA254 differed between watersheds, suggesting exports in DOM are regulated by individual watershed attributes (e.g. landscape classification, flow paths) as well as precipitation. We are using LiDAR and other remote sensing data to examine watershed controls on DOC export. At near-shore marine sites, coupled CTD (Conductivity Temperature Depth) and optical measures (e.g. spectral slopes, slope ratios (SR), EEMs), showed a clear freshwater DOM signature within the system following rainfall events. Ongoing work will explore the relationship between bog forest watershed attributes and DOM flux and composition, with implications for further studies on biogeochemical cycling, carbon budgets, marine food webs, and climate change.",

The degree was designed to prepare students for careers as hydrologists while also including coursework equivalent to a minor in ecology (UNR does not officially offer a minor in ecology). The development of the major was intended to provide students with useful skills and training for the job market, and also to increase enrollment in the University’s water-related undergraduate majors. The Department also established an Ecohydrology minor. Since the degree was established, average enrollment in the major has been almost two times higher than the previous Watershed Science option in Environmental Science (the closest comparable degree offering at UNR). The Department has graduated 19 students as of May 2014, and an additional 8 students have graduated with the Ecohydrology minor. Several Ecohydrology graduates have gone on to graduate degrees, and most of the remainder are employed in water-related areas. The students have established an Ecohydrology Club at UNR and are active in organizing water-related activities to do together. This presentation will describe the development of the degree, its implementation, and challenges and opportunities for carrying out an undergraduate degree in Ecohydrology.

The main perceived problems with weather-driven renewable energies are their intermittent nature, low power density, and high costs. In 2009, we began a large-scale investigation into the characteristics of weather-driven renewables. The project utilized the best available weather data assimilation model to compute high spatial and temporal resolution power datasets for the renewable resources of wind and solar PV. The weather model used is the Rapid Update Cycle for the years of 2006-2008. The team also collated a detailed electrical load dataset for the contiguous USA from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the same three-year period. The coincident time series of electrical load and weather data allows the possibility of temporally correlated computations for optimal design over large geographic areas.\nThe past two years have seen the development of a cost optimization mathematic model that designs electric power systems. The model plans the system and dispatches it on an hourly timescale. The system is designed to be reliable, reduce carbon, reduce variability of renewable resources and move the electricity about the whole domain. The system built would create the infrastructure needed to reduce carbon emissions to 0 by 2050. The advantages of the system is reduced water demain, dual incomes for farmers, jobs for construction of the infrastructure, and price stability for energy.\nOne important simplified test that was run included existing US carbon free power sources, natural gas power when needed, and a High Voltage Direct Current power transmission network. This study shows that the costs and carbon emissions from an optimally designed national system decrease with geographic size. It shows that with achievable estimates of wind and solar generation costs, that the US could decrease its carbon emissions by up to 80% by the early 2030s, without an increase in electric costs. The key requirement would be a 48 state network of HVDC transmission, creating a national market for electricity not possible in the current AC grid. The study also showed how the price of natural gas fuel influenced the optimal system designed.",

            "abstract": "Drought, a natural phenomenon that has affected western North America for millennia, is characterized by significant changes in precipitation with rapid shifts between wet and dry states. General Circulation Model projections indicate increased aridity in the 21st century for the Western U.S., and as such the impact of drought will likely become more significant on the environment and the economy. In the pursuit of improving drought predictability, as well as increasing our ability to better characterize the onset of drought, we ask whether defined climate regime shift signals can be identified and if there are variations in this signal for different drought periods, and if so, whether these shifts may be periodic. Annual growth rings of precipitation sensitive trees in the upper and lower Colorado River Basin regions are analyzed using 1) edge detection filters to determine the timing and significance of climate regime induced precipitation shifts, 2) digital filters to identify long and short-term precipitation variability within the site mean chronologies, and 3) wavelet analysis to determine the presence of significant periodicities in the chronologies. Results show that the edge detection algorithms are successful in identifying significant shifts in climatic regimes, and wavelet analysis indicates that some of these shifts may be periodic, suggesting larger scale atmospheric circulation forcing on timescales of decades to centuries. These results are used to identify specific patterns and timing of drought over the upper and lower Colorado River Basins in relation to oceanic oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and El Nino Southern Oscillation. Establishing a relationship between the timing and pattern of the drought and the timing of the oceanic oscillations can lead to improved drought predictability in this region and increase our ability to respond to the environmental and economic impacts of drought.",

Individuals from each genotype, grown either with high or low nitrogen, were exposed to experimental drought of the same duration. One hypothesis was that the genotypes would differ significantly in their responses to periodic drought. The other hypothesis was that the nitrogen treatment versus no nitrogen treatment would play a significant role in the stress responses during drought. It would be expected that the nitrogen treated would have greater dry leaf mass. A LI-6400 XT portable photosynthesis system was used to obtain A/Ci curves (net CO2 assimilation rate versus substomatal CO2) for each treatment group. Predawn and midday water potentials were obtained throughout the hydrated and drought periods using a Model 670 pressure chamber. The dry leaf mass was significantly greater among the high nitrogen group versus the low nitrogen group for each genotype. Nitrogen and genotype were both determinants in variation of water potentials and net CO2 assimilation. Bro and cab genotypes with high nitrogen showed the highest net CO2 assimilation rates during hydration, but the assimilation rates dropped to the lowest during droughts. The water potentials for bro and cab were lower than values for tur and oil. Nitrogen treated genotypes had lower water potentials, but higher net CO2 assimilation rates. Bayesian ecophysiological modeling with the TREES model showed significant differences in trait expression, quantified in terms of differences in model parameter posteriors, among the four genotypes.",

            "abstract": "Wheat is the most important cereal crop traded on international markets and winter wheat constitutes approximately 80% of global wheat production. Thus, accurate and timely forecasts of its production are critical for informing agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) used an empirical generalized model for forecasting winter wheat production. Their approach combined BRDF-corrected daily surface reflectance from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) with detailed official crop statistics and crop type masks. It is based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the peak of the growing season, percent wheat within the CMG pixel, and the final yields. This method predicts the yield approximately one month to six weeks prior to harvest.\nIn this study, we include the Growing Degree Day (GDD) information extracted from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in order to improve the winter wheat production forecast by increasing the timeliness of the forecasts while conserving the accuracy of the original model. We apply this modified model to three major wheat-producing countries: United States of America, Ukraine and China from 2001 to 2012. We show that a reliable forecast can be made between one month to a month and a half prior to the peak NDVI (meaning two months to two and a half months prior to harvest) while conserving an accuracy of 10% in the production forecast.",

            "abstract": "At the macroscopic scale, where the e-folding distance of low-frequency electromagnetic fields in conductive geomaterials is much larger than the size of organized heterogeneities such as fracture sets or laminations that constitute the geologic texture therein, electrical properties can be conveniently approximated by a generalized 3x3 tensor σ. Less convenient, however, are the algorithmic consequences of this approximation in electromagnetic modeling of 3D induction methods for geophysical exploration. Previous efforts at modelling generalized anisotropy with finite differences on a staggered Cartesian grid (e.g. Weiss and Newman, 2002; Wang and Fang, 2001) are posed in terms of the electric field with its governing \"curl-curl\" equation and well-documented null-space issues at low induction numbers. In contrast, Weiss (2013) proposed an alternate full-physics formulation in terms of Lorenz-gauged magentic vector A and electric scalar Φ potentials (Project APhiD) that eliminates the troublesome curl-curl operator, with ultrabroadband examples drawn from geologies with scalar, isotropic conductivity over the frequency range 10-2-1010 Hz. Here, the anisotropic theory presented in Weiss (2013) is implemented with finite differences on a Cartesian grid.\nBriefly stated, in this theoretical approach the conductivity tensor σ is split in terms of a rotationally-invariant isotropic conductivity σ* = ⅓ Tr(σ) and the residual σ - σ*I. This splitting decomposes the resulting finite difference coefficient matrix K into the sum Kiso + Kaniso, where the Kiso term is the coefficient matrix for the isotropic medium σ*, thus enabling reuse of the various routines previously developed for computing matrix coefficients in the isotropic case. Treatment of anisotropy is algorithmically therefore restricted to computing the coefficients in the sparse matrix Kaniso consisting of simple inner products of (σ - σ*I) · (A-∇Φ) and their divergence. In keeping with the philosophy of economizing the compute resource footprint, the anisotropic finite difference algorithm is solved in a matrix-free formulation whereby coefficient matrices are computed as needed at each step of the iterative BiCG-STAB solver used to solve the finite difference system of equations.",

            "abstract": "An artificial beam of relativistic (0.5--10 MeV) electrons has been proposed as an active experiment in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, with applications to magnetic field-line tracing, studies of wave-particle interactions, and beam-atmosphere interactions. The beam-atmosphere interaction, while a scientific endeavor of its own, also provides key diagnostics for other experiments. We present results of Monte Carlo simulations of the interaction of a beam of relativistic electrons with the upper atmosphere as they are injected downwards from a notional high altitude (thermospheric / ionospheric) injection platform. The beam parameters, defined by realistic parameters of a compact linear accelerator, are used to create a distribution of thousands of electrons. Each electron is injected downwards from 300 km altitude towards the dense atmosphere, where it undergoes elastic and inelastic collisions, leading to secondary ionization, optical emissions, and X-rays via bremsstrahlung. Here we describe the Monte Carlo model and present calculations of diagnostic outputs, including optical emissions, X-ray fluxes, secondary ionization, and backscattered energetic electron fluxes. Optical emissions are propagated to the ground through the lower atmosphere, including the effects of atmospheric absorption and scattering, to estimate the brightness of the emission column for a given beam current and energy. Similarly, X-ray fluxes are propagated to hypothetical detectors on balloons and satellites, taking into account Compton scattering and photoabsorption. Secondary ionization is used to estimate the radar signal returns from various ground-based radar facilities. Finally, simulated backscattered electron fluxes are measured at the injection location. The simulation results show that for realizable accelerator parameters, each of these diagnostics should be readily detectable by appropriate instruments. ",

            "abstract": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), prompted by the United Nations General Assembly, has published a series of papers in their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on processes, impacts, and mitigations of climate change in 2013. The science used in these reports was generated by an international group of domain experts. They studied various scenarios of climate change through the use of highly complex computer models to simulate the Earth’s climate over long periods of time. The resulting total data of approximately five petabytes are stored in a distributed data grid known as the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). Through the ESGF, consumers of the data can find and download data with limited capabilities for server-side processing.\nThe Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) is already in the planning stages and is estimated to create as much as two orders of magnitude more data than the AR5 distributed archive. It is clear that data analysis capabilities currently in use will be inadequate to allow for the necessary science to be done with AR6 data—the data will just be too big. A major paradigm shift from downloading data to local systems to perform data analytics must evolve to moving the analysis routines to the data and performing these computations on distributed platforms. In preparation for this need, the ESGF has started a Compute Working Team (CWT) to create solutions that allow users to perform distributed, high-performance data analytics on the AR6 data. The team will be designing and developing a general Application Programming Interface (API) to enable highly parallel, server-side processing throughout the ESGF data grid. This API will be integrated with multiple analysis and visualization tools, such as the Ultrascale Visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT), netCDF Operator (NCO), and others.\nThis presentation will provide an update on the ESGF CWT’s overall approach toward enabling the necessary storage proximal computational capabilities to study climate change using the AR6 extreme scale distributed data archive. An update on the API will be provided along with a survey of the overall computational approaches being reviewed and studied by the members of the ESGF CWT.",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather events have been linked to unusually amplified atmospheric waves (Screen and Simmons, Nature Clim. Change, 2014). Changes in Rossby wave properties may be linked to changes in climate; hence, an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events may be an indication of a large-scale change in wave properties and thereby large scale climatic changes. Arctic amplification and the related ice-albedo feedback mechanism make this issue more pressing in the polar north, where the rate and magnitude of climate change has been most pronounced (Serreze et al, The Cryosphere, 2009). While there is debate over whether a tipping point will be reached (Tietsche et al, GRL, 2011), dramatic change would be difficult to slow or stop should that occur. In this study, wavelet analysis is applied to time series of zonal phase speeds of Rossby waves at high latitudes. A strong annual signal is found; this signal has tended to increase in power since approximately 1940. It is demonstrated that signals at larger time scales at these latitudes are more isolated, although there may be a westerly propagation pattern. Significant correlations between wavelet power and albedo, snow cover, atmospheric ozone levels, and surface temperature are found at shorter scales. At longer scales there is more ambiguity, but significant correlations with those factors and carbon dioxide levels seem likely. The analysis suggests that patterns of Rossby wave speeds have undergone considerable intensification since 1940. This intensification may have a link to the ice-albedo feedback mechanism, potentially hastening a tipping point in the retreat of the cryosphere.",

            "abstract": "Nonlinear elasticity is studied at the laboratory scale with the goal of understanding observations at earth scales, for instance during strong ground motion, tidal forcing and earthquake slip processes. Here we report frequency and pressure dependences on elasticity when applying dynamic acousto-elasticity (DAE) of rock samples, analogous to quasi-static acousto-elasticity. DAE allows one to obtain the elastic behavior over the entire dynamic cycle, detailing the full nonlinear behavior under tension and compression, including hysteresis and memory effects. We perform DAE on a sample of Berea sandstone subject to 0.5MPa uniaxial load, with sinusoidal oscillating strain amplitudes ranging from 10-6 to 10-5 and at frequencies from 0.1 to 260Hz. In addition, the confining pressure is increased stepwise from 0 to 30MPa. We compare results to previous measurements made at lower (mHz) and higher (kHz) frequencies. Nonlinear elastic parameters corresponding to conditioning effects, third order elastic constants and fourth order elastic constants are quantitatively compared over the pressure and frequency ranges. We observe that the decrease in modulus due to conditioning increases with frequency, suggesting a frequency and/or strain-rate dependence that should be included in nonlinear elastic models of rocks. In agreement with previous measurements, nonlinear elastic effects also decrease with confining pressure, suggesting that nonlinear elastic sources such as micro-cracks, soft bonds and dislocations are turned off as the pressure increases.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we use a hierarchical modeling approach to investigate the influence of tropical air-sea feedbacks on climate impacts of aerosols in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We construct four different models by coupling the atmospheric component of CESM, the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM), to four different ocean models: (i) the Data Ocean Model (DOM; prescribed SST), (i) Slab Ocean Model (SOM; thermodynamic coupling), (iii) Reduced Gravity Ocean Model (RGOM; dynamic coupling), and (iv) the Parallel Ocean Program (POP; full ocean model). These four models represent progressively increasing degree of coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. The RGOM model, in particular, is tuned to produce a good simulation of ENSO and the associated tropical air-sea interaction, without being impacted by the climate drifts exhibited by fully-coupled GCMs. For each method of coupling, a pair of numerical experiments, including present day (year 2000) and preindustrial (year 1850) sulfate aerosol loading, were carried out. Our results indicate that the inclusion of air-sea interaction has large impacts on the spatial structure of the climate response induced by aerosols. In response to sulfate aerosol forcing, ITCZ shifts southwards as a result of the anomalous clockwise MMC change which transports moisture southwardly across the Equator. We present analyses of the regional response to sulfate aerosol forcing in the equatorial Pacific as well as the zonally-averaged response. The decomposition of the change in the net surface energy flux shows the most dominant terms are net shortwave radiative flux at the surface and latent heat flux. Further analyses show all ocean model simulations simulate a positive change of northward atmospheric energy transport across the Equator in response to the perturbed radiative sulfate forcing. This positive northward atmospheric energy transport change plays a role in compensating partially cooling caused by sulfate aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Many attempts to assimilate precipitation observations in numerical models have been made, but they have resulted in little or no forecast improvement at the end of the precipitation assimilation. This is due to the nonlinearity of the model precipitation parameterization, the non-Gaussianity of precipitation variables, and the large and unknown model and observation errors.\nWe addressed these problems by using an EnKF (LETKF) that does not require linearization of Precipitation, and by Gaussian transformations of observed and model precipitation. In addition, several QC criteria were designed to reject precipitation observations that are not useful for the assimilation. OSSE experiments with the SPEEDY model, and a low-resolution version of the NCEP GFS was used to assimilate real TRMM/TMPA observations. Both the OSSEs and the real observation experiments gave encouraging results, indicating that both analyses and 5-day forecasts are improved by the assimilation of precipitation (Lien et al., 2013, Lien, 2014). For real observations, we found that it was necessary to apply quality control criteria to reject observations that are not useful for the assimilation. We found that the use of the ensemble forecast sensitivity to observations (EFSO) to analyze the effectiveness of precipitation assimilation gave results superior to the other QC methods. We plan to apply similar techniques to GPM precipitation observations in collaboration with Prof. Miyoshi of RIKEN, Japan.",

            "abstract": "Rivers cut vertically and laterally into bedrock. However, control on the width of bedrock rivers is an unsolved problem. In alpine settings, frost cracking is one of the mechanisms that break down bedrock. Segregation ice drives growth of ice lenses within rock masses. When the temperature of the rock is within the “frost cracking window” of -3 to -8 °C, ice lenses can attract liquid water. Expanding ice lenses can exert sufficient pressure to fracture the rock. We hypothesize that alpine rivers may promote segregation ice growth at the river margin by supplying water, but also may inhibit frost cracking by supplying heat. We find support for this hypothesis in data collected along the Tuolumne and Mokelumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, California. A 1D heat flow model predicts that frost cracking should occur above 2325 masl in this area. To test for a river effect, we measured fracture density along the Tuolumne River at ~2600 masl, finding that density at the river margin is significantly greater than on adjacent hillslopes in the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. We then deployed data loggers on the Mokelumne River (at 2486 masl) over the winter of 2013/2014 to record water, surface and subsurface rock temperatures at varying depths and distances from the river. Temperatures within the frost cracking window were only recorded at a distance of ~5 m from the river, suggesting an insulating effect from the river and snow cover. Rock temperatures 1 m deep equilibrated at ~ 2 °C, significantly colder than predicted by the 1D model. Ongoing work includes terrestrial LIDAR scans to detect erosion of the river bank at the Mokelumne site, and development of a 2D heat flow model to predict subsurface rock temperatures for varying surface boundary conditions and channel morphology. We expect that further analysis will reveal systematic relationships between the surface boundary conditions and rock temperature at depth, enabling predictive modeling of frost cracking intensity at the river margin.",

Samples of seawater were collected on the first GISR (Gulf Integrated Spill Research) cruise (G01) during the first week of July 2012. This cruise covered an area of ~1360 km2 roughly centered on the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Alkalinity profiles for the southeastern most stations indicate lower (~100 μmol/kg) alkalinities at depth when compared to other stations sampled. This results in calculated pHs that are ~0.5 units lower at depth than they are at the other stations. Another group of stations show increased DIC concentrations on the order of 100-150 μmol/kg higher than average at depths at 800 m and 1200 m leading to calculated pHs about 0.2 to 0.4 below average for those depths in all of the stations sampled. These features may or may not be persistent in this region, and the elevated DIC concentrations may be related to organic matter (petroleum or other) oxidation.

            "abstract": "The Energetic Heavy Ion Sensor (EHIS) instruments for GOES-R will provide high resolution measurement of energetic ions (Solar energetic particles and cosmic rays) from hydrogen (H) through nickel (Ni) for space weather monitoring and scientific research. Measurements are taken in five approximately logarithmically spaced energy intervals from 10-200 MeV/u for hydrogen and helium (He) and comparable penetrations for heavier elements. The Angle Detecting Inclined Sensors (ADIS) technique is used to provide single element resolution by determining the angle of incidence with a very simple telescope design using Si solid state detectors. The ADIS system also facilitates on-board event identification of ion species. During high flux conditions, EHIS can identify the elemental composition of ~2000 events per seconds. Elemental charge histograms are compiled on-board and reported via telemetry once per minute providing an unprecedented combination of statistical resolution and high cadence.\nThe first of four flight instruments (FM1) has been completed. FM1 underwent heavy ion accelerator calibration at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory’s (NSCL) Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) at Michigan State University in February 2013, and proton calibration at the Massachusetts General Hospital’s (MGH) Burr Proton Therapy Center in April 2013. The heavy ion calibration included both Ni primary and secondary fragments runs down to H. Results of these calibration runs will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The OSDT Android SensorPod is a custom-designed mobile computing platform for assembling wireless sensor networks for environmental monitoring applications. Funded by an award from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the OSDT SensorPod represents a significant technological advance in the application of mobile and cloud computing technologies to near-real-time applications in environmental science, natural resources management, and disaster response and recovery. It provides a modular architecture based on open standards and open-source software that allows system developers to align their projects with industry best practices and technology trends, while avoiding commercial vendor lock-in to expensive proprietary software and hardware systems. The integration of mobile and cloud-computing infrastructure represents a disruptive technology in the field of environmental science, since basic assumptions about technology requirements are now open to revision, e.g., the roles of special purpose data loggers and dedicated site infrastructure. The OSDT Android SensorPod was designed with these considerations in mind, and the resulting system exhibits the following characteristics – it is flexible, efficient and robust. The system was developed and tested in the three science applications: 1) a fresh water limnology deployment in Wisconsin, 2) a near coastal marine science deployment at the UCSD Scripps Pier, and 3) a terrestrial ecological deployment in the mountains of Taiwan. As part of a public education and outreach effort, a Facebook page with daily ocean pH measurements from the UCSD Scripps pier was developed. Wireless sensor networks and the virtualization of data and network services is the future of environmental science infrastructure. The OSDT Android SensorPod was designed and developed to harness these new technology developments for environmental monitoring applications.",

            "abstract": "The FP7-SPACE project PRoViDE has assembled a major portion of the imaging data gathered so far from rover vehicles, landers and probes on extra-terrestrial planetary surfaces into a unique database, bringing them into a common planetary geospatial context and providing access to a complete set of 3D vision products. One major aim of PRoViDE is the fusion between orbiter and rover image products. To close the gap between HiRISE imaging resolution (down to 25cm for the OrthoRectified image (ORI), down to 1m for the DTM) and surface vision products, images from multiple HiRISE acquisitions are combined into a super resolution data set (Tao & Muller, 2014), increasing to 5cm resolution the Ortho images. Furthermore, shape-from-shading is applied to one of the ORIs at its original resolution for refinement of the HiRISE DTM, leading to DTM ground resolutions of up to 25 cm. After texture-based co-registration with these refined orbiter 3D products, MER PanCam and NavCam 3D image products can be smoothly pasted into a multi-resolution 3D data representation.\nTypical results from the MER mission are presented by a dedicated real-time rendering tool which is fed by a hierarchical 3D data structure that is able to cope with all involved scales from global planetary scale down to close-up reconstructions in the mm range. This allows us to explore and analyze the geological characteristics of rock outcrops, for example the detailed geometry and internal features of sedimentary rock layers, to aid paleoenvironmental interpretation. This integrated approach enables more efficient development of geological models of martian rock outcrops. The rendering tool also provides measurement tools to obtain geospatial data of surface points and distances between them.\nWe report on novel scientific use cases and the added value potential of the resultant high-quality data set and presentation means to support further geologic investigations.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the EC's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 312377.",

CLUBB replaces the existing planetary boundary layer, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics schemes in CAM with a unified parameterization that drives one double moment microphysics scheme.\nThis presentation documents the performance of CAM-CLUBB for both prescribed sea surface temeprature (SST) and coupled simulations. We will discuss the improved mean state climate, such as improved stratocumulus to cumulus transitions, that can result when compared to CAM5. In addition, CAM-CLUBB is able to improve many long-standing issues that many general circulation models (GCMs) struggle to realistically simulate; such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), diurnal cycle of precipitation, and the frequency and intensity of precipitation.

            "abstract": "The development of next generation Earth System Models (ESM) demands fundamental configuration decisions across three axes of computational constraint: resolution, complexity and simulation length. One of the representational aspirations driving current development is to capture the global ocean mesoscale (i.e. ocean weather) in coupled carbon-climate ESMs. This resolution constraint poses extreme limitations on both complexity (i.e. the number of biogeochemical tracers) and simulation length. The present study explores a novel experimental design in which a series of touchstones across the axes of resolution (100 km to 10 km), complexity (30 tracer full biogeochemistry to 6, 3, and 1 tracer approximations), and simulation length (millenia to decades) are explored to estimate baseline biogeochemical simulation characteristics and the biogeochemical response to climate change. Along the axis of complexity, we find biogeochemical fidelity largely reproduced with a 6 tracer version of our full 30 tracer module, which is very promising for high resolution applications. However, further reduction down to 3 tracers revealed much more pronounced biases in baseline simulation characteristics. Further, we find critical differences in simulation characteristics in the 3 tracer version, across resolutions, that challenge mechanistic attribution. Although these deficiencies may reflect specific aspects of our 3 tracer model design and are the topic of further research for future improvement, they illustrate the great challenge of adequately representing the key processes with such a small number of tracers. Nonetheless, we find that sensitivity of the biogeochemistry to climate change across the complexity bear many similarities, giving us some support that the differences we see across resolutions may indicate robust differences in biogeochemical response across resolutions.",

            "abstract": "At the Nicaragua portion of the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos Plate is subducting at ~85 mm/yr, a tsunami earthquake (mb 5.3, Ms 7.2, Mw 7.6) occurred at 15 km depth on 2 September 1992, causing a tsunami up to 8 m high and >116 deaths. A tsunami earthquake is characterized by deficiency in high frequency radiated energy and large tsunami for its Ms. Tsunami earthquakes are relatively rare, but their occurrence presents a significant hazard to coastal populations, so the potential to identify tsunami earthquake regions has wide-reaching hazard implications. Here we examine the notion that the cause of the dominantly low frequency energy in the 1992 tsunami earthquake may also manifest in small earthquakes in the same area. We examine 241 events within and south of the 1992 rupture limits with hypocenters 8-30 km depth and 1.7 < Mw < 4.6, recorded by land station and ocean bottom seismometers in southern Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica from November 2005 to June 2006. Event source parameters moment, corner frequency, and stress drop are determined using the spectral ratios of S-wave coda. Mean stress drop inside the 1992 rupture area is 3.2 MPa, and immediately south of the 1992 rupture zone mean stress drop is 10.4 MPa. Inside and outside the 1992 rupture zone at similar depths, the increase in stress drop is by a factor of five and occurs abruptly over <50 km. The mean corner frequency of events in the 1992 rupture area is ~45% the mean corner frequency value for events south of the 1992 rupture zone. Therefore, our results demonstrate different source parameter characteristics for microseismicity in the region of a past tsunami earthquake. If this finding can be reproduced at other subduction zones, it may significantly improve subduction zone coastal hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "Since their discovery, numerous models have been put forward to explain the occurance of slow slip and associated tremor. These models invoke a wide array of causal mechanisms and are all successful in reproducing the first-order behavior of slow-slip events. Discriminating amongst the various proposed models requires looking at second-order effects of slow slip and tremor. Here, we consider the effects of tidal modulation on slow slip in subduction zones. A great deal of observational evidence has established that slow-slip and associated tremor are modulated by the small stress perturbations associated with tides and teleseismic events. Recent modeling studies that have examined the influence of tidal stresses (<10 kPa) have focused either on the effects of tidally induced changes in shear stress, or on changes in shear and normal stress that coincide. However, along the Cascadia margin, the relative phase of the tidally induced fault-normal and shear stresses depends on position along the plate boundary fault, and can vary from being in phase, to completely out of phase. We report on the predictions of models designed to examine the sensitivity of slow-slip in subduction zones to the phase shift γ between tidally induced normal and shear stress perturbations. We consider both simple spring-slider and 1-D elastodynamic models that are designed to mimic the effects of geologic heterogeneity by allowing for variations in the rate-and-state frictional parameters. For a given slow-slip event, spring-slider results indicate that the phase lag γv between the peak slip rate and the tidally induced shear stress perturbation depends on both the phase shift γ, and the perturbation amplitude. Models parameterized for Cascadia are capable of producing phase lags γv within the range (15◦ to 30◦) of those reported by Royer et al. (JGR, 2014). Additionally, our models predict that the correlation between tidally induced shear stress perturbations and resultant slip also depends on the phase shift γ. Our results indicate that the influence of tides, especially the effects of phase differences between tidaly induced shear and normal stresses, must be taken into account when evaluating the physical mechanisms of slow-slip and tremor.",

            "abstract": "The Thwaites and Pine Island ice shelves, buttressing the WAIS, have passed the turning point as they are eaten away by warmer ocean waters (Joghin et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2014).\nThere is an increasing evidence (aeromagnetic, radar ice–sounding, high heat flow, subglacial volcanic seismicity, and several exposed and subglacial active volcanoes), for volcanic activity in the WR beneath the WAIS, which flows through it. The 5-km, orthogonally line spaced, central West Antarctica (CWA) aerogeophysical survey defined >400 high amplitude volcanic magnetic anomalies correlated with glacial bed topography. Modeled anomalies defined magnetic properties; interpreted volcanic edifices were mostly removed by the moving ice into which they were erupted. Very high apparent susceptibility contrasts (.001->.3 SI) are typical of measured properties from volcanic exposures in the WAIS area. About 90% of the magnetic sources have normal magnetization in the present field direction. Two explanations as to why the anomalies are not approximately 50% negative: (1) Volcanic activity resulting in these anomalies occurred in a predominantly normal field (unlikely). (2) Sources are a combination of induced and remanent magnetization resulting in anomalies of low amplitude (induced cancels remanent) and are not recognized because they are <100 nT (most probable).\nAbout 18 high relief, (~600-2000 m) “volcanic centers“ beneath the WAIS surface, probably were erupted subaerially when the WAIS was absent; nine of these are in the general area beneath the divide of the WAIS. A 70-km wide, ring of interpreted subglacial volcanic rocks may define a volcanic caldera underlying thedivide (Behrendt et al., 1998). A 2 km-high subaerially erupted volcano (subglacial Mt Thiel, ~78o30’S, 111oW) ~ 100 km north of the WAISCORE, could be the source an ash layer observed in the core. Models by Tulaczyk and Hossainzadeh (2011) indicate >4mm/yr basal melting beneath the WAIS, supportive of high heat flow and the presence of subglacial lakes. These various lines of evidence lead to the general interpretation that the ice divide area of the WAIS overlies present to recent subglacial volcanic activity that may have an influence on the past and future behavior of the WAIS.",

            "abstract": "Moderate energy positrons (~few to 10 MeV) have seldom been observed in the Heliosphere, due primarily to there not having been dedicated instruments for such measurements. Their detection would have implications in the study of Solar energetic particle events and the transport and modulation of the Solar wind and Galactic cosmic rays. The Positron Identification by Coincident Annihilation Photons (PICAP) system is designed specifically to measure these moderate energy positrons by simultaneously detecting the two 511-keV γ-ray photons that result from a positron stopping in the instrument and the subsequent electron-positron annihilation. This method is also expected to effectively discriminate positrons from protons by measuring the amount of energy deposited in the detectors (dE/dx versus residual energy). PICAP offers a low-mass, low-power option for measuring positrons, electrons, and ions in space. Following Monte Carlo modeling, a PICAP laboratory prototype, adaptable to a space-flight design, was designed, built, and tested. This instrument is comprised of (Si) solid-state detectors, plastic scintillation detectors, and high-Z BGO crystal scintillator suitable for detecting the 511-keV γ rays. The prototype underwent preliminary laboratory testing and calibration using radioactive sources for the purpose of establishing functionality. It has since been exposed to beams of energetic protons (up to ~200 MeV) at Massachusetts General Hospital's Francis H. Burr Proton Beam Therapy Center and positrons and electrons (up to ~10 MeV) at Idaho State University's Idaho Accelerator Center. The goal is to validate modeling and determine the performance of the instrument concept. We will present a summary of modeling calculations and analysis of data taken at the accelerator tests.

Such antennas are capable of exciting electromagnetic radiation fields, specifically the creation of whistler waves generated at the very low frequency (VLF) range, which are also capable of propagating large distances away from the source region. The mechanism of whistler wave generation is considered a parametric interaction of quasi-electrostatic low oblique resonance (LOR)oscillations excited by conventional antenna. The transformation of LOR waves on quasi-neutral density perturbations in the near field of an antenna gives rise to whistler waves on combination frequencies. Amplitude of these waves can considerably exceed the amplitude of whistler waves directly excited by a loop. Simulation to demonstrate excitation and spatial structure of VLF waves excited by a loop antenna using a PIC code LSP will be presented as well.",

            "abstract": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are jointly acquiring the next-generation civilian weather and environmental satellite system: the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). JPSS replaced the afternoon orbit component and ground processing system of the old POES system managed by the NOAA. JPSS satellites will carry sensors designed to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological, and solar-geophysical observations of the earth, atmosphere, and space. The ground processing system for the JPSS is the Common Ground System (CGS), and provides command, control, and communications (C3), data processing and product delivery. CGS’s data processing capability processes the data from the JPSS satellites to provide environmental data products (including Sensor Data Records (SDRs) and Environmental Data Records (EDRs)) to the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility.\nThe first satellite in the JPSS constellation, known as the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, was launched on 28 October 2011. CGS is currently processing and delivering SDRs and EDRs for S-NPP and will continue through the lifetime of the JPSS program. The EDRs for S-NPP are currently undergoing an extensive Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) campaign. Changes identified by the Cal/Val campaign are coming available for implementation into the operational system in support of both S-NPP and JPSS-1 (scheduled for launch in 2017). Some of these changes will be available in time to update the S-NPP algorithm baseline, while others will become operational just prior to JPSS-1 launch. In addition, new capabilities, such as higher spectral and spatial resolution, will be exercised on JPSS-1. This paper will describe changes to current algorithms and products as a result of the Cal/Val campaign and related initiatives for improved capabilities. Improvements include Cross Track Infrared Sounder high spectral processing, extended spectral and spatial ranges for Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite ozone Total Column and Nadir Profiles, and updates to Vegetation Index, Snow Cover, Active Fires, Suspended Matter, and Ocean Color. Updates will include Sea Surface Temperature, Cloud Mask, Cloud Properties, and other improvements.",

            "abstract": "A number of aquifers worldwide are being depleted, mainly by agricultural activities, yet groundwater stress has not been explicitly linked to specific agricultural crops. Using the newly-developed concept of the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services), we develop a methodology to derive crop-specific groundwater footprints. We illustrate this method by calculating high resolution groundwater footprint estimates of crops in two heavily used aquifer systems: the Central Valley and High Plains, U.S. In both aquifer systems, hay and haylage, corn and cotton have the largest groundwater footprints, which highlights that most of the groundwater stress is induced by crops meant for cattle feed. Our results are coherent with other studies in the High Plains but suggest lower groundwater stress in the Central Valley, likely due to artificial recharge from surface water diversions which were not taken into account in previous estimates. Uncertainties of recharge and irrigation application efficiency contribute the most to the total relative uncertainty of the groundwater footprint to aquifer area ratios. Our results and methodology will be useful for hydrologists, water resource managers, and policy makers concerned with which crops are causing the well-documented groundwater stress in semiarid to arid agricultural regions around the world.",

Due to the non-linearity of the equations there are transfers of energy and potential enstrophy between scales. This means that energy and enstrophy are transferred between the resolved scales (i.e. larger than the grid spacing) and the subgrid terms. It is important that the dynamical core can accurately model these transfers, as the effect of the subgrid terms can have a large impact on the resolved scale flow.\nWe investigate the energy and potential enstrophy transfers between the resolved and subgrid scales using both spectral and grid point analysis. The spectral analysis shows at which wave numbers energy and potential energy is being added to or removed from the resolved scale flow by the subgrid terms. The grid point analysis compares the dissipative effects of the diffusion in the model with the actual subgrid terms. As a first step we make use of simplified models solving the shallow water equations. We then extend this methodology to investigate atmospheric dynamical cores.",

However, the Permo-Carboniferous apparent polar wander path (APWP) of South America, for which the overlap is the most severe, is dominated by sedimentary rocks and the few igneous rocks are either remagnetized or have suffered from tectonic rotations. Bilardello and Kodama (2010) have shown how inclination shallowing corrections of Gondwana sedimentary rocks may completely eliminate the continental overlap between the northern and southern continental blocks. Such blanket inclination corrections performed using a fixed flattening factor, however, lack a solid base because inclination shallowing is lithology-specific, depending on clay content, magnetic carrier, particle size and shape among other factors, and should not be performed systematically. New paleomagnetic data from the Permo-Carboniferous Itararé Group of Brazil reveal extensive remagnetizations in these rocks, as do recently published studies that also highlight pervasive South American remagnetizations which affect some of the paleopoles that define the Permo-Carboniferous portion of South American APWP. We present new paleomagnetic, rock-magnetic and anisotropy data from the Brazilian Itararé Group and also point out flaws in the widely used and inclination corrected South American Permo-Carboniferous APWP reported in Torsvik et al.

Understanding the predictability of Arctic sea ice melting is thus an important task. A Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model is evaluated for predicting the summer time (May through September) daily Arctic sea ice concentrations. The intra-seasonal forecast skill of the Arctic sea ice is assessed using 1979-2012 satellite data provided by the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The cross-validated forecast skill of the VAR model is superior over persistence and climatological seasonal cycle for a lead-time of 15~60 days, especially over marginal seas. In addition to capturing the general seasonal melt of sea ice, the VAR model is also able to capture the interannual variability of the melting, from partial melt of the marginal sea ice in the beginning of the period to almost a complete melt in the later years. While the detailed mechanism leading to the high predictability of intra-seasonal sea ice concentration needs to be further examined, the study reveals for the first time that Arctic sea ice concentration can be predicted statistically with reasonable skills at the intra-seasonal time scales.",

            "abstract": "We use a large dataset of normal-mode splitting functions, surface-wave phase anomalies, long-period waveforms, and body-wave travel times to investigate the resolution of anisotropic velocities, density and discontinuity topography in the Earth’s mantle. Our starting point is our new anisotropic shear-wave-velocity model S362ANI+M, which is an update to the model S362ANI (Kustowski et al., 2008). S362ANI+M was derived using additional normal-mode splitting-function observations. The isotropic part of the new model has strong variations in the transition zone and is well correlated with several recent global tomographic models. The anisotropic part of S362ANI+M is restricted to the upper ~300 km in the mantle and is similar to S362ANI. When radial anisotropy is allowed throughout the mantle, large-scale anisotropic patterns are observed in the lowermost mantle with vSV > vSH beneath Africa and South Pacific and vSH > vSV beneath several circum-Pacific regions. However, small improvements in fits to the data on adding anisotropy at depth leave the question open on whether large-scale radial anisotropy is required in the transition zone and in the lower mantle. We demonstrate that mode-splitting data reduce tradeoffs between isotropic velocity and anisotropy in the lowermost mantle for the even-degree variations. Anisotropic variations in the mid mantle are also suppressed with the addition of mode-splitting data. The seismic observables used in this study have different sensitivity to mantle heterogeneity; the long-period mantle waveforms and mode-splitting data, for example, are also sensitive to VP and ⍴ structure. Most tomographic models adopt a priori scaling relationships between variations in shear velocity and other elastic parameters. We introduce an approach to estimate the scaling ratios from seismic data wherein we impose, with increasing weights, a priori correlations between variations in VS and that of VP and ⍴. The VS-VP and VS-⍴ correlations and corresponding fit to data are examined to estimate depth-dependent scaling ratios. This approach allows us to investigate the resolution of scaling ratios from current datasets in different regions of the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses are often supersaturated in CO2. Indeed, volatile saturation pressures, estimated from dissolved CO2 and H2O concentrations, exceed eruption pressures (seafloor collection depths) by up to 45–50 MPa. It is thought that rapid ascent to the surface promotes disequilibrium degassing by kinetically limiting bubble nucleation and growth. This study uses supersaturated MORB glasses to experimentally investigate degassing kinetics in order to constrain magma ascent and flow rates. Glasses used were recovered at the fissure of the 2005–06 eruption of the East Pacific Rise, and are supersaturated by about 38 MPa and contain ~105 bubbles/cm3, the largest of which are ~35 µm in size. Away from the fissure, CO2 concentrations decrease as bubble sizes increase dramatically along the flow length, with bubbles reaching 94 µm in size. Nucleation is being studied by heating samples at 1225 °C and 200 MPa, and then rapidly decompressing them to low pressures, holding them at low pressure for various amounts of time, and then rapidly quenching them. Samples quenched at 200 MPa are bubble free and contain about 550 ppm CO2, indicating that all original bubbles resorb. Preliminary results show that samples decompressed to 12–21 MPa nucleate ~105 bubbles/cm3 after two minutes, but nucleate many orders of magnitude more after ten minutes, number densities that far exceed those in the natural samples. Samples decompressed to 52 MPa nucleate ~105 bubbles/cm3 after 10 minutes. These preliminary results suggest that bubble nucleation in MORB occurs at relatively high pressures, and then bubble growth suppresses further nucleation at lower pressures. Such a scenario suggests that MORB magmas may not ascend as rapidly as predicted. Bubble growth at low pressure is being studied by rapidly heating glassy vent samples to 1225 °C at 70 MPa, then decompressing and holding them at ~25 MPa for various amounts of time. Mean bubble size increases steadily by ~3 µm/hr during the first 7 hours, but number density decreases significantly between 3 and 5 hours, possibly because of coalescence. Continued experiments will be run to mimic bubble sizes in the natural samples to constrain the rate of lava emplacement.",

Mixed methods were used to explore this study’s research questions. Supported with NASA funding, twelve secondary science teachers participated in the study. Study findings suggest that RET programs that incorporate a PLC component can help to shift teachers’ beliefs and classroom practices concerning inquiry-based instruction, and help them to increase the level of inquiry in their science lessons. An implication of this research is that teacher professional development models need to be developed to help teachers effectively plan more time for students to conduct inquiry-based activities, to communicate findings based on evidence, and to develop questions to investigate themselves. Moreover, the findings of this study can help to inform science teacher education and professional development programs in creating more fruitful experiences for these professionals, and help them to align their beliefs and practice more toward the constructivist visions of current reform efforts.",

            "abstract": "To provide more accurate models of site response in ShakeMap, earthquake scenarios, and other seismic hazard applications, we have developed a database of site-specific empirical amplification factors (EAFs) based on the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center’s Next Generation of Attenuation ground motion database. These amplification factors are developed for each site with a minimum of five recordings by averaging amplification as a function of frequency (after correcting for event terms where we require each event include a minimum of five recordings). The EAFs employ a non-reference site approach, where the denominator in the site response ratio is defined as the spectral acceleration predicted by the Boore et al. (2014) ground motion prediction equation for rock conditions, i.e. a time averaged shear-wave velocity to 30 m (Vs30) of 760 m/s. Given the large number of sites in the database, the EAFs provide a valuable dataset for addressing the accuracy of site-response models that are based on Vs30. By focusing on a handful of sites where the EAFs are well determined and the Vs30 profile is measured (rather than inferred based on a proxy), we are able to analyze the limitations of Vs30-based site amplifications and discuss strategies for improving site response models. In many cases, the Vs30-based amplifications accurately reproduce the frequency-dependence of the EAFs, though under some conditions the EAFs exhibit distinctive trends with frequency that cannot be reproduced by Vs30-based amplification factors. EAFs at recording sites provide an alternative to Vs30-based factors that allow for a more realistic representation of site response. Yet, an additional challenge that must be addressed entails developing a strategy for proper geospatial interpolation between EAFs for estimating amplifications at locations without multiple recordings.",

            "abstract": "Noble gases are widely used as tracers to both determine fluid origin and identify transfer processes governing fluid flow in natural systems.\nThis work presents the preliminary results and interpretations from submarine gas samples collected during the GAZCOGNE2 cruise (2013). The seepage activity and the spatial distribution of the widespread emission sites encountered at this area are described by (Dupré et al. 2014).\nGas composition shows that methane is the dominant species compared to the C2+. The associated δ13C and δD signatures point to a biogenic origin- through CO2 reduction- of the gas.\nHelium concentrations are very low, ranging from 0.1 and 2.3 ppm, indicating a low residence time of the fluids in the subsurface. However, the resulting helium isotopic ratios are mostly crustal fingerprinted (around 0.02). The R/Ra values sometimes exhibit higher value of 0.2, indicative either an ASW (air saturated water) value, or the fingerprint of ancient mantle helium, the later in agreement with the geological structural context of the Parentis Basin.\nMost of the samples exhibit a mixing between ASW and air, probably by excess air addition to the initial ASW concentration. The elemental Ne/Ar ratio is remarkably constant for the totality of the samples, with a value typical of ASW (0.2). This result implies that the migrating gas phase is \"stripping\" the original water matrix from its noble gas content, as described by Gillfillian et al., 2008. This further indicates that an intermediate reservoir of biogenic gas should be present at depth.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.\n",

            "abstract": "High-speed, precise gas analyzers used in eddy covariance flux research measure gas content in a known volume, thus essentially measuring gas density. The classical eddy flux equation, however, is based on the dry mole fraction. The relation between dry mole fraction and density is regulated by the ideal gas law and law of partial pressures, and depends on water vapor content, temperature and pressure of air. If the instrument can output precise fast dry mole fraction, the flux processing is significantly simplified and WPL terms accounting for air density fluctuations are no longer required. This will also lead to the reduction in uncertainties associated with the WPL terms. For instruments adopting an open-path design, this method is difficult to use because of complexities with maintaining reliable fast temperature measurements integrated over the entire measuring path, and also because of extraordinary challenges with accurate measurements of fast pressure in the open air flow. For instruments utilizing a traditional long-tube closed-path design, with tube length 1000 or more times the tube diameter, this method can be used when instantaneous fluctuations in the air temperature of the sampled air are effectively dampened, instantaneous pressure fluctuations are regulated or negligible, and water vapor is measured simultaneously with gas, or the sample is dried. For instruments with a short-tube enclosed design, most - but not all - of the temperature fluctuations are attenuated, so calculating unbiased fluxes using fast dry mole fraction output requires high-speed, precise temperature measurements of the air stream inside the cell. In this presentation, authors look at short-term and long-term data sets to assess the importance of high-speed, precise air temperature measurements in the sampling cell of short-tube enclosed gas analyzers. The CO2 and H2O half hourly flux calculations, as well as long-term carbon and water budgets, are examined.",

            "abstract": "The magnetopause is a boundary separating the geospace magnetic environment from interplanetary space. Its location provides an important demarcation for satellite operators, the interpretation of plasma observations and a measure of the expected level of space weather activity. Substantial increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure and southward interplanetary magnetic field can result in a magnetopause compressed inward of geostationary orbit. In support of the needs of space weather forecasters, we have transitioned a version of the upcoming Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R (launch ~ early 2016) magnetopause monitoring and crossing product into operations. The current version is based on GOES-13, -14 and -15 magnetic measurements and the Shue et al. (1998) model of the magnetopause, while the future version will take advantage of GOES-R's expanded range of particle energies and derived moments to better define the magnetopause location. This paper will present lessons learned from the research to operations (R2O) process, a statistical validation of product performance, comparisons to other similar products, and a brief summary of a few geosynchronous crossings. Our statistical validation uses GOES and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellite observations to calculate the detection performance characteristics of dayside crossings predicted by commonly used models of the magnetopause boundary including Chao et al. (2001), Petrinec and Russell (1996) and Shue et al. (1998). In our summary of important geosynchronous crossings, we briefly describe monitoring of the magnetopause during the February 2014 event, which resulted in a geosynchronous crossing and degradation of a high-latitude aircraft navigation system.

In the Summer of 2012, we conducted a field survey motivated by Rikhter (1961)'s claim of an episode of inundation in 1960, but could not verify it from the testimony of older witnesses. Rather, we documented that the 1990 Rudbar earthquake (Mw = 7.4) was definitely followed by a tsunami reaching a run-up amplitude of ~2 m along a ~30 km stretch of the coast, from Kiashahr to Jafrood, and which to our our knowledge, had not been previously reported. A dataset of 29 witness reports was compiled using standard investigative techniques for post-tsunami surveys.\nHydrodynamic simulations using the MOST algorithm and various published models of the earthquake's rupture fail to reproduce the fundamental characteristics of the inundation, notably its lateral concentration along the coast. The alternative model of an underwater landslide, presumably triggered along a steep segment of the Caspian Sea floor, provides an acceptable fit to the distribution of the tsunami along the shoreline of the Caspian Sea, and suggests that landslides could be the primary source of tsunami hazard in the area.",

Most ionospheric models use equatorial ExB drift velocities as an input parameter in order to predict the structures and dynamics of the ionosphere. Several studies have shown that the daytime vertical ExB drift can be inferred using ground based magnetometer observations. The dataset of horizontal component of the earth magnetic field obtained from a pair of magnetometers, one at the dip equator (Jicamarca) and another off the dip equator (Piura) by 6.8 degrees are analyzed and correlated with the ExB drift velocities measured by the Jicamarca Incoherent Scatter Radar(ISR). The impact of the pattern of equatorial ExB drift on Global Positioning System(GPS)-derived total electron content(TEC) has also been studied. Observational data from the recent solar minimum period (2008-09) for the day to day and seasonal variations of the drifts were examined. Linear regression and multilayer neural network approaches are used to analyze the data. Our study shows that the overall variation of daytime ExB drift during solar minimum can be inferred from ground based magnetometer observations. Observations show a noticeable connection between TEC value and the daytime ExB drift during low solar activity period. We compare the results from our investigation with Jicamarca ISR measurement and the Scherliess-Fejer empirical model on corresponding local time.",

Earthquake risk and surging reliance on smartphones and the Internet to handle everyday tasks raise the question: is an increasingly technology-reliant Bay Area prepared for potential infrastructure impacts caused by a major earthquake? How will a major earthquake on the Hayward Fault affect lifelines (roads, power, water, communication, etc.)? The U.S. Geological Survey Science Application for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) program’s Haywired disaster scenario, a hypothetical two-year earthquake sequence triggered by a M7.05 mainshock on the Hayward Fault, addresses these and other questions.\nWe explore four geographic aspects of lifeline damage from earthquakes: (1) geographic lifeline concentrations, (2) areas where lifelines pass through high shaking or potential ground-failure zones, (3) areas with diminished lifeline service demand due to severe building damage, and (4) areas with increased lifeline service demand due to displaced residents and businesses. Potential mainshock lifeline vulnerability and spatial demand changes will be discerned by superimposing earthquake shaking, liquefaction probability, and landslide probability damage thresholds with lifeline concentrations and with large-capacity shelters. Intersecting high hazard levels and lifeline clusters represent potential lifeline susceptibility hotspots. We will also analyze possible temporal vulnerability and demand changes using an aftershock shaking threshold. The results of this analysis will inform regional lifeline resilience initiatives and response and recovery planning, as well as reveal potential redundancies and weaknesses for Bay Area lifelines. Identified spatial and temporal hotspots can provide stakeholders with a reference for possible systemic vulnerability resulting from an earthquake sequence.",

            "abstract": "Much of the world’s soil carbon is frozen in permafrost in the Arctic. As the climate warms and permafrost thaws, this carbon will again be actively cycled. Whether it is exported to the ocean or released as greenhouse gases to the atmosphere depends on the form of carbon compounds and conditions encountered during transport, and will determine the strength of permafrost thaw as a feedback on climate change. To better understand the fate of this carbon, we determined how and where in the landscape dissolved organic carbon (DOC) breaks down as water transports it from tundra to ocean. We compared DOC concentration and composition along flowpaths within watersheds and at the mouths of watersheds differing in drainage area. We incubated filtered water samples in light and dark, including filter-sterilized samples, to assess the interactions between light and microbial processing as mechanisms of DOC loss. Composition was assessed using optical measurements associated with the structure of organic compounds. DOC concentration declined along flowpaths within watersheds, with most loss occurring in aquatic environments high in the landscape. We also found a negative correlation between watershed size and DOC concentration. These results suggest that much of the processing of organic carbon occurs in small streams. In addition, the relationship with drainage area suggests that residence time in streams has a large impact on transformation of terrestrial carbon during transport. We found no substantial differences in optical characteristics of DOC, indicating that breakdown processes were not selective, and that light caused much of the breakdown. This conclusion is supported by the incubation experiment, which showed greater breakdown by light, and evidence that light stimulated higher rates of microbial processing. These results highlight the importance of inland aquatic ecosystems as processors of organic matter, and suggest that organic carbon from permafrost thaw is likely to be processed high in the landscape rather than transported to the ocean. Furthermore, the importance of light-induced breakdown as a mechanism for carbon loss suggests that the timing of DOC transport relative to seasonal changes in light intensity may influence the impact of permafrost thaw on climate change.",

            "abstract": "The interpretation of climate model data requires a solid validation of the simulated processes such as the global atmospheric water and energy cycle utilizing in situ measurements, remote sensing data and reanalysis as a reference. Here we develop a satellite simulator for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation radar (TRMM PR) utilizing the CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP). This enables the evaluation of the climate model data in the instrument’s parameter space thereby reducing uncertainties on the reference side. Assumptions for microphysical calculations are chosen to be consistent with the climate model microphysical schemes. The simulator was developed and applied within the MiKlip project funded by BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) to evaluate decadal climate predictions performed with the MPI-ESM (ECHAM6) developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. In this study we focus on a comparison between two climate models, namely the MPI-ESM (ECHAM6) and the HadGEM2, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the satellite simulator results to microphysical properties and sub-grid scale variability. Utilizing joint height-radar reflectivity distributions the simulated radar reflectivites are found to be similar to observations. However, results suggest a slight underestimation of the observed occurrence rates for both models. While MPI-ESM (ECHAM6) shows a clear contribution from both stratiform and convective rainfall to the simulated radar reflectivities, results for HadGEM2 show less contribution from stratiform rainfall. Differences between the two models are traced back to hydrometeor mixing ratio and effective radius distributions. As expected, the results are also shown to be sensitive to the method used to generate sub-grid scale precipitation variability.",

Two diatoms based methods were used for the sea ice reconstructions; a) a qualitative method based on the statistically defined occurrence of diatom assemblages according to their relation to modern surface hydrography, and b) a quantitative method for May sea ice cover based on the Maximum Likelihood transfer function method. The reconstructions were generated with a subdecadal resolution for the time interval 870–1930 CE enabling to reconstruct the climate changes on the SE Greenland shelf with the highest resolution to date.\nDiatoms show a pronounced influence of the sea ice cover in the area during the past 1130 years. Both qualitative diatom data (especially the occurrence of Fragilariopsis spp.) and the quantitative reconstruction for the May sea ice cover indicate the record sea ice cover for the first half of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 870 and 1030 CE. Results might indicate an increased sea ice export on the SE Greenland shelf during the onset of the warm climate anomaly.

            "abstract": "Ecosystems and societies worldwide have evolved to depend upon the timing and magnitude of river discharge, and understanding past flows can help guide modern water management. We used tree rings of riparian plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides subsp. monilifera) to reconstruct the history of flow variation and channel migration of a 20 km reach of the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana. Dendrochronological flow reconstructions commonly use upland trees, but our study highlights the improved resolution when floodplain trees are integrated into the data set . Our sample of 240 cottonwoods dating back to 1751 permits flow reconstruction of the Yellowstone to before the voyage of Lewis and Clark. Our tree ring series intercorrelation coefficient is 0.58, and the ring width index correlates to annual discharge at R = 0.67. Flow reconstruction indicates that the decades of highest (1820s, 1850s) and lowest (1830s, 1900s) flows all occurred prior to the instrumental record, revealing the value of an extended perspective. Cottonwood age distribution indicates that, like other western rivers, the rate of channel migration on the Yellowstone declined in the 20th century. However, the Yellowstone uniquely lacks mainstem dams and substantial water extractions, revealing the occurrence of hydrological and ecological change on a relatively natural river. Our study reach is the most geomorphically active of the entire 1100 km river between Yellowstone National Park and the Missouri River, but cottonwood age distribution reveals that trees that have established since the 1960s are underrepresented. The lack of younger cottonwood trees is likely caused by a decline in river migration rates, which may be attributed to i) climate change directly leading to a decline in fluvial processes driving river migration, ii) a decoupling in the timing of the snowmelt runoff receding limb and cottonwood seed release, or iii) both. Even on this relatively unmodified river, it appears that changes to the hydrologic regime are negatively affecting the floodplain ecosystem and associated habitats.",

            "abstract": "The 146Sm-142Nd (t1/2=68 Ma) chronometer can be used to examine silicate differentiation in the first 400 Ma of Earth history. Early fractionation between Sm and Nd is recorded in cratonic Archean rocks in their 142Nd/144Nd ratios that that deviate up to ±20 ppm, or µ142Nd - ppm deviation relative to the present-day convecting mantle at 0. These values likely record early extraction of incompatible trace element (ITE) enriched material with -µ142Nd, either as crust or late stage residual melt from a magma ocean, and resulting in a complimentary ITE depleted residual mantle with +µ142Nd. If this early-formed ITE-enriched material was re-incorporated rapidly back into the convecting mantle, both ITE-enriched and ITE-depleted mantle domains would have been established in the Hadean. Alternatively, if it was early-formed crust that remained stable it could have slowly eroded and progressively remixed into the convecting mantle as subducted sediment during the Archean. Each of these scenarios could potentially explain the decrease in the maximum variation in µ142Nd from ±20 at 4.0 Ga to 0 at 2.5 Ga [1,2,3]. In the scenario where these variations reflect mixing of mantle domains, this implies long mantle mixing times of greater than 1 Ga in the Archean in order to preserve the early-formed heterogeneities. This can be achieved in a stagnant lid tectonic regime in the Archean with sporadic and short subduction cycles [2]. This scenario would also indicate that mixing times in the convecting mantle were much slower than the previously proposed 100 Ma in the Hadean and Archean. In the alternative scenario, sediment with -µ142Nd was progressively mixed into the mantle via subduction in the Archean [3]. This scenario doesn’t require slow mantle mixing times or a stagnant-lid regime. It requires crustal resident times of up to 750 Ma to maintain a steady supply of ancient sediment recycling over the Archean. Each of these scenarios evoke very contrasting conditions for early Earth history and additional examination is needed. We will consider the geochemical consequences of crustal sediment subduction in order to test the hypothesis of crustal recycling as well as provide additional evidence to aid in resolving this issue.\n[1] Bennett et al., Science, 318 (2007), p.1907\n[2] Debaille et al., EPSL, 373 (2013), p.83\n[3] Roth et al., G3, 2014",

This paper intends to introduce some of our cutting edge systems and tools that are available to everyone in the community.\nAn important objective of the CCMC is to prototype, validate, and compare various methods for CME arrival predictions. As such, CCMC has developed three web based CME specific tools with the goal of facilitating advanced analysis and collaboration within the space weather community. The three tools we highlight in this abstract are: Stereoscopic CME Analysis Tool (StereoCAT), WSA-ENLIL+Cone Fast Track, and Space Weather Scoreboard. These three tools allow making CME measurements, executing space weather simulations in near real-time, and providing a systematic way for the scientific community to record and compare predictions both prior to, and after CME arrivals at near Earth.\nIn order to address the space weather needs of NASA missions and encourage collaboration between various groups, CCMC has developed a web based system called the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (SW DONKI). SW DONKI serves as an archive of all space weather activities including: flares, CMEs (including simulations), SEPs, and geomagnetic storms. An innovative feature of the system is the ability to generate, modify, and store complex linkages between activities - creating a comprehensive network of relationships between activities, and identifying potential cause-and-effect paradigms for each space weather “event”. SW DONKI also provides public access to all human generated event analysis and other notifications produced by the Space Weather Research Center (SWRC) forecasting team.",

            "abstract": "The Liverpool land Eclogite Terrane (LLET) is a small (≈200 km2) high pressure metamorphic terrane at the southern tip of the Eastern Greenland Caledonides. Recent publications propose the LLET is a subducted Baltic terrane that underplated the Eastern Greenland Caledonides during the ca. 400 Ma Scandian Orogeny and was stranded in Greenland (Laurentia) during the opening of the Atlantic. However Johnston et al. (2011) proposed the LLET is actually a composite terrane comprised of a mid-crustal, high-pressure (granulite facies) terrane, the Jaettedal Complex, tectonically juxtaposed during the Scandian orogeny against a higher pressure (eclogite-facies), peridotite-bearing, metamorphic terrane, the Tvaerdal complex. The composite Tvaerdal/Jaettedal Terrane (now the LLET) was subsequently exhumed from beneath a Laurentian plutonic continental arc terrane, the Hurry Inlet Complex. U-Pb Precambrian ages from the Tvaerdal Complex obtained by LA-ICPMS from detrital zircons (this study) as well as published zircon dates do not distinctly match the published Proterozoic zircon age patterns of basins and crystalline complexes from either Laurentia or Baltica, therefore not resolving the provenance of the Tvaerdal Complex. However, Paleozoic zircon U-Pb dates (this study and the literature) demonstrate the Tvaerdal Complex underwent relatively short-lived high pressure/ultrahigh pressure metamorphism and subsequent anatectic melting between 415-385 Ma while recent work by Johnston et al. (2014) indicates the Jaettedal Complex underwent an earlier, much longer evolution between 460-412 Ma. The older ages from the Jaettedal coincide with ages obtained from the overlying Hurry Inlet Complex as well as other Greenland igneous terranes suggesting the Jaettedal Complex is a Laurentian terrane involved in the lengthy evolution of a continental arc complex along the eastern Greenland margin during the closure of Iapetus. The paucity of concordant 460-412 ages from the Tvaerdal Complex suggests it was not part of the Laurentia, but is consistent with earlier proposals that it was part of the eastern Baltica passive margin. Thus the LLET is composite; composed both of both Laurentian and Baltican complexes.\nJohnston et al., 2011, Earth and Planetary Science Letters 297, 512-524: Johnston et al., 2014, in prep.",

            "abstract": "Although short-term production of unconventional gas depends on the area of contact created by hydraulic fracturing and connections with pre-existing natural fracture networks, sustainable recovery is limited by transfer of gas from nanoporous matrix into the fractures, because the permeability of hydraulic fractures is orders of magnitude higher than that of the shale matrix. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of hydrocarbon mobility in shale matrix is urgently needed for improving recovery efficiencies. Shale transport properties (diffusivity, permeability, and electronic conductivity), which are critical for understanding the fundamental transport mechanisms, are still poorly understood. There have been some studies using experimental techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the nanoscale structures of shale. Due to the ultra-low porosity and permeability, it is difficult to experimentally investigate the fundamental transport processes inside the shale or accurately measure the transport properties. Advanced pore-scale numerical methods, e.g., the lattice Boltzman method (LBM) may provide an alternative approach.\nIn the present study, three-dimensional nanoscale porous structures of shale are reconstructed based on SEM images of shale samples. Characterization analysis of the nanoscale reconstructed shale is performed, including determination of porosity, pore size distribution, specific surface area, and pore connectivity. The LBM flow model and diffusion model are adopted to simulate fluid flow and Knudsen diffusion in the reconstructed shale, respectively. Tortuosity, intrinsic permeability, and effective Knudsen diffusivity are numerically predicted. The tortuosity is much higher than what is commonly employed in Bruggeman equation. Correction of the intrinsic permeability by taking into consideration the contribution of Knudsen diffusion, which leads to the apparent permeability, is performed. The correction factor under different Knudsen number and pressure conditions are estimated and compared with existing corrections reported in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernable warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations which on average project strong warming. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific, intensifying trade winds, changes in El Niño activity, increasing volcanic activity and decreasing solar irradiance. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyze observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land since 1920. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the difference between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called “hiatus” period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns different from GHG-induced warming. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a process which regulates the interaction between regions of magnetized plasma. While many factors have an impact on the evolution of this process, there still remains a lack of understanding of the key behaviors involved in the triggering of fast reconnection. Despite an abundance of in-situ measurements, indicating the high degree of variability in the thickness, density and composition along the current sheet, no simulation studies exist which account for such current sheet variations. 2D and 3D simulations have a periodic boundary in the dimension along the current sheet and so tend to neglect these variations in the current sheet originating external to the modeled reconnection region. Here we focus on the effects on reconnection due to the variability in the thickness and density of the current sheet. Using 2.5D kinetic simulations of 2-species plasma, we isolate and explore the dynamic effects on reconnection associated with variations in the current sheet originating externally to the reconnection region. While periodic boundary conditions are still used, in the direction along the current sheet, a step-change perturbation in thickness or density of the current sheet is introduced once a stable reconnection rate is reached. The dynamic response of the overall system, after introducing the perturbation, is then evaluated, with a focus on the reconnection rate. When the reconnection rate is slowed significantly over time, loading of the inflow region occurs (a build-up of plasma and magnetic energy/pressure. This state is indicated by an asymptotic behavior in the reconnection rate over time. If a sudden variation in the current sheet is introduced under these conditions, a resultant triggering of fast reconnection may occur, which could lead to an episode of fast reconnection, saw-tooth-crash condition or even act as a trigger for sub-storms.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency (decadal to centennial) modes of ocean are important components of climate variability. With the rise of supercomputers, these modes are inferred often from long-term climate simulations after being preprocessed by low-pass filtering. Notably, the few modes that are consistently found in many climate models differ significantly, even in frequency, as every model has biases and model errors. At the same time, validation of the extracted signals against observations is limited by the time span of the observational record (e.g., sea surface temperature and sea ice extent observed during the satellite era), which is oftentimes shorter than the timescales of interest and also significantly altered by anthropogenic factors. More importantly, due to preprocessing as well as the subsequent data analysis techniques (such as EOFs), the results have frequently ambiguous physical interpretation.\nHere, we investigate Indo-Pacific Ocean variability from 1300 control run of CCSM4. For that, we apply recently introduced technique called Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA, Giannakis and Majda 2012). Through this technique, drawbacks associated with ad-hoc filtering are avoided as the extracted signals span many temporal scales without preprocessing the input data, enabling detection of low-frequency and intermittent modes not previously accessible with classical EOF-based approaches. Here, we identify spatiotemporal modes covering multiple scales of interest, including several intraseasonal modes such as ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and Tropical Biennial Oscillation, revealing refined linkages between these patterns. Additionally, the amplitudes of these patterns are modulated by low-frequency envelopes whose character can in certain cases be related to patterns of decadal or longer variability which are also identified. As such, our study unambiguously clarifies interdependencies between intraseasonal modes which are sometimes treated in the climate science community as independent, but also lead to the identification of previously-unknown decadal to centennial modes.\nGiannakis, G. and A.

            "abstract": "The Channeled Scablands landscape in eastern Washington, USA contains vast tracts of scoured bedrock and deep canyons carved by catastrophic outburst floods triggered by failure of the ice-dam that impounded Glacial Lake Missoula. The Channeled Scablands are the closest terrestrial analog for the Martian Outflow Channels. Hence, understanding the interaction of flood hydraulics and erosion in the Channeled Scablands has key implications for reconstruction of flood magnitudes on Mars. In recent decades, much progress has been made in understanding the number and timing of floods that occurred in the Channeled Scablands during the last-glacial maximum. However, the response of the landscape to repeated flooding is poorly constrained, especially with respect to the possible role of canyon carving by outburst floods prior to the last glacial period. Whether the Scablands were carved entirely during the last-glacial or progressively over multiple glacial cycles has important implications for the assumptions used to reconstruct flow hydraulics. To constrain the processes, rates, and timing of landscape evolution in the Channeled Scablands, we analyzed topography, mapped terraces, re-constructed discharges, modeled canyon incision, and dated bedrock surfaces and boulder deposits using cosmogenic nuclides. Many Scablands tracts contain numerous bedrock strath terraces that were abandoned by subsequent flows. Preliminary exposure dating results indicate there are likely a wide range of exposure ages, suggesting that canyon carving in the Channeled Scablands initiated prior to the last-glacial maximum. The results suggest the canyons were progressively carved by a series of temporally distinct floods. The terrace topography and exposure ages hence suggest that last-glacial floods did not completely inundate the canyons, which has key implications for reconstructing the magnitude of outburst flood discharges on Earth and Mars.",

            "abstract": "Many factors drive short- and long-term trends in forest biomass production. Replication at multiple scales, from within individual trees up to continental scales, is necessary to determine factors of growth and at what scale they are most important. Here we report on patterns of biomass production from within and across a micro-network of three forests in the northeastern US. Each forest has different histories and species composition, but each is within a similar climatological setting, which gives insight on important factors of short- and long-term patterns of forest production. One emergent pattern is that two forests are showing a large uptick in production over the last decade. Coincident to this uptick, late-season biomass production is showing a significant increase, even among 150-200+ year old trees. The third forest experienced a severe ice storm in the early-Aughts that paused a three-decade trend of increasing production. In the least diverse forest, the most dominant species drives most of the annual to decadal trend in production. In the most diverse forest, no one species appears to be driving landscape-level production, yet the emergent pattern of production reflects not only drought and pluvial events, but the impact of invasive species and the ice storm. Variation in annual biomass production for most species is strongly related to annual variations in soil moisture. Interestingly at the species level, coherency of growth among yellow birch is lower in the oldest forest in which is it is common versus the youngest forest. Differences in coherency suggest different drivers operating at different scales. Growth of red maple is also driven by moisture, but competition appears to be driving a long-term decline of individuals below the canopy. The decline begins soon after a severe defoliation event. In this same forest, however, significant wetting and warming over the last two decades appears to have reduced some of the climatic constraints on red maple’s annual growth. Our micro-network gives insight to the many potential factors on the long-term development of and biomass production in forests.",

To this end, we project international food trade, as well as its water footprint, under climate and policy scenarios for the year 2030. We use the H08 global hydrologic model to determine the impact of climatic changes to staple crop yields and evapotranspiration. Using the yield changes projected with the H08 model, we estimate the bilateral trade of staple crops using the Global Trade Analysis Project model. We combine these projections to obtain the water footprint of food trade, global network properties, and trade-based water savings across scenarios. Our findings indicate the relative importance of near-future climate and policy scenarios for food trade and its water footprint.",

The poor simulation of in-cloud microphysical properties causes much of this variability due to treating these properties as homogenous. Studies have shown that shortwave albedo of clouds is sensitive to variability of in-cloud liquid water. A method developed by Foster et al., 2011 derives distributions of cloud liquid water path over partially cloudy scenes while conserving the total-scene reflectance. Potential uses of this include generating model validation datasets and facilitating satellite record inter-comparison studies. This study explores another use: identifying and quantifying cloud 3D effects. This methodology has been applied to MODIS AQUA and TERRA satellites for the duration of their records over a selection of ocean regions. Initial findings include, seasonal and geographical patterns in the efficiency of the methods in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic. This study investigates whether areas where the method works best correspond with significant 3D cloud effects. Sensitivity to spatial and temporal variables such as geography, seasonality, cloudiness, viewing geometry, and distributions of cloud microphysical properties is also studied.

            "abstract": "Agricultural nitrogen (N) is a legacy contaminant often found in shallow groundwater systems. This legacy has commonly been observed using well nests (vertical sampling) in recharge areas, but may also be observed by sampling at points in/beneath a streambed using pushable probes along transects across a channel (lateral sampling). We compared results from two different streambed point sampling approaches and from wells in the recharge area to assess whether the different approaches give fundamentally different pictures of (1) the magnitude of N contamination, (2) historic trends in N contamination, and (3) the extent to which denitrification attenuates nitrate transport through the surficial aquifer.\nTwo different arrangements of streambed points (SP) were used to sample groundwater discharging into a coastal plain stream in North Carolina. In July 2012, a 58 m reach was sampled using closely-spaced lateral transects of SP, revealing high average [NO3-] (808 µM, n=39). In March 2013, transects of SP were widely distributed through a 2.7 km reach that contained the 58 m reach and suggested overall lower [NO3-] (210 µM, n=30), possibly due to variation in land use along the longer study reach. Mean [NO3-] from vertical sampling (2 well nests with 3 wells each) was 296 µM. Groundwater apparent ages from SP in the 58 m and 2.7 km reaches suggested lower recharge [NO3-] (observed [NO3-] plus modeled excess N2) in 0-10 year-old water (1250 µM and 525 µM, respectively), compared to higher recharge [NO3-] from 10-30 years ago (about 1600 µM and 900 µM, respectively). In the wells, [NO3-] was highest (835 µM) in groundwater with apparent age of 12-15 years and declined as apparent age increased, a trend that was consistent with SP in the 2.7 km reach. The 58 m reach suggested elevated recharge [NO3-] (>1100 µM) over a 50-year period. Excess N2 from wells suggested that about 62% of nitrate had been removed via denitrification since recharge, versus 51% and 78% from SP in the 58 m and 2.7 km reaches, respectively. Groundwater mean transit times from SP were 26-31 years, similar to preliminary estimates from wells (24 years). The two approaches to streambed point sampling have different strengths and weaknesses compared to vertical sampling in the recharge area, but may be viable alternatives for future assessments of legacy N in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Some soil carbon datasets that are spatially rich, such as the USDA Forest Service Inventory and Analysis National Program dataset, sample soil to only 20 cm (8 inches), despite evidence that substantial stores of soil C can be found deeper in the soil profile. The maximum extent of tree rooting is typically many meters deep and provides: direct exchange with the soil solution; redistribution of water from deep horizons toward the surface during times of drought; resources for active microbial communities in deep soil around root channels; and direct carbon inputs through exudates and root turnover. This study examined soil carbon to a depth of 2.5 meters across 22 soils in Pacific Northwest Douglas-fir forests. Excavations at 20 additional sites took place in summer 2014, greatly expanding the spatial coverage and extent of the data set. Forest floor and mineral soil bulk density samples were collected at depths of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 meters. Pool estimates from systematic sampling depths shallower than 1.5 m yielded significantly smaller estimates than the total soil stock to 2.5 meters (P<0.01). On average, only 5% of soil C was found in the litter layer, 35% was found below 0.5 meter, and 21% was found below 1.0 meter. Due to the difficulty of excavating and measuring deep soil carbon, a series of nonlinear mixed effect models were fit to the data to predict deep soil carbon stocks given sampling to 1.0 meter. A model using an inverse polynomial function predicted soil carbon to 2.5 meters with -5.6% mean error. The largest errors occurred in Andisols with non-crystalline minerals, which can adsorb large quantities of carbon on mineral surfaces and preserve it from decomposition. An accurate spatial dataset of soil depth to bedrock would be extremely useful to constrain models of the vertical distribution of soil carbon. Efforts to represent carbon in spatial models would benefit from considering the vertical distribution of carbon in soil. Sampling deep soil will avoid biased estimates of soil carbon and create a more complete picture of soil pools and changes over time.",

These two science courses will probably be the only sciences courses they’ll take in their college career. What are they looking for in a science course? “Is it easy?” “Will we have fun?” I can try for “fun” but “easy” and “science” seem to be oxymorons. I’ve found that they don’t notice the difficulty when they’re having fun. With this is mind I set out to create a course that would fulfill this requirement but also challenge them to learn science through hands-on, real-life, placed based activities and projects. Beaches and Coasts is essentially a coastal processes course that requires a full term research project along with other hands-on activities. We live on an island (Long Island, NY). The state of our shoreline impacts all of us - something we saw during Superstorm Sandy. Long Island's shorelines vary tremendously. Our north shore is glacially controlled and irregular with many harbors and bays; our south shore is an Atlantic Ocean coastline with many barrier islands and lagoons that contain many inlets and marshes. Many municipalities have small natural beaches along this coastline.\nFor their project students choose a shoreline, with input from the instructor, and take \"ownership\" of it for at least one moon cycle. They collect data on tides, currents, waves, offshore sediment transport and anthropogenic structures and then study the impact of these factors on their section of shoreline. They also collect sediment from their beach to analyze later in the lab. They are given a rubric with the specific requirements and then make a PowerPoint presentation that includes all their data, charts and graphs as well as their photos that they took while doing their research.\nStudents love doing this project. They can’t believe they get credits for going to the beach – something they do anyway (the “fun” factor). They all say that they’ll never go to the beach the same way again. They take their family and friends taking pleasure in teaching them what they’re learning. This course has become so popular that several sections of it run each term and is offered for all three summer sessions and our winterim session (during January break) each section filling almost immediately. At present an online version of this course is being developed.",

            "abstract": "We explore the propagation and structure of 3-D reconnection jets in\nthe Earth's magnetotail using a kinetic model. The finite cross-tail\nextent of the flow burst significantly changes the structure and\nevolution of the jet. Ambient ions reflected from the jet front\nproduce a region of enhanced pressure that deflects the jet in the\ncross-tail direction and dissipates a significant fraction of the bulk\nflow energy. Thus, even subsonic jet fronts are dissipation sites for\nbulk flow energy. Jets that are narrow in the cross-tail direction are\ndeflected dominantly in the direction of the ambient ion drift (dusk\ndirection) while wider jets are deflected in both directions. Mass\nloading of the jet due to ions drifting into the jet from the dawn\nreduce the peak jet velocity below the Walen prediction. The body of\nthe jet does not remain laminar but instead becomes strongly turbulent\nas a result of instabilities growing on the sharp boundaries that\ndevelop on dawn and dusk sides of the jet. Both sheared flow and\nreconnection are drivers of this turbulence. These instabilities cause\nthe reconnection component of the magnetic field Bz to be highly\nvariable on spatial scales of around six ion inertial lengths, which\nis consistent with that inferred from the typically bursty behavior of\nBz in satellite observations of the jet body. Finally, we discuss\nthe mechanisms that control the finite duration of flow bursts in the\nmagnetotail.",

            "abstract": "Despite decades of concerted effort to mitigate nonpoint source nitrate (NO3-) pollution from agricultural lands, these efforts have not been sufficient to arrest eutrophication. A primary process for removing excess NO3- from water is denitrification, where denitrifying bacteria use NO3- for respiration in the absence of oxygen. Denitrification results in reduced forms of nitrogen, often dinitrogen gas (N2) but also nitrous oxide (N2O), an aggressive greenhouse gas. A promising solution to NO3- pollution is to intercept agricultural discharges with denitrifying bioreactors (DNBRs). DNBRs provide conditions ideal for denitrifiers: an anaerobic environment, sufficient organic matter, and excess NO3-. These conditions are also ideal for methanogens, which produce methane (CH4), another harmful trace gas. While initial results from bioreactor studies show that they can cost-effectively remove NO3-, trace gas emissions are an unintended consequence.\nThis study’s goal was to determine how bioreactor design promotes denitrification while limiting trace gas production. Reactor inflow and outflow water samples were tested for nutrients, including NO3-, and dissolved inflow and outflow gas samples were tested for N2O and CH4. NO3- reduction and trace gas production were evaluated at various residence times, pHs, and inflow NO3- concentrations in field and lab-scale reactors. Low NO3- reduction indicated conditions that stressed denitrifying bacteria while high reductions indicated designs that optimized pollutant treatment for water quality. Several factors influenced high N2O, suggesting non-ideal conditions for the final step of complete denitrification. High CH4 emissions pointed to reactor media choice for discouraging methanogens, which may remove competition with denitrifiers. It is critical to understand all of potential impacts that DNBRs may have, which means identifying processes and design specifications that may affect them.",

In spite of various factors, climate variability and vegetation cover change are commonly believed as two major drivers in influencing water resources. This study reviewed the published studies from 160 large watersheds (>500 km2) in the world. Based on the Budyko’s Curve, E0/P (potential evapotranspiration/precipitation) is selected as the indicator for climate variability, while watershed area and vegetation cover change represent the watershed properties. Our meta-data analysis shows that the impacts of land cover change on water can be as important as the influence from climate change. In addition, hydrological sensitivity increases with E0/P (dryness index), which is different from the commonly-held perception (i.e., the sensitivity at E0/P = 1 is the highest). Large watersheds have the ability to buffer the effects of land cover change on water yield. The implications of our results for watershed management are discussed in the context of future climate and land cover changes.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric oxygen plays an important role in the dynamics of Earth’s magnetosphere. During geomagnetic storms, oxygen transported into the tail can experience significant energization and become a major contributor to the storm-time ring current. At very low energies, a dense cold oxygen torus straddles the outer plasmasphere, frequently with O+/H+ ratios approaching unity. With the Radiation Belt Storm Probes we now also observe a third oxygen population in this region. In this paper we discuss the nature of “warm” (10’s eV to few keV, i.e., between plasmasphere and ring current ion energies) oxygen density enhancements over the course of the Van Allen Probes mission. We find that the composition of this warm thermal plasma is very dynamic throughout the inner magnetosphere. The warm oxygen density is highly responsive to changes in geomagnetic activity, varying by more than two orders of magnitude between quiet times and moderate storms. This variation at times is a greater than the variation of the corresponding proton density. The O+/H+ warm plasma density ration will frequently exceed unity, usually during the recovery phase of storms. The region of enhanced warm oxygen density reaches from the plasmasphere boundary out to at least geosynchronous orbit (the largest L-shells covered by the Van Allen Probes). It can be observed at all local times. Barring other geomagnetic activity, warm oxygen density enhancements disappear typically within 5 days of their first detection, which is consistent with drift times through the inner magnetosphere along open drift paths. We are putting these characteristics in context of the composition, location, and evolution of the plasmasphere and the ring current.",

            "abstract": "The National Weather Service lacks a comprehensive compilation of major weather events in Alaska. Creating a repository of the effects of past storms and other extreme weather events on society, together with documentation of the meteorological evolution of the events, will facilitate the NWS and other government agencies to analyze this data. Such analysis will improve their strategies, such as sharpening local and state responses to extreme weather and enhancing forecasts for the events, to create a more weather-ready society in Alaska. This research examines six high-impact weather events in Alaska, ranging in dates from 1974 until 2012. Atmospheric data was gathered from the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)’s 6-Hour National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Data Reanalysis Composites and from 3-Hour NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Composites. Reanalysis composites of sea-level pressure, temperature, geopotential height, and vector wind allowed for the storms to be tracked and for weather pattern anomalies to be recognized. Societal impacts were investigated by using the National Climactic Data Center (NCDC)’s online Storm Events Database and by utilizing microfilms of Alaskan newspapers detailing the events. Synthesizing facts from NCDC and newspapers, along with incorporating meteorological knowledge from the atmospheric reanalysis composites, summaries of the events could then be created. In the future, this research will be continued to include a broader range of high-impact Alaskan weather events. This work will further serve as a basis for analysis for decision-makers to better plan for extreme events and their aftermath. The completed research, though a small portion of the anticipated project, provides a template for future data assimilation, and it initiates the efforts towards a more weather-prepared Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Student engagement increases when they take ownership of data. GeoMapApp (\nhttp://www.geomapapp.org\n) is a free, map-based data discovery and visualisation tool that enables students to manipulate and examine a wide range of geoscience data in a variety of ways. Additionally, a new Save Session function allows educators to preserve a pre-loaded state of GeoMapApp. When shared with a class, the saved file allows every student to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same starting point from which to begin their data explorations. Built-in data sets include those related to land and ocean topography, seafloor spreading and plate tectonics, polar sea ice cover and ocean temperature, geological maps, and sea-level rise. An intuitive user interface allows students to interrogate the research-grade data using simple techniques to help gain meaning from the data. For example, students can readily layer data sets for easy comparison, display tabular data sets in ways that facilitate visual pattern recognition, and shade and contour elevation data to help delineate features on land and the seafloor. Using a simple profiling tool, cross-sections can be generated instantly and saved for future use. In the attached image, high-resolution elevation data for Mount St. Helens reveals the dramatic relief of this famous volcano – the gap in the northern flank is clearly seen in both the map view and the 3-D perspective image, and the cross-section shows the steep flanks forming the crater rim. An import function allows students to quickly bring their own data sets into GeoMapApp. Once imported, all of the same analytical and visualisation functionality that applies to built-in data sets can be used on the students’ own data. A number of guided-inquiry learning modules developed with GeoMapApp are available and help students grapple with fundamental concepts in earth sciences. Examples include a module in which students calculate seafloor spreading rates in different ocean basins using their own profiles, and another module that explores the relationship between geology and landscapes. Examples will be shown.",

Rare eruptions on the Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges and on the Alarcon Rise (northern East Pacific Rise) produce volcanic cones or shields from point sources. Bathymetric maps at 1-m resolution from an autonomous underwater vehicle enabled classification of these ~circular features. The most common are 290-510m across and <50m tall cones with craters or tumulus-like inflated flows on their summits. There are 8 of these on the upper south rift, caldera floor, and southwest caldera rim on Axial Seamount; one on North Cleft segment near the 1986 pillow mounds; and one in the axial graben on northern Endeavour Segment. Hundreds of smaller pillow mounds lack craters or tumulus-like inflated flows at their summits. Three 660-1300m across circular cones have either a crater or an inflated tumulus-like structure at their flat to slightly domed summits. One in the axial graben on the northern Endeavour Segment is dissected by extensional faulting. Cage Seamount on the Coaxial Segment south of the 1993 pillow ridge is the most voluminous at 1100m across and >200m tall. Two flat-topped cones are located near the center of Alarcon Rise. A low-relief shield volcano on the northern Alarcon Rise is ~1700m across and only ~45m tall, and is cut by numerous faults and fissures. Two other shields, 860m and 1700m across and 50-70m tall, occur south of the 1996 North Gorda pillow mounds. These shields are decorated with small pillow mounds. Five 100-250m across and 15-30m deep pits collapsed on the northern shield. These constructional cones and shields form during eruptions where the initial fissure consolidated to a point, indicative of long duration activity. They are constructed during uncommon eruptions with flux larger than produces pillow mounds and smaller than produces sheet flows. They are a submarine equivalent of subaerial shield-building eruptions.",

Rupture propagation, seen by HF emissions, is characterized by initial slow rupture speed (~1.5 km/s, during the first 30 s), with a later acceleration (~2.5 km/s). Source duration is ~100 s.\nWe further study regional accelerometers from the IPOC/CSN and ONEMI networks (Iquique region), using an original detection and backprojection approach, based on high-order statics signal representation. This method allows dealing with the wavefield complexity, at regional scale, related to the extended source duration, and to the local velocity structure. We image coherent radiation sources in the frequency range 0.05 – 0.5 Hz, confirming SE rupture propagation.\nWe finally study in finer detail the initial seconds of the rupture, from the analysis of a small-scale strong motion array and of P-wave polarization at the closest stations.\nThe resulting multi-scale image of the Pisagua rupture is examined in light of the resolved space-time distribution of co-seismic high-frequency sources and fault slip, together with the GPS-derived interface coupling map (Métois et al, 2013), and the rupture areas of fore- and aftershocks. A possible mechanical model of earthquake nucleation and propagation along the offshore-Pisagua segment of the megathrust interface is proposed and discussed.",

These dynamics were a focus of numerous recent studies, which led to the development of the “tidal river” concept. Subtidal oscillations in the “weather” frequency band (periods from a few days to a few weeks) can exhibit similar propagation upstream the river channel, but have so far attracted less attention from researchers. In this work, we analyze data obtained from USGS stream gauge stations at several rivers flowing into the South Atlantic Bight along with NOAA tide gauge stations located on the adjacent coastline. Subtidal free surface oscillations in river channels decay at a slower rate than tidal oscillations (referenced to their amplitude on the coast), while their propagation speed is lower than at tidal frequencies. Potential to kinetic energy ratio sufficiently far upstream in the river channel becomes comparable for tidal and subtidal oscillations, as effects of earth’s rotation become negligible. The results suggest that a coastal storm surge can cause more severe flooding inland along the river channel than tides with comparable coastal amplitude.",

The mapping covers 48-m long and 4-m high walls and the ceiling of the tunnel. A general cryostratigraphic map of the entire tunnel and more detailed maps of several parts of the tunnel were compiled, and ground-ice content was estimated. The tunnel presents features typical of ice-rich syngenetic permafrost (yedoma): ice wedges with a vertical extent of more than 10 m, the prevalence of micro-cryostructures, and the occurrence of large amount of almost undecomposed organic matter. The isotope composition of the Late Pleistocene ice wedges ranges between -28.7‰ and -25.5‰ for δ18O (mean value -27.3‰, n=18), while for the Holocene wedges the range is between -26.5‰ and -21.9‰ (mean value -24.3‰, n=26). Numerous bodies of thermokarst-cave ice and several layers of segregated ice (both of the Late Pleistocene age) were also sampled: δ18O values for thermokarst-cave ice vary from -25.5‰ to -19.3‰ (mean value -23.0‰, n=23), and for layers of segregated ice (ice “belts”) – from -23.4‰ to -21.0‰ (mean value -21.7‰, n=9).\nFive main cryostratigraphic units include (described from the top): (1) active layer, 0.6 to 0.8-m thick; (2) intermediate layer (ice-rich silt, up to 0.6-m thick); (3) yedoma silts reworked by thermokarst and thermal erosion during the Holocene, 3 to 5-m thick, generally ice-poor, with thin ice wedges; (4) Late Pleistocene ice-rich yedoma silts with large ice wedges, 10 to 14-m thick; (5) ice-poor alluvial gravels. Occurrence of the ice-poor deposits in the upper permafrost protects ice-rich yedoma deposits from thermokarst development. These studies revealed significant differences in the cryostratigraphy of the new and old CRREL tunnels: permafrost in the new tunnel has been less affected by erosional events.",

            "abstract": "The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law is not only of fundamental importance in statistical seismology but also a cornerstone of non-linear geophysics and complex-systems science. It states that, in terms of seismic moment M or released energy, the distribution of earthquake sizes is a power law. This has important physical implications, as it suggests an origin from a critical branching process or a self-organized-critical system. However, it presents also some conceptual difficulties, due to the fact that the mean value of M provided by the distribution turns out to be infinite. These elementary considerations imply that the GR law cannot be naively extended to arbitrarily large values of M, and one needs to introduce additional parameters to describe the tail of the distribution, coming presumably from finite-size effects.Main and co-workers have examined the problem of the global earthquake-size distribution including recent data (shallow events only). Using a Bayesian information criterion (BIC), they compare the plain GR law with the so-called tapered GR distribution, and conclude that, although the tapered GR gives a significantly better fit before the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman event, the occurrence of this changes the balance of the BIC statistics, making the GR law more suitable; that is, the power law is more parsimonious, or simply, is enough for describing shallow global seismicity when the recent mega-earthquakes are included in the data.\nWe revisit the problem using distinct statistical tools and considering different parameterizations for the tail. A discussion of results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet have attracted a great deal of attention in the scientific community with respect to their role in seasonal enhancements of ice flow velocities. Large amounts of meltwater generated at the surface can be efficiently delivered to the base of the ice sheet through hydro-fractured pathways beneath supraglacial lakes, potentially increasing basal sliding velocities. Therefore, assessments of surface meltwater volumes stored in and transported from supraglacial lakes to the englacial and subglacial systems are crucial for better coupling models of ice sheet hydrology and dynamics, particularly in response to a warming climate.\nSeveral physically-based and empirical passive remote sensing techniques based on MODIS, ASTER, Landsat measurements have been proposed to derive bathymetric information over supraglacial lakes. While unvalidated, most of the techniques have been calibrated against limited in-situ observations and yet have been applied across large regions of the ablation region. In this study, we investigate the validity of such techniques, specifically developed for MODIS, Landsat and WorldView-2 instruments. To make such an assessment, we calibrate the depth-retrieval models by using water-leaving radiances over lakes captured by a specific sensor early in the melt season, and depth measurements from a high resolution WV-2 DEM over the same lakes when devoid of water. Having applied calibrated models over lakes (validation dataset), we then compare the modeled depths against observations derived from the after-drainage DEM of the area. Our primary study site is located in a portion of the ablation region of the GrIS with its center situated at 67o 18’ N, 48o 55’ W at approximately 1200 m A.S.L[1]. Initial results from the study specifically point to the capability of WV-2 multispectral measurements in calculating lake depths with a high degree of accuracy (bias< 2% of mean depth) and precision (RMSE< 12% of mean depth) and an average volumetric error of 6%. Through analyzing MODIS and Landsat measurements over the same lake region, this work will improve the currently-used techniques by allowing calibration/validation over larger areas and will better quantify the errors and uncertainties in lake storage assessments made thus far.\n\n[1] Above Sea Level",

            "abstract": "The physical architecture of a landscape, as recorded in topography, is a major factor driving the spatial distribution of river habitat within a catchment. For this reason, predictive geomorphic models for fluvial characteristics, particularly grain size, have been suggested as possible contributors to salmonid habitat identification efforts. However, to our knowledge, no work has been done to both implement geomorphic predictions of reach-scale grain size and then test those predictions with salmonid habitat use data. We present a physically-based, empirically calibrated approach to predicting grain size distributions from high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-derived topographic data. This approach builds on previous efforts in that it predicts the full grain size distribution, rather than just median grain size, and incorporates an empirically calibrated shear stress partitioning factor. We use the predicted grain size distributions to calculate the fraction of the bed area movable by salmon of a given size, which we then compare to 7 years of steelhead trout and coho salmon spawning survey data for a 77 km2 watershed along the central California Coast. We find that grain size explains the paucity of spawning in the upper reaches of the drainage, but does not explain variation within the mainstem. In order to explain the residuals in spawning within the mainstem, we turn to the spacing of riffle bedforms. Field surveys of riffle spacing explain 64% of the variation in spawning in these reaches, suggesting that spawning is ultimately limited by the availability of riffles. Because riffle spacing varies systematically with channel width, we show that predicting riffle spacing is feasible with LiDAR data. Taken together, these findings highlight both the value and limitations of a grain-size focused approach to habitat prediction, and suggest that such approaches should be used in concert with predictions of channel bed morphology.",

The water-quality parameters pH, temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), and specific conductance (SC) are measured (15 minute intervals) at continuously pumping supply wells (190 m and 98 m depths), and the data are transmitted by GOES satellite.\nGroundwater is sampled for nitrate (NO3), DBCP (Dibromochloropropane), perchlorate, 222Rn, δD, δ18O, and major ions bimonthly at the wells in an effort to correlate changes in pH, T, DO, and SC with these constituents of interest. NO3, DBCP, 222Rn, and perchlorate were detected above maximum contaminant levels or at elevated concentrations.\nThe first year of data (2013-2014) show mostly constant groundwater quality, including the constituents of interest for both wells. Real-time data, however, also provide information about the sensitivity of the data to external factors. These include interruption in pump operation (turbine pump on and off) due to power disruption or periodic maintenance, which caused notable variability in the DO and SC data. Sonde mounting orientation also affected the data due to bubble accumulation on the probes. These factors must be considered to ensure a robust and accurate temporal record.",

            "abstract": "The paleoceanographic community has measured physical and chemical properties of thousands of sediment cores, in order to reconstruct past oceanic conditions across a wide range of timescales. Most of these datasets were archived in online data repositories in order to facilitate later analysis. However, the diversity of proxy types and heterogeneous reporting standards have hindered the analysis of globally distributed paleoceanographic time series, despite the tremendous potential utility of large datasets. In order for the existing archives of paleoceanographic data to contribute towards important unanswered issues, the datasets must be readily accessible in an organized structure, with an appropriate unified age model for each sediment site.\nHere we present a comprehensive database, built using MATLAB structure, for the most commonly measured proxies in marine sediment cores and surface sediment. These include the concentrations of carbonate, organic matter and opal, density of the sediment, the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of benthic and planktonic foraminifera, sea surface temperature estimates, as well as chronological constrains. The records were downloaded from PANGAEA and NOAA databases and multiple records from the same sediment core were regrouped, allowing age models to be shared between records. The resulting database consists of more than 30,000 sites, facilitating rapid and accurate mapping of sediment composition for selected time periods, and retrieving and plotting time series.\nThe greatest hurdle identified in building a unifi­ed dataproduct of this type is inconsistency in the reporting of depth measurements and chronological information.\nIn our view, standardized reporting practices would greatly assist in developing global quantitative analysis, and requires community-wide action. We propose the development of a unified global sediment core registry, including metadata and chronological information for all marine sediment cores.\nFrom this global database, we calculated changes in sedimentary mass accumulation rates for carbonate and organic carbon over the last deglaciation using hundreds of sediment cores. By comparing these with modern maps of carbonates and organic carbon burial, we evaluated the variations of carbon across the last deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "Change in storage is an important component of water cycle that is often ignored in large-scale hydrologic studies due to limited data and difficulty in measurement. For the first time, this study quantifies and inter-compares storage changes in major river basins of the world. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly mass deviation in storage (MDS) data over 2003-2013 is used to compute monthly, annual and long-term change in storage (ΔS) for 51 major river basins of the world (> 200,000 km2). For each river basin, GRACE ΔS is analyzed to understand a) temporal variability in ΔS b) magnitude of ΔS at annual and decadal time scales and c) duration of storage cycle (time taken by a basin in months to return to initial storage condition). This study identified that 11, 33 and 7 out of 51 basins showed high, medium and low month to month variability in storage changes, respectively. Compared to basin precipitation, 48 out of 51 river basins showed storage to be considerable (5 – 35% of basin annual precipitation). Only 3 basins (Irrawaddy, St. Lawrence, and Brahmaputra) showed minimum variability in storage (< 5%). At long-term (decadal) time-scales, all the 51 river basins showed negligible storage changes (< 0.5%). This result emphasizes the fact that change in storage, ΔS is substantial at monthly and annual time scales but can be ignored over a decadal time scale. Analysis of storage cycle for each basin revealed that a basin can take anywhere from 5 to 12 months to restore itself. While, 14 out of 51 basins showed biannual storage cycle (≤ 6 months), six basins (Zambezi, Mekong, Orinoco, Tocantins, and Amazon) showed annual storage cycle of 12 months. Our results indicate that most basins within the tropics show positive correlation with precipitation indicating that precipitation is the main driver of storage. On the other hand, ΔS in the basins located in the higher latitudes mostly show negative correlation with precipitation. This study provides new insights into how basin storage changes in the major river basins. Future study would focus on the analysis of ΔS over large river basins within the United States. Such analysis and estimates of ΔS would help to (i) improve our knowledge of water availability and (ii) meet the goals of the WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America’s Resources for Tomorrow) project.",

This EWS has provided NRT forest change products to the forest health protection community since 2010, using temporally processed MODIS Aqua and Terra NDVI time series data to currently compute and post 6 different forest change products for CONUS every 8 days. Multiple change products are required to improve detectability and to more fully assess the nature of apparent disturbances. Each type of forest change product reports per pixel percent change in NDVI for a given 24 day interval, comparing current versus a given historical baseline NDVI. EMODIS 7 day expedited and MODIS MOD13 data are used to obtain current and historical NDVIs, respectively. Historical NDVI data is processed with the Time Series Product Tool (TSPT) and the Phenological Parameters Estimation Tool (PPET) software. While each change product employs maximum value compositing (MVC) of NDVI, the design of specific products primarily differs in terms of the historical baseline. The three main change products use either 1, 3, or all previous years of MVC NDVI as a baseline. Another product uses an Adaptive Length Compositing (ALC) version of MVC to derive an alternative current NDVI that is the freshest quality NDVI as opposed to merely the MVC NDVI across a 24 day time frame. The ALC approach can improve detection speed by 8 to 16 days. ForWarn also includes 2 change products that improve detectability of forest disturbances in lieu of climatic fluctuations, especially in the spring and fall. One compares current MVC NDVI to the zonal maximum under the curve NDVI per pheno-region cluster class, considering all previous years in the MODIS record. The other compares current maximum NDVI to the mean of maximum NDVI for all previous MODIS years. The ForWarn EWS includes the US Forest Change Assessment Viewer for viewing NRT forest change products compared to geospatial data on jurisdictional boundaries, historical forest disturbances, drought severity, hydrologic features, elevation, and land cover. This system has been used to detect and monitor regional forest damage from storms, drought, fire, and insects.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere is variable over twenty orders of magnitude in time (≈10-3 to 1017 s) and almost all of the variance is in the spectral “background” which we show can be divided into five scaling regimes: weather, macroweather, climate, macroclimate and megaclimate. We illustrate this with instrumental and paleo data. Based the signs of the fluctuation exponent H, we argue that while the weather is “what you get” (H>0: fluctuations increasing with scale), that it is macroweather (H<0: fluctuations decreasing with scale) – not climate – “that you expect”. The conventional framework that treats the background as close to white noise and focuses on quasi-periodic variability assumes a spectrum that is in error by a factor of a quadrillion (≈ 1015).\nUsing this scaling framework, we can quantify the natural variability, distinguish it from anthropogenic variability, test various statistical hypotheses and make stochastic climate forecasts. For example, we estimate the probability that the warming is simply a giant century long natural fluctuation is less than 1%, most likely less than 0.1% and estimate return periods for natural warming events of different strengths and durations, including the slow down (“pause”) in the warming since 1998. The return period for the pause was found to be 20-50 years i.e. not very unusual; however it immediately follows a 6 year “pre-pause” warming event of almost the same magnitude with a similar return period (30 - 40 years).\nTo improve on these unconditional estimates, we can use scaling models to exploit the long range memory of the climate process to make accurate stochastic forecasts of the climate including the pause. We illustrate stochastic forecasts on monthly and annual scale series of global and northern hemisphere surface temperatures. We obtain forecast skill nearly as high as the theoretical (scaling) predictability limits allow: for example, using hindcasts we find that at 10 year forecast horizons we can still explain ≈ 15% of the anomaly variance. These scaling hindcasts have comparable – or smaller - RMS errors than existing GCM’s. We discuss how these be further improved by going beyond time series forecasts to space-time.",

            "abstract": "Arctic landfast sea ice provides important services to local populations, industry and key marine biota. Such services strongly depend on the stability of the landfast ice cover. While landfast ice may appear stationary to the untrained eye, it is in fact constantly undergoing changes, many of them a result of deformation and movement on scales of meters or less. Such processes, while difficult to detect, are closely linked to important coastal hazards, including the formation of cracks (with potential for flooding or hazardous drainage during the melt season) and catastrophic breakout and complete removal of landfast ice. This study applies synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) in combination with modeling to characterize direction and magnitude of deformation through maximizing coherence between forward models. The model has been tested using ALOS-1 L-band (2010) and ERS-2 C-band (1992) SAR collected over coastal sea ice in northern Alaska. It correctly identifies convergence in the ice cover of coastal lagoons where thermal contraction and tidal forcing are known to be primary causes of ice deformation. Sea ice interferograms are complex and avoiding phase unwrapping leads to more unstable solutions. Therefore areas exposed to higher wind stress and interaction with the offshore pack ice, model results are less definitive and require analysis in terms of plausible forcing mechanisms. Interpretation of InSAR data over landfast sea ice has provided insights into the extent of bottomfast ice. The data also hold promise in evaluating the impact of artificial gravel islands on ice stability and tracking potentially hazardous displacement along ice roads used by industry.",

            "abstract": "The Ili, Syr Dayra and Amu Dayra rivers of Inner Asia are emerging as critical areas for the development of irrigation-based agriculture in the ancient world. Following research by Russian archaeologists in the 1970s it is evident that these watersheds had flourishing riverine civilizations comparable to those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. But unlike these areas where the relationship between Holocene river dynamics, climate change and floodwater farming is increasingly underpinned by radiometric dating, the alluvial archaeology of Inner Asia is significantly under researched. To address this, a major multi-disciplinary research program was begun in 2011 centred on the Talgar catchment, a south-bank tributary of the Ili river, southeast Kazakhstan. Building on archaeological excavations and surveys conducted over the past 20 years, we have undertaken one of the most detailed investigations of Holocene people-river environment interactions in Inner Asia. River development has been reconstructed over the last 20,000 years and human settlement histories from the Eneolithic to the Medieval period documented. Periods of Holocene river aggradation and high water levels in Lake Balkhash and Aral Sea correspond with cooler and wetter neoglacial episodes while river entrenchment and floodplain soil development are associated with warmer and drier conditions. Floodwater farming in the Talgar river reached its acme in the late Iron Age (400-200 cal. BC) with more than 60 settlement sites and 550 burial mounds. This corresponds to a period of reduced flood flows, river stability and glacier retreat in the Tien Shan headwaters. A new hydroclimatic-based model for the spatial and temporal dynamics of floodwater farming in the Ili, Syr Dayra and Amu Dayra watersheds is proposed, which explains the large scale expansion (down-river) and contraction (up-river) of settlements since the first use of irrigation in the Neolithic through to the late Medieval period.",

            "abstract": "The tropical Pacific Ocean has persistently cool sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that last several years to a decade, with either no El Niño events or very few weak El Niño events. These have been shown to cause large-scale droughts in the extratropics\n[i]\n, including the major North American droughts such as the 1930s Dust Bowl, and may also be responsible for modulating the global mean surface temperature\n[ii]\n. Here we show that two models with different levels of complexity – the Zebiak-Cane model and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model version 2.1 – are able to produce such periods in a realistic manner. We then test the predictability of these periods in the Zebiak-Cane model using an ensemble of experiments with perturbed initial states. Our results show that the cool mean state is modestly predictable, while the lack of El Niño events during these cool periods is not. These results have implications for our understanding of the origins of such persistent cool states and the possibility of improving predictions of large-scale droughts.\nFurther, we apply this method of using an ensemble of model simulations with perturbed initial states to make retrospective forecasts and to forecast the mean state of the tropical Pacific Ocean for the upcoming decade. Our results suggest, albeit with low confidence, that the current cool mean state will persist. This could imply the continuation of the drier than normal conditions that have, in general, afflicted southwest North America since the 1997/98 El Niño, as well as the current pause in global warming.\n\n[i]\nC.

            "abstract": "Global virtual water trade is an important research topic that has yielded several interesting insights. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment of virtual water flows within the USA, a country with global importance as a major agricultural producer and trade power. This is the first study of domestic virtual water flows based upon intra-national food flow data and it provides insight into how the properties of virtual water flows vary across scales. We find that both the value and volume of food flows within the USA are roughly equivalent to half that of international flows. However, USA food flows are more water intensive than international food trade, due to the higher fraction of water-intensive meat trade within the USA. The USA virtual water flow network is more social, homogeneous, and equitable than the global virtual water trade network, although it is still not perfectly equitable. Importantly, a core group of U.S. States is central to the network structure, indicating that both domestic and international trade may be vulnerable to disruptive climate or economic shocks in these U.S. States.",

            "abstract": "Gale Crater, in which the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) landed in August 2012, is the most topographically complex area visited to date on Mars. The meteorology within the crater may also be one of the most dynamically complex meteorological environments, because topography is thought to strongly drive the near-surface atmospheric circulations. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on the Curiosity rover consists of a suite of meteorological instruments that measure pressure, temperature (air and ground), wind (speed and direction), relative humidity, and the UV flux. REMS has provided some clues on the nature of the local meteorology strongly influenced by the complex topography, as predicted by numerous previous studies. As with all single station measurements, the meteorological interpretation is typically hindered by a lack of spatial context in which to place the observations. Numerical modeling results, when properly validated against observations, can provide interpretive context. In an effort to better understand the atmospheric circulations of the Gale Crater, the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) was applied to the landing site region using nested grids with a spacing of 330 meters on the innermost grid that is centered over the landing site. MRAMS is ideally suited for this investigation; the model is explicitly designed to simulate Mars’ atmospheric circulations at the mesoscale and smaller with realistic, high resolution surface properties. Simulations with MRAMS indicate thermal and wind thermal signatures associated with slope flows, katabatic winds, and nocturnal mixing events that are consistent with the rover environment monitored by REMS. Of particular note is evidence for two distinct air masses—one in the bottom of the crater (a relatively cold potential temperature air mass) and one on the plateau—that have minimal interaction with one another. If there are indeed two distinct air masses, there are strong implications for dust and water vapor cycling within Gale Crater. The air within Gale should be drier and less dusty due to limited mixing with the environment and limited dust lifting due to dust devils. Observations indicate a meteorological scenario that varies seasonally, and is far more complex than any previously measured surface environment.",

            "abstract": "A recently published study by Sherwood et al. (2014) suggested that convective mixing is a key process that determines the inter-model spread in low cloud feedback and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The parameterized sub-grid scale convective mixing (S) is represented by the temperature and humidity differences between the lower free troposphere, 700 hPa, and the boundary layer, 850 hPa. Although a strong correlation between convective mixing strengths averaged over a deep convective region and ECSs among the models was shown, how convective mixing relates to the distribution and variation of low clouds was not examined in the study. Lower tropospheric stability (LTS, the potential temperature difference between 700 hPa and 1000 hPa) is known to have a strong correlation with low cloud fraction (Klein and Hartmann 1993). How S is related to LTS and whether model simulations of LTS contribute to the model spread in low cloud feedback are of great scientific interest. Combined AIRS and CloudSat/CALIPSO observations along with CMIP5 model simulations are analyzed to address the relationships between S, LTS, and cloud variations in the past decade and in the future climate model projections under the doubling of CO2. The implications for climate sensitivity are explored.",

            "abstract": "The auroral electrojet (AE) index is traditionally calculated from 13 ground magnetometer stations located around the typical northern auroral oval location. Similar coverage in the Southern Hemisphere index (SAE) does not exist, so the AE calculation has only been performed using Northern Hemisphere data. In the present study, we use seven southern auroral region ground magnetometers as well as their conjugate Northern Hemisphere data to calculate conjugate AE indices for 274 days covering all four seasons. With this dataset over 1200 substorm onsets have been identified in the SAE index using the technique of Hsu et al. [2012]. A comparison of the SAE index with the world data center standard AE index shows that the substorm onsets do not always occur at the same time with differences on the order of several minutes. In this study we examine the differences in the onset time and the reason for those differences using our conjugate AE indices and using pairs of conjugate ground magnetometer stations. Specifically, we used the pair of stations at West Antarctica Ice Sheet Divide and Sanikiluaq, Canada and Syowa, Antarctica and Tjörnes, Iceland. The largest differences in onset time appear to be related to the IMF Bz and magnetic field line length. Differences on the order of minutes for the onset time of conjugate substorms have serious implications for substorm theories. The problem is that waves from a current disruption region to the mid tail, or flows from the mid tail to the current disruption region take the same amount of time (~2 minutes), which makes it difficult to decide where the onset disturbance is initiated, particularly when onset indicators have differences on the order of minutes.",

            "abstract": "We analyze gravity and topography of Mars to investigate the spatial variations in crustal thickness, lithospheric strength, and mechanisms of support of prominent topographic features on Mars. The latest gravity model JGMRO110c (released in 2012) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission has a spatial block size resolution of ~97 km (corresponding to degree-110), enabling us to resolve crustal structures at higher spatial resolution than those determined from previous degree-80 and 85 gravity models [Zuber et al., 2000; McGovern et al., 2002, 2004; Neumann et al., 2004; Belleguic et al., 2005]. Using the latest gravity data, we first inverted for a new version of crustal thickness model of Mars assuming homogeneous crust and mantle densities of 2.9 and 3.5 g/cm3. We calculated “isostatic” topography for the Airy local isostatic compensation mechanism, and “non-isostatic” topography after removing the isostatic part. We find that about 92% of the Martian surface is in relatively isostatic state, indicating either relatively small lithospheric strength and/or small vertical loading. Relatively isostatic regions include the hemispheric dichotomy, Hellas and Argyre Planitia, Noachis and Arabia Terra, and Terra Cimmeria. In contrast, regions with significant amount of non-isostatic topography include the Olympus, Ascraeus, Arsia, Pavonis, Alba, and Elysium Mons, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris. Their relatively large “non-isostatc topography” implies relatively strong lithospheric strength and large vertical loading. Spectral analysis of the admittance and correlation relationship between gravity and topography were conducted for the non-isostatic regions using the localized spectra method [Wieczorek and Simons, 2005, 2007] and thin-shell lithospheric flexural approximation [Forsyth, 1985; McGovern et al., 2002, 2004]. The best-fitting models reveal significant variations in the effective lithospheric thickness with the greatest values for the Olympus Mon, Valles Marineris, and Isidis Planitia; reduced values for the Ascraeus, Arsis, and Pavonis Mons; and smallest values for the Alba and Elysium Mons. Our models also suggest that there could be significant sub-surface loading underneath the Olympus, Ascraeus, Arsia, and Pavonis Mons, and Isidis Planitia.",

            "abstract": "Formation of peatlands depends primarily on climate and its interactions with hydrology, soil thermal regimes, plant composition, and nutrients. A water balance with precipitation exceeding evaporation is necessary for their formation. The rate of peat accumulation also greatly depends on thermal resources. The prominent impact of the water balance and temperature on peatland formation is evident in the West Siberia Lowland. The rate of peat accumulation steadily increases from arctic tundra to moss tundra, to forest tundra, to northern taiga, and to southern taiga. This increase is a result in increase in air temperature and length of the growing season because all of these zones have water balance favorable for peat formation. Further to south, evaporation prevails over precipitation and peat formation occurs only in isolated areas.\nClimate change will redefine geographical distribution of climatic and vegetation zones. It is predicted that in arctic and subarctic regions the difference between precipitation and evaporation will increase and as a result these regions will remain favorable to peat accumulation. With increase of thermal resources, the rate of peat accumulation will also increase. The Alaska Arctic Coastal Plain is of a special interest because it has thousands of shallow lakes, which due to warming climate would shift from open waterbodies to peatlands through shoreline paludification and infilling. The accumulation of organic matter will likely turn open water into shore fens and bogs, and eventually to peat plateaus, as is occurring in many boreal landscapes.\nExpected impact on permafrost in arctic and subarctic regions will include rise of the permafrost table, thickening of the ice-rich intermediate layer with ataxitic (suspended) cryostructure, and replacement of frost boils with earth hummocks. In the contemporary continuous permafrost zone, permafrost formed as climate-driven will be transformed into climate-driven ecosystem protected. Sphagnum mosses, which grow better under warm climates, is a dominant factor in this transformation. Terrestrialization of numerous shallow lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska will lower permafrost temperatures beneath them and in surrounding areas.",

Ever since its discovery, numerous interpretations have been proposed to explain the ribbon's existence, with sophisticated models and simulations attempting to explain key characteristics of the ribbon, including its intensity, spatial and spectral structure, and evolution over time. Although the ribbon's origin is still unknown, the leading theory is the so-called \"secondary ENA\" mechanism, in which primary ENAs from inside the heliosphere undergo two charge-exchange events outside the heliopause, producing secondary ENAs which may come back inside the heliosphere and be detected by IBEX. While the leading hypothesis for the generation of the ribbon (\"secondary ENA\" mechanism) appears to explain several key characteristics, modeling efforts are becoming under-constrained by current measurement capabilities. In this talk, I present an analysis of key measurement parameters needed to test and differentiate hypotheses of the ribbon in models and simulations (e.g., spectral range and resolution, angular resolution, and temporal baseline of observations). Understanding these parameters and their importance for identifying and interpreting the physical processes that generate the ribbon are critical for the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP).",

            "abstract": "The Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest natural emitter of reactive trace gases. Due to its dense vegetation (leaf area index > 4), turbulence fluctuations are highly attenuated deep inside the canopy. However, strong coherent eddies that penetrate the upper portion of the canopy can be very effective in transporting gases. Sweeps and ejections act in the order of seconds and transport air parcels into or out of the canopy. The effects of coherent structures on the air parcel residence times and associated chemical processing of reactive gases remain largely unquantified in tropical forests.\nWe combine canopy resolving Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and field observations in the Brazilian Amazon to study residence times of air parcels in the rainforest as a function of canopy structure and height (h). Good agreement is obtained between simulated and observed turbulence statistics within and above the forest. Coherent structure properties obtained from quadrant analysis are also well reproduced. A Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm is used to quantify the distribution of residence times of air parcels “released” at different heights.\nCanopy residence times were determined from the particle trajectories. The resulting probability density function (PDF) strongly depended on the particle release height (z). For particles released in the upper canopy (at z/h=0.75) the most frequent residence times were in the order of 30s, with 50% of all particles ejected from the canopy after ~2 minutes. The mean residence time was close to 5 minutes, indicating a very skewed PDF. At z/h=0.25 the PDF was more evenly distributed with its median and mean in the order of ~10 minutes. Due to sweeps, both simulations had a non- negligible fraction of particles transported deep into the canopy, thus increasing greatly their residence times. As the reaction timescales of many biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are in the order of seconds to minutes, significant chemical processing can take place before particles are transported out of the canopy. This result highlights the importance of coherent motions on the capability of BVOC to escape the canopy space. Hence, it is important to consider the real distribution of residence times, highlighting the need for accurate canopy representation in LES models.",

            "abstract": "We examine the ability of satellite-based measurements of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 to help explain the variability in atmospheric CO2 observations over North America. This work presents the first application where remotely sensed SIF measurements have been incorporated into a CO2 flux inversion. We utilize a geostatistical inverse modelling (GIM) framework to examine if SIF provides additional information over traditional vegetation indices in explaining the spatiotemporal patterns of CO2 flux, and if so, what is the influence of SIF on the resulting flux estimates. Results show that at the 16 day scale, SIF offers substantial information, beyond that of Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), for constraining inverse-modeling estimates of CO2 flux. Inverse-modeling estimates of CO­2 flux that incorporate SIF show an increase in CO2 uptake in the midwest US (temperate savanna, grasslands, and cropland) and a reduction in uptake in Canada (boreal forests) and the pacific northwest US (temperate coniferous forests) with differences occurring primarily during the peak of the growing season. These results confirm previous results from site-level studies showing an apparent increase in estimated GPP over U.S. cropland regions when using SIF to inform estimates. Additionally, this work highlights the utility of combining satellite measurements of SIF with atmospheric CO2 observations to improve our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "As a part of a joint undertaking by Environmental Defense Fund and the Fair Climate Network, we have measured reduction in methane and nitrous oxide emissions due to alternate “low carbon” rice cultivation practices for three ago-ecological zones in India for the past two years. Sampling for nitrous oxide and methane emissions was done on approximately 60-80% of the total number of days in a growing season and was based on modified GRACEnet protocol. In recognition of farmer’s economic interest and global food security demands, we also measured the effect of rice cultivation practices on farm economics and yields.\nOur data from three agro-ecological zones for 2012-2014 suggest that, for semi-arid peninsular India, low-carbon rice cultivation practices offer large range of emission reduction potential (0.5-5 metric tons CO2e/acre/year). The regions with sandy soils (Alfisols) had high rates of nitrous oxide emissions even under baseline “flooded” rice cultivation regimes and, thus, the Tier 1 IPCC emissions factors grossly underestimate both the amount of nitrous oxide emission from conventional rice cultivation practices, and the extent to which it can be reduced through better fertilizer management. Also, the IPCC factors overestimate the methane emission reduction possible due to water management for rice paddies. Therefore, it is crucial to customize N and water management to each region such that yields and net GHG emission reduction are maximized. These practices also have the potential to decrease water use by 10-30% and improve long term soil health by optimizing organic matter and increasing water-holding capacity.\nIn addition, through GPS based demarcation of farmer plots, recording baseline practices through extensive surveys, documenting the parameters required to aggregate and prove implementation of low carbon rice farming practices, and to model the GHG emission reduction over large scales, we have put forward a path for better monetization of GHG emission reductions which will incentivize adoption of such practices. The payoff is a “triple win” including increased long-term food security (through enhanced yields), rural economic development (through improved farm profitability and adaptation), and lower environmental impacts (including lower GHG emissions).",

            "abstract": "To address widespread arsenic contamination of drinking water sources numerous technologies have been developed to remove arsenic. All technologies result in the production of an arsenic-bearing waste that must be evaluated and disposed in a manner to limit the potential for environmental release and human exposure. One disposal option that is commonly recommended for areas without access to landfills is the mixing of arsenic-bearing wastes with cow dung. These recommendations are made based on the ability of microorganisms to create volatile arsenic species (including mono-, di-, and tri-methylarsine gases) to be diluted in the atmosphere. However, most studies of environmental microbial communities have found only a small fraction (<0.1 %) of the total arsenic present in soils or rice paddies is released via volatilization. Additionally, past studies often have not monitored arsenic release in the aqueous phase. Two main pathways for microbial arsenic volatilization are known and include methylation of arsenic during methanogenesis and methylation by arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase. In this study, we compare the roles of these two pathways in arsenic volatilization and aqueous mobilization through mesocosm experiments with cow dung and arsenic-bearing wastes produced during drinking water treatment in West Bengal, India. Arsenic in gaseous, aqueous, and solid phases was measured. Consistent with previous reports, less than 0.02% of the total arsenic present was volatilized. A much higher amount (~5%) of the total arsenic was mobilized into the liquid phase. Through the application of molecular tools, including 16S rRNA sequencing and quantification of gene transcripts involved in methanogenesis, this study links microbial community activity with arsenic fate in potential disposal environments. These results illustrate that disposal of arsenic-bearing wastes by mixing with cow dung does not achieve its end goal of promoting arsenic volatilization but rather appears to increase arsenic mobilization in the aqueous phase, raising concerns with this approach.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between cumulative fault displacement, slip rate and length, along with fault population statistics are analyzed for faults located within the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ), focusing on areas north of the Garlock fault. Here many faults are geologically young and in an early stage of evolution, while many older and larger faults are also still active. We analyze scaling relationships for both strike-slip and normal faults in order to determine whether the two fault populations share the same properties or not. Cumulative displacement, slip rate and length data are collected from published maps and literature sources. The dataset spans fault lengths from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers. Results of fault scaling analyses indicate that displacement has a linear relationship with fault length for normal faults in this area over the entire length span, whereas strike-slip faults do not have a clear displacement-length scaling relation. For a given length, the subset of strike-slip faults typically exhibits a much larger displacement than that for the normal faults. The slip rate versus length trends are similar but are considerably more scattered. In addition, we define a subpopulation of normal faults that are kinematically related to the right-lateral strike-slip faults; these have a maximum length set by the spacing between the right-lateral faults. Fault size-frequency distributions also indicate differences between the normal and strike-slip fault populations. Overall, the normal faults have higher ratios of cumulative number to fault length than the strike-slip population does, which we relate to different patterns of localization of faulting. We interpret these trends as reflecting different tectonic histories, with the majority of normal faults being intraplate faults associated with Basin and Range extension and the strike-slip faults being kinematically connected with plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "Climate is changing rapidly in southwestern North America during the Spring season, a critically important transition season in terms of hydrology, ecosystem dynamics, and water resource management. Major rivers are snow-fed in mountainous headwaters but then flow through a monsoonal region with a Summer precipitation maximum; Spring is the dry season in between snowmelt and monsoon onset and is the principal wildfire season in the Southwest. Evaporation during the warm, dry Spring represents a major hydrologic loss in the surface water budget and is a principal cause of projections of significant decreases in post-snowmelt streamflow, during the first half of the growing season when demand for surface water for irrigated agriculture is highest. As temperatures increase, snowpack is expected to decrease and melt earlier, leading to a smaller and earlier peak in snowmelt runoff. Recent climate model projections suggest that monsoon onset should occur later in the year, delaying the summer rainy season. Each of these effects contributes to projections of a lengthening Spring season, at both the beginning and end of Spring. A longer, warmer Spring season is associated with significant surface drying and increased wildfire risk in the 21st Century across the Southwest. So far changes are observed at the beginning of spring in terms of temperature (increasing) and snowpack (decreasing). Detection of other changes, including metrics of the end of spring, has not been easy, in part due to the huge natural variability of precipitation that affects hydrologic variables in conjunction with temperature. This presentation describes efforts to diagnose and document observed changes in the transitions into and out of the Spring dry season in the Southwest, in variables such as temperature, snowmelt date, timing and magnitude of streamflow, and monsoon onset date.",

            "abstract": "Considerable debate has recently taken place concerning the origin of the inner and outer ejecta layers of double layered ejecta (DLE) craters on Mars. For craters in the diameter range ~10 to ~25 km, the inner ejecta layer of DLE craters displays characteristic grooves extending from the rim crest, and has led investigators to propose three hypotheses for their formation: (1) deposition of the primary ejecta and subsequent surface scouring by either atmospheric vortices or a base surge; (2) emplacement through a landslide of the near-rim crest ejecta; and (3) instabilities (similar to Gortler vortices) generated by high flow-rate, and high granular temperatures. Critical to resolving between these models is the topographic expression of both the ejecta layer and the groove geometry. To address this problem, we have made several digital elevation models (DEMs) from CTX and HiRISE stereo pairs using the Ames Stereo Pipeline at scales of 24 m/pixel and 1 m/pixel, respectively. These DEMs allow several key observations to be made that bear directly upon the origin of the grooves associated with DLE craters: (1) Grooves formed on the sloping ejecta layer surfaces right up to the preserved crater rim; (2) There is clear evidence that grooves traverse the topographic boundary between the inner and outer ejecta layers; and (3) There are at least two different sets of radial grooves, with smaller grooves imprinted upon the larger grooves. There are “deep-wide” grooves that have a width of ~200 m and a depth of ~10 m, and there are “shallow-narrow” grooves with a width of <50 m and depth <5 m. These two scales of grooves are not consistent with their formation analogous to a landslide. Two different sets of grooves would imply that, simultaneously, two different depths to the flow would have to exist if the grooves were formed by shear within the flow, something that is not physically possible. All three observations can only be consistent with a model of groove formation by scouring of the ejecta surface after the layers were emplaced. However, it is apparent that unique characteristics exist at many different DLE craters; thus the need to generate additional DEMs to investigate local slopes, ejecta volumes, and heights of obstacles that have either diverted or been over-topped, is of continuing importance",

            "abstract": "We use dynamic prescribed slip (kinematic) modeling to examine the factors contributing to multi-segment rupture in the 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake. We consider fault geometry and slip distributions from inversions by Beavan et al. (2012) based on geodetic observations and by Elliott et al. (2012) based on geodetic and teleseismic observations. We invert for subevent origin times using strong-motion records and find complex rupture propagation across multiple fault segments. Our inversions suggest that the rupture began on one or two secondary faults with reverse/oblique slip near the hypocenter, consistent with the GNS first motion mechanism. The primary bilateral strike-slip rupture of the Greendale fault, consistent with centroid moment tensor solutions, occurred about 9-10 seconds after the origin time. The strong-motion records provide poor constraints on the timing of rupture of the reverse Hororata fault, which may have occurred about 16-17 seconds after the origin time. Denser strong-motion instrumentation would have provided stronger constraints on the timing of the complex rupture. The relative orientation of the regional stress field and the faulting regime explain the sense of motion and loading of these fault segments. Additionally, dynamic stress changes also created favorable conditions for triggering of the main rupture on the Greendale fault. Current work focuses on evaluating how well the UCERF3 (USGS Open File Report 2013-1165) criteria for forecasting multi-segment ruptures in California apply to this complex rupture in New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "With increasing risk of dangerous climate change geoengineering solutions to Earth’s climate problems have attracted much attention. One proposed geoengineering approach considers the use of ocean pipes as a means to increase ocean carbon uptake and the storage of thermal energy in the deep ocean. We use a latest generation Earth System Model (ESM) to perform simulations of idealised extreme implementations of ocean pipes. In our simulations, downward transport of thermal energy by ocean pipes strongly cools the near surface atmosphere – by up to 11°C on a global mean. The ocean pipes cause net thermal energy to be transported from the terrestrial environment to the deep ocean while increasing the global net transport of water to land. By cooling the ocean surface more than the land, ocean pipes tend to promote a monsoonal-type circulation, resulting in increased water vapour transport to land. Throughout their implementation, ocean pipes prevent energy from escaping to space, increasing the amount of energy stored in Earth’s climate system despite reductions in surface temperature. As a consequence, our results indicate that an abrupt termination of ocean pipes could cause dramatic increases in surface temperatures beyond that which would have been obtained had ocean pipes not been implemented.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen isotope (δ15N) measurements from core samples taken from unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs may provide important information on depositional environment, reservoir characterization, and post-depositional processes. In order to evaluate the potential of nitrogen isotopes as geochemical proxies for resource evaluation, we measured δ15Nbulk values for six Woodford Shale (Late Devonian-Early Mississippian) cores and three Caney Shale (Early Mississippian) cores and compared the profiles with other geochemical, lithological, maturation, and well-log data. The strongest correlation is between δ15Nbulk and redox-sensitive trace metals and other redox proxies, as predicted by previous research into δ15Nbulk values. This indicates that δ15Nbulk can be used in unconventional reservoirs as a proxy for depositional redox conditions. Unlike other redox proxies, δ15Nbulk reflects the redox state of the deep-water column, rather than that of the deposited sediment, providing a representation of water column processes during deposition. The δ15Nbulk proxy also appears not to be overprinted by catagenic processes. Associations of δ15Nbulk with thermal maturity, gamma ray response, and catagenesis and diagenesis proxies were found to be minimal. The δ15Nbulk profiles do not appear to be overprinted during catagenesis and therefore are not a reliable record of post-depositional processes. Including nitrogen isotope analyses in a geochemical assessment can provide valuable information about the original redox state of the reservoir unit, and assist in characterizing depositional environment.",

            "abstract": "The ability to investigate landscape and vegetation from airborne instruments offers many advantages, including high resolution data, ability to deploy instruments over a specific area, and repeat measurements. The Alaska Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration (ACUASI) has recently integrated a hyperspectral imaging camera onto their Ptarmigan hexacopter. The Rikola Hyperspectral Camera manufactured by VTT and Rikola, Ltd. is capable of obtaining data within the 400-950 nm range with an accuracy of ~1 nm. Using the compact flash on the UAV limits the maximum number of channels to 24 this summer. The camera uses a single frame to sequentially record the spectral bands of interest in a 37° field-of-view. Because the camera collects data as single frames it takes a finite amount of time to compile the complete spectral. Although each frame takes only 5 nanoseconds, co-registration of frames is still required. The hovering ability of the hexacopter helps eliminate frame shift. GPS records data for incorporation into a larger dataset. Conservatively, the Ptarmigan can fly at an altitude of 400 feet, for 15 minutes, and 7000 feet away from the operator. The airborne hyperspectral instrument will be extremely useful to scientists as a platform that can provide data on-request. Since the spectral range of the camera is ideal for the study of vegetation, this study 1) examines seasonal changes of vegetation of the Fairbanks area, 2) ground-truths satellite measurements, and 3) ties vegetation conditions around a weather tower to the tower readings. Through this proof of concept, ACUASI provides a means for scientists to request the most up-to-date and location-specific data for their field sites. Additionally, the resolution of the airborne instruments is much higher than that of satellite data, these may be readily tasked, and they have the advantage over manned flights in terms of manpower and cost.",

            "abstract": "The chemical variability of chondrule volatile element contents provide a wealth of information on the processes that shaped the early solar system and its compositional heterogeneity. An essential observation is that chondrule melts contain very low alkalies and other volatile elements (e.g., Cl). The reason for this depletion is the combined effects of cooling rates (10 to 1000K/h), the small size of chondrules, and their high melting temperatures (~1700 to 2100 K) resulting in extensive loss of volatiles at canonical pressures (e.g., 10-4bar). However, we observe some chondrules with significant concentrations of volatiles (Na, Cl), that differ markedly from chondrules dominated by refractory elements. Could such heterogeneity arise from loss of alkalis and Cl to a gas phase that itself later condenses, thereby yielding variations in volatile enrichments in chondrules? Does Cl enhance volatility of the alkalis to varying extents?\nExperiments on Cl-bearing and Cl-free melts of equivalent composition for 10 min, 4 h, and 6 h reveal systematic effects of Cl on alkali volatility. Cl-bearing melts lose 48% of initial Na2O, 66% of K2O, 96% of Cl within the first 10 minutes of degassing. Then the amount of alkali loss decreases due to the absence of Cl. Cl-free melts loses only 15% of initial Na2O and 33% K2O. After 4 hours, melts lose 1/3 of initial Na2O and 1/2 of K2O. For both systems, Na2O is more compatible in the melt relative to K2O. Therefore, the vapor given off has a K/Na ratio higher than the melt through time in spite of the much higher initial Na abundance in the melt. Enhanced vaporization of alkalis from Cl-bearing melt suggests that Na and K evaporate more readily as volatile chlorides than as monatomic gases. Cl-free initial melts with normative plagioclase of An50Ab44Or6 evolved into slightly normal zoned ones (An49Ab50Or1) while Cl-bearing initial melts normative to albitic plagioclase (An46Ab50Or4) evolved to reverse zoned ones (An54Ab45Or1). The vapor phase over Cl-bearing chondrule melts may have a bimodal character over time. The heteregeneous volatile contents of chondrules may result from quenching of melt droplets at different stages of repeated heating, chondrule fragment recycling, and recondensation of exsolved volatiles.",

We review both the successes and limitations of resilience metrics in the framework of dynamical systems and their generalization in the framework of the viability theory. We then point out that the most important step to achieve is to define resilience across scales instead of doing it at a given scale.\nOur preliminary, critical analysis of the series of attempts to define an operational resilience metrics led us to consider a scale invariant metrics based on the scale independent codimension of extreme singularities. Multifractal downscaling of climate scenarios can be considered as a first illustration. We focussed on a flood scenario evaluation method with the help of two singularities γ_s and γ_Max, corresponding respectively to an effective and a probable maximum singularity, that yield an innovative framework to address the issues of flood resilience systems in a scale independent manner.\nIndeed, the stationarity of the universal multifractal parameters would result into a rather stable value of probable maximum singularity γ_s. By fixing the limit of acceptability for a maximum flood water depth at a given scale, with a corresponding singularity, we effectively fix the threshold of the probable maximum singularity γ_s as a criterion of the flood resilience we accept. Then various scenarios of flood resilient measures could be simulated with the help of Multi-Hydro under upcoming climat scenarios. The scenarios that result in estimates of either γ_Max or γ_s below the pre-selected γ_s value will assure the effective flood resilience of the whole modeled system across scales.\nThe research for this work was supported, in part, by the EU FP7 SMARTesT and INTERREG IVB RainGain projects.",

We placed broadband seismometers on each arch and recorded up to three hours of ambient seismic data. Identified spectral peaks are interpreted to represent resonant frequencies of the arches, and further studied for their polarization attributes. We developed 3D models of each site using ground-based photogrammetry in order to perform numerical modal analyses. Assigning representative material properties, we are able to match the measured fundamental frequency of each arch, as well as certain higher-order resonant frequencies. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in North America and is remarkably slender, while Double-O Arch is a prominent visitor attraction. Repeat ambient vibration measurements over time will be used to assess changes in resonance characteristics, which in turn provide evidence of internal mechanical change. Our goal is to understand how the arches respond to their environment, and ultimately be able to assess progressive damage of these iconic features.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations on the Fraser Delta slope (British Columbia, Canada) confirm that unconfined turbidity currents occur on the delta slope close to the mouth of the main river channel. However the conditions that trigger these events are not understood. This study attempts to characterize the triggering conditions using data from the Delta Dynamics Laboratory (DDL), part of the VENUS Coastal Network in the Ocean Networks Canada Observatory, collected over four years. Data collection focused on the freshet season (May-July), a period believed to have the highest occurrence of submarine sediment density flows due to a high river discharge from snow melt combined with high tidal excursions resuspending bottom sediment. ADCP backscatter profiles reveal sediment settling through the water column from the river plume to the delta slope during ebb tide when the salt wedge is likely pushed out of the river channel and into the basin. Combined with measurements of tidal excursions and Fraser River discharge, quantitative measurements of the sediment settling process were analyzed on a daily and seasonal time scale. It is found that while sediment settling events occur throughout the entire year, the most intense and longest duration events occur on a higher frequency during the freshet season. In addition, the intensity of the ADCP backscatter has a strong positive correlation with the height of the major tide each day. This suggests that the tidal excursion has a larger direct control on the near bottom sediment concentration the delta slope than the river discharge. Continuous data collection is able to capture a clearer picture of the conditions in which submarine sediment density flows are created. From this, the aim is to produce more accurate predictions of when and where the flows will occur. With this information, improved geohazard monitoring on delta slopes can be achieved.",

            "abstract": "The processes governing the accumulation and melt of seasonal snowcovers in large open areas and under continuous forest canopies are well understood, however our understanding of spatiotemporal variations in snowcover processes in discontinuous forests is limited. The objective of this study was to quantify the snowcover mass and energy-balance dynamics across a canopy discontinuity and from a valley bottom to hilltop location to improved the understanding of hydrologic fluxes in complex terrain. Energy balance components were calculated using both the mass and energy balance snowmelt model (SNOBAL) and the 1-dimensional Simultaneous Heat and Water Balance (SHAW) Model, driven with micrometeorological from 7 contrasting sites. Results indicate that the canopy gap accumulated 52% more snow water equivalent (SWE) than the forest canopy sites. Net energy flux in the gap was approximately half of the open location and twice the sub-canopy locations. Net radiation was highest at the north and center points of the gap, smallest at the south point in the gap, and intermediate at the forested locations. Net turbulent (sensible and latent) energy fluxes were typically small positive values in the gap, and slightly negative in the forest, due to cold-air drainage and low wind speeds at all valley bottom sites, and colder air temperatures at the forested sites. Soil heat flux was a relatively minor component of the energy balance at the gap sites, but was surprisingly large at the forested sites due to relatively warm soil temperatures and slightly cooler snow temperatures. A sensitivity study, multi-model comparison, and comparison to other similar studies suggests that the computed spatiotemporal fluxes are reasonable for this specific site. The combination of mass and net energy flux differences between the open and gap sites resulted in the open site melting out 60 days prior to the south gap site. The mass and energy flux differences similarly resulted in the forested sites melting out 15 days prior to south gap site. This work demonstrates that distinctive micrometeorological conditions occur in both discontinuous canopies and in valley bottom locations that can produce large spatiotemporal variations in peak SWE and ablation timing.",

            "abstract": "Wells have in numerous scientific works been denoted the \"weak link\" of safe and cost-efficient CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS). Whether they are active or abandoned, all wells are man-made intrusions into the storage reservoir with sealing abilities depending on degradable materials like steel and cement. If dense CO2 is allowed to expand (e.g. due to leakage) it will cool down its surroundings and cause strong thermal and mechanical loading on the wellbore. In addition, CO2 reacts chemically with rock, cement and steel. To ensure long-term underground containment, it is therefore necessary to study how, why, where and when leakage occurs along CO2wells.\nIf cement bonding to rock or casing is poor, leak paths can form already during drilling and completion of the well. In the present work, we have mapped the bonding quality of cement-rock and cement-steel interfaces – and measured their resistance towards CO2 flow. This involved a large experimental matrix including different rocks, steels, cement types and well fluids. The bonding qualities were measured on composite cores using micro computed tomography (µ-CT), and CO2 was flooded through the samples to determine leakage rates. These were further compared to numerical simulations of leakage through the digitalized µ-CT core data, and CO2chemical interactions with the materials were mapped using electron microscopy. We also present a new laboratory set-up for measuring how well integrity is affected by downhole temperature variations – and we showcase some initial results.\nOur work concludes that leak path development in CO2 wells depends critically on the drilling fluids and presflushes/spacers chosen already during drilling and completion of a well. Fluid films residing on rock and casing surfaces strongly degrade the quality of cement bonding. The operation of the well is also important, as even slight thermal cycling (between 10°C and 95°C on casing) leads to significant de-bonding of the annular cement.",

In the case of the Pine Point lead zinc deposits, the time of genesis has been assumed to have happened from the Middle Devonian age to the Tertiary age. It is generally said that, based on isotope data, the ore forming fluid there must have been hydrothermal in a temperature range of 100 °C or more. The average homogenized temperature in fluid inclusions in dolomite in the Pine Point area has been reported to be 116 °C and the burial temperature at about 70 °C.\nIn the course of a former joint industry/governmental research project on regional and local groundwater flow, water chemistry, and water isotopes, all available regional and local geological and mineral data for exploration bore holes were collected. The massive body of these data indicated that in the Pine Point region, the present groundwater flow systems and their respective chemistry would support the continuous formation of ore bodies from glacial times to the present day. This body of data provides strong indications that the interplay of today’s groundwater flow systems, their chemistry, and the associated microbiological activity may currently be forming MVT ore bodies and mineral showings even at low non-hydrothermal temperatures in the range of 3 °C. Upon abandonment of Pine Point Mines this suspicion was supported by the occurrence of a ‘black smoker’ discharging from a flowing hole near one of the formerly mined ore bodies (Figure 1).\nAt Pine Point, MVT ore bodies are positioned within karstic rocks at the intersection of two active and very substantial groundwater flow systems. In one of these systems, groundwater carries sulphate, while the other, upwelling one, also carries NaCl and metals. At the ore bodies, microbiological populations of sulfur-reducing bacteria are present and participate in forming conditions for ore precipitation.\nFigure 1. ‘Black smoker’ at a flowing borehole near an mined-out ore body at the abandoned Pine Point mines.

            "abstract": "The Abbot Ice Shelf extends 450 km along the coast of West Antarctica between 103°W and 89°W and straddles the boundary between the Bellingshausen Sea continental margin, which overlies a former subduction zone, and Amundsen Sea rifted continental margin. Inversion of NASA Operation IceBridge airborne gravity data for sub-ice bathymetry shows that the western part of the ice shelf, as well as Cosgrove Ice Shelf to the south, are underlain by a series of east-west trending rift basins. The eastern boundary of the rifted terrain coincides with the eastern boundary of rifting between Antarctica and Zealandia and the rifts formed during the early stages of this rifting. Extension in these rifts is minor as rifting quickly jumped north of Thurston Island. The southern boundary of the Cosgrove Rift is aligned with the southern boundary of a sedimentary basin under the Amundsen Embayment continental shelf to the west, also formed by Antarctica-Zealandia rifting. The shelf basin has an extension factor, β, of 1.5 - 1.7 with 80 -100 km of extension occurring in an area now ~250 km wide. Following this extension early in the rifting process, rifting centered to the north of the present shelf edge and proceeded to continental rupture. Since then, the Amundsen Embayment continental shelf has been tectonically quiescent and has primarily been shaped though subsidence, sedimentation and the passage of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet back and forth across it. The former Bellingshausen Plate was located seaward of the Amundsen Sea margin prior to its incorporation into the Antarctic Plate at ~62 Ma. During the latter part of its existence, Bellingshausen plate motion had a clockwise rotational component relative to Antarctica producing convergence between the Bellingshausen and Antarctic plates east of 102°W. Seismic reflection and gravity data show that this convergence is expressed by an area of intensely deformed sediments beneath the continental slope from 102°W to 95°W and by incipient subduction beneath the Bellingshausen Gravity Anomaly on the western edge of a salient of the Antarctic plate near 94°W. West of 102°W, relative motion was extensional and occurred in a diffuse zone occupied by the Marie Byrd Seamounts that are dated at 65-56 Ma and extend 800 km along the continental margin near the base of the continental rise.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones cause more financial distress to insurance companies than any other natural disaster. From 1970-2002, it is estimated that hurricanes caused 44 billion dollars in damage, greater than 2.5 times the the next costliest catastrophe. Theses damages do not go without effect. A string of major catastrophes from 1991-1994 caused nine property firms to bankrupt and caused serious financial strain on others. The public was not only affected by the loss of life and property, but the increase in tax dollars for disaster relief. Providing better seasonal predictions of North Atlantic hurricane activity farther in advance will help alleviate some of the financial strains these major catastrophes put on the nation.\nA statistical model was first developed by Bill Gray’s team to predict the total number of hurricanes over the North Atlantic in 1984, followed by other statistical methods, dynamic modeling, and hybrid methods in recent years. However, all these methods showed little to no skill with forecasts made by June 1 in recent years. In contrast to the relatively small year-to-year change in seasonal hurricane numbers pre-1980, there has been much greater interannual changes since, especially since the year 2000. For instance, while there were very high hurricane numbers in 2005 and 2010, 2013 was one of the lowest in history.\nRecognizing these interdecadal changes in the dispersion of hurricane numbers, we have developed a new statistical model to more realistically predict (by June 1 each year) the seasonal hurricane number over the North Atlantic. It is based on the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) conditioned by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index, the zonal wind stress and sea surface temperature over the Atlantic. It provides both the deterministic number and the range of hurricane numbers. The details of the model and its performance from 1950-2014 in comparison with other methods will be presented in our presentation.",

            "abstract": "Mathematical-model reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD) has been shown to be an effective method for reducing the computer runtime of linear and nonlinear groundwater-flow models without sacrificing accuracy. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is an alternate method of model reduction better suited for nonlinear systems. In this research, both methods are applied simultaneously to reduce the dimensionality of a 3-D unconfined groundwater-flow model: SVD to reduce the column space and DEIM to reduce the row space. The results of the dimensional reduction can approach several orders of magnitude, resulting in significantly faster simulation runtimes. The implementation and benefit of SVD/DEIM model reduction is demonstrated through its application to a synthetic, groundwater-flow and solute-transport model with groundwater extraction wells that influence of seawater intrusion. The developed methodology identifies the dominant locations (i.e. the discrete points) of the model that have the most influence on the water levels and saltwater concentrations. The result is a reduced model constructed from fewer equations (row dimension) and is projected into a reduced subspace (column dimension). The methodology first independently constructs the reduced flow and transport models such that their errors are minimized for a flow-only model and transport-only model, respectively. Once the two reduced models have been established, a density-dependent flow simulation is preformed by iterating between the flow and transport models for each time step. Further analysis of the SVD/DEIM method illustrates the tradeoff between magnitude of the reduced dimension and corresponding errors in model output, with respect to the unreduced and independently reduced models. The application of this method shows that runtime can be significantly decreased for models of this type while still maintaining control of desired model accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Southern California is predicted to face decreasing precipitation with increased interannual variability in the coming century. Native shrublands in this area are increasingly invaded by exotic annual grasses, though invasion dynamics can vary by rainfall scenario, with wet years generally associated with high invasion pressure. Interplay between rainfall and invasion scenarios can influence carbon stocks and community composition. Here we asked how invasion alters ecosystem and community responses in drought versus high rainfall scenarios, as quantified by community identity, biomass production, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). To do this, we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment with paired plots dominated either by native shrubs or exotic herbaceous species, subjected to treatments of 50%, 100%, or 150% of ambient rainfall. The study site was located in a coastal sage scrub ecosystem, with patches dominated by native shrubs and exotic grasses located in San Diego County, USA.\nDuring two growing seasons, we found that native, herbaceous biomass production was significantly affected by rainfall treatment (p<0.05 for both years), though was not affected by dominant community composition. Photosynthetic biomass production of shrub species also varied by treatment (p=0.035). Exotic biomass production showed a significant interaction between dominant community composition and rainfall treatment, and both individual effects (p<0.001 for all). NDVI showed similar results, but also indicated the importance of rainfall timing on overall biomass production between years. Community composition data showed certain species, of both native and exotic identities, segregating by treatment. These results indicate that exotic species are more sensitive to rainfall, and that increased rainfall may promote greater carbon storage in annual dominated communities when compared to shrub dominated communities in high rainfall years, but with drought, this trend is reversed.",

            "abstract": "Iron exerts a major control on element cycling in soils by serving as a prominent sorbent (principally when present as an oxide phase) and as an electron acceptor (in the ferric-form) or donor (ferrous-form) in both chemical and microbially-mediated reactions. Within the aggregated structure of soils, steep chemical gradients arise from the supply of oxygen and nutrients along macropores that are rapidly consumed (relative to supply) within the micropore domains of aggregate interiors. As a consequence, iron undergoes a dynamic biogeochemical cycle whereby ferric (hydr)oxides form within aggregate exteriors while ferrous-iron generation dominates within interior regions. Further, inter-aggregate cycling of iron can transpire through the supply of electron donors and acceptors, linked with diffusive controlled response to gradients. Coupling to iron transformation are the varying retention of adsorptives such as lead and phosphorus and the redox alterations of elements from nitrogen to uranium. Nitrate, for example, diffusing into aggregate interiors encounters ferrous-iron fronts where the ensuring oxidation of Fe(II)-coupled to nitrate reduction transpires. The outcome of aggregate-scale iron transformations, described within this presentation, is fundamental controls on the cycling of redox active elements from nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen to contaminants such arsenic and uranium.",

            "abstract": "Although tree mortality induced by episodic drought events has been extensively reported in the literature, investigation of drought-induced tree mortality in the context of long-term plant-water relations and in the continuum of hydraulic adaptation strategies of plant species has been rare. Yet such investigation can lead to in-depth understanding of tree mortality mechanisms and predictive models. Using decade-long continuous observations of tree mortality and plant water status at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, we studied characteristics of precipitation regimes that drove drought-induced tree mortality of half a dozen of tree species with different hydraulic adaptation strategies. We found that water availability determined inter-annual variations in tree mortality with a one-year time delay. The Predawn Leaf Water Potential Integral (PLWPI) and the Mean Non-Exceedance Interval (time periods with no daily precipitation rates exceeding a threshold) with a daily threshold precipitation at 5 mm day-1 (MNEI5) of the growing season were strong predictors of the following year’s mortality of species as well as plant community as a whole. The mean daily precipitation rate and the Precipitation Variability Index (PVI) individually were also good predictors of tree mortality caused by severe drought but must be used jointly to predict tree mortality caused by intermediate water stress. The PLWPI-mortality relationship was monotonic for the same species and the plant community as a whole. But it was non-monotonic across species such that species with extreme (lowest or highest) values in the continuum of PLWPI suffered higher mortality than species with intermediate values of PLWPI. This finding reconciles contradictory reports in previous studies regarding the effects of hydraulic adaptation strategies on tree mortality across species.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of total column water vapor can be made by ground-based GPS receivers in all weather conditions. Over the world’s oceans, total column water vapor can also be retrieved from measurements made by satellite-borne microwave imaging radiometers, such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). We have analyzed the satellite vapor retrievals in the vicinity of small, isolated islands that host one or more GPS stations that can be processed to produce water vapor measurements. The analysis shows that, in general, there is very good agreement between the two very different types of measurements, with the RMS difference between individual measurements typically less than 1.5 mm and no evidence for system-wide difference in water vapor trends. A more detailed look at the comparison data reveals small inconsistencies. In many cases, we can assign the cause of these to either the GPS station, or the satellite data, by comparing results from different satellites and/or different stations. For example, a discontinuity seen in the GPS/satellite differences for a given station that is similar for a number of different satellites can be assigned to the GPS station. In another example, a comparison of GPS data with an earlier version of the satellite data allowed us to correct a small bias in the satellite retrievals for high values of total column vapor. Because of the high quality of both the GPS and microwave satellite measurements, the results of GPS/satellite intercomparisons are extremely valuable both as a validation tool and a source of information for future improvements.",

            "abstract": "Eddy covariance techniques were used to quantify understory contributions to carbon and energy balances, and to evaluate the environmental responses of the overstory and understory at a black spruce forest in interior Alaska. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), sensible heat flux (H), and latent heat flux (LE) were estimated for the ecosystem (subscripted by ‘eco’), canopy (subscripted by ‘cano’) and forest floor (subscripted by ‘floor’) based on canopy gap fraction and footprint analyses for 3 years, 2011 - 2013. Fluxes per unit land surface area of black spruce overstory (subscripted by ‘b’) and that of understory (subscripted by ‘u’) were also evaluated their ecophysiological responses to micrometeorological environments. Overall, NEPfloor, GPPfloor, REfloor and LEfloor represented 60 (37, growing season in parenthesis) %, 47 (51) %, 47 (54) %, and 75 (76) % of NEPeco, GPPeco, REeco, and LEeco, respectively with the average canopy gap fraction of 0.52 (± 0.073 SD). The year, 2013 was characterized by high air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during the growing season. The high temperature and VPD particularly reduced understory NEP and their growth inferred by low green excessive index (GEI), which was correlated to GPPu more strongly than GPPb. LEu linearly increased with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) whereas LEb was insensitive to VPD. Future warming and drying expected in the boreal forest will increase understory evapotranspiration disproportionately to that of black spruce and likely decrease the production of the current understory community.\nAcknowledgments This study was supported by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the JAMSTEC-IARC Collaboration Study, with funding provided by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) to the International Arctic Research Center (IARC).

In this study, fixed-film bioreactor experiments, in situ microcosms, and microbial analyses were utilized to evaluate both anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation processes for tri- and dichlorobenzene isomers, monochlorobenzene, and benzene in a wetland. Biofilm-based bioreactors provide a robust assessment tool because of their typically high degree of stability, even with major and repeated perturbations. Two bioreactor units seeded with an anaerobic dechlorinating consortium (WBC-2) and one unit seeded only with bacteria indigenous to the site were operated under flow-through conditions to compare biougmentation and natural attenuation. Electron donor levels were varied to fluctuate between anaerobic and aerobic conditions, and inflow concentrations of total chlorobenzenes were transitioned from 1-10 mg/L to 50-100 mg/L. Biodegradation resulted in removal efficiencies of 80 to 99 percent for the different compounds and inflow concentrations. Degradation efficiency in the native bioreactor was not impacted by cycling between anaerobic and aerobic conditions, although removal rates for monochlorobenzene and benzene increased under aerobic conditions.\nIn situ microcosms were incubated below the wetland surface in sets of 3 treatments—unamended, biostimulated (lactate addition), and bioaugmented (WBC-2 and lactate). Additional treatment sets contained 13C-labeled contaminants to monitor for production of 13C-containing carbon dioxide and cellular material. Microcosm results verified that WBC-2 bioaugmentation can enhance biodegradation, with complete mineralization of chlorobenzene and benzene in bioaugmented and native treatments. Microbial analyses using QuantArrayTM for functional and taxonomic genes indicated potential for co-occurrence of anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation. Compared to the unamended in situ microcosms, the WBC-2 microcosm contained two to five orders of magnitude higher quantities of targeted microbial populations that are associated with degradation of chlorinated and petroleum compounds through both anaerobic and aerobic pathways.",

While there are a number of elements common to the guidelines proposed, not surprisingly, there are also some significant differences among them and, in a number of cases, important considerations that are not addressed. The goal of this work is to develop a comprehensive protocol for site characterization based on a rigorous scientific understanding of the responsible processes. Topics addressed will include the geologic setting (emphasizing faults that might be affected), historical seismicity, hydraulic characterization of injection and adjacent intervals, geomechanical characterization to identify potentially active faults, plans for seismic monitoring and reporting, plans for monitoring and reporting injection (pressure, volumes, and rates), other factors contributing to risk (potentially affected population centers, structures, and facilities), and implementing a modified Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA). The guidelines will be risk based and adaptable, rather than prescriptive, for a proposed activity and region of interest. They will be goal oriented and will rely, to the degree possible, on established best practice procedures, referring to existing procedures and recommendations. By developing a risk-based site characterization protocol, we hope to contribute to the development of rational and effective measures for reducing the risk posed by activities that potentially trigger earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "This study aims at comparing the performances of Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) methods in assessing landslide susceptibility for multiple-occurrence regional landslide events within the Mediterranean region. A test area was selected in the north-eastern sector of Sicily (southern Italy), corresponding to the catchments of the Briga and the Giampilieri streams both stretching for few kilometres from the Peloritan ridge (eastern Sicily, Italy) to the Ionian sea. This area was struck on the 1st October 2009 by an extreme climatic event resulting in thousands of rapid shallow landslides, mainly of debris flows and debris avalanches types involving the weathered layer of a low to high grade metamorphic bedrock.\nExploiting the same set of predictors and the 2009 landslide archive, BLR- and BRT-based susceptibility models were obtained for the two catchments separately, adopting a random partition (RP) technique for validation; besides, the models trained in one of the two catchments (Briga) were tested in predicting the landslide distribution in the other (Giampilieri), adopting a spatial partition (SP) based validation procedure. All the validation procedures were based on multi-folds tests so to evaluate and compare the reliability of the fitting, the prediction skill, the coherence in the predictor selection and the precision of the susceptibility estimates.\nAll the obtained models for the two methods produced very high predictive performances, with a general congruence between BLR and BRT in the predictor importance. In particular, the research highlighted that BRT-models reached a higher prediction performance with respect to BLR-models, for RP based modelling, whilst for the SP-based models the difference in predictive skills between the two methods dropped drastically, converging to an analogous excellent performance. However, when looking at the precision of the probability estimates, BLR demonstrated to produce more robust models in terms of selected predictors and coefficients, as well as of dispersion of the estimated probabilities around the mean value for each mapped pixel.\nThe difference in the behaviour could be interpreted as the result of overfitting effects, which heavily affect decision tree classification more than logistic regression techniques.",

            "abstract": "The volcanoes of the Cascade Range pose a legitimate threat to people living in the Pacific Northwest. Mt St Helens, which erupted in 2004 as a part of a dome building event, is a notable example of this danger. Deformation and seismicity are known indicators of volcanic activity and can provide warning of an imminent eruption. In the weeks leading up to the 2004 eruption, a shallow earthquake swarm was detected under St. Helens, suggesting ongoing deformation with its source beneath the edifice. A campaign GPS survey conducted in 2000 found no evidence of deformation. The sole continuous GPS station that was operational prior to the eruption (located ~9 km away from the crater) began moving only with the onset of the earthquake swarm.\nBecause of the lack of ground based geodetic instruments in the near-field of Mt St Helens at the time of the 2004 eruption, it is unknown whether pre-eruptive deformation occurred on the edifice or solely within crater. InSAR is the only method available to conclusively determine whether the 2004 eruption was preceded by deformation of the edifice. Previous work explored this question using standard 2-pass interferometry, but the results were inconclusive. The main obstacle to implementing InSAR methods in the Cascades region is phase decorrelation due to the presence of both dense forest and snow for most of the year. We revisit the available InSAR data for St. Helens by experimenting with the application of the Persistent Scatterers and Distributed Scatterers processing techniques in order to overcome the decorrelation problem. By using these techniques on the question of Mt St Helens pre-eruptive deformation, we will demonstrate the viability of their application to the entire Northwest region as a low cost, low maintenance, monitoring tool.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover areal depletion curves were used in a continuous daily hydrologic model to simulate seasonal spring snowmelt during the period between maximum snowpack accumulation and total melt. The curves are defined as the ratio of snow-water equivalence (SWE) divided by the seasonal maximum snow-water equivalence (Ai) (Y axis) versus the percent snow cover area (SCA) (X axis). The slope of the curve can vary depending on local watershed conditions. Windy sparsely vegetated high elevation watersheds, for example, can have a steeper slope than lower elevation forested watersheds. To improve the accuracy of simulated runoff at ungaged watersheds, individual snow cover areal depletion curves were created for over 100,000 hydrologic response units (HRU) in the continental scale U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrologic Model (NHM). NHM includes the same components of the USGS Precipitation-Runoff-Modeling System (PRMS), except it uses consistent land surface characterization and model parameterization across the U.S. continent. Weighted-mean daily time series of 1-kilometer gridded SWE, from Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS), and 500-meter gridded SCA, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), for 2003-2014 were computed for each HRU using the USGS Geo Data Portal. Using a screening process, pairs of SWE/Ai and SCA from the snowmelt period of each year were selected. SCA values derived from imagery that did not have any cloud cover and were >0 and <100 percent were selected. Unrealistically low and high SCA values that were paired with high and low SWE/Ai ratios, respectively, were removed. Second order polynomial equations were then fit to the remaining pairs of SWE/Ai and SCA to create a unique curve for each HRU. Simulations comparing these new curves with an existing single default curve in NHM will be made to determine if there are significant improvements in runoff.",

The sensor was launched on June 10, 2011 as part of the Aquarius/SAC-D mission and has been collecting data since August 25, 2011. Version 3 of the data product was released in June 2014 and provides a major milestone towards reaching the mission requirement of 0.2 psu.\nThis presentation reports the status of the Aquarius salinity retrieval algorithm highlighting the advances that have been made for and since the Version 3 release. The most important ones are:\n1) An improved surface roughness correction that is based on Aquarius scatterometer observations;\n2) A reduction in ascending/descending differences due to galactic background radiation reflected from the ocean surface; 3) A refinement of the quality control flags and masks that indicate degradation under certain environmental conditions. The Aquarius salinity algorithm also retrieves wind speed as part of the roughness correction with an accuracy comparable to the products from other satellites such as WindSat, SSMIS, ASCAT, and QuikSCAT.\nValidation of the salinity retrievals is accomplished using measurements from ARGO drifters measuring at 5 m depth and in the tropics also from moored buoys measuring at 1 m depth which are co-located with the nearest Aquarius footprint. In the most recent work an effort has also been made to identify areas with frequent rain to isolate potential issues with rain freshening in the upper ocean layer. Results in rain-free regions indicate that on monthly basis and 150 km grid, the V3 Aquarius salinity maps have an accuracy of about 0.13 psu in the tropics and 0.22 psu globally. Comparing Aquarius with ARGO and moored buoy salinity measurements during and after rain events permits a quantitative assessment of the effect of salinity stratification within the first 5 m of the upper ocean layer.",

            "abstract": "Most extreme precipitation events that occur along the North American west coast are associated with narrow plumes of above-average water vapor concentration that stretch from the tropics or subtropics to the West Coast. These events generally occur during the wet season (October-March) and are referred to as atmospheric rivers (AR). ARs can cause major river management problems, damage from flooding or landslides, and loss of life.\nIt is expected that anthropogenic global warming could lead to thermodynamic and dynamic changes in the atmosphere, such as increases in water vapor content and, thus, precipitation, and shifts in the climatological jet stream. Since AR events are associated with extreme values of integrated water vapor (IWV) near the West Coast, increases in IWV could impact the intensity of AR events intersecting the coast. Additionally, ARs are associated with cyclonic activity that originates near and propagates along the jet stream. The jet stream configuration influences the frequency and location of AR landfall along the North American west coast. It is probable that any changes in the general circulation of the atmosphere will result in changes in the frequency, orientation, and location of AR landfalls.\nGlobal climate models have sufficient resolution to simulate synoptic features associated with AR events, such as high values of vertically integrated vapor transport (IVT) approaching the coast. Ten Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations are used to identify changes in ARs impacting the west coast of North America between historical (1970-1999) and end-of-century (2070-2099) runs, using representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. The most extreme ARs are identified in both time periods by the 99th percentile of IVT days along a north-south transect offshore of the coast. Integrated water vapor (IWV) and IVT are predicted to increase, while lower-tropospheric winds change little. Winter-mean precipitation along the West Coast increases by 11-18% (4-6% C-1) while precipitation on extreme IVT days increases by 15-39% (5-19% C-1). The frequency of IVT days above the historical 99th percentile threshold increases as much as 290% by the end of this century.",

In addition, I'll talk about two open source systems we are building to \"jailbreak\" the core technology of relational databases and adapt them for use in science. The first is SQLShare, a Database-as-a-Service system supporting collaborative data analysis and exchange by reducing database use to an Upload-Query-Share workflow with no installation, schema design, or configuration required. The second is Myria, a service that supports much larger scale data, complex analytics, and supports multiple back end systems.

To this end, we are building Myria, a web-based platform for scalable analytics and data-parallel programming. Myria's internal model of computation is the relational algebra extended with iteration, such that every program is inherently data-parallel, just as every query in a database is inherently data-parallel. But unlike databases, iteration is a first class concept, allowing us to express machine learning tasks, graph traversal tasks, and more. Programs can be expressed in a number of languages and can be executed on a number of execution environments, but we emphasize a particular language called MyriaL that supports both imperative and declarative styles and a particular execution engine called MyriaX that uses an in-memory column-oriented representation and asynchronous iteration. We deliver Myria over the web as a service, providing an editor, performance analysis tools, and catalog browsing features in a single environment. We find that this web-based \"delivery vector\" is critical in reaching non-experts: they are insulated from irrelevant effort technical work associated with installation, configuration, and resource management. The MyriaX backend, one of several execution runtimes we support, is a main-memory, column-oriented, RDBMS-on-the-worker system that supports cyclic data flows as a first-class citizen and has been shown to outperform competitive systems on 100-machine cluster sizes.

            "abstract": "Recent tomographic models show that while many slabs seem to deflect or stagnate at the 660 km discontinuity, some slabs continue to subduct deeper and pond at 1000 km below the earth's surface (Fukao and Obayashi, 2013). Only one slab is observed to penetrate significantly deeper into the mantle. Furthermore, some mantle upwellings also appear to be deflected at 1000 km in depth. The radial correlation functions for the low-order spherical harmonics of most tomographic inversions show that while seismic wave velocities are correlated for all depths below ~1000 km, velocities at depths between 400–1000 km are uncorrelated with velocities at any other depth. This implies that there are large scale velocity features coherent from 1000 km to the core-mantle boundary, but no large scale features coherent from the top of the transition zone down to 1000 km. Seismic studies using precursors and receiver functions find evidence for numerous reflectors in the mid-mantle, ranging from 900 km in depth beneath the southern Pacific and southeast Asia to 1200 km beneath Europe and Japan. This range of depths could indicate topography along a single laterally continuous discontinuity or result from multiple unconnected features. Some reflectors are geographically near, and therefore may be associated with, subducted slabs, however the origin of the others is unclear. The 1000 km 'discontinuity' could potentially be explained by an increase in viscosity or density, such as a compositional difference in the mantle below this depth.\nWe use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the diversity in apparent slab stagnation behavior and which geophysical mechanisms prevent subduction into the lower mantle. The controlling factor may be a function of the slab itself, including subduction rate, trench rollback, composition, or temperature. Alternatively, bulk mantle properties may control slab penetration. We perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations to determine the influence of viscosity on stab stagnation and flow. We also explore the influence of a density jump at 1000 km. Finally, we generate theoretical seismograms for various velocity and density jumps in the mid mantle, and compare to seismic observations.

We include the effects of the decomposition, ionization, and charge exchange of major ion species around the comet in the model.

Second, we simulate the real-time response of the Mars magnetosphere in the comet tail using a multi-fluid model of Mars.

            "abstract": "Though western Oregon and Washington summers are typically mild due to the influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean, this region occasionally experiences heat waves with temperatures in excess of 35ºC. These heat waves can have a substantial impact on this highly populated region, particularly since the population is unaccustomed to and generally unprepared for such conditions. A comprehensive evaluation is needed of past and future heat wave trends in frequency, intensity, and duration. Furthermore, it is important to understand the physical mechanisms of Northwest heat waves and how such mechanisms might change under anthropogenic global warming.\nLower-tropospheric heat waves over the west coast of North America are the result of both synoptic and mesoscale factors, the latter requiring high-resolution models (roughly 12-15 km grid spacing) to simulate. Synoptic factors include large-scale warming due to horizontal advection and subsidence, as well as reductions in large-scale cloudiness. An important mesoscale factor is the occurrence of offshore (easterly) flow, resulting in an adiabatically warmed continental air mass spreading over the western lowlands rather than the more usual cool, marine air influence. To fully understand how heat waves will change under AGW, it is necessary to determine the combined impacts of both synoptic and mesoscale effects in a warming world. General Circulation Models (GCM) are generally are too coarse to simulate mesoscale effects realistically and thus may provide unreliable estimates of the frequency and magnitudes of West Coast heat waves. Therefore, to determine the regional implications of global warming, this work made use of long-term, high-resolution WRF simulations, at 36- and 12-km resolution, produced by dynamically downscaling GCM grids.\nThis talk will examine the predicted trends in Pacific Northwest heat wave intensity, duration, and frequency during the 21st century (through 2100). The spatial distribution in the trends in heat waves, and the variability of these trends at different resolutions and among different models will also be described. Finally, changes in the synoptic and mesoscale configurations that drive Pacific Northwest heat waves and the modulating effects of local terrain and land/water contrast will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In the Canadian Arctic shelf and upper slope, the thermal disturbance caused by sea level rise at the end of the last glacial period, is still propagating into the subsurface and heating shelf sediments, where submerged terrestrial permafrost and gas hydrate, and marine gas hydrate occur in close proximity. Studies conducted on the Canadian sector of the Beaufort Sea shelf and slope show evidence of gas venting in three distinct environments: in Pingo-Like-Features (PLF) on the mid-shelf, along the shelf edge, and in ~1 km wide circular topographic highs in 290, 420 and 790 m water depths on the continental slope. The chemical and stable isotopic composition of fluids found in these environments and in background sediments where determined on pore waters obtained from piston and gravity cores. Isotopic and major ion chemistry results from the shelf and shelf edge indicate downcore mixing between seawater and a freshwater end-member with a Mackenzie River-like composition. In contrast, water from the PLFs display an isotopic composition to the left of the Local Meteroric Water Line (LMWL) suggesting a source different from current surface and ground waters found onshore. Waters from sediments of the slope topographic highs are isotopically and chemically evolved: They display different degrees of mixing between seawater and a Na-Cl-HCO3 type brackish component, plotting to the right of the LMWL, and possibly reflect extensive interaction with clays. Pore waters collected in background sediments of the slope down to 750 m, also show freshening downcore, but as opposed to the topographic highs found at the same water depths, their isotopic composition indicate the contribution of a Mackenzie River-type fresh water end-member. Overall, results presented here indicate that the shelf and slope of the Beaufort sea experience vertical fluid advection, but the sources of these waters are different: The background shelf and slope show influence of freshwater similar to the present meteoric water, the topographic highs in the slope probably tap a much deeper source with waters that experienced a large degree of chemical evolution, and the PLFs in the mid shelf have isotopic characteristics that may suggest meteoric water that precipitated under different climatic conditions from the present.",

            "abstract": "Highlights of the UVIS investigation on Cassini include the discovery of a neutral oxygen cloud surrounding Saturn and the determination that Saturn’s magnetosphere is dominated by neutrals. Later, UVIS observed and measured the cause of these phenomena: that the icy moon Enceladus is erupting water molecules at about 200kg/sec from fissures in its south polar terrain. These eruptions also carry a fraction of small solid ice grains that are sufficient to produce Saturn’s ethereal E ring. The morphology of the jets of vapor in the Enceladus plume imply supersonic flow velocities that loft the grains carried in the jets, consistent with theoretical models. UV occultations and spectroscopy define the constituents of Titan’s upper atmosphere and explain its dayside and nightside emissions. UVIS sees Saturn's auroral oval evolve and has detected Enceladus' footprint. Self-Gravity Wakes in Saturn’s rings were detected by comparing ring occultations with Voyager results and with multiple Cassini UVIS occultations at a range of viewing aspects. We developed a simple ‘granola-bar model’ to explain our observations and the azimuthal brightness asymmetry observed from the Earth and previous space missions. UVIS has detected numerous small structures in the rings: kittens, propellers and other embedded objects. Some are as small as meters across from UVIS ‘tracking’ occultations. Features preferentially form where the rings are stirred by resonances and nearby passing moons. This more active ring system seen by Cassini may explain bright haloes in the rings; how the ring system can recycle ring material so that the rings are much older than inferred from Voyager; and provide implications of how planets may form. Future observations will provide the best resolution on active features like edges of the rings, ring haloes and propeller bands.",

            "abstract": "Natural fractures provide fluid flow pathways in otherwise low permeability reservoirs. These fractures are usually lined or completely filled with mineral cements. The presence of these cements causes very rough fracture walls that can constrict flow and hinder the connectivity between the fracture and matrix/fracture pores thereby reducing porosity and permeability.\nIn order to accurately predict fluid transport in unconventional reservoirs, we study the influence of diagenesis, numerical cement and fracture roughness on flow in three different fractures: a carbonate outcrop from the Niobrara formation; and two distinct sandstones, from a core from the Travis Peak and an outcrop from the Torridonian. We use x-ray microtomography imaging to provide information on fracture geometry. Image analysis and characterization of the connectivity and geometric tortuosity of the pore space and individual fluid phases at different saturations, is performed via ImageJ and 3DMA Rock software. We also use a combination of the level-set-method-based progressive-quasistatic algorithm (LSMPQS software), and lattice Boltzmann simulation (Palabos software) to characterize the capillary dominated displacement properties, absolute permeability and relative permeability of the naturally cemented fractures within. In addition, we numerically investigate the effect of (uniform) cementation on the fracture permeability as well as the tortuosity of the pore space and the capillary pressure-water saturation (Pc-Sw) relationship in the Niobrara. Finally, we create 3D prints of the fractures for visualization purposes.\nPermeability estimates in the studied fractures vary by several orders of magnitude when computed with the different correlations that currently exist in the literature. The presence of cements increases the geometric tortuosity of the pore space and capillary pressure while reducing the permeability. Contrary to our expectation, the tortuosity of the wetting and non-wetting phases and their respective relative permeabilities show no clear correlation.",

Multifractals has become a standard tool to analyze and simulate this key phenomenon for scalar fields. However, fields of interest, e.g. the velocity and the magnetic fields are vector fields. Some time ago, \"Lie cascades\" were introduced to deal with such fields by considering exponentiation from a stochastic element of a Lie algebra to its corresponding Lie group of transformations. The concerned transformation corresponds to the fine graining/downscaling of the field to higher and higher resolution. Unfortunately, developments were paused due to the possible large number of degrees of freedom of the latter, in particular with respect to the information that can be easily extracted from a d-dimensional vector field. In short, some physics was missing.\nIn this communication, we point out the interest of the Clifford algebra Clp,q to make concrete progress. Ironically, these algebra were mentioned at once as rather straightforward generalizations of the scalar complex cascades, but they were not investigated. On the contrary, the particular case of the \"pseudo-quaternions\" l(2,R)=Cl2,0=Cl1,1 has been often used to generate generalized scales to analyse and simulate anistropic scaling (scalar) fields. The latter is in fact illustrative of the basic property of the Clifford algebra $Cl_{p,q}$ to be generated by a quadratic form $Q$ whose signature ($p,q$) is fundamental.",

This study shows that the lack of coupling does not undermine AGCM’s ability to simulate global and regional anthropogenic climate change. A comparison between coupled and AGCM simulations shows that anthropogenic climate change can be well reproduced by AGCM and errors due to lack of coupling are only related to internal variability. These results are confirmed using a stochastic linear model. Furthermore, in association with a previous study which showed that atmospheric circulation and precipitation over land are insensitive to the pattern of future SST change, we found that anthropogenic climate change over land can be well simulated with AGCM forced with only radiative forcing and a uniform warming. This result shows that ocean model is not necessary for simulations of future land climate change.",

The size of these objects are on the order of the plasma kinetic scales, lying beyond the validity of magnetohydrodynamics, and therefore constitute unique “laboratories” to investigate the role of kinetic effects in magnetosphere formation/dynamics.\nIn this work we investigate the conditions under which collisionless magnetized shocks are formed due to plasma interaction with such small-scale (order of the plasma kinetic scales) magnetic obstacles. We have performed multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, that capture both electron and ion kinetics from first principles, in order to accurately describe the important microphysical processes associated with these scenarios. We observe the clear formation of a magnetized shock when the typical size of the magnetic obstacle is greater than ~ 2 ion-Larmor-radii. This condition may be fulfilled in lunar minimagnetospheres, whose dimensions are on the order of the ion inertial length, only for low Mach number shocks (<2). The effective size of the magnetic obstacle, however, is strongly dependent on the relative orientation of its own field to that of the plasma; antiparallel field configurations increase the effective size of the magnetic obstacle, allowing the clear formation of a shock, whereas in parallel field configurations the effective size of the magnetic obstacle is decreased, inhibiting shock formation in some cases. PIC simulations further capture electron-scale surface instabilities that modulate the magnetopause boundary and other streaming instabilities resulting from the interaction between the upstream and reflected plasma.",

The degree to which this ancient C is diffusing as CO2 into the modern atmosphere during winter is a key climate feedback uncertainty today. Quantifying the magnitude and patterns of these ancient CO2 emission are critical as we begin to fully understand how, as a consequences of climate changes, these emissions might increase even further, accelerating the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and thus global temperatures. In order to do so, we measured fall and winter ecosystem respiration, soil pore space CO2 concentrations and bulk soil C at different depths along with their radiocarbon (14C) contents under ambient and experimentally manipulated deeper snow conditions in mesic tundra of Svalbard, in Adventdalen. Abiotic parameters such as air and soil temperature and water content were continuously monitored for the entire study period.\nOur findings reveal that: a) soils in these landscapes have permafrost that is up to 25,000 years old at 1.5 m depth; b) in late fall, once plants are dormant, CO2 emissions are dominated by ancient C with older values under deeper snow conditions c) that respiration rates are higher in winter under deeper snow, due to soils being up to 8oC warmer than ambient conditions; d) winter emissions of respired CO2 are dominated by ancient C at all times with effect of snow depth. For the first time our results show that ancient C, previously disconnected from the C cycle, is continuously emitted into the atmosphere during the long High Arctic winter. This new biosphere-atmosphere C cycle interaction may accelerate over time as permafrost active layers continue to deepen, increasing the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, further distributing global temperatures and leading to subsequent changes in the Arctic and global climates. Our findings are integrated into a synthetic High Arctic annual cycle model of the ages and rates of CO2 emissions from the northerly most landscapes on earth.",

            "abstract": "Constraining moment deficit rates on crustal faults using geodetic data is currently an under-utilized but powerful method for estimating the potential seismic hazard presented by crustal faults. Two previous approaches to moment-bounding, bootstrapping and Metropolis-Hastings sampling, can both fail catastrophically when estimating the probability distribution of moment given data, p(Mo|d). Straightforward application of traditional Metropolis-Hastings sampling with uniform prior probabilities on slip leads to a mesh-dependent estimate of moment with a variance inversely related to the number of model elements. Moment thus estimated exhibits an “effective prior” on p(MO) that tends toward a delta function halfway between the bounds as the fault discretization becomes finer! Thus, it is incorrect to estimate the uncertainty in moment directly from the uncertainty in slip. Bootstrapping can produce optimistic bounds and give biased results. A third approach is functional moment bounding (FMB), which obtains bounds on moment by minimizing the data misfit over slip for all possible values of Mo and accepting only those values with a total misfit less than some threshold. We present a modified version of this method that creates a probability distribution function on Mo from the misfit and uses this pdf to obtain confidence bounds. We also present a fourth method that we term Probabilistic Moment Bounding (PMB) that we derive within a Bayesian framework and incorporate a smoothed slip prior. Both of these approaches produce conservative results and do not exhibit mesh dependence. We compare the results from FMB and PMB to those obtained from other methods and assess the results.",

            "abstract": "To address how natural disturbance, forest harvest, and deforestation from reservoir creation affect landscape-level carbon (C) budgets, a retrospective C budget for the 8500 ha Sooke watershed from 1911 - 2012 was developed using historic spatial inventory and disturbance data. Data was input to a spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model-Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), an inventory-based C budget model used to simulate forest C dynamics at multiple scales. In 1911 the watershed was dominated by mature/old Douglas-fir forests with aboveground biomass C (ABC) of 262 Mg C/ha and net ecosystem production (NEP) of 0.63 Mg C/ha/yr. Land was cleared around Sooke Lake, a dam built and lake expanded from 370 to 450 ha in 1915, 610 ha in 1970, 670 ha in 1980 and 810 ha in 2002. Along with deforestation, fires and localized harvest occurred from 1920 - 1940, reducing ABC to 189 Mg C/ha, with NEP varying from -1.63 to 0.13 Mg C/ha/yr. Distributed harvest occurred 1954 - 1998, with a minimum ABC of 148 Mg C/ha in 1991. By 2012 ABC (177 Mg C/ha) and NEP (2.29 Mg C/ha/yr) had increased. Over 100 years, 2430 ha forest was cut and replanted and 640 ha deforested. CBM-CFS3 includes transfers of dissolved organic C (DOC) to aquatic systems, however data has not been available to parameterize DOC flux. DOC fluxes are modelled as a fraction of decay loss from humified soil C with a default of 100% of losses to CO2 and 0% to DOC. Stream flow and [DOC] data from 1996 - 2012 for 3 watershed catchments, Rithet, Judge and Council were used to estimate annual DOC fluxes. Rithet, Judge and Council differed both in area % disturbed (logging or fire) over 100 years (39%, 93%, 91%) and in area % mature/old forest (>80yrs in 2012) (67%, 56%, 21%). DOC flux for Rithet and Judge ranged from 0.037 - 0.057 Mg C/ha/yr, Council averaged 0.017 Mg C/ha/yr. Low DOC fluxes were likely due to influences of a small lake in the catchment. Constraining CBM-CFS3 to observed DOC fluxes, required parameterization of humified C losses of 5.5 - 6.5% to DOC for Rithet and Judge, 2.5% to DOC for Council. All other catchments were assigned a fraction loss to DOC based on physiographic similarities to the 3 gauged catchments and the watershed C budget recalculated.

            "abstract": "Pluto, its large satellite Charon, and its four small known satellites represent the first trans-Neptunian Kuiper Belt objects populating the outer-most solar system beyond the gas giant planets to be studied in detail from a spacecraft (New Horizons). A complete picture of the solar nebula and solar system formation cannot be confidently formulated until representatives of this group of bodies at the edge of solar space have been examined. The Pluto system is composed of unique, lunar- and intermediate-sized objects that can tell us much about how objects with volatile icy compositions evolve. Modeling of the interior suggests that geologic activity may have been significant to some degree, and observations of frost on the surface could imply the need for a geologic reservoir for the replenishment of these phases. However, these putative indicators of Pluto's geologic history are inconclusive and unspecific. Detailed examination of Pluto's geologic record is the only plausible means of bridging the gap between theory and observation. In this talk I will examine the potential importance of these tentative indications of geologic activity and how specific spacecraft observations have been designed and used to constrain the Pluto system’s geologic history. The cameras of New Horizons will provide robust data sets that should be immanently amenable to geological analysis of the Pluto system’s landscapes. In this talk, we begin with a brief discussion of the planned observations by the New Horizons cameras that will bear most directly on geological interpretability. Then I will broadly review major geological processes that could potentially operate on the surfaces of Pluto and its moons. I will first survey exogenic processes (i.e., those for which energy for surface modification is supplied externally to the planetary surface): impact cratering, sedimentary processes (including volatile migration), and the work of wind. I will conclude with an assessment of the prospects for endogenic activity in the form of tectonics and cryovolcanism.",

            "abstract": "Surfzone and inner-shelf tracer dispersion was observed at the approximately alongshore-uniform Imperial Beach, California during the IB09 experiment. Rhodamine dye tracer, released continuously near the shoreline for several hours, was advected alongshore by breaking wave- and wind-driven currents, and ejected offshore from the surfzone to the inner-shelf by transient rips. Aerial multispectral imaging of inner-shelf dye concentration complemented in situ surfzone and inner-shelf measurements of dye, temperature, waves, and currents, providing tracer transport and dispersion observations spanning approximately 400 m cross-shore and 3 km alongshore. Combined in situ and aerial measurements approximately close a surfzone and inner-shelf dye budget. Mean alongshore dye dilution follows a power-law relationship, and both spatial and temporal dye variability decrease with distance from the release. Aerial images reveal coherent inner-shelf dye plume structures extending over 300 m offshore with alongshore length scales up to 400 m. Plume tracking among successive images yields inner-shelf alongshore advection rates consistent with in situ observations. Alongshore advection is faster within the surfzone than on the inner-shelf, and the leading alongshore edge of inner-shelf dye is due to local transient rip ejections from the surfzone. A combination of in situ and aerial surfzone and inner-shelf measurements are used to quantify cross- and alongshore dye tracer transports. This work is funded by NSF (including a Graduate Research Fellowship, Grant No. DGE1144086), ONR, and California Sea Grant.\nFigure: Aerial multispectral image of surface dye concentration (parts per billion, see colorbar) versus cross-shore coordinate x and alongshore coordinate y, approximately 5 hours after the start of a continuous dye release (green star).

            "abstract": "There is a need to accurately account for the different fluxes of water (streamflow, ET, groundwater flow) exiting alpine catchments at the present time and into the future, as this will inform efforts to plan and adapt to future changes in the environment. This is particularly true for the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, which supply over half of California’s developed water to over 38 million people and where the maritime snowpack volumes are predicted to shrink substantially with 21st century climate warming. With this need in mind, we are modeling streamflow from a 1 km2 catchment (Providence P301) in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory during the period of 2009 – 2012, using the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). Our objective is to examine possible future changes in the water budget of the catchment with reduced snowpacks in a warmer climate, and to formalize procedures for model calibration and sensitivity analysis. During the 4-year period of examination, the observed mean residual in the water budget components, P – Q – ET, is comparable in magnitude to the stream discharge, Q (22 cm versus 51 cm, respectively). The comparable magnitude of these quantities leads to unsatisfactory error statistics in modeled runoff (typical Nash-Sutcliffe values ~ 0). Substantially better statistics are obtained after normalizing modeled discharge to observed annual totals (Nash-Sutcliffe values ~ 0.6 – 0.7), suggesting that much of the interannual variability in timing of runoff is being captured. Possible causes for the large observed residual in P – Q – ET are explored, including measurement errors in the individual water budget components, and modeled changes in subsurface storage. Based on observed changes in precipitation over the last decade, change in subsurface storage likely accounts for no more than one-fourth of the observed residual in P – Q – ET, with measurement error accounting for the remainder.",

            "abstract": "Control of watershed nutrient input has long been a priority of Chesapeake Bay watershed management for alleviating hypoxia in the Bay. Therefore, systematic evaluations of historical watershed nutrient inputs and responses of river water quality can help managers to assess the effectiveness of nutrient management across the Bay watershed. Toward that end, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of multi-decadal total nitrogen (TN) watershed input and riverine output for the nine major rivers in the non-tidal Bay watershed. Specifically, we (1) compiled available data regarding multi-decadal TN input from four major sources, (2) obtained updated estimates of TN flux at downstream (edge-of-tide) river locations (‘output’), and (3) used these inputs and outputs to quantify the watersheds’ land/river effectiveness (LRE) factors in regard to TN assimilation, including an investigation of relationships between LRE and TN input. Our compiled data for N sources confirmed known trends regarding the two largest of the four TN sources (atmospheric deposition and fertilizer loadings) – i.e., that the former has declined significantly in all river basins, whereas the latter has decreased in most of the river basins. For the other two sources, point sources have declined most dramatically in the Patuxent River but exhibited various trends in other basins, whereas manure sources have increased statistically significantly in most of the river basins. The riverine output results were observed to follow watershed inputs in a non-linear manner. Finally, the LRE of the various basins were observed to correlate inversely with the watersheds’ input loadings, whereas temporal correlations within a given basin were less consistent. In addition, the Susquehanna sub-watersheds show lower LREs compared with other river basins, with riverine output similar to or even larger than input, implying that greater management effort at these locations could be especially fruitful for load reduction.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) occurred between 1.2 and 0.7 Ma with a shift to ~100-kyr glacial cycles and ~50 m greater sea level variability. This transition appears to suggest an increased ice-volume response to the 100-kyr-1 frequency periodicity of eccentricity; however, insolation forcing from eccentricity decreased during this period. Further, proxy records show no significant corresponding decrease in mean CO2. A possible explanation for the MPT invokes removal of North American regolith. In theory, the gradual exposure of crystalline bedrock by multiple cycles of ice advance and retreat provides a higher friction substrate, which leads to thicker ice sheets. These thicker ice sheets then require greater insolation forcing, potentially produced by a combination of high obliquity and eccentricity / precession, to retreat. Here we test this hypothesis using an Earth system model with dynamic atmosphere, vegetation, and ice components. Using idealized, transient orbits of obliquity and precession, we compare the ice-volume responses under several basal sliding scenarios. Our preliminary results show increased ice-volume spectral power at the frequency of precession relative to obliquity and a larger ice-volume response when basal sliding is low, lending support to the reduced regolith hypothesis. These differences in ice response are due, in part, to changes in the temperature and circulation feedbacks as the ice sheets become bigger and thicker.",

            "abstract": "Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) is a technique that can be used to determine the elastic properties of geological core samples. The resonant frequencies of the sample are measured and the elastic tensor inverted for by the non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It is a non-destructive method that allows the complete elastic tensor to be calculated from a single measurement and can provide important attenuation information. Many crustal rocks are anisotropic and can often be described by a hexagonal model of symmetry, where the sample has a single axis of rotational symmetry with perpendicular isotropic planes. Geological samples are often cylindrical and cut parallel or perpendicular to the layering (termed horizontal or vertical transverse isotropy respectively). The two situations cannot be treated by a single model and have substantially different resonant spectra. We have added functionality to existing forward and inverse codes to account for both situations. It is important to be able to deal with the two subsets of hexagonal symmetry because by using mutually perpendicular samples from the same rock complementary information can be obtained and more accurate results achieved than is possible with a single core. Shale formations consist of thin layered sequences of aligned microscopic clay platelets, which are responsible for the inherent anisotropy of shales, and can be described by a hexagonal symmetry model. RUS is used to determine the complete elastic tensor of two shale samples. When measured using RUS at frequencies on the order of 104 Hz and with time-of-flight methods with a dominant frequency an order of magnitude higher the elastic properties display frequency dispersion.",

            "abstract": "Access to employment improves women’s lives and is listed among the top five priorities for promoting gender equality in the 2012 World Development Report. This paper addresses this issue by exploring women’s labor market opportunities in Africa within one very important and growing sector: extractive industries.\nAfrica’s opportunities are being transformed by new discoveries of natural resources and their rising prices, and the mining sector is the main recipient of foreign direct investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Whether the discovery of natural resources is a blessing or a curse to a country’s citizens is a contentious issue, and natural resource dependence has been linked to negative outcomes at the national level such as environmental degradation, conflict, elite capture of rents and low female labor force participation. Natural resource extraction has been argued to be a hindrance to women’s labor market participation by increasing reservation wages and by decreasing market demand for female labor. We perform the first cross-national study testing these hypotheses with micro-data. To do this we combine survey data on 500,000 women in Sub-Saharan Africa with geo-coded data on 900 large-scale mines (see Figure 1). We treat mine openings and mine closings as natural experiments to explore local labor market changes.\nIndustrial mines generate local structural shifts. Subsistence farming becomes less important for both men and women. However, men shift to skilled manual labor, and women shift to service sector jobs. This contradicts the hypothesis that natural resource extraction is detrimental to women, by not providing them with new job opportunities. However, in support of the hypothesis, women decrease their labor market participation more than men do. A back-of-the-envelope calculation estimates that 90,000 women across Africa benefit from service sector jobs as a direct result of industrial mining in their communities, but 280,000 women leave the labor force. Further evidence using exogenous changes in world prices of minerals show that effects are stronger in boom times, but that the labor market effects are temporary and disappear with mine closing. The effects are highly spatially concentrated, and individuals living 50km away from a mine are not affected by it.",

            "abstract": "Smaller data latency through direct readout will be crucial for hourly updated regional operational models run currently (e.g., NOAA Rapid Refresh (RAP) and 3-km HRRR) and also for future global hourly updated models. Most polar orbiter radiance data are not currently meeting data cut-off availability requirements (~30 minutes) for the current NOAA RAP model. Modest improvement in overall RAP forecast skill is available with full polar-orbiter data availability if data latency was smaller (Lin et al. 2015 a,b) To some extent, this is addressed through “partial cycling” catch-up cycles in RAP, but partial cycling requires parallel NWP cycles and use of more computer resources. Better satellite data coverage (enhanced with reduced data latency) improves forecast skill not only through direct use of more data over more geographic areas but also through improved bias correction leading to more effective use of observations and less data rejection. Increased use of hourly updated models (RAP and HRRR) is clearly occurring for improved decision making. RARS (Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services) is a precursor to full direct readout availability. Initial development toward a global rapid refresh capability now underway and smaller satellite data latency will be critical for successful demonstration of 3h and 1h global updating.",

Cassini arrived in early northern winter and now it is mid-spring. The northern vortex has dissolved gradually, but the buildup of Titan's south polar vortex has been quite rapid, evidenced by the marked increase of trace organic gases and condensates. Saturn has seasonal and more irregular behavior. Like Earth, its stratosphere has an equatorial oscillation, with a descending pattern detected in Cassini's extended tour. The great northern storm that erupted in late 2010 was unexpected, leading to perturbations in tropospheric composition, and stratospheric anticyclones. Although the visible storm died out in a few months, the highly disturbed stratosphere persisted until this year. In the remainder of Cassini's tour, there will also be new observations of the thermally anomalous \"Pac-Man\" features on Mimas, Tethys, and Dione, which will provide better constraints on their physical surface properties and spatial distribution. Regions of Hyperion, Epimetheus, Janus, Pandora and Atlas will be mapped for the first time or at significantly better spatial-resolution than before. Two close flybys of Enceladus in late 2015 will allow the sampling of the structure of tiger stripe thermal emission on sub-kilometer scales. As the southern winter deepens, its endogenic signature will be less polluted by passive emission, providing the best opportunity to determine its heat flow and constrain its source. The F-ring and Proximal orbits will provide close views to obtain limb sounding of Saturn's equatorial region and map the thermal structure and composition of its north and south poles. CIRS will resolve structures in the rings previously inaccessible in the thermal infrared, including the plateaux in the C ring and broad structures associated with resonances in the A ring dubbed 'haloes,' and it will obtain the best resolution and signal-to-noise on the F ring of the entire tour.",

            "abstract": "Establishing volcanic hazard and risk management strategies hinges on a detailed understanding of the type, timing and tephra dispersal of past eruptions. In order to unravel the pyroclastic eruption history of a volcanic field, genetic links between the deposits and eruption source centre need to be established. The Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF; New Zealand) has been active for ca. 200 kyr and comprises ca. 53 individual centres covering an area of ca. 360km2. These centres show a range of sizes and eruptive styles from maar craters and tuff rings, to scoria cones and lava flows consistent with both phreatomagmatic and magmatic eruptions. Superimposition of the metropolitan area of Auckland (ca. 1.4 million inhabitants) on the volcanic field makes it critically important to assess the characteristics of the volcanic activity, on which to base assessment and management of the consequent hazards.\nHere we present a geochemical approach for correlating tephra deposits to their source centres. To acquire the most complete stratigraphic record of pyroclastic events, maar crater cores from different locations, covering various depths and thus ages across the field were selected. Magnetic susceptibility and x-ray density scanning of the cores was used to identify the basaltic tephra horizons, which were sampled and in-situ analysis of individual shards undertaken for major and trace elements using EPMA and LA-ICP-MS techniques, respectively. Our results show that tephra shard trace element ratios are comparable and complementary to the AVF whole rock database. The use of specific trace element ratios (e.g. Gd/Yb vs. Zr/Yb) allows us to fingerprint and cross correlate tephra horizons between cores and, when coupled with newly acquired 40Ar-39Ar age dating and eruption size estimates, correlate horizons to their source centres. This integrated style of study can provide valuable information to help volcanic hazard management and forecasting, and mitigation of related risks.",

We use a Monte Carlo code to track a population of ions throughout the Martian atmosphere, predicting energy loss from collisional processes such as ionization, excitation, dissociation, etc. The model framework is open to multiple planetary-specific inputs (e.g. three-dimensional neutral densities, electric and magnetic fields) and uses an adaptive trace algorithm to accurately model collisions in both dense and sparse atmospheric regions. Applying predicted 3-D models of electric and magnetic fields from the Michigan Mars MHD code and 1-D neutral densities from the MTGCM model, we use this model to calculate global rates of collisional processes for proton and neutral hydrogen collisions in the Martian upper atmosphere. Future work will include generating three-dimensional ionization rates in areas of strong and weak crustal magnetic fields for typical isotropic and beamed solar energetic particle (SEP) events.

            "abstract": "Contemporary GCMs exhibit a number of systematic errors in their simulations of cloud properties, as recently documented in Klein et al. (2013): Models do not simulate large enough total cloud fraction, especially over regions of marine stratocumulus on the eastern sides of subtropical ocean basins and throughout the midlatitudes over both ocean and land. Models also produce an over-­‐abundance of thick cloud (optical depth > 23) and an under-­‐abundance of thin cloud (optical depth < 23). It is important to determine the extent to which these biases are due to errors in model physics or due to errors in the simulated large-­‐scale ocean-­‐atmosphere state, as different causes require different solutions. Here we make use of novel simulations in which several CMIP5 GCMs are run in weather forecast mode as part of the Transpose-­AMIP II experiment. As each hindcast is initialized from the operational ECMWF YOTC analysis, large-­scale states remain very close to observations within a few days of model integration. Therefore, errors in the cloud fields with respect to instantaneous ISCCP observations can be largely attributed to model physics errors that arise relatively quickly in the simulations. We find that many of the systematic cloud biases identified in Klein et al. (2013) emerge within the first few days of these T-­AMIP hindcasts, indicating that errors in model physics are the dominant driver of the cloud biases. Using cloud radiative kernels designed specifically for the T-­AMIP runs, we quantify the relative importance of biases in cloud amount, altitude, and optical depth in driving errors in TOA radiation, focusing on key regions including Northern Hemisphere land areas where large summertime TOA SW radiation biases contribute to large warm biases at the surface.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-­‐AC52-­‐07NA27344.

            "abstract": "Based on tomography, geochemical and petrological evidences, a mantle plume called Hainan Plume has been suggested lying under Hainan Island. Our recent studies on basin subsidence and surface topography indicated that there existed surface vertical motion response to the suggested mantle plume. Post-rift rapid subsidence in the Qiongdongnan basin, which lies south of Hainan Island, is well known and accepted phenomenon. A particular feature is that the rapid subsidence did not just follow the end of syn-rift phase at ~ 21 Ma, but began after a ~10 my relatively tectonic quiescence. Different tectonic processes have been proposed to account for this rapid subsidence event. However, all these proposed mechanisms just focus on the rapid subsidence episode since Late Miocene. Our details subsidence analyses show that its tectonic subsidence is of a two-stage anomalous character: the deficit subsidence at the end of the syn-rift phase and the well known post-rift rapid subsidence after 10.5 Ma. Numerical analyses show that the stretching factor βs based on syn-rift sequences is much less than the observed crustal stretching factor βc, and the present basement depth can be almost predictable if assuming that the lithosphere was thinned with stretching factor βc; The crustal thinning happened during the syn-rift phase (before 21 Ma), and a new rifting and lower crustal flow after 21 Ma were not supported, proposing further that the syn-rift subsidence is deficit. Our further analyses proposed that the syn-rift subsidence deficit might be caused by the dynamic support of the secondary plume, and the post-rift rapid subsidence might result from the losing support of the thermal source decaying, therefore occurred to compensate the subsidence deficit of the syn-rift phase. The cooling history of the southern Hainan deduced by low temperature chronometry data, also indicated there exist an uplift event in the Late Oligocene (Shi et al., 2011). All the samples show that there is a Late Oligocene rapid uplift and cooling episode in the Southern Hainan. It is hard to explain the rapid cooling (uplift) episode in the eastern rim of the Hainan since there are no big faults close to the eastern Hainan. The deficit subsidence and uplift event might be the surface response to the deep thermal anomaly.",

NASA’s ocean salinity missions, that include\nAquarius/SAC-D\nand the SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) field campaign, illustrate the value of integrated observations in support of studies of the water cycle, environmental variability and climate. However, the inherent heterogeneity of resulting data and the disparate, distributed systems that serve them complicates their effective utilization for both earth science research and applications. Despite increased availability of oceanographic data online and improved protocols and tools for access, the fundamental problem of unified data access remains an impediment in part because of structural reasons (domain specific data providers) and in part because of specific technical issues. Key technical interoperability challenges include adherence to metadata and data format standards that are particularly acute for in-situ data and the lack of a unified metadata model facilitating archival and integration of both satellite and oceanographic field datasets. Here we report on new efforts at the PO.DAAC, NASA’s physical oceanographic data center responsible for the archival and distribution of the satellite mission data that includes Aquarius, to extend our data management infrastructure to additionally support field campaign datasets such as those from SPURS. Integral to this are plans to develop a generalized data matchup service facilitating the reconciliation of multi-scale data exhibiting heterogeneous sampling geometries in support of mission Cal/Val and oceanographic research.",

            "abstract": "Biomass losses in tropical forests due to rising temperatures could accelerate regional and global climate change via reduced land-surface feedbacks associated with the carbon cycle. However, the response of tropical vegetation to such increased temperatures is highly uncertain. Current vegetation models may fail to capture resilience in plant response as they do not appropriately account for photosynthetic acclimation and typically allow for relatively coarse changes in plant community composition. Laboratory, greenhouse, and experimental studies from other biomes provide evidence that acclimation and assembly changes occur, suggesting more plant- and community-organisational changes to temperature that create resilient functional shifts to this environmental driver. Experimental data on how tropical forests respond to increased temperatures is still limited. We assess the resilience of tropical forest carbon exchange to increased temperatures through experimental warming of a 0.2 ha artificial tropical forest: the Biosphere 2 tropical forest biome, B2-TF. The B2-TF experienced temperatures 5–7˚C higher than lowland Amazonia for over 20 years. We compare the temperature response of ecosystem carbon exchange in the B2-TF with several evergreen tropical forests in the Brazilian Amazon and a tropical dry forest in Mexico using eddy flux data. Our results show that the B2-TF sustains carbon assimilation at higher temperatures than in situ tropical forests. Whereas net ecosystem productivity at the Amazonian sites declines as temperatures increase above 28˚C, it is maintained to much higher temperatures in the B2-TF. The tropical dry forest also functions at higher temperatures than the evergreen forests in Brazil but carbon uptake declines at temperatures below those where uptake is sustained in the B2-TF biome. If the B2 forest function is a proxy for how real-world forests respond to temperature, this result suggests that these forests may have acclamation and assembly responses that allow them to tolerate greater temperature increases than models currently assume. Mechanism for this tolerance (not yet resolved in this analysis) could be due to differing responses to vapour pressure deficit inside B2, to true thermal acclimation of photosynthesis, or to shifts in tree community composition.",

Grain cores in eclogite from the centre of the Tso Morari dome are grossular-rich and pyrope poor in comparison to grain mantles and rims. The two garnet domains are separated by a layer of spessartine-rich garnet, which reflects a period of partial grain resorption. Grain cores have inclusion assemblages involving paragonite, ilmenite, rutile, actinolite and quartz, whereas grain mantle and rim inclusions involve omphacite, talc, rutile and quartz. The two garnet domains also have distinct REE compositions: REE content in grain cores defines a common trend of element enrichment increasing with atomic mass whereas grain mantles and rims are enriched in MREE and comparatively depletion in HREE. Eclogite from towards the dome margin is metasomatised in comparison with samples taken from the dome core, and is extensively recrystallized to a third assemblage rich in barroisite, paragonite and phengite. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb analysis of in situ zircon grains from the matrix and garnet rims yield maximum ages of c. 53 Ma. Zircon grains from garnet mantles and cores yield older, mixed ages having a possible Panjal Traps origin.

            "abstract": "The western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of three regions that have experienced the greatest warming on Earth over the recent decades. This warming has caused widespread glacier retreat and expansion of ice-free land areas. However, responses of terrestrial ecosystems to these rapid climate and landscape changes are still poorly understood. Here we used paleo records of climate and ecosystem reconstructions during the last millennium from peats on the WAP to understand climate-cryosphere-ecosystem connections. Continuing retreat of ice and permanent snow at Bonaparte Point on Anvers Island near Palmer Station and on Galindez Island near Vernadsky Station around 65°S latitude has recently exposed numerous entombed mosses and intact peatbank ecosystems that have been buried under ice and snow since the cold Little Ice Age (LIA). Radiocarbon dating indicates ages of 850-600 cal yr BP from re-exposed moss samples from near retreating ice (n=9 dates) and of 100 cal yr BP from near shrinking snow (n=5 dates). This age difference suggests that initial climate cooling and subsequent ice advance overran peatbanks immediately below the ice margin at the onset of the LIA, followed by permanent snow expansion often from low elevation upslope at the end of the LIA. Furthermore, detailed macrofossil and pollen analysis of a 35-cm-long peat core from a moss peatbank on nearby mainland Antarctic Peninsula show dramatic shifts from a waterlogged peatland dominated by pure stands of Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica) before the LIA to an aerobic peatbank dominated by erect mosses Polytrichum strictum and Chorisodontium aciphyllum afterwards. At present the nearest known occurrence of Deschampsia “bog peats” is in South Georgia, about 1900 km north at 54°S, a location having a mean annual temperature 6°C higher than the study region on the WAP. If we use this modern spatial relationship as an analogue, then this suggests that the pre-LIA climate was much warmer than today and appeared to support very different ecosystems on the WAP. These results imply that major ecological transformations and novel ecosystems are things to come in Antarctica by the end of this century under rapid ongoing climate warming (>0.5°C warming per decade) and widespread glacier retreat.",

The websites also contain ancillary products from 5 geostationary and 27 low earth orbiting sensors, ranging from visible through microwave channels. NRL-MRY also leverages the NRL global and regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for assessing cloud top measurements and synoptic overlays. With collaborations at CIMSS' Direct Readout site along with the AFWA IDPS-FNMOC and NOAA IDPS portals, a robust component to our websites are product latencies that typically satisfy operational time constraints necessary for planning purposes. Given these resources, NRL-MRY acquires ~2TBytes of data and produces 100,000 image products on a daily basis. In partnership with the COMET program, our product tutorials contain simple and graphically enhanced descriptions that accommodate users ranging from basic to advanced understanding of satellite meteorology.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of our website functionality: animations, co-registered formats, and Google Earth viewing. Through imagery, we will also demonstrate the superiority of VIIRS against its heritage sensor counterparts. A focal aspect will be the demonstration of the VIIRS Day Night Band (DNB) in detecting nighttime features such as wildfires, volcanic ash, Arctic sea ice, and tropical cyclones. We also plan to illustrate how NexSat and VIIRS websites demonstrate CAL/VAL ocean color activity. We will also discuss outreach and training efforts designed for research and operational applications.

            "abstract": "The uptake of gas phase species onto an aerosol surface is the primary process that governs oxidative aging of aerosols. The complexity of the resulting multiphase chemical and physical transformations has been challenging to describe at the level of accuracy required to predict aerosol lifetimes, chemical composition, phase and other key properties. Stochastic simulations of a modelcoupling free radical reactions and Fickian diffusion that quantitatively reproduces experimental observations areused to examine the early stages of a well-mixed liquid model system, the oxidation of squalane by hydroxyl radical (OH). The results elucidate the physical meaning of the uptake coefficient and reveal internal details of the particle as it undergoes oxidation. The uptake coefficient is not equivalent to an accommodation coefficient: is an intrinsically emergent process that depends upon particle size, viscosity, and OH concentration. Well-mixed, liquid behavior is also found to depend on these systems characteristics. The small particle size creates large instantaneous concentration gradients, leading to dispersal of OH within the top few nanometers and rapid mixing of long-lived peroxy radicals throughout. The implications of these results for connecting laboratory and natural oxidative processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Waste organic contaminants stored in low permeability subsurface layers serve as long-term sources for dissolved phase contaminant plumes. These layers may have a different mineralogical make up than the surrounding geologic media; specifically, they may be characterized by a high clay content. Although these layers are often considered inert, interactions may occur between the clay minerals and the waste liquids that may influence transport. Measurements of the basal spacing of Na-montmorillonite in contact with pure chlorinated organic liquids such as trichloroethylene (TCE) showed that it is similar to that with water; however, its basal spacing in contact with waste chlorinated liquids was reduced, leading to cracking. In fact, the basal spacing in contact with the waste chlorinated liquids was closer to that in contact with air than in contact with water. The observation that contact with pure organic liquids did not cause cracking, but contact with chlorinated wastes obtained from the field did, suggests that other components of the waste are critical to the basal spacing reduction process. Screening experiments indicated that the presence of a binary mixture of surfactants, a nonionic and an anionic surfactant, in the chlorinated solvent were necessary to cause the cracking at the same rate and magnitude as the chlorinated wastes obtained from the field. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurements suggest that the mixture alters the adsorbed water OH-bending band, implying a displacement of adsorbed water. Coupling these results with sorption and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, a hypothesis of component conformation in the clay interlayer space that leads to cracking can be constructed.",

Traditional reservoir simulator models for fracking are computationally expensive, and require many hours on a supercomputer to simulate a single fracking treatment. We have developed a computationally inexpensive percolation model for fracking that can be used to understand the processes and risks associated with fracking. In our model, a fluid is injected from a single site and a network of fractures grows from the single site. The fracture network grows in bursts, the failure of a relatively strong bond followed by the failure of a series of relatively weak bonds. These bursts display similarities to micro seismic events observed during a fracking treatment. The bursts follow a power-law (Gutenburg-Richter) frequency-size distribution and have growth rates similar to observed earthquake moment rates. These are quantifiable features that can be compared to observed microseismicity to help understand the relationship between observed microseismicity and the underlying fracture network.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence due to excess groundwater overdraft has been an ongoing problem in south-central and southern Arizona since the1940’s. The first earth fissure attributed to excessive groundwater withdrawal was discovered in 1946 near Picacho, Arizona. In some areas of the State, groundwater declines of more than 400 feet have resulted in extensive earth fissuring and widespread land subsidence; land subsidence of more than 19 feet has been documented near Phoenix and Eloy.\nThe Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) has been monitoring land subsidence throughout Arizona since 1997 using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Data and Global Navigation Satellite System Data. The ADWR InSAR program has proven to be a critical resource in monitoring land subsidence throughout Arizona, resulting in the identification of more than twenty-five individual land subsidence features that cover an area of more than 1,200 square miles. The majority of these land subsidence features are a direct result of groundwater declines attributed to groundwater overdraft.\nUsing InSAR data in conjunction with both automated and manual groundwater level datasets, ADWR is able to monitor active land subsidence areas as well as identify other areas that may require additional InSAR monitoring. InSAR data have also proven to be extremely useful in monitoring land surface uplift associated with rising groundwater levels near groundwater recharge facilities. InSAR data can show the impact of the recharged groundwater as the area of uplift extends down gradient from the recharge facility.\nSome highlights of recent InSAR results include the identification of a new land subsidence feature in the eastern portion of Metropolitan Phoenix where groundwater levels have recently declined; the identification of changes to a floodplain that may be exacerbating recent flooding; seasonal land subsidence and uplift related to seasonal groundwater demands; and the identification of uplift related to groundwater recharge facilities.\nThe declining groundwater levels in Arizona are both a challenge for future groundwater availability but also for mitigating land subsidence. ADWR’s InSAR program will continue to be a critical tool for monitoring land subsidence due to excessive groundwater withdrawal.",

            "abstract": "Waterfalls are important components of mountain river systems and they can serve as an agent to transfer tectonic, climatic, or authigenic signals upstream through a catchment. Retreating waterfalls lower the local base level of the adjacent hillslopes, and temporarily increase sediment delivery to the fluvial system. Their creation is often attributed to seismic ruptures, lithological boundaries, or the coalescence of multiple smaller steps. We explore here a mechanism for the nucleation of waterfalls that does not rely on sudden seismic slip but on the build-up of accumulated slip during periods of fault burial by fluvial aggradation. Alluvial fans are common features at the front of mountain ranges bound by normal or thrust faults. Climate change or internal forcing in the mountain catchment modifies the equilibrium slope of alluvial fans. When alluvial fans aggrade, they shield the active fault scarp from fluvial erosion allowing the scarp to grow undisturbed. The scarp may then be exposed when the channel incises into the fan exposing a new bedrock waterfall. We explore this mechanism analytically and using a numerical model for bedrock river incision and sediment deposition. We find that the creation of waterfalls by scarp burial is limited by three distinct timescales: 1) the critical timescale for the scarp to grow to the burial height, 2) the timescale of alluvial re-grading of the fan, and 3) the timescale of the external or internal forcing, such as climate change. The height of the waterfall is controlled by i) the difference in equilibrium alluvial-fan slopes, ii) the ratio of the respective fan and catchment sizes, iii) the catchment wide denudation rate, and iv) the fault slip rate. We test whether an individual waterfall could be produced by alluvial shielding of a scarp, and identify the tectonic, climatic, or authigenic nature of waterfalls using example field sites in the southwest United States.",

            "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of seismic regional waves in seismic event identification and attenuation tomography, very little is known on how seismic sources radiate energy into these waves. For example, whether regional Lg wave has the same source spectrum as that of the local S has been questioned by Harr et al. and Frenkel et al. three decades ago; many current investigators assume source spectra in Lg, Sn, Pg, Pn and Lg coda waves have either the same or very similar corner frequencies, in contrast to local P and S spectra whose corner frequencies differ. The most complete information on how the finite source ruptures radiate energy into regional waves is contained in the time domain source time functions (STFs). To estimate the STFs of regional waves using the empirical Green's function (EGF) method, we have been substantially modifying a semi-automotive computer procedure to cope with the increasingly diverse and inconsistent naming patterns of new data files from the IRIS DMC. We are applying the modified procedure to many earthquakes in central Asia to study the STFs of various regional waves to see whether they have the same durations and pulse shapes, and how frequently source directivity occur. When applicable, we also examine the differences between STFs of local P and S waves and those of regional waves. The result of these analyses will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Canopy leaf area index (LAI; one-sided leaf area per unit ground area) is a key instrumental variable used in models of plant-atmosphere carbon and water exchange, greenhouse gas and energy budgets and canopy-based habitats. Multiple studies have measured LAI in upland terrestrial landscapes and explored methods to up-scale field values to regional extents using remote sensing. However, in wetland ecosystems globally, much uncertainty still exists on magnitude of LAI, its spatial and temporal variation and on robust approaches to measure this index in the field and from remote sensing. We assessed LAI in different wetlands of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA (the Delta) in growing seasons of 2013-2014 and tested its empirical relationships with spectral indices of vegetation function derived from Landsat satellite images. Peak-season site-average LAI ranged from 3.3m2m-2 in a diked marsh to 6.5m2m-2 in a young engineered wetland. Results also indicate high within-site dispersion of LAI (coefficient of variation from 0.13 in rice paddy to >0.5 in tall-canopy reed-dominated marshes) attributed to complex surface composition, variable canopy height and non-uniform contribution of litter. Optically measured field LAI significantly correlated (p<0.001) with several Landsat-based indicators of vegetation greenness; however, the strongest univariate relationships explained only 45-50% of LAI variance due to variable canopy characteristics and sub-pixel wetland complexity. Goodness of fit in these relationships improved following corrections based on subpixel spectral unmixing of the green cover fraction. Results indicate that single site-level “mean” LAI values may not sufficiently characterize complex Delta wetland canopies, and models of wetland ecosystem function and greenhouse gas fluxes should incorporate within-site spatial variation in canopy properties. Landsat satellite imagery is promising for regional-scale modeling of LAI, however, simple univariate relationships with spectral indices may need to be extended to multivariate spatial models with sub-pixel corrections for site heterogeneity and phenological characteristics of vegetation.",

            "abstract": "River deltas grow primarily through repeated avulsions, where abrupt redistribution of sediment and water delivered to the ocean creates new delta lobes and rugose shorelines. Previous work isolates sediment caliber and cohesion as a primary control on the planform morphology of deltas; however, the effect of varying water discharges and backwater hydrodynamics on the creation of new delta lobes and development of shoreline rugosity is yet to be explored. Here we report on two physical experiments conducted with non-cohesive sediment in the river-ocean facility at Caltech, where a 7 m long, 7 cm wide alluvial river drains into a 6 m by 3 m “ocean” basin, building its own delta under subcritical flow and constant sea level conditions. The first experiment was conducted under constant sediment and water discharge, while in the second experiment we alternated between a low flow and a high flow such that the backwater hydrodynamics are persistent through time. We find that in the first experiment, channel dynamics are dominated by pronounced channel migration and avulsions at the location of imposed change in flow confinement, which result in smooth shorelines that are radially symmetric. However, in the second experiment, channel migration is arrested due to the creation (during low flow) and destruction (during high flow) of bars, which results in progradation of the delta front in a localized area, producing significant shoreline rugosity. The avulsion length in this experiment is determined by the backwater length, and delta progradation results in downstream translation of the avulsion node, thus determining the delta-lobe size and consequently the degree of shoreline rugosity. Our results indicate that deltas can exhibit rugose shorelines in the absence of cohesive sediment, and the time-iterative process of downstream-translating avulsion locations that are controlled by backwater hydrodynamics offer an alternative mechanism for development of shoreline rugosity.",

            "abstract": "Lava flows can be sensitive recorders of their environments of formation (e.g., pillow lava). However, while deposits formed during interactions between lava and frozen water are increasing critical for constraining paleoclimate reconstructions on Earth and Mars, those interactions are subtle and complex. Fortunately, recent observations made during eruptions (2010 Fimmvorduhals/Eyjafjallajokull, Iceland; 2012-13 Tolbachik, Russia; 2013 Veniaminof, Alaska), during large-scale experiments (Syracuse Lava Lab), and on ancient deposits are shedding new light on these complexities.\nTo understand these observations, it is critical to constrain the nature (porosity, permeability, ability to deform) of the boundary between the lava and the substrate. When lava travels directly on top of non-permeable ice, meltwater is produced rapidly enough to significantly accelerate lava movement (e.g., ‘hydroplaning’ or ‘Leidenfrost effect’). The lack of surface permeability also facilitates ingestion of steam into the base of the lava for several minutes on the scale of experiments (dm); anomalously large gas cavities are also present in modern and ancient lava flow deposits inferred to have formed in water/ice-rich environments. When lava is emplaced directly on snow, the permeability of the substrate controls meltwater accumulation, which can facilitate/hinder heat transfer but can also weaken the substrate. Finally, the presence of basal lava flow breccia (‘a’a flows) or an earlier erupted tephra blanket at the lava-H2O boundary acts to significantly slow heat transfer.\nThe speed of lava emplacement may also be important. The lavas emplaced during most of the eruptions above were not able to cover a large enough area to quickly generate significant volumes of meltwater. However, at the high discharge rates for the first few days of the Tolbachik eruption (~400 m3 s-1), effusion onto a less permeable surface (e.g., ice instead of snow) could generate significant volumes of meltwater.",

            "abstract": "A decade-long investigation of subfossil wood buried in glacio-fluvial, fluvial and lacustrine deposits from the U.S. Great Lakes region has resulted in a Great Lakes tree-ring network (GLTRN) comprising 47 sites dated from ca. 15 ka to 3ka. The GLTRN provides high-resolution proxies for exploration of local and regional responses to hydroclimate change at inter-annual scales during the transition from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Classification of radiometric ages of GLTRN wood with relative cumulative-probability function delineates intervals and importance of hydrological changes in time and space. The overwhelming majority of wood burial events correlate with generally cold climate excursions. Forest-stand deterioration and tree mortality events at the studied sites are demonstrated to result from flooding, via river aggradation (identifying occurrence of extreme hydrologic events), rise of water table, or lake inundation. To better evaluate the special patterns of hydrological change back to 15ka, we developed four floating d13C chronologies from spruce tree rings. The length of these tree-ring proxy series that capture high-frequency moisture variability of the Great Lakes area ranges from 120 to 250 years. Our data indicate progressive wet intervals during the cold excursions precisely dated with 14C tree-ring wiggles at 13.7ka, 12.1ka, and 11.3ka that fall in the Bølling–Allerød and Pre-Boreal Interstadials, and Younger Dryas Stadial. The inter-annual and decadal variability of tree-ring moisture proxies are similar across the studied locations and time intervals. Such coherence of respective proxies may result from both local ecological stability of spruce communities or regional response to a common source of moisture at the studied time intervals and locations. This study demonstrates a potential of GLTRN proxies for modeling hydroclimatic changes at the North American continent back 15 ka.",

It has also been shown that the magnitude of these effects strongly depends on the time of day and geographic location of the image acquisition as well as on the coincident solar activity. Hence, in order to provide realistic error estimates for geodetic measurements derived from L-band InSAR, an error model needs to be developed that is capable of describing ionospheric noise.\nWith this paper, we present a global ionospheric error model that is currently being developed in support of NASA’s future L-band SAR mission NISAR. The system is based on a combination of empirical data analysis and modeling input from the ionospheric model WBMOD, and is capable of predicting ionosphere-induced phase noise as a function of space and time. The error model parameterizes ionospheric noise using a power spectrum model and provides the parameters of this model in a global 1x1 degree raster. From the power law model, ionospheric errors in deformation estimates can be calculated.\nIn Polar Regions, our error model relies on a statistical analysis of ionospheric-phase noise in a large number of SAR data from previous L-band SAR missions such as ALOS PALSAR and JERS-1. The focus on empirical analyses is due to limitations of WBMOD in high latitude areas. Outside of the Polar Regions, the ionospheric model WBMOD is used to derive ionospheric structure parameters for as a function of solar activity. The structure parameters are converted to ionospheric phase screens from which phase power spectra are calculated.\nWe introduce the concept of the error model and provide examples of global error maps calculated for the NISAR mission. We also propagate ionospheric phase errors to errors in line-of-site deformation estimates assuming simple multi-temporal stacking algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Water-quality time series have been observed to exhibit long-range dependence (LRD) phenomena (e.g., Kirchner & Neal, PNAS 110(30), 2013). LRD means that the autocorrelation between values decays more slowly than exponential and presents challenges to the identification of deterministic trends. To quantify the strength of LRD, a variety of methods have been developed, e.g., rescaled range analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis, and spectral analysis. However, these methods are generally inapplicable to water-quality monitoring data that may be sampled irregularly or have missing values. This work systematically evaluates and compares two broad types of methods for estimating LRD in gappy water-quality time series using Monte Carlo simulation. The first type uses several forms of interpolation to fill in gaps, thus making the data analyzable by the traditional methods. The second type of methods, which includes some newly developed wavelet techniques, can be directly applied to gappy data. However, such methods have not been evaluated in the context of water-quality data, which usually contain irregularly distributed gaps. Here we present the simulation results obtained in three steps: first, we generate an ensemble of 1,000 replicates of synthetic data with known LRD using the fractional auto-regressive integrated moving average model. Second, we remove portions of the data to create the irregular sampling intervals that are typical of a water-quality time series. Third, we apply the candidate methods to estimate the LRD for the irregular data. The performances of the candidate methods are evaluated for values of the fractional differencing parameter (d) ranging from 0 (i.e., no LRD) to 0.499 (strong LRD yet stationary). For practicality, the simulations have been designed to mimic the Chesapeake Non-tidal Monitoring Program data, which are typical long-term water-quality data in terms of sampling frequency (weekly to monthly), length (15-40 years), and gaps (irregular and frequent). The results will help hydrologists choose appropriate methods to estimate LRD in water-quality time series, and the findings and approaches may be applicable to gappy data in other scientific fields.",

They also have significant implications to air-sea interaction and biogeochemistry. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Salinity (SSS) both contribute to the horizontal density gradient. For the first time surface density can be globally inferred from remote sensing with unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Since August 2011, NASA’s Aquarius/SAC-D satellite mission and since January 2010, ESA’s SMOS mission have provided global high resolution SSS datasets. In this study, we use various satellite measurements of SSS and SST to characterize the mean spatial structure and temporal variability of surface density gradients in the tropical Pacific Ocean from 2011 to present. In particular, we focus on the equatorial region where the Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) are present. TIWs contribute largely to heat and momentum transport in the ocean and interact with surface wind forcing. We also investigate the relative contributions of SSS and SST on density and contrast them with the estimate from in-situ data based on Argo float measurements. The analysis of multiple datasets of SSS and SST from satellite and in-situ observations allow us to estimate the uncertainties in computing surface density gradients. This comparison furthermore highlights the regions where satellite measurements provide estimated surface gradients at finer scales than sparser in situ observations. The results have strong implications to the interpretation of the characteristics of TIWs as seen from satellite measurements of SSS and SST.",

            "abstract": "Most coral-based paleoceanographic studies have used massive colonies of Porites or Faviidae, due to their long, continuously accreted skeletal records and sub-annual resolution, but other sub-massive corals provide an untapped resource. The genus Isopora is a dominant reef builder in some high-energy environments in the tropical western Pacific, and was a major component of cores recovered on IODP Leg 325 off the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Despite its abundance, Isopora remains largely unexplored and hence underutilized in paleoceanographic studies. We present a modern Sr/Ca-δ18O-Sea Surface Temperature (SST) calibration of modern Isopora corals (n=3) collected from inner and outer reef locations ranging from 1-13m depth by Heron Island in the southern GBR in 2012. Pairing the Isopora Sr/Ca record with monthly SST yielded an average relationship of SST=−11.48×(Sr/Ca)+131.1 (r2 = 0.42-0.78). The Sr/Ca sensitivity of −0.087 mmol/mol/°C is similar to the sensitivity for Porites that was corrected for tissue layer smoothing effects determined by Gagan et al. (2012). The similarity between our Sr/Ca-SST sensitivity and the corrected sensitivity for Porites suggests tissue layer effects are minimal in Isopora. The mean annual SST amplitude recorded by the corals from 2008-2011 (full annual cycles) was 5.3°C and the average δ18O annual cycle of 1.1‰ approximates that expected if salinity had little effect on coral δ18O, assuming a previously established conversion of -0.23‰ (δ18O)/°C for biogenic aragonite. The average annual salinity amplitude of 0.3 in gridded data from around Heron Island supports our conclusion that δ18O variability is forced almost completely by SST. This modern Sr/Ca-SST calibration will expand the paleoceanographic utility of Isopora and, by assisting interpretation of Sr/Ca data from fossil corals collected during IODP 325, will better constrain the timing and magnitude of sea level changes and surface conditions since the Last Glacial Maximum.",

            "abstract": "Recent data syntheses and modeling studies of arctic tundra carbon dioxide (CO2) balance have suggested that the tundra is a CO2 sink, a source or neutral. Much of this uncertainty arises from a lack of data pertaining to winter CO2 flux, as well as how these ecosystems have responded to recent warming trends. Due to a harsh, remote environment, long-term, continuous measurements of arctic tundra CO2 fluxes over the full annual cycle have been non-existent. In September 2007, we began eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE, where a negative value denotes a sink) of CO2 in northern Alaska at two ecosystems, heath and wet sedge tundra. These measurements continue to the present, and represent the longest continuous record of arctic tundra NEE currently available. From January 2008 – December 2013, the ecosystems were annual sources of CO2, with the wet sedge tundra acting as a greater source (mean ± standard deviation of 50 ± 30 g C m-2 y-1) than the heath tundra (16 ± 6 g C m-2 y-1). During these same years, the ecosystems were sinks of CO2 in the summer (June – August), with less variability between the ecosystems, -77 ± 15 g C m-2 in the wet sedge tundra, and -70 ± 12 g C m-2 in the heath. Environmental controls over NEE differed between ecosystems and seasons, with the wet sedge tundra acting particularly responsive in terms of CO2 release during periods with warm air temperatures from fall to early winter. During cold winter periods, CO2 release from the snowpack in both ecosystems was related to increases in wind speed and drops in atmospheric pressure. Overall, the measured differences in the annual versus summer NEE illustrate how the sink strength of the tundra can be overestimated if data are only collected during the growing season. Furthermore, eddy covariance measurements of methane (CH4) in the wet sedge tundra during late spring to early fall from 2012 to present show that this ecosystem releases 0.34 ± 11 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Thus, to understand and predict the sink strength of the arctic tundra, long-term measurements of CO2, CH4 and associated meteorological variables across a range of tundra ecosystems over the full annual cycle are critical, and biogeochemical models, which typically underestimate tundra winter respiration, should be more accurately formulated to take into account winter CO2 release.",

Land surfaces are generally heterogeneous, can create mesoscale circulations and alter the development of clouds and precipitation. This can be a source of uncertainties for current climate and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, where convection is partially parameterized. Results of our simulations will help to identify the interaction between land-surface heterogeneities, moist convection and mesoscale circulations in NWP models.\nIn this study we simulate the diurnal cycle of mid-latitude summertime convection with a focus on the propagation of a thermally induced mesoscale circulation. High resolution large-eddy simulation with an interactive land-surface model is used to address the problem. Sensitivity studies show that moist convection significantly strengthens thermally induced mesoscale circulations.

            "abstract": "As cities evolve to become increasingly complex systems of people and interconnected infrastructure the impacts of extreme events and long term climatological change are significantly heightened (Walsh et al. 2011). Understanding the resilience of urban systems and the impacts of infrastructure failure is therefore key to understanding the adaptability of cities to climate change (Rosenzweig 2011). Such information is particularly critical in developing nations which are predicted to bear the brunt of climate change (Douglas et al., 2008), but often lack the resources and data required to make informed decisions regarding infrastructure and societal resilience (e.g. Paar & Rekittke 2011).\nWe propose that mobile social media in a people-as-sensors paradigm provides a means of monitoring the response of a city to cascading infrastructure failures induced by extreme weather events. Such an approach is welcomed in developing nations where crowd-sourced data are increasingly being used as an alternative to missing or incomplete formal data sources to help solve infrastructure challenges (Holderness 2014).\nIn this paper we present PetaJakarta.org as a case study that harnesses the power of social media to gather, sort and display information about flooding for residents of Jakarta, Indonesia in real time, recuperating the failures of infrastructure and monitoring systems through a web of social media connections. Our GeoSocial Intelligence Framework enables the capture and comprehension of significant time-critical information to support decision-making, and as a means of transparent communication, while maintaining user privacy, to enable civic co-management processes to aid city-scale climate adaptation and resilience.\nPetaJakarta empowers community residents to collect and disseminate situational information about flooding, via the social media network Twitter, to provide city-scale decision support for Jakarta’s Emergency Management Team, and a neighbourhood-scale public information service for individuals and communities to alert them of nearby flood events.\nDouglas I., et al. 2008 ENVIRONMENT & URBANIZATION\nHolderness T. 2014 IEEE TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY MAGAZINE\nPaar P. & Rekittke J. 2011 FUTURE INTERNET\nRosenzweig C. 2011 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\nWalsh C.

However, access to these systems both inside and from outside the observatory offices are limited in some cases by factors such as software cost, network security, and bandwidth. Thus, a variety of Internet-based tools have been developed by the USGS Volcano Science Center to: 1) Improve accessibility to data sources for staff scientists across volcano monitoring disciplines; 2) Allow access for observatory partners and for after-hours, on-call duty scientists; 3) Provide situational awareness for emergency managers and the general public. Herein we describe VolcView (volcview.wr.usgs.gov), a freely available, web-based platform for display and analysis of near-real-time satellite data.\nInitial geographic coverage is of the volcanoes in Alaska, the Russian Far East, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Coverage of other volcanoes in the United States will be added in the future. Near-real-time satellite data from NOAA, NASA and JMA satellite systems are processed to create image products for detection of elevated surface temperatures and volcanic ash and SO2 clouds. VolcView uses HTML5 and the canvas element to provide image overlays (volcano location and alert status, annotation, and location information) and image products that can be queried to provide data values, location and measurement capabilities. Use over the past year during the eruptions of Pavlof, Veniaminof, and Cleveland volcanoes in Alaska by the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the National Weather Service, and the U.S. Air Force has reinforced the utility of shared situational awareness and has guided further development. These include overlay of volcanic cloud trajectory and dispersion models, atmospheric temperature profiles, and incorporation of monitoring alerts from ground and satellite-based algorithms. Challenges for future development include reducing the latency in satellite data reception and processing, and increasing the geographic coverage from polar-orbiting satellite platforms.",

A major portion of the dam basins in Turkey are deprived of vegetation and have slope topography on near surrounding area.

Erosion control and forestation are important factors, reducing the sediment, to protect the water basins of the dams and increase the functioning life of the dams. The functioning life of dams is as important as the investment and construction. Nevertheless, in order to provide safety of human life living around, well planned monitoring is essential for dams. Dams are very large and critical structures and they demand the use or application of precise measuring systems. Some basic physical data are very important for assessing the safety and performance of dams. These are movement, water pressure, seepage, reservoir and tail-water elevations, local seismic activities, total pressure, stress and strain, internal concrete temperature, ambient temperature and precipitation.\nMonitoring is an essential component of the dam after construction and during operation and must en­able the timely detection of any behavior that could deteriorate the dam, potentially result in its shutdown or failure. Considering the time and labor consumed by long-term measurements, processing and analysis of measured data, importance of the small structural motions at regular intervals could be comprehended.\nThis study provides some information, safety and the techniques about the deformation monitoring of the dams, dam safety and related analysis.\nThe case study is the deformation measurements of Atatürk Dam in Turkey which is the 6th largest dam of world considering the filling volume of embankment.

            "abstract": "The oil industries and their cornucopian supporters (press, politicians, energy agencies) promote the story that in the oil is abundant and oil production will increase. The reality is that 1) World crude oil production has been on a plateau since 2005, in spite of new technology (fracking), record high prices (Brent Oil > $100 per barrel) and record spending on exploration and development ($5.4 trillion over the past six years) and 2) The price of oil has risen steadily from 1999 to present. Typically when commodities are abundant the price tends to fall.\nHow is this reality being distorted? 1) Resources are being equated with reserves (both are amounts), neither of which can be equated with each other or with production (a rate). 2) Crude oil (the price or which is rigorously defined by API density) has been redefined as total liquids, which includes substances (lease condensates, natural gas liquids, biofuels, refinery gains) which can not be used in the same way oil is or sold for the same price as oil. If what you are selling cannot be sold on the world market as crude oil, then it is not crude oil. 3) The demand for oil remains high, but World production is stagnant and World net-export production has been decreasing since 2005. Thus the price remains high and will only increase in the future. Growth in Global GDP is impacted by high-priced oil.\nHow do you know unethical behavior when you see it? It has to do with intentionality and motivation. “Advocacy science” often reports data to support their cause. Is that unethical? Where is the divide between being an “Issue Advocate” and “Advocacy Science”? If data are reported poorly, is it unethical or just “bad science”? Do the same ethical standards apply to businesses (when profits are involved) and politicians (when elections are at stake)? Why would the definition of oil include NGL, condensates and refinery gains if not trying to inflate the numbers. The standards should be the same, but when there are no reliable independent sources of data, different definitions and uncertainty in the data allow a range of interpretations. Within these limits it allows some to bend the truth for their needs.\nWhat is the solution? With so much at stake, why have the uncertainties in these issues been so poorly examined by the academic community? Doing so will encourage alternative sources of energy to be developed.",

            "abstract": "Glacial meltwater can refreeze within firn and crevasses, warming the ice through latent heat transfer. The consequent softening of the ice has been identified as a potential destabilization mechanism for the Greenland Ice Sheet, which would flow more quickly seaward with lower viscosity. We calculate the effect of meltwater refreezing within firn and englacial features on ice temperature and viscosity in two contrasting areas of western Greenland: Jakobshavn Isbrae, a convergent, fast-flowing outlet glacier, and the Pakitsoq area (Swiss Camp) directly to its north, a \"dead zone\" experiencing slow, divergent flow because of its location between two outlet glaciers. We explore how much refreezing affects the seaward velocity of ice in each location by comparing our modeled temperature profiles to borehole data. Pakitsoq ice shows significant englacial latent heat transfer, or cryo-hydrologic warming, while the ice in Jakobshavn has warmed largely due to percolation within the firn. We find that the Pakitsoq region is rather unique in western Greenland because of the long residence time of the ice in the ablation zone (800 years) there; ice flowing through Jakobshavn, by contrast, spends only 20 years in the ablation zone, not enough time for deep, diffusive englacial warming to occur. Examination of the velocity field of the ice sheet indicates that 70% of the ice flux through western Greenland spends insufficient time (200 years or less) in the ablation zone to produce significant englacial warming. Thus, the effects of englacial latent heat transfer may be fairly limited to regions of divergent flow such as Pakitsoq. Ice loss in these regions, which tend to be land-terminating, is dominated by surface melt rather than seaward ice motion, further suggesting that englacial heat transfer may have a lesser effect on the stability of the ice sheet than previously supposed.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes and tsunamis are the principal geohazards of southern Alaska. The entire margin has ruptured in megathrust earthquakes, including the M9.2 1964 event, and these earthquakes have launched deadly local and trans-Pacific tsunamis. Tsunamis have been by far the largest killer in these earthquakes. Moreover, the subduction zone displays a range in locking behavior from completely locked beneath Prince William Sound, to ­­­­nearly freely slipping beneath the Shumagin Islands.\nCharacterizing earthquake-related tsunami sources requires a diverse set of methods, and we discuss several examples. One important source for tsunamis is from megathrust splay faults. The Patton Bay splay fault system ruptured during the 1964 earthquake and generated a tsunami that impacted coastlines tens of minutes after the earthquake. A combination of multibeam mapping, high-resolution and crustal-scale seismic data, thermochronology, and detrital zircon geochronology show focused exhumation along this splay fault system for the last 2-3 Ma. Moreover, this long term pattern of exhumation mimics the pattern of uplift in 1964.\nSubmarine landslides are another example of a tsunami source. Numerous devastating slides were triggered by the 1964 earthquake. Multibeam bathymetry, bathymetry difference maps, high-resolution seismic data, and records of paleotsunamis in coastal marshes reveal a long history of submarine landsliding in the coastal fjords of Alaska. The Little Ice Age appears to have had a significant influence on the submarine landslides in the 1964 earthquake through increased sediment production, transport to fjord margins, and, locally, compaction by glacier advances. Glacial retreat before 1964 gave rise to over-steepened slopes susceptible to dynamic failure. Numerous blocks in the submarine landslides were particularly effective in generating high tsunami run up.\nFinally, regional tectonic displacements of the seafloor have launched trans-Pacific tsunamis. Coastal evidence of high tsunamis in the eastern Aleutians has helped us understand the frequency of megathrust earthquakes west of Kodiak Island. Recent studies of vertical displacements produced by tsunamigenic earthquakes has led to new insights about the persistence of rupture boundaries and long term constraints on locking behavior.",

            "abstract": "The deepest parts of the southern Mariana Trench have variously been interpreted to 1) indicate strike-slip motion along the trench, 2) contain a series of 3 sediment ponds at greater than 10,900 m depth separated from one another by fault-controlled ridges on the subducting plate, and 3) have an even deeper feature in the western-most pond (Vitiaz Deep). Recent lander deployments in all three ponds and the Deepsea Challenger submersible dive by J. Cameron in 2012 showed that the deepest ponds within the Challenger Deep area have nearly unbroken, flat surfaces. One point explored showed veined serpentinite at a depth of 10,800+ m. The potential for active serpentinite-hosted seeps and vent communities was demonstrated for the Shinkai Vent Field at 5,800m depth. Rocks collected using the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution’s hybrid remotely operated vehicle, Nereus, in 2009 from deep (10,879 m) on the incoming plate south of the Challenger Deep, were recovered from the base of a fault scarp where large, columnar-jointed blocks are draped with sediment. Optical microscopy, electron-microprobe and Raman analysis show that they are partially altered massive diabase with altered interstitial glass and containing microbial tubules in vug–filling secondary phases. The chain of seamounts striking NNW, colinear with the Lyra Trough, has been interpreted as a boundary between the Pacific Plate and the seafloor north of the Caroline Ridge. Sediments, drilled from above postulated basement north of the Caroline Ridge are no older that Oligocene. Ar/Ar age dates completed for one rock collected by Nereus in 2009 give a weighted mean plateau age, based on two experiments, of 24.6 +/- 3.2 Ma. Thus, the igneous basement of the subducting plate south of the Challenger Deep is, far younger than the Jurassic Pacific Plate subducting further east. This represents a previously unidentified tectonic plate. With new vehicles and technologies the future for hadal exploration is ripe.",

            "abstract": "Augustine Island is a small, 8x11 km island in South Central Alaska’s lower Cook Inlet. It is approximately 280 km southwest of Anchorage, and occupied entirely by its namesake Augustine Volcano.\nAt Augustine Volcano, SAR data suitable for interferometry is available from 1992 to 2005, from March 2006 to April 2007, and from July 2007 to October 2010. Its last two eruptive episodes, in 1986 and 2006, resulted in substantial pyroclastic flow deposits (PFDs) on the Volcano’s north flank. Earlier InSAR analyses of the area, from 1992-1999, identified local subsidence, but no volcano-wide deformation indicative of magma-chamber evacuation. In contrast to previous studies, we use InSAR data to determine a range of geophysical parameters for PFDs emplaced during the Augustine’s two most recent eruption cycles.\nBased on InSAR measurements between 1992 and 2010, we reconstruct the deformation behavior of PFDs emplaced during Augustine’s last two eruption cycles. Using a combination of InSAR measurements and modeling, we determine the thickness and long-term deformation of overlaying pyroclastic flow deposits emplaced in 1986 and 2006. Consistent with previous observations of pyroclastic flows, we found that the PFDs on Augustine Island rapidly subsided after emplacement due to an initial compaction of the material. We determined the length of this initial settling period and measured the compaction rate. Subsequent to this initial rapid subsidence, we found that PFD deformation slowed to a more persistent, linear, long-term rate, related to cooling of the deposits. We established that the deposits’ contraction rate is linearly related to their thickness and measured the contraction rate. Finally, a study of long term coherence properties of the Augustine PFDs showed remarkable stability of the surface over long time periods. This information provides clues on the structural properties and composition of the emplaced material.",

            "abstract": "We propose a simple, self-consistent model to explain a range of puzzling observation made in many Archean cratons including 1/ the marked petrological stratification of the lithospheric mantle; 2/ the multimodal polybaric volcanism of greenstone covers; 3/ the regional and temporal overlap between komatiitic-tholeiitic basalts and arc-volcanism; and 4/ the mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity mapped across several cratons. This model also explains the possible transition from a stagnant-lid regime to a transient then steady-state plate tectonic regime.\nWe performed several series of 2D thermo-mechanical numerical experiments to investigate the effect of an early continent on mantle convection. We considered a composite lid including 1/ a continent consisting of 55 km thick crust - made of TTG and continental flood basalts – above a 170-km-thick strongly depleted, strong and buoyant lithospheric mantle, and 2/ an oceanic lid including a 15-km-thick basaltic crust.\nThese experiments show that the continent slowly spreads laterally toward the adjacent oceanic lid. The spreading and thinning of the continent drives exhumation of the fertile sub-continental mantle, which in turn promotes polybaric decompression melting producing komatiitic and tholeiitic basalts. Continental boudinage and rifting accompanying the spreading drives further upwelling and decompression melting to even shallower depths. This partial melting produces a moderately depleted mantle layer, progressively incorporated through cooling to the base of the continent. Our numerical experiments also show that spreading continents force the adjacent oceanic lid into the convective mantle, promoting subduction of the oceanic lid and temporal overlap between Archean komatiitic-tholeiitic basalts with arc-volcanism. Spreading and thinning of the continent lead to a sub-horizontal litho-tectonic fabric in the mantle, with a possible major discontinuity between the older strongly depleted mantle, and the younger moderately depleted accreted mantle.\nOur experiments show that early continents acted as kick-starters of subduction until plate tectonics became self-sustaining through the increasingly negative buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Development of local groundwater resources in coastal areas is limited by the presence of saline groundwater. For a study in the San Diego area, a geochemical approach was used to investigate the sources and movement of saline groundwater in the coastal aquifer. Chemical and isotopic data were collected from multiple-depth monitoring-well sites near the San Diego coastline at discrete intervals to depths of more than 650 meters. The groundwater samples were analyzed for major and minor ions, the stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, and strontium, and radioactive isotopes of tritium and carbon-14. Each chemical and isotopic tracer preserves some aspect of the hydrologic history of the groundwater ranging from the chemical characteristics (major and minor ions), to the source of water (stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen), to the types of rock encountered in the groundwater flow system (strontium isotopes), to time-since-recharge (tritium and carbon-14). By using sodium-to-calcium mass ratios, in combination with the isotopic data, the occurrence of saline groundwater as a result of seawater intrusion was distinguishable from groundwater in a previously-saline aquifer that has been “flushed” by fresher continental recharge. The systematic analysis of these tracers indicate that the sources and movement of saline groundwater in the coastal San Diego area are dominated by: 1) regional flow of higher-elevation precipitation that recharged many thousands of years ago along deep flowpaths; 2) recharge of local precipitation in relatively shallower portions of the flow system; and 3) intrusion of seawater that primarily entered the aquifer during pre-modern times. Use of multiple chemical and isotopic tracers provides unique insight regarding the processes affecting groundwater quality, enabling local water agencies to assess the groundwater resources in the coastal aquifer and begin to reduce the area's reliance on imported water.",

Analysis of observational data shows that during this period a low-frequency (10-60-day) monsoon gyre interacted with Megi. To investigate the effect of the low-frequency flow on Megi, numerical experiments were designed. The flow field is divided into a slowly varying background state, a 10-60-day low frequency component representing the monsoon gyre, and a 10-day high-pass filtered component representing Megi. In the control experiment, all three components are included, and the model is able to simulate Megi’s sharp northward turning track. In the second experiment, the 10-60-day mode is removed from the initial and lateral boundary fields. In the absence of the low-frequency mode, Megi moves westward and slightly northwestward without turning north. Tracks of the relative positions between the Megi and the monsoon gyre centers indicate that a Fujiwhara effect existed between them and was responsible for the northward turn of both Megi and the monsoon gyre.",

Tidal flats are characterized by large elongate subtidal sand bars and broad intertidal and supratidal mud flats with spring tidal range reaching up to 10 meters. Geomorphic features, surface sediments and core data show that the intertidal flat can be divided into two zones:upper intertidal zone and lower intertidal zone. The upper intertidal zone dips gently seaward with shore-normal tidal creeks, which changes from mud-flat facies to mixed-flat facies with seaward coarsening in average grain size. Dominant sedimentary facies are homogeneous mud (highly bioturbated) and thinly interlaminated sand/mud to coarsely interlaminated sand/mud (wavy and lenticular bedding) showing seasonal bedding.The surface topography of lower intertidal flat is characterized as sand-bar complex migrated landward. The bars are reaching up to 1.5m in height, and shore-parallel tidal creeks are developed between individual bars. Dominant sedimentary facies is sand-flat facies except for mixed-flat facies occurring near boundary of two zones. Broad tidal flats around the islands of the Shinan and Seocheon areas associated with macrotidal range in very shallow epicontinental sea (Yellow Sea) display outstanding geological processes and geoheritage significance, which can be a strong potential World Heritage site.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we present a large flare showing negative emissions in the EUV passbands observed by SDO/AIA. Contrary to ordinary flare emission represented by an increase of intensity, negative flare emission refers to as a decrease of intensity during flares. In the literature, negative flare emissions were usually reported by stellar observations. Only a few negative solar flares were observed in He I D3 in 1970s and one event observed in the near Infrared at 8542 Å in 2001. On 2014-Jan-07, an X1.2 flare occurred near the solar disk center with a complex magnetic configuration, showing multiple flare ribbons. Among them a remote flare ribbon is located to the southwest from the flare core region. A small portion of the remote ribbon became darkened from about 18:45 UT, while the rest of the ribbon remained bright. This darkening lasted for more than one hour and did not show obvious motion. Therefore, we exclude the possibility of transient coronal hole associated with EUV waves. By comparing with SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms, we find that the negative flare regions are associated with weak magnetic fields, lower than 50 Gauss. In contrast, the bright flare ribbons are co-spatial with strong magnetic fields above 200 Gauss. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the negative emission by examining the temporal evolution of its intensity and area. Finally, we discuss the possible mechanisms in generating the negative emissions.",

            "abstract": "Recent changes, including outlet glacier retreat and speedup, and increased rates of surface melting, have dramatically increased the Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea-level rise over the past few decades. Increasingly studies point towards the influence of coupled ocean-ice processes in modulating Greenland ice sheet mass balance and glacier behavior in response to climate change, but many of these studies are limited to the past few years to decades, restricting our ability to understand these ocean-ice relationships over longer time periods. Ice core records have the potential to provide unique, high-resolution records of interest (e.g. accumulation and melt variability, as well as contemporaneous proxy records of regional air temperature and sea surface conditions), but suitable Greenland ice sheet coring regions are often located far inland (>200 km) from many maritime regions of interest. In this study we focus on new records from previously unstudied maritime ice caps (10-30 km from the coast) to reconstruct past environmental conditions in the Disko, Ummannaq and Baffin Bay regions. Here we present results from our recent 2014 field investigation of three high altitude ice caps (1300-2000 m) on Disko Island and the Nuussuaq Peninsula, as well as complementary results from two sites in the western ice sheet accumulation zone. Geophysical observations provide constraints on ice thickness, layering, and ice flow. Physical and chemical stratigraphic observations from snow pits and shallow firn cores are used to reconstruct recent accumulation rate and melt variability, as well as to develop and test environmental proxy relationships over the satellite era. Multi-century records from longer coastal ice cores, to be drilled in 2015, will contribute a key missing component to the existing observational record documenting ice, ocean and atmospheric changes in this region over a time period of dramatic change in Greenland ice sheet behavior (retreat and thinning) and regional climate warming",

Climate change research and terrestrial responses to climate change over the TP is limited to a large extends due to the harsh nature condition and limited in-situ observations. GCMs are useful tools to be implemented in climate change study but with lots deficiency. GCMs could not provide regional information due to the coarse resolution. Using a regional climate model and driven by GCMs, dynamic downscaling could provide physics-based high-resolution information for the related researches. Downscaling is expected to perform better than the coarse resolution forcing. However, GCMs possess biases themselves due to various factors. GCMs biases will be passed over to RCMs nevertheless. Therefore, it is worth to consider to what extends the GCMs biases impact the downscaling results? Recently, a 120-years dynamic downscaling driven by CCSM4 was conducted in the Asia. To address the impact of GCMs biases, the 25-years (1980-2005) historical downscaling results will be compared to simulations driven by the reanalysis in the TP.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally dry tropical forests account for over 40% of the forested area in tropical and subtropical regions. Previous studies suggest that seasonal water stress is one main driver of phenology and related vegetation dynamics in seasonally dry tropical forests. Species that coexist in seasonally dry tropical forests have different plant traits, experience different degrees of plant water stress and show distinctive phenological patterns. However, the observed diversity in plant phenology and related vegetation dynamics is poorly represented in current dynamic vegetation models. In this study, we employ a new modeling approach to enhance our model skills in seasonally dry tropical forests. First, we implement a new plant hydraulic module under the framework of a state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation model, Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2). Second, we link plant water stress with several key coordinated plant traits. Unlike previous models, the updated ED2 does not prescribe leaf phenology (deciduous or evergreen) and plant water stress is not determined by empirical water stress factors or by soil moisture alone. Instead, the model tracks more mechanistic indicators of plant water stress like leaf water potential, accounts for different abilities to tolerate water stress among plant functional types and predicts dry season leaf deciduousness and related vegetation dynamics. The updated model is then tested with in-situ meteorological data and long-term ecological observations. We also perform numerical experiments to explore the possible biases of ignoring the observed diversity in seasonally dry tropical forests. We find that (i) variations of several key plant traits (specific leaf area, wood density, turgor loss point and rooting depth) can account for the observed distinctive phenological patterns as well as inter-annual variations in vegetation growth among species. (ii) Ignoring the trait-driven trade-offs and diversity in seasonality would introduce significant amount of biases in model predictions of ecosystem energy and water fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Tree cores collected from trees growing at high latitudes have long been used to reconstruct past climates, because of close positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. However, in recent decades and at many sites, these relationships have deteriorated and have even become negative in some instances. The observation of declining tree growth in response to rising temperature has prompted many investigators to suggest that high latitude trees may be increasingly exhibiting drought-induced stomatal closure. In the Brooks Range of northern Alaska, the observation of low and declining growth of white spruce is more prevalent in the central and eastern parts of the range, where precipitation is lower, providing superficial support for the drought stress hypothesis. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of white spruce drought-induced stomatal closure in four watersheds along a west to east gradient near the Arctic treeline in the Brooks Range. We obtained a historical perspective on tree growth and water relations by collecting increment cores for analysis of ring widths and carbon isotopes in tree-ring alpha-cellulose. Meanwhile, we made detailed assessments of contemporary water relations at the scales of the whole canopy and the needle. All of our data indicate that drought-induced stomatal closure is probably not responsible for low and declining growth in the central and eastern Brooks Range. Carbon isotope discrimination has generally increased over the past century and our calculations indicate that needle inter-cellular CO2 concentration is much greater now than it was in the early 1900’s. Measurements of needle gas exchange are consistent with the tree core record, in the sense that instances of low photosynthesis at our sites are not coincident with similarly low stomatal conductance and low inter-cellular CO2 concentration. Finally, hourly measurements of xylem sap flow indicate that trees at our study sites are able to maintain near peak canopy transpiration under the highest atmospheric vapor pressure deficits observed (>3.0 kPa). Thus, our tree-ring data provide further evidence of what has become known as the “divergence problem” in northern forests, but our physiological measurements suggest that drought-induced stomatal closure may not be the cause.",

A forward simulator is a crucial tool for examining the quality of individual products as well as resolving discrepancy among related data sets. NASA Earth Observing System Simulator Suite (NEOS3) is a highly customizable forward simulation tool for Earth remote sensing instruments. Its three-stage simulation process converts the 3D geophysical description of the scene being observed to corresponding electromagnetic emission and scattering signatures, and finally to observable parameters as reported by a (passive or active) remote sensing instrument. User-configurable options include selection of models for describing geophysical properties of atmospheric particles and their effects on the signal of interest, selection of wave scattering and propagation models, and activation of simplifying assumptions (trading between computation time and solution accuracy).\nThe next generation of NEOS3, to be released in 2015, will feature additional state-of-the-art electromagnetic scattering models for various types of the Earth’s surfaces and ground covers (e.g. layered snowpack, forest, vegetated soil, and sea ice) tailored specifically for missions like GPM and SMAP. To be included in 2015 is dedicated functionalities and interface that facilitate integrating NEOS3 into Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) environments. This new generation of NEOS3 can also utilize high performance computing resources (parallel processing and cloud computing) and can be scaled to handle large or computation intensive problems.\nThis presentation will highlight some notable features of NEOS3. Demonstration of its applications for evaluating new mission concepts, especially in the context of OSSE frameworks will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying invasive species success is a challenge in ecology. Treeline ecotones are eminently suited to address this challenge given their sensitivity to climate change and the different abiotic filters in place over short distances. The invasive dwarf bamboo Sasa kurilensis has had pronounced effects on Japanese alpine plant communities, including the loss of over 1/3 of native species in some areas. The drivers of S. kurilensis invasions remain unresolved. We evaluated S. kurilensis stands along elevation and moisture gradients in Daisetsuzan National Park (Hokkaido, Japan) to identify strategy shifts that might facilitate invasions. We anticipated morphological responses to be correlated with invasion above treeline, while physiological processes to be more coordinated below treeline, reflecting different ecological filters in place within each community. We compared growth patterns and plant water status in the native (i.e., montane forests) and invasive (i.e., subalpine and alpine meadows) ranges of S. kurilensis. Dwarf bamboo at native lower elevations were taller than those at newly-invaded upper limits, indicating light limitation and investment in culm elongation. Culms in the native range grew faster than those at higher elevations. In contrast, culm density increased and plants allocated more to photosynthetic structures in invaded areas without overstory. Plants tended to invade drier soils but showed increased water stress, likely compensating by producing more photosynthetic structures to promote carbon gain. Overall, our results reveal dwarf bamboo exhibits both morphological and physiological variation across treeline ecotones. This appears to enable it to successfully invade subalpine and alpine communities while responding to a new climate. This pattern of variation coupled with changing soil dynamics as a result of earlier snowmelt will likely continue to promote the invasion of S. kurilensis into these systems. Linking resource allocation strategies and physiological responses to environmental variation will produce a mechanistically-based predictive framework vital to helping federal agencies apply limited funds to optimally conserve and manage sensitive lands.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is considered to pose a significant risk to the vast and varied peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL). Changes in peatland biogeochemical processes in this region could have major consequences for global greenhouse gas exchange and climate regulation, and yet there are still many gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge of these processes. In particular, our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the structure (vegetation and water table) and function (carbon flux) of these systems is limited. Various theories and models of peatland development have been proposed, including those that describe peatlands as self-regulating systems where long-term stability is maintained by feedback between biological and hydrological processes. There is limited field data however to support the different development theories and to validate proposed feedback mechanisms. Understanding how peatlands are controlled by internal and external forces is also particularly important when considering possible ecosystem shifts due to climate change.\nHere we compare data from a pristine peatland and a drained peatland site in the HBL to understand peatland structure and function in current climate conditions and a future climate scenario (drier conditions). We measured carbon dioxide and methane fluxes using closed chambers at 51 collar locations (12 collars at the hydrologically impacted site, 39 collars at the pristine peatland site - triplicates at both study sites) representing a total of 13 vegetation communities and different peatland microforms (hummocks, ridges, hollows and pools). Continuous hydrological measurements and vegetation surveys were also completed.\nThese results suggest that peatland structure and function in the HBL must be explained by a combination of peatland development mechanisms and that these mechanisms are dependent on the variable hydroecological setting of peatland areas. We suggest that the drained peatland site may represent an alternative ecosystem state as indicated by considerably low water levels (2013 annual average water table depths of 129 cm for hummocks and 68 cm for pools), declining cover of healthy peatland vegetation (particularly Sphagnum moss) and lower CH4 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic plates may accelerate after large inter-plate earthquakes (Anderson, Science 1975). This was indirectly substantiated by Heki and Mitsui (EPSL 2013), who analyzed crustal deformation of an island arc after megathrust earthquakes. Here we show direct evidence of postseismic acceleration of the Pacific Plate from the data of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) station on the Minami-torishima (Marcus) Island ~2000 km off the Pacific coast of Japan.\nHeki and Mitsui (2013) found the enhancement of the inter-plate coupling in NE Japan on segments adjacent to those ruptured in the 2003 Tokachi-Oki (Mw8.0) and the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (Mw9.0) earthquakes. They inferred that the subduction of the Pacific Plate slab significantly accelerated after these earthquakes. During interseismic periods, the balance between the down-dip (slab pull and ridge push) and up-dip (viscous traction and interplate coupling) forces realizes convergence rate constant over geological timescales. A megathrust event reduces interplate coupling, and the down-dip forces temporarily exceed the other. The accelerated subduction realizes under the new balance and continues until the interplate coupling recovers.\nIn the Marcus Island, the closest island on the Pacific Plate to the Japan Trench, continuous GNSS observations started in 2002, and showed linear movement toward WNW of ~7.7 cm/year (in the nnr-NUVEL1 frame). This station showed coseismic jump of ~1 cm toward the epicenter in the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. At the same time, the velocity showed distinct increase of ~10 percent without changing the azimuth, resulting in post-2011 speed of ~8.5 cm/year. This is difficult to explain with a simple postseismic viscous relaxation in a stratified earth, and would be the direct evidence of the postseismic acceleration of the Pacific Plate. Such an acceleration is, however, not seen in Hawaii, ~6000 km away from the fault.",

The Air Force Weather Agency typically uses a daily Kp and F10.7 when running the IFM. This study used Kp and F10.7 values at 1‑hourly, 3‑hourly, and daily cadence intervals in the IFM and the resulting GAIM‑GM model total electron content (TEC) output was verified using skill scores. This study showed that while the IFM produced different output for different cadence configurations, the GAIM‑GM model output showed little or no variation. It also showed that when ingested data was suddenly removed from the GAIM-GM model, skill scores decayed to those of the model’s background ionosphere at the same rate, regardless of cadence configuration. In addition, alternate sources of Kp and F10.7 data were investigated, to include data from the ACE satellite as an alternate to Kp, and F11.1 data as an alternate to F10.7. While the use of ACE Kp data had little effect on GAIM‑GM model output, the use of F11.1 data showed improvement in three of the five periods tested, with a reduction in root mean square error of up to 1.17 TEC units.",

            "abstract": "The Los Humeros geothermal field is a high-enthalpy hydrothermal system with more than 40 drilled deep wells, mostly producing high steam fractions at > 300oC. However, although it has a large resource potential, low permeability and corrosive acid fluids have hampered development so that it currently has an installed electrical generating capacity of only 40 MWe. The widespread production of low pH fluids from the reservoir is inconsistent with the marked absence in the reservoir rocks of hydrothermal minerals typical of acid alteration. Instead the hydrothermal alteration observed is typical of that due to neutral to alkaline pH waters reacting with the volcanic rocks of the production zones. Thus it appears that since the reservoir has recently suffered a marked drop in fluid pressure and is in process of transitioning from being water-dominated to being vapor-dominated. However sparse examples of acid leaching are observed locally at depths of about 2 km in the form of bleached, intensely silicified zones, in low permeability and very hot (>350oC) parts of reservoir. Although these leached rocks retain their primary volcanic and pyroclastic textures, they are altered almost entirely to microcrystalline quartz, with some relict pseudomorphs of plagioclase phenocrysts and traces of earlier-formed hydrothermal chlorite and pyrite. These acid-altered zones are usually only some tens of meters thick and deeper rocks lack such silicification. The acid fluids responsible for their formation could either be magmatic volatiles, or could be formed during production (e.g. reaction of water and salts forming hydrogen chloride by hydrolysis at high temperatures). The very high boron content of the fluids produced by the Los Humeros wells suggests that their ultimate source is most likely magmatic gases. However, these acid gases did not react widely with the rocks. We suggest that the silicified zones are forming locally where colder descending waters are encountering superheated (or possibly supercritical) steam containing acid gas, thus forming low pH liquids that react with the reservoir rocks.",

            "abstract": "Increases in turbidity in shallow coastal bays typically occur in response to resuspension of bed sediment driven by the interaction between wind-generated waves and the bay bottom. The mass and grain size of resuspended sediment at any location in a bay are strongly controlled by local bed properties. This suggests that spatial variations in bed properties, such as grain size, porosity and erodibility, should be reflected in spatial patterns of turbidity. Unfortunately, knowledge of bed properties in coastal bays is typically sparse at best. In this study we address two related questions: 1) how best to estimate the spatial distribution of bed properties in shallow coastal bays; and 2) how does the spatial distribution of bed properties affect the spatial pattern of wave-driven turbidity? We explored these questions using field observations and the Delft3D coastal hydrodynamic and sediment transport model for a system of shallow coastal bays on Virginia’s Atlantic coast. This system comprises bays of varying geometry with similar wind and tidal forcing. We found a strong relationship between water residence time and measured grain size. We leveraged the relationships between residence time and grain size fractions to map the spatial distribution of grain size throughout the system based on a recent mapping of residence times for the Virginia coastal bays. This spatially varying map of grain size was used as the initial bed conditions for 2-month-long runs of Delft3D forced with measured wind and tides. The resulting patterns of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and turbidity differ dramatically from those obtained from simulations with an initially spatially homogeneous bed, with high wave-driven SSC near the mainland in the non-uniform case but high SSC near the inlets for the uniform case. The pre- and post-simulation bed properties are compared to each other and with measured bed properties to investigate how close the residence-time generated bed is to equilibrium bed conditions.",

            "abstract": "Mountain flows have been studied for several decades now and it is safe to say that their main features are well understood under steady conditions and over idealized terrain. The Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) program was designed to better understand atmospheric fluid dynamics across all scales over realistic mountainous terrain as well as under transient and steady conditions. As part of MATERHORN, a large field campaign was conducted in May 2013. The main study area, a playa site, covers an area of several hundred square kilometers. It is mostly devoid of vegetation, characterized by a flat surface, shallow water table and a heterogeneous soil moisture spatial distribution even in dry conditions. Recent studies have shown that soil moisture plays a critical role in the dynamics of mountain flows, but a detailed understanding of these has not been sufficiently quantified. The objectives of this study are thus: 1) to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture on the playa site; 2) to describe how soil moisture affects the surface energy balance; 3) to identify the key controlling mechanisms on evaporation after a rain event in an arid area; 4) to explore the existence of nocturnal evaporation and investigate its main driving factors. To do this, we applied the gravimetric method to measure volumetric water content in the surface soil layer (0 – 2 cm and 4 – 6 cm) twice per 24-h intensive observation period at 17 sites evenly distributed on a 180 x 240 m grid. Near-surface atmospheric variables as well as ground heat-flux were also measured by a flux tower located close to the soil sampling sites. Preliminary data analysis reveals that the highest spatial variability in surface soil moisture is found under dry conditions. Our results also show that decreasing surface albedo with increasing soil moisture sustained a powerful positive feedback loop promoting large evaporation rates. Finally, it was found that while nocturnal evaporation was negligible during dry time periods, it was quite significant (up to 30% of the daily cumulative flux) during nights following rain events. Overall this study allows us to better understand the mechanisms underlying soil moisture dynamics in desert playas as well as evaporation following occasional rain events.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrate, an ice-like clathrate of water and methane, forms in shallow continental slope sediments, and is both a potential energy source and geologic hazard. Hydrates presence is traditionally inferred from the presence of the bottom simulating reflector (BSR), a seismic velocity inversion resulting from free gas pooling at the base of the hydrate stability field. The BSR is not a measure of hydrate, but rather a proxy for free gas presence. Whereas seismic methods are sensitive to velocity anomalies, controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods are sensitive to conductivity anomalies. The electrically resistive methane hydrate makes a favorable target for CSEM surveys, which are capable of detecting and potentially quantifying the presence of methane hydrate directly. Building on previous work 100km to the south in the San Nicolas Basin, we present initial results from a 6-day June 2014 survey in the Santa Cruz Basin, located 100km west of Los Angeles.\nCSEM surveys are performed by deep-towing an EM source that is transmitting a known signal; this signal is detected by towed and seafloor receivers. The initial EM source signal is altered by the electrical properties of the surrounding environment. Conductors such as brine and seawater are attenuating mediums, while resistors such as methane hydrate, gas, and oil are preservative of the original signal. Twenty-one seafloor receivers, as well as a 4 receiver towed array were deployed to image the resistivity structure of the Santa Cruz Basin.\nUsing 30-year-old 2D seismic profiles as a guide, potential hydrate targets were identified, and the transmitter and array were towed over 150 km on 6 lines with 5 seafloor receivers each. The 6 towed lines were coincident with legacy seismic lines. The towed array is sensitive to sediment depths less than 1km, allowing for high data density through the hydrate stability field. The larger transmitter-receiver offsets of the seafloor receivers allow sensitivity to at least 3km below the seafloor. Combining the two data sets allows for both high resolution in the near-seafloor hydrate accumulations as well as imaging the potential gas-source regions of the hydrate field.",

            "abstract": "The bifurcated structure of the current sheet in the mid tail (X~-20 RE) has been reported in several in-situ observational studies. The presented study examines a spatial distribution of current densities that statistically infer a thick bifurcated current sheet as a typical structure in the near-Earth tail (X=-8 to -12 RE). The current density is evaluated by using any two of THEMIS spacecraft measurements when certain conditions, such as spacecraft separation and orientation, are strictly met. A survey from 2007 to 2013 results in approximately 3000 current densities, which made it possible to study north-south profile of the current sheet. The peak of the current density is often found 0.5 RE to 1 RE off the magnetic equator, while the median half-thickness of the current sheet is approximately 3 RE. These indicate that the current sheet is thick and bifurcated on average. Presumably, owing to this non-uniform profile, local current densities sometimes become very intense. The intense current density preferentially occurs during growth phase and expansion phase of substorms, but also occur in quiet time. The intense current densities are found to be independent from the solar wind dynamic pressure. It is concluded that the intense current density is not caused by the compression of the plasma sheet. Other mechanisms need to be suggested to fully understand the structure and the evolution of the current sheet in the near-Earth tail.",

There are large uncertainties in the estimates of direct radiative forcing of BC and dust, which range from 0.2 to 0.9 W m-2 for BC (Bond et al., 2013) and 0.07 to 0.31 W m-2 in the long waves for dust (IPCC, 2007). BC and dust deposited on snow can significantly reduce the surface albedos and further affect the regional hydrological cycle. In the western U.S. (WUS), mountain snowmelt accounts for over 70% of the annual fresh water supply, which is facing severe challenges in the region recently. Transpacific transport of Asian emissions is likely becoming an even larger contributor to the fine particulate matter in the WUS in spring, as the Asian emissions are increasing under the rapid economic development in this region. We thus intend to better understand the radiative forcing effects of BC and dust in the atmosphere and snow in the WUS using an offline coupled 3-D global chemical transport model with a radiative transfer model. With improved dust and BC emissions and dust particle size distributions, we would like to quantify the relative contributions from different sources and source regions to the radiative forcing of BC and dust.",

            "abstract": "Forest managers sometimes harvest burned trees after wildfires to realize economic value, reduce fuel loads, or achieve other operational goals. This logging can be controversial because some ecosystem effects are negative, yet the potential impacts on erosion rates have not been clearly identified. Our objectives were to quantify hillslope-scale erosion rates and compare the hillslope erosion rates to rates from larger (swale) and smaller (rill) scales. Soil characteristics, vegetative regrowth, and erosion rates were measured in logged areas and unlogged controls at seven severely burned sites in the western US. One site had replicated measurements at all three scales, five sites had only hillslope or swale scale measurements, and one site had only rill measurements. Erosion rates from hillslopes (70-170 m2) and swales (0.1-2.6 ha) were measured with sediment fences. Rill erosion rates were measured with rill experiments, where water was applied to a hillslope at five flow rates for 12 min each; water samples were collected at a point 9 m downslope.\nAt the hillslope scale the passage of heavy logging equipment reduced soil water repellency, compacted the soil, reduced vegetative regrowth rates, and generally increased erosion rates by one or two orders of magnitude relative to the controls. The rill experiments also showed greater rates of rill incision and erosion from the areas disturbed by heavy logging equipment relative to the controls. At the swale scale erosion rates were higher in the logged areas than the controls when measurements were replicated and simultaneous but there was no detectable change in the other study areas. Overall, the absolute erosion rates from both logged and unlogged areas tended to decline over time while the relative difference in erosion tended to increase due to the slower vegetative recovery in the more heavily disturbed areas. The potential adverse effects of salvage logging can be minimized by reducing compaction and increasing cover on the most heavily disturbed areas, and minimizing the convergence and connectivity between these areas and the stream network.",

            "abstract": "Since the initiation of tomographic studies in the 1970s, geoscientists have advanced the art of inferring 3D variations in the subsurface using collections of geophysical (primarily seismic) observables recorded at or near Earth’s surface. Advances have come from improvement and enhancement of the available data and from research on theoretical and computational improvements to tomographic and generalized inverse methods. In the last decade, utilizing dense array datasets, these efforts have led to unprecedented 3D images of the subsurface. Understandably, less effort has been expended on model validation to provide an absolute assessment of model uncertainty. Generally models constructed with different data sets and independent computational codes are assessed with geological reasonability and compared other models to gain confidence. The question of “How good is a particular 3D geophysical model at representing the Earth’s true nature?“ remains largely unaddressed at a time when 3D Earth models are used for both societal and energy security. In the last few years, opportunities have arisen in earth-structure imaging, including the advent of new methods in computational seismology and statistical sciences. We use the unique and extensive High Performance Computing resources available at Los Alamos National Laboratory to explore approaches to realistic model validation.\nWe present results from a study focused on validating a 3D model for the western United States generated using a joint inversion simultaneously fitting interpolated teleseismic P-wave receiver functions, Rayleigh-wave group-velocity estimates between 7 and 250 s period, and high-wavenumber filtered Bouguer gravity observations. Validation of the obtained model is performed through systematic comparison of observed and predicted seismograms generated using the Spectral Element Method, which is a direct numerical solution for full waveform modeling in 3D models, with accuracy of spectral methods.",

            "abstract": "Rheology of the lower crust has often been compared to the creep properties of polycrystalline anorthite. Samples that have been used in previous studies (Dimanov et al., 1999; Rybacki and Dresen, 2000) were prepared through crystallization of anorthite glass which can remain in the experiment and also contain some impurities such as absorbed water, TiO2, MgO and Fe2O3. In this study, we synthesized genuinely pure polycrystalline anorthite using the technique that does not allow the contamination of water and glass phase. Also, we prepared anorthite aggregates with glass phase and/or a small amount (1wt%) of MgO to investigate the creep properties of pure and impure anorthite aggregates.\n Pure anorthite powders were prepared through high temperature reaction of highly pure and nano-sized powders of CaCO3, Al2O3 and SiO2 and then they were vacuum sintered (Koizumi et al., 2010). For MgO doping, we added Mg(OH)2powders at the synthesis of anorthite powders. Glass phase was introduced to the samples by sintering above melting temperature and subsequent quenching. Constant load tests under 1 atmosphere were performed at temperatures ranging from 1150 to 1380˚C and stresses of 10 to 120 MPa. We measured Arithmetic mean grain size of specimens by microstructural observations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after creep tests.\n Grain sizes of all the specimens were around 1 μm before and after the creep test. Log stress versus log strain rate showed a linear relationship where its slope gave a stress exponent, n of 1, indicating that all the samples were deformed under diffusion creep. Anorthite containing MgO and glass phase were more than two and one orders of magnitude weaker than genuinely pure anorthite aggregates, respectively. Further, our pure aggregate exhibited three orders of magnitude lager strength compared to the “pure” aggregate used in previous studies. These results indicate that a small amount of glass and/or impurities including water have a great influence on the strength of polycrystalline anorthite aggregates.",

            "abstract": "Soil CO2 efflux (RS) is an important component of forest ecosystem carbon budgets and net ecosystem CO2 exchange, but little is known about how RS and its components respond to decreasing soil moisture and changes in soil fertility. The experiment design was a 2 X 2 factorial combination of fertilization (2 levels) and precipitation (throughfall exclusion, 2 levels) replicated in four blocks. We measured RS along with soil temperature (Ts) and soil moisture (WS) from 2012 to 2014 in a loblolly pine plantation in Washington, GA. The autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic (RH) components of soil CO2 efflux were separated using trenched plots. Our objectives were to (1) quantify impacts of throughfall exclusion and fertilization on RS and its components (RA, RH).and (2) determine soil CO2efflux and its components individually response to environmental factors and biological factors in throughfall exclusion and fertilization treatments.\nAnnual mean RS was 2.11, 1.73, 2.09 and 1.92 for treatments of control, fertilization, throughfall exclusion and combination of fertilization and throughfall exclusion, respectively, from 2012 to 2013. The apparent Q10 for RS was 2.26, 2.25, 2.12 and 2.35 in the four treatments, respectively. There were no significant differences in RS among treatments except between the Ws treatments. However, there was slight reduction in RS and RA in fertilization and the fertilization plus throughfall exclusion treatment. In all treaments, Ts explained more than 80% of variation in RS. The contribution of CO2-derived from ectomycorrhizal hyphae was less than 15%. RS and RH was better predicted by TS in the dormant season than the growing season, indicating that additional factors such as root growth and photosynthesis became more important contributors to RS during the growing season. Fertilization slightly decreased RS mainly from a decrease in RH. Throughfall exclusion increased the contribution of RA to RS. We concluded that soil moisture had more effect on RS and its components than changes in fertility.",

            "abstract": "Earth system model experiments suggest that ecosystem changes in the Northern Hemisphere could influence climate over the Southern Hemisphere, or vice versa. In reality, whether an ecosystem change could have a detectable influence on climate variability in remote regions is not clear. Direct validation of such an influence based on available climate records is not feasible largely because we cannot isolate the influences of ecosystems from more dominant sources of climate variability from ocean and atmosphere. However, our observational analysis suggests that the variability of wet season onset over the Amazonia, which is significantly influenced by evapotranspiration of the rainforest, could influence the demise of the North American monsoon. Such a remote influence appears to be carried out by the influence of the Amazonia rainfall on the cross-equatorial flow and latitudinal propagation of the atmospheric waves, which in turn, influence wind and moisture transport over the North American monsoon region. These results suggest that perhaps the future reduction of evapotranspiration due to CO2 fertilization and large-scale land use over the Amazonia will not only delay the wet season onset over this region, but also impact the demise of the North American monsoon.",

            "abstract": "We compared evapotranspiration (ET) estimates in Jordan calculated by four theoretically-different methods. The first method was the FAO Single Crop Coefficient method. Our calculation took into account 20 dominant crop species in Jordan, utilized the global Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data set, and generated spatially heterogeneous crop coefficients. The second approach was the Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land (SEBAL) method. It was used with Landsat TM/ETM+ images to calculate instantaneous ET at the moment of satellite overpass, and the results of multiple images were combined to derive seasonal and annual ET estimates. The third method was based on the 1-km land surface ET product from MODIS, which was calculated using MODIS-observed land cover and photosynthetically active radiation. The fourth method was based on the SWAT model, which combines the Penman-Monteith equation and vegetation growth to estimate daily ET rates at the watershed scale. The results show substantial differences in both magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of ET estimates across different regions from the four methods. Such differences were particularly evident in the Highlands region, where irrigation plays a critical role in local water balance. Results also suggest that land cover data is a major source of uncertainty in estimating regional ET rates. Although it is difficult to conclude which method was more reliable due to the limited availability of validation data, the results suggest caution in developing and interpreting ET estimates in this arid environment.",

            "abstract": "The Azores archipelago is located at the triple junction between the North American, African and Eurasian plates, in an area dominated by transtensive tectonic. The magmatism is concentrated along elongated volcanic ridges, generally orthogonal to the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR), where central volcanoes alternate with fissure zones. In order to better understand the relationships between the regional and local tectonics and the magmatism, we carried out a systematic study of basaltic pyroclasts from monogenic Strombolian cones built up on both fissure zones and central volcanoes, on five Azores Islands. We combined the major and trace element geochemistry of bulk rocks, melt inclusions and minerals with microthermometric data of coexisting CO2-rich fluid inclusions. These latter, trapped in Fo88-82 olivines, reveal pressure decrease from west to east for each ridge, but the highest pressures are recorded by fluids trapped in mineral assemblage forming ultramafic cumulates (dunites, harzburgites and wehrlites). All these results fully confirm variable depths of the Moho Transition Zone (MTZ), which marks the upper limit for underplating and correspond to the magma ponding zones where the main processes of magmatic evolution occur. The MTZ is located at 25 km beneath Flores Island, on the North American plate, and 29.5 km beneath the island of São Miguel, 380 km eastward. It reaches a minimum (18.5 km depth) under Faial at ~120 km east of the MAR. In these pressure conditions, the volatile composition is XH2O =0.1 and XCO2=0.9, at 1155-1175 °C, under QFM redox conditions. The maximum dissolved volatile content achieves 1.8-1.9 wt% of H2O and 0.4-0.5 wt% of CO2 in the central archipelago, and 2.3-2.6 wt% of H2O and 0.8-1.0 wt% of CO2 at São Miguel. However, the total pressures (PCO2+PH2O) and the dissolved H2O content recorded by melt inclusions are commonly underestimated. The initial H2O content of the basaltic magmas characteristic of each volcanic system was re-assessed from the maximum value of the H2O/Ce ratio, and their degassing paths calculated during their transfer in the crust, where fluid inclusions indicated the presence of small ponding areas. We used these data to discuss the influence of the different tectonic settings, associated to the studied systems, on the magma degassing paths.",

            "abstract": "Haphazard urban development may have far reaching impacts not only around the urban vicinity but also across regional and perhaps global scales. To investigate urban change and impacts, the PO PLain EXperiment (POPLEX) was conducted in May 2014. The focus of POPLEX was to conduct the most effective study, by closely coordinating the field campaign with the science team in different zones of the Po Plain in northern Italy, and also with an extension to Florence in the Tuscany region. Northern Italy is one of the most populated areas in Europe and most of its cities registered an urban sprawl pattern in the 2000s. In this view, the POPLEX domain represents a pertinent “pilot area” to identify environmental impacts due to urban sprawl. This is to identify and understand the influence of urban characteristics and urban change on important environmental topics such as: (a) groundwater resource quality assessment and management, (b) air quality assessment, and (c) temperature assessment. POPLEX involved 25 participants from 15 institutions from 5 countries using data from 12 satellites and extensive field networks including approximately 220 meteorological stations, 170 air monitoring stations, hundreds of groundwater monitoring wells, and 20 river gauges together with demographic census data and detailed survey maps of land cover and land use. Innovative processing, with the Dense Sampling Method and Rosette Transform applied to satellite scatterometer data, has allowed a successful development of a spatially and temporally consistent dataset delineating urban extension and thus to monitor the annual rate of changes, in each pixel of a 1-km grid, throughout the decade of 2000s across the landscape without spatial gaps. Such dataset enables the introduction of the time dimension into dynamic analyses combining both anthropogenic and natural factors including atmospheric, geophysical, and hydrogeological characteristics of each study area. Initial results have been obtained and will be presented on: (i) accelerated urbanization gradient in Milan transition areas, (ii) air pollution over urban areas and its constrain in the Po Plain surrounded by mountains, (iii) water contaminations due to urbanization in Lombardy, and (iv) hot-spot urbanization pattern of new built-up pockets in the Florence-Prato plain.",

            "abstract": "Geyser eruption cycles can be influenced by adjacent and distant thermals sources, suggesting a hydraulic connection through permeable pathways. Diffusion of fluid pressure can be responsible for the communication between geysers. In this study we examine the processes linking two different geysers with adjacent thermal pools. The first was Vega Rinconada, located at El Tatio geyser field, Chile, where we measured temperature inside the conduit between the ground surface and a depth of seven meters, at one-meter intervals. The second was Lone Star Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, where we measured temperature of the overflow water at the base of the cone. Concurrently, we measured temperature and the water level in pools adjacent to both geysers. We found common elements in both geyser – pool systems: First, water temperature in both adjacent pools was below the boiling point and cooler than water in the geysers. Second, changes in pool water levels were correlated with eruptions of the geysers. During the quiescent period of the geysers, the water level increased in adjacent pools, while water level in the pools deceased during eruptions. Additionally, measurements inside of the conduit in Vega Rinconada Geyser showed that water temperature increased in the deepest part of the conduit during eruptions, while water temperature decreased in the shallow part of the geyser conduit (~1 to 2 m). These drops in temperature in the shallow conduit were coincident with the drop in water level in the adjacent pool. This suggests that after the initiation of an eruption, water may drain from the pool to the geyser. Furthermore, we observed a temperature drop of 3oC in the shallow conduit immediately preceding the end of an eruption. This suggests that flow from the pool to geyser contributes to eruption shut off. Our observations of geyser-pool systems indicate a hydrologic connection between the geysers and their adjacent pools. In the case of Vega Rinconada, cold water drains from the pool to geyser. The Vega Rinconada pool thereby not only records changes in geysers activity, but may also modulate the duration of eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) can acquire imagery of crop fields in various spectral bands, including the visible, near-infrared, and thermal portions of the spectrum. By combining techniques of computer vision, photogrammetry, and remote sensing, these images can be stitched into precise, geo-registered maps, which may have applications in precision agriculture and other industries. However, the utility of these maps will depend on their positional accuracy. Therefore, it is important to quantify positional accuracy and consider the tradeoffs between accuracy, field site setup, and the computational requirements for data processing and analysis. This will enable planning of data acquisition and processing to obtain the required accuracy for a given project.\nThis study focuses on developing and evaluating methods for geo-registration of raw aerial frame photos acquired by a small fixed-wing UAS. This includes visual, multispectral, and thermal imagery at 3, 6, and 14 cm/pix resolutions, respectively. The study area is 10 hectares of soybean fields at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University. The dataset consists of imagery from 6 separate days of flights (surveys) and supporting ground measurements. The Direct Sensor Orientation (DiSO) and Integrated Sensor Orientation (InSO) methods for geo-registration are tested using 16 Ground Control Points (GCPs). Subsets of these GCPs are used to test for the effects of different numbers and spatial configurations of GCPs on positional accuracy. The horizontal and vertical Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used as the primary metric of positional accuracy. Preliminary results from 1 of the 6 surveys show that the DiSO method (0 GCPs used) achieved an RMSE in the X, Y, and Z direction of 2.46 m, 1.04 m, and 1.91 m, respectively. InSO using 5 GCPs achieved an RMSE of 0.17 m, 0.13 m, and 0.44 m. InSO using 10 GCPs achieved an RMSE of 0.10 m, 0.09 m, and 0.12 m. Further analysis will identify the optimal spatial configuration and number of GCPs needed to achieve sub-meter RMSE, which is considered a benchmark for precision agriculture purposes. Additional benefits of superior positional accuracy will also be explored.",

Although the two spacecraft were unable to operate simultaneously we present measurements from both spacecraft of energetic electrons in low-earth orbit, specifically near the bounce and drift loss cones.\nWe present an analysis of the energy characteristics of the precipitation observed on the spacecraft looking at variations in the energy spectra, both in terms of location but also taking into account the slow rotation of the spacecraft owing to its passive magnetic stabilization. This slow rock results in a sampling of a range of pitch angles with the detectors, and a consequent variation in energy spectra. We discuss both the physical ramifications of the measurements as well as instrumental challenges and opportunities intrinsic to making the measurement in a CubeSat.",

            "abstract": "Climate feedbacks from soils can result from environmental change and subsequent responses of plant and microbial communities and nutrient cycling. Explicit consideration of microbial life history traits and strategy may be necessary to predict climate feedbacks due to microbial physiology and community changes and their associated effect on carbon cycling. In this study, we developed an explicit microbial-enzyme decomposition model and examined model performance with and without representation of dormancy at six temperate forest sites with observed soil efflux ranged from 4 to 10 years across different forest types. We then extrapolated the model to all temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere (25-50°N) to investigate spatial controls on microbial and soil C dynamics. Both models captured the observed soil heterotrophic respiration (RH), yet no-dormancy model consistently exhibited large seasonal amplitude and overestimation in microbial biomass. Spatially, the total RH from temperate forests based on dormancy model amounts to 6.88PgC/yr, and 7.99PgC/yr based on no-dormancy model. However, no-dormancy model notably overestimated the ratio of microbial biomass to SOC. Spatial correlation analysis revealed key controls of soil C:N ratio on the active proportion of microbial biomass, whereas local dormancy is primarily controlled by soil moisture and temperature, indicating scale-dependent environmental and biotic controls on microbial and SOC dynamics. These developments should provide essential support to modeling future soil carbon dynamics and enhance the avenue for collaboration between empirical soil experiment and modeling in the sense that more microbial physiological measurements are needed to better constrain and evaluate the models.",

            "abstract": "In the lowermost Jurassic, following the end-Triassic mass extinction, coupled positive δ34S and δ13C excursions indicate elevated rates of organic carbon burial. These coupled excursions have been most widely interpreted to result from ocean anoxia driven by warming induced via CO2 effusion from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). Yet, recent stratigraphic correlations suggest the positive excursions corresponded with an interval – identified by paleosol proxy data – during which pCO2 dropped below pre-extinction baseline levels following the cessation of CAMP activity. If so, the positive δ13C excursion could not have been directly related to CAMP induced warming, nor the pCO2 undershoot driven by enhanced drawdown of carbon by weathering of fresh CAMP basalts. The enhanced weathering of silicate rock can cause a reduction in pCO2, but it cannot increase the ratio of Corg to Ccarb burial – a prerequisite for an increase in δ13C value of the ocean. Here we use a carbon cycle model to test whether the establishment of anoxic marine conditions can account for both the positive δ13C excursion and pCO2 undershoot indicated by the paleosol proxy record. Anoxia leads to high rates of organic carbon burial because it is sustained by enhanced remineralization of phosphate within sulfidic bottom waters. Enhanced return of phosphate to the marine water column fuels further productivity, resulting in the stabilization of anoxia even in the face of rising pO2 and a declining supply of phosphate from weathering. We parameterize this behavior in the model by imparting hysteresis to the C:P burial ratio of sediments such that it remains high even as pCO2 declines past baseline levels, resulting in a pCO2 undershoot accompanying the positive carbon isotope excursion. This interpretation of the data suggests that the negative feedbacks that respond to warming may overcompensate, resulting not in a smooth exponential decay, as the recovery is often modeled, but rather in a non-linear response.",

By contrast to other magnetized planets having large scale dynamo driven magnetic fields Mercury has a quadrupolar field large enough to reinforce the dipolar field at high northern latitudes and to shape the topology of the planetary field in the equatorial region and the southern hemisphere. Magnetic reconnection at Mercury is extremely effective for all IMF orientations [DiBraccio et al., JGR, 2013]. Global hybrid simulations by Richer et al. (2012) have demonstrated the dramatic influence of the quadrupolar field of Mercury on the topology of the Hermean magnetosphere. Then Chanteur et al.

Annual biogenic emissions in Texas ranked first within the continental United States in the 2011 National Emission Inventory. In recent years, the effects of drought in Texas have been among the most severe in the southern United States; during 2011, more than 80% of the state was under exceptional drought. Understanding the effects of drought on vegetation and biogenic emissions is important as the state concurrently faces requirements to achieve and maintain attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in several large metropolitan areas. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) has been utilized extensively for the estimation of biogenic emissions on global and regional scales. This research investigates the interannual variability in leaf area index and isoprene and monoterpene emissions estimates from MEGAN in eastern Texas climate regions with diverse climatology and land cover. In MEGAN, the adjustment to emissions from a standardized set of environmental conditions is determined using a multiplication of individual activity factors for leaf age, soil moisture, and the canopy environment. The research also interprets and quantifies differences in environmental activity factors between years with extreme to exceptional drought and average to above average precipitation in eastern Texas and identifies influences on biogenic emissions estimates from MEGAN.",

            "abstract": "Super typhoon (ST) Haiyan killed more than 6,000 and destroyed over a million dwellings in the central Philippines. It is the deadliest typhoon in the Philippines superseding the November 1991 Tropical Storm Thelma disaster in Ormoc City, on the western coast of Leyte Island. Damage and losses from ST Haiyan were particularly high along the coasts surrounding the shallow and funnel-shaped San Pedro Bay, including the coastal city of Tacloban. The first storm surge reconnaissance was conducted from 23 to 28 November 2013 in areas surrounding San Pedro Bay. Follow up surveys were conducted in January, May and June to cover larger and more remote coastlines in Samar Island facing the Leyte Gulf and the Philippine Sea. Digitized local bathymetric charts and Delft3D Flow were used to generate a coupled surge-tide-wave model to simulate the surge heights within San Pedro Bay. We corroborated eyewitness accounts, video recordings, and simulations with field measurements to characterize ST Haiyan’s inundation with flow depths, surge heights, timing and peak flood duration, and resulting damage extent. We also compared the surge heights from ST Haiyan with a similar event from an unnamed typhoon in October 1897 (Ty 1897). Strong winds estimated to be in excess of 280 km h-1 and a ‘tsunami-like’ surge with heights typically ranging from 5 m up to 7 m struck in the early hours of 8 November 2013. According to eyewitness accounts this represents an event in the region of unprecedented magnitude. Historical records, however, clearly indicate that Tacloban and nearby coastal communities were similarly devastated by another typhoon in 1897. The 1897 typhoon crossed the Philippines on a similar path of destruction, almost parallel to ST Haiyan but about 10 to 15 km farther north. Ty 1897 seemed less intense than ST Haiyan but generated a storm surge of comparable magnitude. Inundation heights in 1897 exceeded 4 m in most places with a maximum of 7 m. The Ty 1897 estimated death toll of 1228 corresponds to a similar fatality rate as Haiyan, given the massive population growth between the two events. This historical event demonstrates that ST Haiyan is not unprecedented and highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge, historical awareness and education for appropriate hazard mitigation, response and evacuation.",

            "abstract": "Field monitoring of isotopes and isotope analyses have been used to approximate water travel time at hillslope scales. This paper introduces an alternate method for estimating a point-scaled transit time in a soil layer, namely hydrometric transit time (HTT). HTT uses hydrometric measurements to address both matrix flow and bypass flow. Soil matrix flux is approximated through integration of continuous soil moisture profiles and soil water computations. Free surface film modeling of unsaturated flow is used to estimate bypass flow. This flux and storage estimation scheme is applied to a steep hillslope using hydrometric measurements that were estimated over an 8-month period using a continuous daily approximation of soil moisture profiles. Transit times at several designated points are also evaluated using isotope analyses. Results show that rainfall strongly controls temporal fluctuations. This work highlights the potential role of HTT in revealing the spatial and seasonal variations in the transit time probability density function (PDF) along transects. Mean transit time does not sufficiently characterize transit time variations on a hillslope scale. Accumulated flux distributions identify distinct hydrologic contributions and efficient redistribution of soil water in the downslope area of the hillside.",

            "abstract": "A quite famous phrase in risk management “How safe is enough safe?” implies there exists a framing gap among experts, the general public and stakeholders. Scientific evidence that experts provide usually contains uncertainty, while the public tends to have the other type of qualitative local knowledge. As there is no zero-risk society, we have to build consensus on acceptable level of risk and trade-offs of risks based on expert knowledge and local knowledge. Therefore having a dialogue among them in the early stage of the policy process such as problem definition and agenda setting is essential to cultivate trust and to integrate their knowledge.\nTo this end, we especially pay attention to Joint Fact-finding (JFF). The tentative definition of JFF is that a promising strategy for experts, decision makers, and key public rights-holders and stakeholders from opposing sides of an issue to work together to resolve or narrow factual disputes over public policy issues. JFF process usually begins with identifying stakeholders and holding interviews with them to determine their interests. We call this step stakeholder analysis. Then we define the scope of the study including the required scientific evidence and the preliminary list of experts. After that, stakeholders jointly select experts to participate in the study, then they work together on what they would like to clear about scientific evidence. They finally get the common understanding and findings through these collaboration.\nWe applied the stakeholder analysis to the issue of groundwater in Obama City and the issues of hot spring water and geothermal power in Beppu City in Japan. We drew conclusions from these case studies to some extent but at the same time we found that the analysis method has a limitation in applying it to multiple nexus issues because the method based on stakeholders’ cognition. For example, in Obama case, we identified a lack of cooperation among stakeholders that especially agricultural sector who should have positive relationship with groundwater in nature is not involved in groundwater issue thoroughly. However, we could not enough furnish stakeholders with the framing of trade-offs between resources. Accordingly we need to raise awareness of stakeholders with scientific evidence of experts on the way of the stakeholder analysis.",

            "abstract": "Numerous investigations demonstrate that mantle convective processes affect the surface topography of the overriding plate. ‘Positive dynamic topography’ refers to the surface expression of mantle upwelling. An advecting wave of dynamic topographic surface uplift plate is thought to result from migration of North America relative to the Yellowstone hotspot. Advection of positive dynamic topography through an overriding plate disturbs the landscape by a combination of a change in surface uplift rate and tilting. Identification of dynamic topography’s contribution to evolution of the greater Yellowstone region’s landscape, however, is complicated by the polygenetic regional topography that results from glaciation, bimodal volcanism, Basin and Range extension, early Cenozoic arc volcanism, and Laramide contraction. Our model, which is parameterized to Yellowstone but doesn’t include climate variations, suggests contribution of the dynamic topography erosional signal should decrease from 0.1mm/yr to 0.5 mm/yr at a 100km radius from the hotspot uplift source. The cosmogenic chronology that we are building to constrain spatial patterns of incision in the Bighorn Basin indicates that there is differential incision occurring in the Bighorn basin. Rates vary from 2.8mm/yr in the western basin, which is closer to Yellowstone to 1.1mm/yr in the eastern basin. Global cooling and its effects at the Plio-Pleistocene transition is thought to be the dominant control on the region’s erosional regime. However, the magnitude of the contribution from Yellowstone dynamic topography to the regional landscape evolution is still unknown because published incision rates lack the resolution to differentiate between incision forcing mechanisms. Bedrock stream profile analysis is powerful tool for determining spatial patterns of surface deformation. We compare results for normalized channel steepness indices across various basins in the Central Rockies and Greater Yellowstone area with existing datasets to determine whether regional steepness patterns are associated with the proposed spatial distribution of dynamic topography.",

            "abstract": "It is not unusual to observe atmospheric eddies in satellite imagery of the marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds that characterize the summertime weather of the California coastal region and near-shore oceanic environment. The winds of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) over the ocean interact with the high terrain of prominent headlands and islands to create order-10 km scale areas of swirling air that can contain a cloud-free eye, 180-degree wind reversals at the surface over a period of minutes, and may be associated with mixing and turbulence between the high-humidity air of the MABL and the much warmer and drier inversion layer air above. However, synoptic and even subsynoptic surface weather measurements, and the synoptic upper-air observing network are inadequate, or in some cases, completely unable, to detect and characterize the formation, movement, and even the existence of the eddies. They can literally slip between land-based surface observation locations, or stay over the near-shore ocean environment where there may be no surface meteorological measurements. This study presents Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulations of these small-scale, terrain-driven, atmospheric features in the MABL from cases detected in GOES satellite imagery. The purpose is to use model output to diagnose the formation mechanisms, sources of vorticity, and the air flow in and around the eddies. Satellite imagery is compared to simulated atmospheric variables to validate features generated within the model atmosphere, and model output is employed as a surrogate atmosphere to better understand the atmospheric characteristics of the eddies. Model air parcel trajectories are estimated to trace the movement and sources of the air contained in and around these often-observed, but seldom‑measured features.",

The hydrographic structure of the upper water above the permanent thermocline may be classified into 4 principal types: (a) classic type (an almost isopycnic upper water); (b) stepwise type (with one or more small but significant step-increases in σθ  in the upper water); (c) graded type (an approximately constant depth gradient in a monotonic increase in σθ in the upper water); and (d) mixed type (a combination of the stepwise and graded types). The 4 types of upper water were found in 75, 14, 5, and 6% of the cruises, respectively. Ten schemes were applied to these data to determine the mixed layer depth (MLD): 4 fixed temperature difference (FTD) methods (0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0oC decrease from 10 m); 1 fixed density difference (FDD) method (0.125 σθ increase from 10 m); 1 fixed temperature gradient (FTG) method (at 0.05oC/m); 3 fixed density gradient (FDG) methods (at 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 σθ/m); and the maximum density gradient (MDG) method. MLD could not be clearly depicted in the 3 minor types of upper water. In the classical type, while similar MLD-s were found in a large majority of the cruises among all 10 methods, substantial discrepancies among methods could be found. The most consistent results, generally within ±5 m, were found among the FDG method at 0.05, 0.1 σθ/m and FTD method at 0.8 and 1.0oC. The MDG method gave consistently deeper MLD by ~8 m. If that difference was taken into account, the results were generally consistent with those from the other 4 methods. The remaining 5 methods could all yield MLD-s shallower than the first 4 methods by >10 m as they failed to capture the bottom of the mixed layer as indicated by visual inspection.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection accompanied by a pair of slow-mode shock waves, known as Petschek’s theory, has been widely studied as an efficient mechanism to convert magnetically stored energy to thermal and/or kinetic energy in plasmas. Satellite observations in the Earth’s magnetotail, on the other hand, report that the detection of slow shocks is rare compared with the theory. As an important step to bridge the gap between the observational fact and the Petschek-type reconnection, we performed one- and two- dimensional collisionless magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection paying special attention to the effect of temperature anisotropy. In high-beta plasmas such as a plasma sheet in the magnetotail, it is expected that even weak temperature anisotropy can greatly modify the dynamics.\nWe demonstrate that the slow shocks do exist in the reconnection layer even under the anisotropic temperature. The resultant shocks, however, are weaker than those in isotropic MHD in terms of plasma compression. In addition, the amount of magnetic energy released across the shock is extremely small, that is, the shock is no longer switch-off type. In spite of the weakness of the shocks, the reconnection rates measured by the inflow velocities are kept at the same level as the isotropic cases. Once the slow shock forms, the downstream plasma is heated in highly anisotropic manner, and the firehose-sense anisotropy affects the wave structure in the system. In particular, it is remarkable that the sequential order of propagation of slow shocks and rotational discontinuities reverses depending upon the magnitude of a superposed guide field.\nOur result is consistent with the rareness of the slow shock detection in the magnetotail, and implies that shocks do not necessarily play an important role. Furthermore, a variety of wave structure of a reconnection layer shown here will help interpretation of observational data in collisionless reconnection.",

            "abstract": "The Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions (TCRE) is a measure of the climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Recent studies have shown that the TCRE can be well approximated by a constant value for cumulative emissions up to about 2 TtC. However, there has been little attention given in the literature to how the TCRE varies across the range of emission rates represented by the current RCP emissions scenarios. Here we use an ensemble of climate model simulations to quantify how the TCRE varies as a function of both the total magnitude and also the rate of CO2 emissions. We show that the long-term temperature response to a pulse CO2 emission (1.81°C per TtC) does not depend on the magnitude of cumulative emissions up to 3 TtC. The transient response to constant emissions, when calculated at the point of doubled atmospheric CO2 (1.66°C per TtC), is also remarkably insensitive to the rate of emissions for emissions as high as 30 GtC per year. There is evidence, however, that for very high emission rates, the warming does not keep pace with the rate of emissions, and the TCRE tends to decrease with time, especially as cumulative emissions also increase. We conclude that the TCRE provides a robust estimate of the temperature response to CO2 emissions in RCP scenarios 2.6, 4.5 and 6, whereas a constant TCRE value significantly overestimates the temperature response to CO2 emissions in RCP 8.5.",

In meso/global scale models, urban parameterization schemes are used to represent the urban effects. However, these schemes require a large set of input parameters related to urban morphological and thermal properties. Obtaining all these parameters through direct measurements are usually not feasible. A number of studies have reported on parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis to adjust and determine the most influential parameters for land surface schemes in non-urban areas. Similar work for urban areas is scarce, in particular studies on urban parameterization schemes in tropical cities have so far not been reported.\nIn order to address above issues, the town energy balance (TEB) urban parameterization scheme (part of the SURFEX land surface modeling system) was subjected to a sensitivity and optimization/parameter estimation experiment at a suburban site in, tropical Singapore. The sensitivity analysis was carried out as a screening test to identify the most sensitive or influential parameters. Thereafter, an optimization/parameter estimation experiment was performed to calibrate the input parameter. The sensitivity experiment was based on the “improved Sobol’s global variance decomposition method” . The analysis showed that parameters related to road, roof and soil moisture have significant influence on the performance of the model. The optimization/parameter estimation experiment was performed using the AMALGM (a multi-algorithm genetically adaptive multi-objective method) evolutionary algorithm. The experiment showed a remarkable improvement compared to the simulations using the default parameter set. The calibrated parameters from this optimization experiment can be used for further model validation studies to identify inherent deficiencies in model physics.",

However, many studies have shown that flow characteristics, particularly the frequency spectrum of extreme hydrologic events,were modified by climate change and human activities and the conventional frequency analysis without considering the non-stationary characteristics may lead to costly design. The analysis presented in this paper was based on the more than 100 years of daily flow data from the Yichang gaging station 44 kilometers downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. The Mann-Kendall trend test under the scaling hypothesis showed that the annual low flows had significant monotonic trend, whereas an abrupt change point was identified in 1936 by the Pettitt test. The climate informed low flow frequency analysis and the divided and combined method are employed to account for the impacts from related climate variables and the nonstationarities in annual low flows. Without prior knowledge of the probability density function for the gaging station, six distribution functions including the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV), Pearson Type III, Gumbel, Gamma, Lognormal, and Weibull distributions have been tested to find the best fit, in which the local likelihood method is used to estimate the parameters. Analyses show that GEV had the best fit for the observed low flows. This study has also shown that the climate informed low flow frequency analysis is able to exploit the link between climate indices and low flows, which would account for the dynamic feature for reservoir management and provide more accurate and reliable designs for infrastructure and water supply.",

However, these solution falls short of following key features: A) Requires explicit policy definition such server load and therefore lacks any predictive intelligence to make optimal decision; B) Does not decide on the right size of resource and thereby does not result in cost optimal resource pool.\n\nIn a typical cloud deployment model, we consider two types of application scenario: A.

Classical queueing models applies to scenario where number of servers are constant. So we cannot apply stationary system analysis in this case. We investigate the following questions 1. Can we define Job queue and use the metric to define such a queue to predict the resource requirement in a quasi-stationary way? Can we map that into an optimal sizing problem? 2. Do we need to get into a level of load (CPU/Data) on server level to characterize the size requirement? How do we learn that based on Job type?",

This study has developed a Markov Chain model, which simulates the occurrence of daily rainfall using the transition probability of dry and wet days, while the precipitation for the wet days are generated using a two parameter gamma distribution. We have identified significant seasonal and intra- to inter-decadal variations of the model parameters at our field site. Incorporating the temporal variability (for instance, calibrating the model parameters to each decade independently), we have found that the model satisfactorily preserves the daily, monthly and annual characteristics of the NARCliM rainfall. In addition to the temporal variability, we have observed that the model parameters vary spatially at our site with potential orographic effects that vary both seasonally and decadally. However, the parameters of the model fitted to the NARCliM rainfall are significantly different from the parameters fitted to the ground-based climate station rainfall. Suitability of the model for the generation of long time series (e.g. 1000 years) required for reservoir simulation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Lake Chabot is a backup water supply source and it is important to know if the water is healthy because California is experiencing a drought. To check the quality of the water we used a submersible, waterproof thermometer to measure the temperature of the water at different depths. We hypothesized that the heat-island effect would cause the runoff from the surrounding developed areas to be warmer. This is because paving roads causes areas to become impermeable and absorb heat. Water runs off these impermeable surfaces, absorbing heat from the ground and enters larger bodies of water via stream. To locate streams we used a topography map. We located close lines followed by lines that were farther apart and then once again followed by close lines. This indicates that there is a concave area between two high points, allowing water to possibly flow through. We found that areas where the water came from highly populated areas were warmer.\nThe increase in temperature was shown throughout all depths of the water at each site that was measured. The temperature throughout the lake was in between 19°C and 25°C. This warm temperature makes it hard for gases to mix. The lower the dissolved oxygen level, the less desirable it is for a variety of organisms to survive. Higher temperatures also increase bacterial growth and can causes water to be unhealthy. This indicates that the water at Lake Chabot is not suitable for human consumption and should not be considered a suitable backup water source for our area.",

            "abstract": "It has long been suspected that nanoscale heterogeneity is responsible for colloid attachment to surfaces under conditions unfavorable to attachment. Recently, mechanistic colloid force and torque simulations have been applied to arrays of experimental data to back out nanoscale heterogeneity that is representative of the collector surface. These recent experiments were performed under flowing conditions with limited colloid attachment. This presentation explores whether surface heterogeneity backed out from experiments performed under conditions designed to maximize attachment (e.g., non-flowing followed by elution) yields a characteristic heterogeneity that can be reproduced on surfaces backed out under other conditions. The nature of attachment under flowing vs. non-flowing conditions differed for large (2.0 μm) relative to small (0.25 μm) colloids. For example, the maximum loading of small colloids was the same under flowing conditions versus non-flowing conditions followed by elution. The maximum loading of large colloids however was much lower under flowing conditions relative to non-flowing conditions followed by elution. This difference indicates a mechanism contributing to the attachment of large colloids that is not included in mechanistic force and torque balances. These possible mechanisms are reviewed and strategies to incorporate them are discussed. The reproducibility of attachments and their spatial distribution will also be examined.",

Although many models have been proposed[ e.g. reference 1-4], the mechanisms for the occurrences of the OAEs with extreme climates remain unclear. Here, we provide inorganic carbon isotope (δ13C), iron speciation chemistry and trace element records for the later Aptian and the Cenomannian OAEs in the Southern Tibet. Our results indicate that these OAEs in the Tibet were featured by extremely negative δ13Canomalies(-15‰~-35‰),rich LREE with Eu positive anomalies and low iron ratios which suggest oxic bottom water conditions for the depositions .Accordingly, we propose that large-scale releases of methane may have greatly consumed dissolved oxygen and other oxidants in the water columns with increasing carbon emissions, which may at least partially contributed to the multiple developments of the oceanic anoxia and extreme warming in the middle Cretaceous.\n",

            "abstract": "Severe drought has been a recurring phenomenon in the southwestern United States. Most climate models suggest that droughts will become more frequent in the future as climate changes in response to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and other radiative forcing species in the atmosphere. Drought-induced changes in natural and anthropogenically managed and cultivated land cover systems have the potential to affect air quality. Dry deposition refers to the process by which trace gases and particulates in the atmosphere are transferred to the Earth’s surface, including to soil, vegetation, and water, in the absence of precipitation. It is a primary physical removal mechanism for ozone during the warm spring through early fall seasons in Texas. As the state endeavors to achieve and maintain attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, it is important to understand the impacts of drought conditions on estimates of dry deposition. This research explores the interannual variations in predicted dry deposition velocities and component surface resistances of ozone in eastern Texas during 2006-2011, including years with severe to exceptional drought conditions (e.g. 2011) as well as years with average to above average precipitation patterns (e.g. 2007). Two widely used dry deposition algorithms that have been incorporated within the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), the photochemical grid model used to support air quality planning efforts in Texas, are used in offline simulations.",

(2013\n) developed a physically-based analytical spatial air temperature and humidity (PASATH) model to simulate microclimate of urban area. This model can provide spatial time series maps of air temperature, humidity, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux in spatial resolution of one hundred meters and temporal resolution of one hour. PASATH performed satisfactorily given its intended simplicity and low requirement on the inputs. The USDA Forest Service and the Davey Institute developed i-Tree Temperature model based on the PASATH model to complement the strength of the i-Tree suite of tools for urban forest analyses of structure and ecosystem services. The i-Tree temperature model was written in C++ with Objected Oriented Design (OOD). Improved functions were added to improve the simulation of heat flux resistances; new classes were incorporated to better control the inputs and outputs; new model structure was designed to advance the simulation efficiency; inputs formating were optimized to make it more user friendly. The model will be publicly available as a new i-Tree function in 2015 by the USDA Forest Service and the Davey Institute. It can be used to study urban heat island effects and investigate land cover and hydrology based mitigation methods; the simulated spatial maps of air temperature and humidity can provide inputs for other environmental models, including atmospheric models, ecosystem models, and hydrology models, for scientific studies of environmental and human health.",

This current plays an important role in the heat and salt transport in the northern North Pacific. We here focus on the northern edge of this current, which is characterized by the potential vorticity front, to detect the interannual variability of the current. As the result we found that potential vorticity front at the isopycnal surface of 26.8σθ, shifted latitudinally 1−2 degrees and 4−5 degrees in the area east and west of 170°W, respectively. This difference would be attributed to the relatively high eddy activity in the area west of 170°W.

The XRD data were collected in the pressure range from 0.0 to 5.9 GPa and the structural refinements based on single-crystal diffraction data were performed at 0.0, 1.8, 2.7, and 4.6 GPa. The unit-cell parameters were determined from the least-squares refinement of d-values of the observed 20 reflections. The a unit-cell parameter decreases continuously from 8.3908 (5) Å to 8.311 (7) Å3 up to 5.9 GPa. At 4.6 GPa, however, the crystal structure started to distort and the a axis of the cubic phase splits to a smaller a axis (ax = 8.3367 (6) Å ) and a longer c axis (az = 8.340 (1) Å). This change indicates a phase transition from a cubic (space group Fd-3m, Z = 8) to a tetragonal structure (space group I41/amd, Z = 4). The crystal structure after the phase transition has a body-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice constants a = 5.8949 (6) Å and c = 8.340 (1) Å. The crystal structure at 4.6 GPa was refined with a full-matrix least-squares refinement to R1 = 0.0148, wR2 = 0.0117 using observed 35 X-ray reflections. The tetrahedral (T) site is filled with 52.6% Cu2+ and 47.4% Fe3+ cations, whereas, the octahedral (M) site is with 3.7% Cu2+ and 96.3% Fe3+ cations. At the tetrahedral site, the tetrahedral O-T-O bond angles along the c-axis direction of the unit cell decreases slightly from 109.5° to 108.8 (1)°, which generates a 'stretched' tetrahedral geometry. The cubic-to-tetragonal transition is caused by the Jahn-Teller effect of Cu2+ cation giving rise to the angular distortion at the tetrahedral environment. In the octahedral site, on the other hand, the two M-O bonds parallel to the c-axis are more shortened than the four M-O bonds parallel to the the ab-plane. Consequently, the octahedral coordination changes a 'squeezed' octahedral geometry along the c-axis. With pressure, the anisotropic deformation of both the tetrahedral and octahedral coordinations leads to tetragonal compression of the unit cell (the c/a ratio < 1).",

            "abstract": "Precipitation alone is not sufficient to transform closed cellular circulation capped by stratocumulus cloud to open cellular circulation with cumulus clouds; observations often show high rainrates existing within the closed cell state. It has been suggested that the spatial distribution of precipitation plays an important role in the transition from closed-to-open convection but this hypothesis has to date not been rigorously tested. In this study, a series of idealized 3-dimensional simulations are conducted to evaluate the dependency of areal coverage of rain on the transformation, and to explore the role of interactions between multiple rainy areas in the formation of the open cell state. This is done by inserting a low aerosol concentration patch (or multiple patches separated by specified distance) into a non-precipitating closed cell state. We show that when rain is restricted to a small area, even significant rain does not result in a transition. The rain event is quickly filled in by adjacent non-precipitating closed cells and the rain ceases without significant trace. With increasing areal coverage of the rain, the transition becomes possible provided the rainrate is sufficiently large. When multiple rain regions interact with each other, the transition to the open cell state is reinforced over a wider area, provided the distance between the rain regions is small enough. When the distance between the rain areas is large, rainy areas are initially filled in by neighboring closed cells, but the transition eventually occurs, albeit slowly. These results suggest a connection to the remote control of open cell formation hypothesized in the recent past.",

            "abstract": "Particulate matter of size <2.5 µm (commonly referred to as PM2.5) is considered to be the best indicator of health risks due to exposure to particulate pollution. Unlike the decreasing trends in the developed countries, aerosol loading continues to increase over the Indian subcontinent in the recent past, exposing ~1.6 billion population at risk. Lack of direct measurements prompted us to utilize satellite data in establishing a robust long-term database of surface PM2.5 at high spatial resolution. The hybrid approach utilizes a chemical transport model to constrain the relation between columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface PM2.5 and establish mean monthly conversion factor. Satellite-derived daily AODs for the period 2000-2012 are then converted to PM2.5 using the conversion factors. The dataset (after validation against coincident in-situ measurements and bias-correction) was used to carry out the exposure assessment. 51% of the population is exposed to PM2.5 concentration exceeding WHO air quality interim target-3 threshold (35 µg m-3). The health impacts are categorized in terms of four diseases - cardio ortho-pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and lung cancer (LC). In absence of any region-specific cohort study, published studies are consulted to estimate risk. The risks relative to the background concentration of 10 µg m-3 are estimated by logarithmic fitting of the individual cohort studies against the corresponding PM2.5 concentration. This approach considers multiple (>100) cohort studies across a wide variety of adult population from various socio-economic backgrounds. Therefore, the calculated risks are considered to be better estimates in relative to any one particular type of risk function model (e.g. linear 50 or linear 70 or exponential). The risk values are used to calculate the additional mortality due to exposure to PM2.5 in each of the administrative districts in India to identify the vulnerable regions. 52.1% of the additional mortality is attributed to COPD, while the corresponding numbers for stroke, IHD and LC are 19.3%, 25.2% and 3.4% respectively. In absolute terms, an additional 0.6 million (with an uncertainty of ±20%) mortality per year is estimated in India due to exposure to outdoor PM2.5 in the last decade.",

            "abstract": "Topography and gravity data recovered by the MESSENGER mission have revealed the existence of 3–4 domical topographic swells on Mercury that are characterized by diameters of ~1000 km and coincident geoid highs. A number of mechanisms may explain the formation of these swells, including uplift associated with deep-seated buoyancy or voluminous intrusion of magma. A domical swell within the northern smooth plains (NSP), informally called the northern rise (NR), is perhaps a type example because, unlike the others, it is not obscured by large variations in crustal thickness. The floors of impact craters partially infilled by volcanic plains deposits are tilted by amounts that match the long-wavelength topographic slope, indicating that the growth of the rise largely postdates plains emplacement. Further, high values of low-degree admittance indicate that the NR is either supported by buoyancy near the base of the mantle or is elastically supported under top loading of the lithosphere. The latter of these two scenarios predicts compression at the NR and extension elsewhere in the NSP. The magnitudes of these surface stresses decrease with increasing lithospheric thickness.\nWe use horizontal surface strain, as accommodated by contractional landforms (primarily wrinkle ridges), as a proxy for the stress state subsequent to the emplacement of the NSP. Specifically, we consider the areal density of wrinkle ridges to reflect the distribution of horizontal stress-induced strains in the region. We do not observe higher ridge densities on the NR than across the rest of the NSP, which indicates that any stresses associated with top loading of the lithosphere were less than the global compressive stresses associated with the radial contraction of Mercury. If the NR did form through top loading, the elastic lithosphere must have been at least 100 km thick at the time of NR formation.\nFig. 1.

            "abstract": "Redistribution of air masses deforms the Earth's crust and results in vertical and horizontal displacements of the ground. We investigated whether such displacements were recorded in the time series of the Taiwan GPS network while typhoon Morakot impacted Taiwan, early August 2009. As Taiwan concentrates numerous GPS stations (presently nearly 400) over a rather small area (400x200 km), we stacked the time series of 165 GPS stations to increase the signal to noise ratio and compared it to the displacements computed at the same sites. We assumed this stacking method is adequate due to the wave length of the deformation induced by typhoon, which is about 4 times wider than Taiwan. However, stacking also increases the amplitude of the common mode errors in the GPS time series, and classical methods to remove them removed the typhoon signal as well. Thus, comparing the observations with estimated displacements is also a way to identify common mode errors. Estimated displacements were computed by convolving load Green functions of displacement with surface pressure data released in the frame of the Year Of Tropical Convection (YOTC) project. The best agreement between the observation and the model is obtained for the vertical component of the displacements, which reach 1+/-0.3 cm on August 6th, the day where Morakot made landfall in Taiwan. The horizontal displacements, both the East-West and the North-South components, are more difficult to identify. For the East-West component, we may observe the arrival of Morakot, from the East, with an eastward displacement of the GPS stations of about 1+/-1 mm. For the North-South component, as Morakot crossed Taiwan in its middle, we divided the stacked time series in two groups depending on the location of the GPS stations, North or South of Morakot path. These two groups of GPS diverged by less than 1 mm at most when Morakot was over Taiwan, yet the uncertainty on the data prevented from firmly concluding on this displacement. Therefore, thanks to a high concentration of GPS stations, typhoon-induced displacements were observed in Taiwan, at least in the vertical component.",

Children playing on these beaches are possibly at risk of exposure to mercury in beach sand through the ingestion pathway. As part of an investigation into this risk samples were collected from various locations along 7 of Sydney’s beaches where children typically would be exposed. Samples were dried and the sand fraction (i.e. >63 µm and <2 mm) analysed for total mercury using a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA-80) methodology. Risk of Exposure to mercury was assessed based on published estimates of daily ingestion of soil by children and Health Canada’s guideline of 105 ng Hg kg-1 BW d-1 exposure threshold. For the beaches sampled concentrations of total mercury in beach sand ranged from 0.6 to 58 ppb. The maximum concentrations of total mercury in beach sand were observed on Beach 6, in the vicinity of five storm water runoff sources. Daily mercury intake values were determined for two commonly used published values for daily ingestion of soil by children of 0.2 g soil d-1 and 1.75 g soil d-1. Results to date show the maximum daily intake calculated using an average child weight of 13 kg to be 7.8 ng Hg kg-1 BW d-1, well below the currently accepted daily intake threshold of 105 ng Hg kg-1 BW d-1.",

            "abstract": "To assess how terrestrial ecosystems react to climate change at different scales in a long term, in this paper, the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial carbon flux at global and continental scales were assessed and compared in the period 1911-2000. The 30-year running mean values results indicated that the terrestrial biosphere has been approximately neutral in 1911-1940 periods, and climate variability and change promoted absorbance of terrestrial carbon in 1941-1970 periods with 0.482 Pg C yr-1, while in 1971-2000, the sink effect weakened with 0.239 Pg C yr-1. Ecosystems in Europe and North America were estimated to have been absorbing carbon in the last 90 years. Savanna and temperate forest contributed the most to carbon uptake than other ecosystems, while most carbon release was induced by tropical forest. Ecosystems at northern mid-latitude north of the tropics have been sinks for atmospheric carbon, and the effect strengthened gradually in the past 90 years. By contrast, the South Temperate Zone appeared neutral for carbon in 1911-1970, while carbon accumulated significantly and amounted to 0.208 Pg C yr-1 in 1971-2000. The tropic zone appears to be a small net source of carbon in 1911-1940, and then carbon was accumulating in 1941-1970. However, in 1971-2000, a robust carbon source was formed. Due to the consistently rising global temperature and redistributed precipitation patterns, the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems changed with shrinking mid- and high latitude ecosystems, while expanding of ecosystems in temperate zones. Accordingly, the global terrestrial NPP increased during the past century, but it didn`t cause a substantial terrestrial carbon sink, for warming may enhance NPP, but also stimulates soil respiration. In general, the react of carbon flux of different terrestrial ecosystem varied a lot in response to climate change, and the generation or reversal of the terrestrial carbon sink caused by climate change itself may play a negative feedback to the climate system.",

            "abstract": "We review the recently published descriptive genetic classification for glaciovolcanoes (Russell et al., Quat Sci Rv, 2014). The new classification uses ‘tuya’ as a root word for all glaciovolcanic edifices, and with modifiers that make the classification descriptive (e.g., andesitic, lava-dominated, flat topped tuya). Although tuyas can range in composition from basaltic to rhyolitic, many of the characteristics diagnostic of glaciovolcanic environments are largely independent of lava composition (e.g., edifice morphology, columnar jointing patterns, glass distributions, pyroclast shapes). Tuya subtypes are first classified on the basis of variations in edifice-scale morphologies (e.g., conical tuya) then, on the proportions of the essential lithofacies (e.g., tephra-dominated conical tuya), and lastly on magma composition (e.g., basaltic, tephra-dominated, conical tuya). The lithofacies associations within tuyas broadly record the interplay between magmatic and glaciohydraulic conditions extent during the active phases of the eruption, including the dominant style of eruption (e.g., explosive vs. effusive). We present nine distinct, endmember models for glaciovolcanic edifices that simultaneously record changes in eruption conditions (explosive, transitional, effusive) for different general glaciohydraulic conditions (closed/sealed, leaky/partly sealed, open/well-drained). To date we have identified potential examples for 7 of the 9 models. Use of a simplified, descriptive classification scheme for glaciovolcanoes will facilitate communications amongst volcanologists and planetary scientists and the use of tuyas for recovering critical paleo-environmental information, particularly the local glaciohydraulics extent during eruptions.",

Even more, enhancing confidence in long-term stability of geological environment is required for geological disposal in Japan where is in active tectonic region. The aim of the study is to provide future direction for increasing GEMs confidence based on review of current GEMs.\nGEMs has been constructed in following three steps; 1) Features, Events and Processes (FEP) analysis, 2) Scenario development and 3) Numerical modeling. Base on the current status, we looked at the issues for developing GEMs with higher level of confidence. As the result, development of techniques and methodologies for; 1) validation of GEMs, 2) handling uncertainty and 3) digitalization/visualization are identified as open issues. To solve these issues, we specified three approaches. First approach is using multiple lines of evidence. Consistency between various study fields will be important information for validation of the GEMs. Second one is revealing the argument behind GEMs. Confidence/uncertainty of GEMs will be able to be confirmed by synthesizing the basic information behind the GEMs because GEMs are built on many evidences, hypothesis and assumptions. In addition, the optional cases will be needed for demonstrating the level of understanding. Third is development of elemental technology, such as the integrated system between numerical simulation and visualization which can take into account large size of model and composite phenomenon. In the future, we will focus on increasing GEMs confidence in keeping with this notion.\nThis study was carried out under a contract with METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) as part of its R&D supporting program for developing geological disposal technology.",

            "abstract": "Based on four radiosonde datasets and three reanalysis datasets, analyzed the long-term tropospheric temperature changes over China for the period 1958-2001 and the uncertainties. The results from all datasets except for HadAT2 and 20th Century Reanalysis data (20CR) show a significant warming trend in the lower-troposphere temperature averaged over China during 1958-2001, but this trend decreases with height and is replaced by a cooling tendency at 500hPa, reaching maximum cooling at 300hPa. The year-by-year changes of temperature over China are largely in agreement among the radiosonde and the reanalysis datasets. The uncertainties of upper-troposphere temperature changes are larger compared with those of the lower troposphere. The uncertainty was relatively small during 1970-1990 and large during 1958-1970 and from 1990 to the present. The trend uncertainty is large in the Northwest for the lower troposphere and in South China for the upper troposphere, with the largest trend uncertainty over Northwest China at 850hPa and east to 100ºE at 300hPa. For the average temperature trend over China, the largest uncertainty peaks at 300hPa for 1958-2001. The tropospheric temperature of China at 300hPa, derived from HadAT2, warms up; this differs greatly from the other datasets. The warming trend is produced mainly by the stations over South China and is due to the choice of neighbor stations during construction. The temperature trend at 300hPa in NCEP-NCAR is cooler than the other datasets due to its abrupt cooling around the early 1990s. 20CR can partly capture the cooling tendency at 300hPa over North China but with weaker magnitude.",

Observations of the wave and oscillatory activity can be used to examine the local physical parameters and equilibrium properties. Here we investigate the large amplitude oscillations in a prominence and a bundle of chromospheric loops, observed with SDO/AIA on the east solar limb on 22 September 2012. The oscillations are triggered by large scale coronal waves, associated with a large flare in remote active regions behind the solar limb. Time series of the oscillations, from which the oscillatory properties are extracted, are tracked with slits perpendicular to the solar surface. Then local physical parameters are obtained, based on the oscillatory and damping mechanisms, and the leakage of the oscillatory energy can also be estimated. Combined with observations of STEREO/EUVI, different locations of the prominence, the loops, and other non-oscillatory structures for contrast, are determined with SCC_MEASURE procedure. The comparison of influences of the coronal waves on these oscillatory and non-oscillatory structures reveals the variation of the properties of the coronal waves during their propagation.",

            "abstract": "The productive Gulf of Maine shelf system is generally divided into eastern and western regions based on hydrography. The eastern gulf exhibits weaker stratification, stronger tidal flows, periodic upwelling, and higher nutrient levels than the more stratified western gulf. We hypothesize that diatom fluxes and accumulation will be distinctly different between the east and west, reflecting the variable water column characteristics. While it has been shown that inter- and intra-annual variations exist between western and eastern gulf regions in terms of the mass flux of organic carbon and biogenic opal, the seasonal flux and deep-water delivery of diatoms has not been examined. In the present study, time-series sediment traps were deployed in Wilkinson and Jordan Basins (western and eastern gulf, respectively) to quantify the inter-annual variation of total and individual diatom species fluxes, as well as simultaneous particulate organic carbon (POC) and opal exports. Surface sediments at both locations were also collected and analyzed for diatom accumulation. Distinct inter-basinal differences were observed in which the mean, daily subsurface diatom (valve) flux measured in Jordan Basin was 4-fold greater than that for Wilkinson Basin. In both regions, Thalassionema nitzschioides was found to be a common species in all trap-collected samples, though the seasonal abundance levels of the species varied substantially between regions. Comparison of the species’ abundance in upper-water column traps to near-bottom traps revealed a strong depth-related decrease of T. nitzschioides in the eastern versus the western gulf. This finding may partially explain the similar percentage of T. nitzschioides in the surface sediments of both regions (~8.4% of total planktonic diatom valves) despite the greater upper water column fluxes in the east. We discuss implications of these data relative to the use of T. nitzschioides as a recent paleo-proxy of primary production in the gulf.",

            "abstract": "The hallmark of nonlinear complexity phenomena in plasmas as well as in all natural sciences is the appearance of intermittent fluctuating events. Such intermittent fluctuations are the results of the dynamic interactions of multiple coherent structures of varied sizes in stochastic media. We discuss here a unique procedure, the Rank-Ordered Multifractal Analysis (ROMA), that is both physically explicable and quantitatively accurate in deciphering the multifractal characteristics of intermittency. The generic character of the procedure provides a natural connection between the implicit spectrum based on parametric rank ordering and the one-parameter scaling idea of monofractals. Such an implicit multifractal spectrum has several advantages over the results obtainable using the conventional structure functions. Firstly, the utility of the spectrum is to fully collapse the unscaled PDFs. Secondly, the physical interpretation is clear. It indicates how intermittent the scaled fluctuations are once the spectrum is given. Thirdly, the determination of the values of the fractal nature of the grouped fluctuations is not affected by the statistics of other fluctuations that do not exhibit the same fractal characteristics.\nThe method has been used to study results obtained from large-scale incompressible fluid simulations and large-scale MHD simulations as well as observations of the magnetic field fluctuations of the solar wind, the extreme ultraviolet emissions of the solar corona, and the broadband electric field fluctuations in the auroral zone. The method and some of these applications will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are sites of large lithospheric slabs sinking into the Earth’s mantle inducing complex 3D flow. Seismic anisotropy generated by strain-induced lattice/crystal preferred orientation (LPO/CPO) of intrinsically anisotropic minerals is commonly used to study the patterns of mantle flow and the associated plate motions at convergent margins. Here, we computed the upper mantle fabric due to strain-induced LPO in 3D thermo-mechanical models of dynamic subduction. Overall, strong fabrics develop in the upper and mid mantle around the subduction zone. We find that the mantle fabric occurrence depends on the distribution and amount of the deformation, whereas it is independent of the rate of subduction. As a consequence, distinctive fabric patterns are formed in the upper mantle below, aside and above the slab. Additionally, synthetic seismograms of teleseismic waves propagating sub-vertically were computed to estimate SKS splitting, which are sensitive to the upper mantle anisotropy. The results are remarkably comparable with observations from different subduction settings (i.e., Cascadia, Calabria, Aegean), yielding strong constraints on the recent dynamics of these margins. Concluding, we discuss the potential bias the seismic anisotropy introduces, which might affect isotropic seismic tomographies imaging subduction zones and eventually leading to (mis)interpreation of artificial seismic anomalies.

            "abstract": "Poorly constrained rates of biomass turnover are a key limitation of Earth system models (ESM). In light of this, we recently proposed a new approach encoded in a model called Populations-Order-Physiology (POP), for the simulation of woody ecosystem stand dynamics, demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. POP is suitable for continental to global applications and designed for coupling to the terrestrial ecosystem component of any ESM. POP bridges the gap between first generation Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) with simple large-area parameterisations of woody biomass (typically used in current ESMs) and complex second generation DVMs, that explicitly simulate demographic processes and landscape heterogeneity of forests. The key simplification in the POP approach, compared with second-generation DVMs, is to compute physiological processes such as assimilation at grid-scale (with CABLE or a similar land surface model), but to partition the grid-scale biomass increment among age classes defined at sub grid-scale, each subject to its own dynamics. POP was successfully demonstrated along a savanna transect in northern Australia, replicating the effects of strong rainfall and fire disturbance gradients on observed stand productivity and structure.\nHere, we extend the application of POP to a range of forest types around the globe, employing paired observations of stem biomass and density from forest inventory data to calibrate model parameters governing stand demography and biomass evolution. The calibrated POP model is then coupled to the CABLE land surface model and the combined model (CABLE-POP) is evaluated against leaf-stem allometry observations from forest stands ranging in age from 3 to 200 years. Results indicate that simulated biomass pools conform well with observed allometry. We conclude that POP represents an ecologically plausible and efficient alternative to large-area parameterisations of woody biomass turnover, typically used in current ESMs.\nHaverd, V., Smith, B., Briggs, P.R., Nieradzik, L.P, 2014.

            "abstract": "Due to increasing demands for bioenergy, a considerable amount of land in the Midwestern United States could be devoted to the cultivation of second-generation bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass and miscanthus. In this study, we attempt to explore and analyze how different amounts of above-ground biomass returned to the soil at harvest affect the below-ground dynamics of carbon and nitrogen as a comparative study between miscanthus, swichgrass, and corn-corn-soybean rotation. The simulation results show that there is a threshold effect in the amount of above-ground litter input in the soil after harvest that will reach a critical organic matter C:N ratio in the soil, triggering a reduction of the soil microbial population, with significant consequences in other microbe-related processes such as decomposition and mineralization. These thresholds are approximately 25% and 15% of above-ground biomass for switchgrass and miscanthus, respectively. However, we do not observe such threshold effects for corn-corn-soybean rotation. These results suggest that values above these thresholds could result in a significant reduction of decomposition and mineralization, which in turn would enhance the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the topsoil and reduce inorganic nitrogen losses when compared with a corn-corn-soybean rotation.",

In particular, it can constrain the downdip edge of the locked zone, which informs the hazard assessments for major cities including Seattle, Tacoma, and Vancouver. As shown by Houston (AGU abstract, 2012), slip inferred from GPS extended updip of the seismically-detected tremor in the 2010 M6.8 ETS event. Following the methods used on the 2010 ETS event, we used the PANGA GPS to measure the displacement vectors for 71 stations to analyze a large ETS event in 2012 that extended from Vancouver Island to Southern Washington. We implemented Principal Component Analysis to automatically select the direction and magnitude of the maximum displacement vector. We then inverted these GPS displacements for slip, using the Okada formulation of buried rectangular faults in a halfspace with a grid of 8 by 8 km subfaults based on the McCrory slab model. We performed inversions with either 0th or 2nd order Tikhonov regularization and found that over the 6 weeks of propagation, the 2012 ETS event released moment corresponding to M6.7, in three high-slip regions. We compared two different inversions, one where slip was allowed on a broad regional grid and a tremor-restricted inversion (TRI) where slip was restricted to grid locations where tremor had been detected in the 2012 ETS. We found that the TRI forced the slip to the updip edge of the grid where it reached above 10 cm, which is physically implausible given that this exceeds the slip that can accumulate in an inter-ETS time period. Additionally, the regional grid inversion indicates that 1 to 2 cm of slip occurred 10’s of km updip of the western edge of tremor. This further supports the inference from the 2010 event that in northern Washington, the slow slip during an ETS event extends many kilometers updip of the western edge of tremor.",

Almost three times increase in the occurence of the F3-layer has been observed 2009 (~ 48%) as compared to that during 2007(~ 16%). The increase of this order just within low solar activity period is unusual. In earlier studies similar increase in F3 occurrence has been reported when solar activity changes from high (F10.7=182) to low (F10.7=72). Another important feature of this study, is the presence of post-noon F3 layers that are observed predominantly during the summer solstice of 2009. Such occurrence of post-noon F3 layers was nearly absent during summer solstice of previous solar minimum (1996) over nearby dip equatorial station Trivandrum. Using the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) as a proxy for eastward electric field, we found that the EEJ strength and the maximum rate of change of EEJ are higher for F3-days as compared to that during non-F3 days. It was also observed that the peak occurrence of pre-noon F3-layer closely coincides with the time of maximum rate of change of EEJ. The present study reveals that the rate of change of eastward electric field (dE/dt) as well plays an important role in the formation of F3-layer.",

            "abstract": "The Arkavathy River Basin adjacent to Bangalore, India, faces a multitude of challenges driven by water demands from urbanization and intensification of agriculture. In the Arkavathy Basin, the two major reservoirs that historically supplied water to Bangalore now receive little to no inflow. Recent research has resulted in multiple plausible hypotheses attributing streamflow reductions in the Arkavathy to (1) increased evapotranspiration due to a boom in eucalyptus plantations and irrigated agriculture, and (2) increased deep drainage from surface soils due to long-term, excessive groundwater extraction. Current knowledge of Bangalore's water scarcity is largely based on anecdotal evidence and the sparse environmental data for this region is insufficient to definitively test these hypotheses. To bridge the gap between provincial and academic knowledge and better understand the nature of regional water resource depletion, we utilize a range of methods to integrate information across spatial and temporal scales. We use the full history of Landsat satellite imagery to approximate post-monsoon water storage in tanks and construct a spatially-explicit, historical record of surface water. We combine stable isotope mixing models, traditional field methods, and kite photography to build a deeper understanding of rainfall-runoff processes. Remote-sensing results confirm reductions of surface water in many of the tanks in the upper reaches of the watershed. We also observe an increase in surface water availability downstream of Bangalore, where imported water results in large waste flows. Field methods reveal considerable contributions of Hortonian overland flow due to soils with low hydraulic conductivity, mitigating changes in the subsurface water balance. We conclude that surface water availability is strongly related to spatial patterns of urban and agricultural water demand overlaid on a template defined by topography, soil, and climate.",

            "abstract": "Submarine basalts have been collected from the slopes of Rurutu and Tubuai in the Austral Islands, South Pacific with the manned submersible Shinkai 6500. Previous work on the bulk radiogenic isotope and trace element chemistry of these samples suggests that the basalts were generated from a HIMU reservoir derived from an ancient subducted slab that was entrained and mixed with the depleted asthenospheric mantle. Olivines and glasses from the submarine basalts show lower 3He/4He than MORB, similar to subaerial basalts from these islands. Sixteen glass chips from the same submarine samples have now undergone in-situ analysis for major elements (including S and Cl) by EPMA, trace elements by LA-ICP-MS, H2O and CO2 by FTIR, and bulk volatile analysis (S, Cl, F) by ion chromatography combined with pyrohydrolysis. H2O ranges from 0.62-2.44 wt%, while CO2 is below detection (<20 ppm). S measured by EPMA ranges from 612-1889 ppm and by bulk analysis from 582-1301 ppm and, with the exception of one sample, concentrations agree well. Cl measured by EPMA ranges from 151-538 ppm, and by bulk analysis from 188-980 ppm. The higher values suggest that the bulk samples may be contaminated by seawater; otherwise Cl correlates strongly with incompatible elements. F measured in the bulk samples ranges from 221-1243 ppm. S correlates positively with FeO and Cu, but not with incompatible elements, suggesting sulfide saturation. While the highest H2O contents may reflect late-stage hydration and are oversaturated at the depth of collection, the low H2O contents (11 samples with 0.62-0.96 wt%) are undersaturated, and there is a positive correlation between the H2O contents of all chips and their incompatible element concentrations. This suggests that H2O/Ce and Cl/Ce filtered for shallow level processes may reflect source compositions, providing constraints on volatiles in the sources of Rurutu and Tubuai, and indications about the efficiency of subduction-related volatile-loss in the HIMU component.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater recharge variation in space and time is crucial for effective water management especially in arid/ semi-arid regions. In order to reveal comprehensive groundwater recharge processes in a catchment with a large topographical relief and seasonal hydrological variations, intensive field surveys were conducted at 4 times in different seasons in Wangkuai watershed, Taihang Mountains, which is a main groundwater recharge zone of North China Plain. The groundwater, spring, stream water and lake water were sampled, and inorganic solute constituents and stable isotopes of oxygen-18 and deuterium were determined on all water samples. Also, the stream flow rate was observed in stable state condition.\nThe stable isotopic compositions, silica and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater show close values as those in the surface water, suggesting main groundwater recharge occurs from surface water at mountain-plain transitional zone throughout a year. Also, the deuterium and oxgen-18 in the Wangkuai reservoir and the groundwater in the vicinity of the reservoir show higher values, suggesting the reservoir water, affected by evaporation effect, seems to have an important role for the groundwater recharge in alluvial plain.\nFor specifying the groundwater recharge area and quantifying groundwater recharge rate from the reservoir, an inversion analysis and a simple mixing model were applied in Wangkuai watershed using stable isotopes of oxygen-18 and deuterium. The model results show that groundwater recharge occurs dominantly at the altitude from 357 m to 738 m corresponding to mountain-plain transitional zone, and groundwater recharge rate by Wangkuai reservoir is estimated to be 2.4 % of total groundwater recharge in Wangkuai watershed.",

            "abstract": "Sea level change is an issue of immense importance in conjunction with global warming. The advent of satellite measurements offers a unique opportunity to address the global patterns of sea level height change associated with global warming. The rate of sea level change, however, is still uncertain due to the relatively short length of the satellite measurements, which began in 1993. In the present study, the contribution of global warming was separated from natural variability via cyclostationary EOF analysis in a sea level reconstruction dataset covering 1950-2010. Global sea level change due to the warming signal is within the range of fluctuations of the global average sea level computed directly from the data but is much less contaminated by natural variability as in the globally averaged sea level heights. A quadratic polynomial fit to the global warming signal indicates that the rate of sea level rise has increased by 0.2 mm yr-1 per decade and is 1.3 mm yr-1 as of 2010. The current rate of sea level rise is lower than that estimated from the globally averaged sea level heights by 0.2 mm yr-1 but is in the 1s range of the estimate (1.3 – 1.8 mm yr-1).\n Separation of the global warming mode from natural variability allow us to estimate the magnitude of natural variability and the relative significance of sea level change due to global warming. It appears that the sea level change due to global warming is, in general, comparable to natural variability in magnitude so far. Notable exceptions are over the southern tropical Indian, equatorial Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and along the extensions of the western boundary currents. Sea level rise due to warming is expected to exceed several standard deviations of natural variability by 2060 over the majority of the world oceans. This implies that coastal regions will be much more prone to disasters (such as hurricanes) due to warming-induced sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Legacy mine tailings are a significant source of metal(loid)s due to wind and water erosion, especially in the arid southwest, and exposure to fugative dusts presents a health risk to surrounding populations. Compost assisted phytostabilization has been implemented to reduce off site emissions at the Iron King Mine U.S. Superfund Site in central Arizona, concurrent with a greenhouse mesocosm study for detailed study of subsurface mechanisms. Quantification of plant available toxic metal(loid)s in the amended tailings was accessed with a targeted single extraction of diethylenetriaminepentaactic acid (DTPA).\nGreenhouse mesocosms (1m dia, 0.4 m deep), run in triplicate, mimicked field treatments with: i) tailings only control (TO), ii) tailings plus 15 wt% compost (TC), iii) TC + quailbush seeds (TCA), and iv) TC + buffalo grass seeds (TCB). Core samples collected at 3-month intervals for 1 year were dissected by depth (10 cm each) for analysis. DTPA results indicated that compost treated samples decreased plant availability of Al, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Pb but increased Mn and Zn compared with TO. TCB decreased plant available metal(loid)s at all depths, whereas TCA plant available Al, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn increased in the deeper 20-30cm and 30-40 cm relative to TCB. Samples from the greenhouse were compared to tailings from both the field site and tailings impacted soils used to grow vegetables.\nMineral transformations and metal complexation, in the pre- and post-extracted tailings were analyzed by synchrotron transmission XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. The temporal change in plant available metal(loid)s in response to phytostabilization indicates mineralogical alteration that improves soil quality by reducing plant available metal(loid)s. These results will aid in the understanding and efficacy of phytostabilization as a means of remediating and reducing toxicity on mine tailings as well as providing information on health risk management in the region.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires in the tundra regions and the boreal forest project an immediate effect upon the surface energy and water budget by drastically altering the surface albedo, roughness, infiltration rates, and moisture absorption capacity in organic soils. Although fires create a sudden and drastic change to the landcover, it is only the beginning of a long process of recovery and perhaps a shift to a different successional pathway. In permafrost regions, these effects become part of a process of long-term (20-50 years) cumulative impacts. Burn severity may largely determine immediate impacts and long-term disturbance trajectories. As transpiration decreases or ceases, soil moisture increases markedly, remaining quite wet throughout the year. Because the insulating quality of the organic layer is removed during fires, permafrost begins to thaw near the surface and warm to greater depths. Within a few years, it may thaw to the point where it can no longer completely refreeze every winter, creating a permanently thawed layer in the soil called a talik. After formation of a talik, soils can drain internally throughout the year. At this point, soils may become quite dry, as the total precipitation received annually in the Arctic is quite low. The local ecological community must continuously adapt to the changing soil thermal and moisture regimes. The wet soils found over shallow permafrost favor black spruce forests. After a fire creates a deeper permafrost table (thicker active layer) the invading tree species tend to be birch or alder. The hydrologic and thermal regime of the soil is the primary factor controlling these vegetation trajectories and the subsequent changes in surface mass and energy fluxes. The complexities of a changing climate accentuate these processes of change and complicate predictions of the resulting vegetation trajectories. Understanding these shifts in vegetative communities and quantifying the consequences of thawing permafrost can only be accomplished through complementary analyses of field research data and numerical simulations. The permafrost dramatically controls other landscape features and its dynamic response to thermal influences yield consequent effects on the surficial ecology, water and energy balances and regional climate.",

This is most clearly expressed by the fast flowing ice streams in Greenland and Antarctica, where low levels of basal friction are thought to support the high flow rates. These ice streams are of particular interest since they are large constituents of the polar ice sheet mass balance. The study of these ice streams and their future impact on the ice sheets necessitates a deeper understanding of their basal dynamics, including the rheology of water-saturated sediment.\nWe present the methodology and first results of a coupled numerical model for computational experiments on granular-fluid mixtures under dynamic conditions similar to those in subglacial settings. The granular phase is simulated on a per-particle basis by the soft body discrete element method. The fluid phase is handled as a continuum by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The particle and fluid phases are coupled by mass conservation and momentum exchanges.\nThe hydraulic diffusivity and permeability is compared to previous laboratory studies on tills. We demonstrate how the onset and halt of granular deformation is an efficient mechanism to create fluid pressure fluctuations due to local porosity changes. These pressure anomalies are driving transient hydraulic flows, and they influence directly the rheology of granular-fluid mixtures. Our results highlight the nonlinear nature of water saturated granular deformation, and demonstrate how the mechanical behaviour of granular materials may include both brittle and viscous components depending on the rates of deformation and the hydrological properties.",

Recent studies indicated that forest mortality caused by rising temperature and drought from around the world have unexpectedly increased in the past decade and they collectively illustrate the vulnerability of many forested ecosystems to rapid increases in tree mortality due to warmer temperatures and more severe drought. Persistent changes in tree mortality rates can alter forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services (such as albedo and carbon sequestration). Quantifying potential impacts of tree mortality on ecosystem processes requires research into mortality effects on carbon, energy, and water budgets at both site and regional levels. Despite recent progress, the uncertainty around mortality responses still limits our ability to predict the likelihood and anticipate the impacts of tree die-off. Studies are needed that explore tree death physiology for a wide variety of functional types, connect patterns of mortality with climate events, and quantify the impacts on carbon, energy, and water flux. In this presentation, I will highlight recent research progress, and identify key research needs and future challenges to predict the consequence and impacts of drought-induced large-scale forest mortality on biogeochemical cycles. I will focus on three main forest ecosystems (tropic rainforest in Amazon, temperate forest in Western USA, and boreal forest in Canada) as detailed case studies.",

In 2010, we manufactured the autonomous VCS data acquisition systems. Through several experimental surveys, our VCS is successfully completed.\nIn 2011 and 2013, we carried out the two VCS surveys using GI gun and high-voltage sparker respectively in the Izena Cauldron, Okinawa Trough, which is one of the most promising SMS areas around Japan. Because seismic survey is not proven to be effective for SMS exploration, no seismic surveys have been conducted there so far.\nOur strategy for SMS exploration consists of two stages. In the first stage, we carried out VCS survey with the lower frequency GI gun (but higher compared to the convebtional oil/gas exploration) and explored deeper (up to 1,500m) structure to obtain the fault system of hydrothermal flow. Next, using a high frequency (about 1 kHz higher) and high-voltage sparker, we explored very shallow (up to 200m) part to delineate the very thin SMS deposits. These two VCS dataset have been processed with 3D Prestack Depth Migration. These results are consistent with geological information from the borehole drilled nearby and give useful information to SMS exploration.",

To characterize the provenance and transport pathways of eolian dust deposited in the western tropical/subtropical Pacific, and to investigate changes over the late Quaternary, we used the clay mineral assemblage, together with the 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr composition of the inorganic silicate fractions of a deep-sea sediment core retrieved from the Palau-Kyushu Ridge in the Philippine Sea. The analyzed attributes of the core resemble those of dust from the central Asian deserts (CADs; e.g., the Taklimakan Desert) as in the North Central Pacific, but published aerosol data collected near the study site during winter/spring has the mineralogical signature of dust originating from the East Asian deserts (EADs; e.g., the Chinese Loess Plateau and nearby deserts). These data indicate that the relative contribution of EAD dust increases with the northeasterly surface winds associated with the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) during winter/spring, but the Prevailing Westerlies and Trade Winds that carry dust from the CADs have been the dominant transport agent for the last 600 kyr. The results of this study contradict the prevailing view that direct dust transport by the EAWM winds in spring dominates the annual flux of eolian dust in the northwest Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Geochronology of metamorphic rocks aims to determine pressure-temperature-time paths. The development of in-situ oxygen isotope analysis by ion microprobe permits to add fluid evolution to metamorphic histories. Accurate oxygen isotope analysis requires matrix-matched standards and, for chemically complex minerals, also appropriate matrix corrections. We will report on recent progresses on the analysis of oxygen isotopes in monazite, allanite and garnet using the SHRIMP ion microprobe.\nZircon is a prime candidate for retrieving the oxygen composition of the pre-metamorphic protolith, as inherited zircons are preserved in many high-grade rocks. Metamorphic zircon rims that differ from the cores in δ18O offer insight into the origin of the fluid and the timing as well as degree of fluid-rock interaction. Garnet is another exceptional recorder of multiple metamorphic stages. Highly zoned garnets are found in a variety of eclogite-facies rocks and they can preserve dramatic oxygen isotopic variations (differences of a few to 10 δ18O ‰ within single crystal).\nGarnet and zircons from eclogite-facies metamorphic veins and shear zones within the metamorphosed Lago Superiore Unit from the Monviso ophiolite (W. Alps) have distinct growth zones with different oxygen isotopes composition. The shift in oxygen isotopes between the magmatic zircon core and the metamorphic zircon rim testifies to metasomatism by fluids equilibrated with serpentinites. The oxygen isotopes zoning in garnet confirms large scale fluid metasomatism concentrated in shear zones. It also indicates that some major shear zones from the Monviso ophiolitic sequence possibly underwent two stages of metasomatism, an event before or during early subduction and a later stage at around 550°C/2.5 GPa at peak pressure metamorphism.",

            "abstract": "Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), lake expansion/shrinkage has been found closely correlated to the changing evapotranspiration (ET) patterns. Lake Selin Co is the largest endorheic lake on the TP, but the spatio-temporal changes of ET and its controlling factors in this lake basin are still not well understood. In this study, the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model (WEB-DHM, for land area), Penman-Monteith method (unfrozen period of water area) and a simple sublimation estimation approach (frozen period of water area) were used to estimate the spatio-temporal variations of ET in the Lake Selin Co Basin from 2003 to 2012. The causes for the variations are also discussed. By comparing with MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, WEB-DHM successfully reproduced the spatial pattern and basin-averaged values of nighttime and daytime LST. Compared with the ET reference values estimated from water balance method, our method showed better performance than global ET products in reproducing annual basin-averaged ET. The modeled ET at point scale matches well with in situ daily measurements from 10 October to 10 November 2012 (RMSE = 0.82 mm/day). The increase of precipitation makes ET from the land area an increasing trend, except in winter. ET from the water area is an integrated effect of climate factors on annual and seasonal scales. The decline of wind speed and the increase of vapor pressure deficit may offset the effect of increasing temperature and contribute to an insignificant decreasing trend of annual ET from the water area.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a method of in situ ion microprobe U–Pb dating and Sr isotope measurement of biogenic apatite using NanoSIMS. This was applied to a protoconodont, an early Cambrian phosphate microfossil [1]. On a single fragment of a fossil derived from a sedimentary layer in the Meishucunian Yuhucun Formation, southern China [2], 23 spots provide a 238U/206Pb isochron age of 547 ± 43 Ma (2sigma), which is consistent with the depositional age, 536.5 ± 2.5 Ma estimated using zircon U–Pb dating of interbedded tuffs [3]. However, five spots on a small region in the same protoconodont yield an isochron age of 417 ± 74 Ma (2sigma), apparently younger than the formation age. The younger age might be attributable to a later hydrothermal event, perhaps associated with Caledonian orogenic activity recorded in younger zircon with an age of 420–440 Ma [4]. We measured Sr isotopic ratios of the protoconodont by NanoSIMS. In the older domain, 19 spots give the ratio of 0.71032 ± 0.00023 (2sigma), although seven spots on the younger region provide the ratio of 0.70862 ± 0.00045; which is significantly less radiogenic than the older domain. We also measured U-Pb age and Sr isotopes of a Carboniferous conodont derived from the Kinderhookian stage from the Illinois Basin region in North America. 20 spots yield a 238U/206Pb isochron age of 291 ± 56 Ma (2sigma), which is markedly younger than the depositional age of the fossil of 350-363 Ma. On the other hand, 9 spots give a Sr isotopic ratio of 0.70784 ± 0.00030, less radiogenic than the older domain of protoconodont. These data together with other isotopes such as Cl may provide a constraint on the model for chemical evolution of seawater. [1] Sano et al. (2014) J. Asian Earth Sci. 92, 10-17. [2] Condon et al.

            "abstract": "Lack of reliable historical basin-scale evapotranspiration (ET) estimates is a bottleneck for water balance analyses and model evaluation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study looks at four large basins on the TP to develop a general approach to estimate historical monthly ET. Five existing global ET products are evaluated against monthly ET estimated by the water balance method as a residual from precipitation (P), terrestrial water storage change and discharge (R). The five ET products exhibit similar seasonal variability, despite differences among them. A bias correction method, mainly depending on the probability distribution mapping, effectively removes nearly all biases and significantly increases the reliability of the estimates. Then, the surface water balance changes over the four basins are analyzed based on the corrected ET products as well as observed P and R during 1983–2006. A trend analysis shows an upward trend for ET in the four basins for all seasons during the past three decades, which is consistent with regional warming. For the upper Yangtze River basin, Qiangtang Plateau, and Qaidam basin, P exhibits increasing trend in all seasons with the largest increase in summer; ET also displays increasing trends in all seasons. For the upper Yellow River basin, both of P and R display consistently decreasing trends in summer, while increasing of P and decreasing of R in other seasons.",

            "abstract": "In the meteorological community, efforts converge towards implementation of high-resolution (< 12km) data-assimilating regional climate modelling/monitoring systems based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) cores. This is driven by requirements of improving process understanding, better representation of land surface interactions, atmospheric convection, orographic effects, and better forecasting on shorter timescales.\nThis is relevant for the GRACE community since (1) these models may provide improved atmospheric mass separation / de-aliasing and smaller topography-induced errors, compared to global (ECMWF-Op, ERA-Interim) data, (2) they inherit high temporal resolution from NWP models, (3) parallel efforts towards improving the land surface component and coupling groundwater models; this may provide realistic hydrological mass estimates with sub-diurnal resolution, (4) parallel efforts towards re-analyses, with the aim of providing consistent time series. (5) On the other hand, GRACE can help validating models and aids in the identification of processes needing improvement.\nA coupled atmosphere - land surface – groundwater modelling system is currently being implemented for the European CORDEX region at 12.5 km resolution, based on the TerrSysMP platform (COSMO-EU NWP, CLM land surface and ParFlow groundwater models). We report results from Springer et al. (J. Hydromet., accept.) on validating the water cycle in COSMO-EU using GRACE and precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff data; confirming that the model does favorably at representing observations. We show that after GRACE-derived bias correction, basin-average hydrological conditions prior to 2002 can be reconstructed better than before. Next, comparing GRACE with CLM forced by EURO-CORDEX simulations allows identifying processes needing improvement in the model. Finally, we compare COSMO-EU atmospheric pressure, a proxy for mass corrections in satellite gravimetry, with ERA-Interim over Europe at timescales shorter/longer than 1 month, and spatial scales below/above ERA resolution. We find differences between regional and global model more pronounced at high frequencies, with magnitude at sub-grid scale and larger scale corresponding to 1-3 hPa (1-3 cm EWH); relevant for the assessment of post-GRACE concepts.",

            "abstract": "In snowy cold regions, snow-melt water can cause a snowmelt floods. For this reason, many snowmelt runoff models have been proposed for predicting the volume of runoff into dams. Given that snow distributions differ between inside of forests versus outside of forests, we developed a snowmelt runoff model that is able to correct the snow distribution by using observation data from snow surveys. This paper reports the results obtained when the model was applied to Chubetsu Dam, Japan, which is at a high elevation and about 40% of whose basin area is higher than the forest limit.\nThe Model consists of three sub-models, first, a snowmelt model and a snow permeation model are applied to meshes of about 1 km2; then, water supply to the ground is estimated for each mesh. After that, water supply to the ground for each mesh in the entire basin are lumped together, and the lumped value is applied to the runoff model to obtain dam inflow. With regard to the correction of snow water equivalent distribution, a correction method that considers topography is applied to meshes inside of forests, a correction method using overground openness as a parameter is applied to meshes outside of forests, and the parameters for the correction formula are determined based on the results of the annual snow survey.\nCalculation was performed using the data of the five snow-melting seasons from 2008 to 2012. The accuracy is higher when this method is employed than when no correction is made; thus, the correction of snow distribution was found to be effective. Since there is no significant difference between when no correction was made and when this method was employed in the early snow-melt season, it is considered that the correction of snow distribution is very effective at high elevations, where snow-melting peaks in the late snow-melting season. At high altitudes above the forest limit, fallen snow tends to be redistributed by wind. The snow distribution corrected by means of overground openness gives consideration to the characteristics of snow distribution after redeposition, i.e., after the wind has redistributed the snow. From this, it is assumed that the snow distribution in the high-altitude range was properly corrected, thus contributing to improved accuracy of dam inflow calculation.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic activity at Ambrym volcano (Vanuatu) is currently characterised by continuous lava lake activity within two main cones (Marum and Benbow), distant by 3 km. Acoustic measurements were performed by an acoustic array set at a distance of 3 km from the active vents between April 2009 and January 2010. The detection of volcanic signals, done by using PMCC (progressive multi-channel correlation), showed that more than 97 % of the detections came from one of the active vents, with millions of acoustic transients and no quiescent period. Two short Strombolian phases and 3 isolated explosions existed at Marum during this period while no strong signal was detected at Benbow. The active degassing, i.e. that detected by acoustic measurements, is mostly around 1 Hz at both vents. The gas volume is estimated from calculating acoustic power for each detection in the 0.8-2 Hz frequency range, assuming that the source has a constant radius of 5 m. The gas volume expelled per hour is similar at Benbow and Marum with 0.5-4 Mm^3. One striking observation is the existence of regular alternations between periods with high and small expelled gas volume, with 3 Mm^3 per hour and 0.5 Mm^3 per hour for each period, respectively. The detection of acoustic pulses even small, which is done with wavelet analysis, showed rapid and regular variations in the number of acoustic transients (1-460). The duration, return time and expelled gas volume were similar at Benbow and Marum on the 50 and 38 recognised cycles, respectively. The duration, return time and expelled gas volume at Benbow were equal to 58 hr, 70 hr and 42 Mm^3, respectively. Their relative small standart deviation for the above parameters, equal to 24 hr, 82 hr and 26 Mm^3 respectively, suggested that the fluctuations between periods with high and low gas volume, is probably cyclic. This 5 days-cyclicity could be perhaps be related to thermal convection processes in the magma reservoir.",

Information pertaining to the annual rainfall is valuable in flood mitigation and water quality concerns. The approach of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide onsite detention of various percentile capture depths stormwater management is examined here. Such information is pertinent to construct new or extend current undersized drainage infrastructures with consideration of future high intensity flood events which are anticipated to increase. In this study, the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) regional climate model (RCM) precipitation baseline (1973-2000) and future (2041-2070) data are used to generate annual 85% and 95% capture depths for Washington D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area. The RCM data contain systematic biases and are therefore adjusted to produce appropriate estimates at the local scale. Depending on the adjustment technique used, the statistically transformed data leads to increased precipitation capture depths. In this study, several approaches: non-parametric, parametric, and modified parametric methods are employed for bias correction. Graphical comparisons of the adjustment techniques using National Climate Data Center (NCDC) and several model combinations (GCM+RCM) daily rainfall data are presented. Comparisons are made between NCDC daily rainfall and simulated (uncorrected and corrected) data to assess mean absolute error.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is the driving force of the terrestrial water cycle over land, and is also one of the most common indicators of climate change. As such, it is rigorously monitored by many organizations using an array of instruments and/or models. However, disparities between the various products and observations lead to the questions: what are the uncertainties of these products? and how do these uncertainties propagate to the estimation of soil moisture?\nTo address the first question, we have evaluated over 20 gauge-based, satellite-based, modeled, and reanalysis precipitation products using 57 years of observations over a highly instrumented 150 km2 watershed in southern Arizona. Most of the products do a better job of estimating winter precipitation than summer or annual precipitation with higher daily correlation and lower root mean square differences compared with observations. All products with the exception of models estimate the timing of the peaks in the annual cycle well, but overestimate amount with respect to the observations. The gauge and satellite products estimate average intensity of precipitation well, while the models estimate drizzle (<0.01 mm/day) too frequently. Many products reveal positive or negative trends in seasonal and annual precipitation total, while observations do not show any significant trends over the same time period.\nTo answer the second question, several modeled and reanalysis soil moisture products relying on the above mentioned precipitation products are compared with 11 years of in situ soil moisture measurements as well as the modeled soil moisture of Stillman et al. (2014), which extends the measurement period of summer soil moisture to 57 years. Most of the soil moisture products are significantly correlated with observations except for the models, partly due to errors in precipitation estimation. Improvements in soil moisture estimation from updated versions of ERA and MERRA are also shown.",

Using statistically downscaled temperature projections for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6, we project changes in\nT\nw\nfor the next two centuries. We find that dangerously humid days (\nT\nw\n> 27\n∘\nC) will become increasingly common in the eastern U.S. under RCP 8.5, with the expected number of days per summer surpassing those of Louisiana today in Chicago in 25 years, Washington, D.C. in 30 years, New York City in 50 years and Portland in 60 years. By the end of the century under RCP 8.5, one extraordinarily dangerous (\nT\nw\n> 33\n∘\nC) day per year is expected in counties currently home to about one-third of the U.S. population. Mitigation can significantly the expected number of extreme wet-bulb temperature days, with only one-eighth of the U.S. population in counties with a 1-in-10 chance per year of an extraordinarily dangerous day by the end of the century under RCP 4.5.\n",

The results show that the Lushan mainshock locates at 30.28 N, 103.98 E, with the depth of 16.38 km. The leading edge of aftershock in the northeast of mainshock present a spade with a steep dip angle, the aftershocks' extended length is about 12 km. In the southwest of the Lushan mainshock, the leading edge of aftershock in low velocity zone slope gently, the aftershocks' extended length is about 23 km. The P wave velocity structure of the Lushan seismic area shows obviously lateral heterogeneity. The P wave velocity anomalies represent close relationship with topographic relief and geological structure. In Baoxing area the complex rocks correspond obvious high-velocity anomalies extending down to 15 km depth，while the Cenozoic rocks are correlated with low-velocity anomalies. Our high-resolution tomographic model not only displays the general features contained in the previous models, but also reveals some new features. An obvious high-velocity anomaly is visible in Daxing area. The high-velocity anomalies beneath Baoxing and Daxing connect each other in 10 km depth, which makes the contrast between high and low velocity anomalies more sharp. Above 20 km depth the velocity structure in southwest and northeast segment of the mainshock shows a big difference: low-velocity anomalies are dominated the southwest segment, while high-velocity anomalies rule the northeast segment. The Lushan mainshock locates at the leading edge of a low-velocity anomaly surrounded by the Baoxing and Daxing high-velocity anomalies. The Lushan aftershocks in southwest are distributed in low-velocity anomalies or the transition belt: the footwall represents low-velocity anomalies, while the hanging wall shows high-velocity anomalies. The northeastern aftershocks are distributed at the boundary between high-velocity anomalies in Baoxing and Daxing area. The main seismogenic layer dips to northwest.",

            "abstract": "The Doba gabbro was collected from an exploration well through the Cretaceous Doba Basin of Southern Chad. The gabbro is comprised mostly of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxide minerals and displays cumulus mineral textures. Whole rock 40Ar/39Ar step-heating geochronology yielded a Late Permian plateau age of 257 ± 1 Ma. The major and trace elemental geochemistry shows that the gabbro is mildly alkalic to tholeiitic in composition and has trace element ratios (i.e. La/YbN > 7; Sm/YbPM > 3.4; Nb/Y > 1; Zr/Y > 5) indicative of a basaltic melt derived from a garnet-bearing sublithospheric mantle source. The moderately enriched Sr-Nd isotopes (i.e. ISr = 0.70495 to 0.70839; eNd(T) = -1.0 to -1.3) fall within the mantle array (i.e. OIB-like) and are similar to other Late Permian plutonic rocks of North-Central Africa (i.e. ISr = 0.7040 to 0.7070). The Late Permian plutonic igneous complexes of North-Central Africa are geologically associated with tectonic lineaments suggesting they acted as conduits for sublithospheric melts to migrate to middle/upper crustal levels. The source of the magmas may be related to the spatial-temporal association of North-Central Africa with the African large low shear velocity province (LLSVP). The African LLSVP has remained stable since the Late Carboniferous and was beneath the Doba basin during the Permian. We suggest that melts derived from deep seated sources related to the African LLSVP percolated through the North-Central African crust via older tectonic lineaments and form a discontiguous magmatic province.",

            "abstract": "Although it is known since long that microbial denitrification plays a central role in N cycling in soils due to loss of nutrient N, emissions of N2O and lowering of N leaching, few data at the field scale are available due to the difficulty in measurement. In recent years, stable isotope signatures of N2O such as d18O, average d15N (d15Nbulk) and 15N site preference (SP = difference in d15N between the central and peripheral N positions of the asymmetric N2O molecule) have been used to constrain the atmospheric N2O budget and to characterize N2O turnover processes including N2O production and reduction by microbial denitrification. However, the use of this approach to study N2O dynamics in soils requires knowledge of isotope fractionation factors for the various partial processes involved, e.g. N2O production by nitrification or fungal/bacterial denitrification, and N2O reduction by bacterial denitrification.\nHere we present recent progress on the principles of isotope fractionation modeling to estimate N2O reduction and on the role of microbial groups and their specific impact on isotope values. Moreover, we report and discuss approaches to determine isotope values of produced N2O prior to its reduction as well as enrichment factors of N2O reduction. Finally, a variety of results from lab and field studies will be shown were N2O reduction estimates by isotope fractionation modeling are validated by independent measurements using 15N tracing or He/O2 incubations. Methodical improvements to increase sensitivity of the 15N tracing approach will be briefly addressed.\nWe conclude that up to now SP of soil-emitted N2O proved to be suitable to constrain the product ratio of denitrification if N2O fluxes are dominated by bacterial denitrification. Although this approach is not yet precise enough for robust quantification of N2 fluxes, improved precision can be obtained in future, if further progress in understanding the control of fractionation factors of production and reduction and identifying N2O formation by processes other than bacterial denitrification is achieved.",

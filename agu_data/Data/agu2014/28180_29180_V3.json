            "abstract": "Rocks are commonly polycrystalline systems presenting multi-scale chemical and structural heterogeneities inherited from crystallization processes or successive metamorphic events. Through different applications on metamorphic rocks involving fluorescence microprobes and full-field spectroscopy, one will illustrate how spatially resolved analytical techniques allow rock compositional variations to be related to large-scale geodynamic processes. Those examples also stress the importance of multi-modality instruments with zoom-in capability to study samples from mm to several µm large fields of view, with micrometer down to sub-100 nanometer spatial resolutions. In this perspective, imaging capabilities offered by the new ultra-bright diffraction limited synchrotron sources will be described based on experimental data. At last, the new hard X-ray Transmission X-ray Microscope (TXM) at Sector 32 of the APS at Argonne National Laboratory, performing nano computed tomography with in situ capabilities will be presented. The instrument benefit from several R&D key activities like the fabrication of new zone plates in the framework of the Multi-Bend Achromat Lattice (MBA) upgrade at APS, or the development of powerful tomography reconstruction algorithms able to operate with a limited number of projections.",

            "abstract": "It has been established that the Sweet-Parker current layer in high-Lundquist-number reconnection is unstable to the super-Alfvenic plasmoid instability. Past two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that the plasmoid instability leads to a new regime in which the Sweet-Parker current layer evolves into a chain of plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets and the averaged reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of the Lundquist number. In a three-dimensional configuration with a guide field, the additional degree of freedom allows plasmoid instabilities to grow at oblique angles [S. Baalrud et al. Phys. Plasmas 19, 022101 (2012)] and develop the complex dynamics of flux ropes which overlap, cause field-line stochasticization, and self-generate a turbulent state. Three-dimensional simulations in the high-Lundquist-number regime show the formation of cigar-shaped eddies elongated in the direction of the local magnetic field, which is a signature of anisotropic MHD turbulence. Furthermore, the energy fluctuation spectra are found to satisfy power laws in the inertial range. The averaged 3D reconnection rate in the self-generated turbulent state is of the order of a hundredth of the characteristic Alfven speed, which is an order of magnitude lower than the reconnection rate reported in recent studies of externally driven 3D turbulent reconnection. The physical reasons for these differences will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The M 7.2 October 15, 2013 Bohol earthquake is one of the strongest earthquakes to hit a populated area in the Philippines in recent years. The epicenter was located in Sagbayan municipality, central Bohol, and was generated by a previously unmapped reverse fault called the \"Inabanga Fault\". Its name, taken after the barangay (village) where the fault is best exposed and was first seen. The earthquake resulted in 209 fatalities and over 57 billion USD worth of damages. The earthquake generated co-seismic landslides, most of which were related to fault structures. Unlike rainfall induced landslides, the trigger for co-seismic landslides happen without warning. Preparedness against this type of landslide therefore, relies heavily on the identification of fracture-related unstable slopes. To mitigate the impacts of co-seismic landslide hazards, morpho-structural orientations or discontinuity sets were mapped in the field with the aid of a 2012 IFSAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with 5-meter pixel resolution and < 0.5 meter vertical accuracy. Coltop 3D software was then used to identify similar structures including measurement of their dip and dip directions. The chosen discontinuity sets were then keyed into Matterocking software to identify potential rock slide zones due to planar or wedged discontinuities. After identifying the structurally-controlled unstable slopes, the rock mass propagation extent of the possible rock slides was simulated using Conefall. The results were compared to a post-earthquake landslide inventory of 456 landslides. Out of the total number of landslides identified from post-earthquake high-resolution imagery, 366 or 80% intersect the structural-controlled hazard areas of Bohol. The results show the potential of this method to identify co-seismic landslide hazard areas for disaster mitigation. Along with computer methods to simulate shallow landslides and debris flow paths, the located structurally-controlled unstable zones can be used to mark unsafe areas for settlement. The method can be further improved with the use of Lidar DTMs, which has better accuracy than the IFSAR DTM. A nationwide effort under DOST-Project NOAH (DREAM-LIDAR) is underway, to map the Philippine archipelago using Lidar.",

            "abstract": "Ocean dynamics are complex over irregular topography areas, and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, specifically the DeSoto Canyon region, is a challenge for modelers and oceanographers. Vertical movement of waters, especially upwelling, is observed to take place over the canyon’s head and along the coast; however, it is not well understood. We focus on upwelling/downwelling processes induced by the Loop Current and its associated eddy field using multi-decadal Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model simulations. The Loop Current, part of the Gulf Stream, can develop northward into the Gulf through the Yucatan Channel and exit through the Florida Straits. It can reach the continental slope of the study domain and directly depress the isopycnals. Cyclonic eddies in front of the Loop Current also induce upwelling underneath. On the other hand, the Loop Current sometimes impinges on the West Florida Shelf and generates a high pressure disturbance, which travels northward along the shelf into the study region. Consequently, large-scale downwelling occurs across the continental slopes. Our analysis of sea surface height shows that the Loop Current pressure disturbance tends to propagate along the shallow isobaths of 100 to 300 m in the topographic wave direction from south of the West Florida Shelf to the Mississippi Delta. In addition, after shedding a large anticyclonic eddy, the Loop Current retracts southward and can touch the southeastern corner of the West Florida Shelf. This can result in a higher pressure disturbance, and therefore stronger large-scale downwelling in the DeSoto Canyon region.",

            "abstract": "Since the mid-Pleistocene, the oscillation between glacial and interglacial climate states occurs with a period of approximately 100 kyr. Each cycle is comprised of a slow glaciation with a subsequent rapid deglaciation. While the solar forcing is clearly an important driver for these transitions, the power spectrum of the solar forcing is quite different from the subsequent climate response and, in general, does not have a noticeable correlation with global ice volume. Instead, previous studies have shown that internal climate processes and their interactions (e.g., CO2, water vapor, isostatic bed response) play a significant role in producing these global climate cycles. The rapid retreat of large ice sheets at the start of an interglacial is often attributed to the interaction between surface and atmospheric processes. While calving is thought to amplify this retreat, it is not typically considered a principle driver of the ice sheet response.\nOur study investigates the potential for ice/bedrock feedbacks to be a principle contributor in shaping the glacial-interglacial climate oscillation -- particularly the rapid deglaciation that precedes an interglacial. The ice sheet model we develop includes a piecewise linear ice/bedrock feedback while atmospheric and surface processes are taken to be as simple as possible. Due to the long timescale of the bedrock response and the rapid mass loss due to calving, the model ice sheet exhibits rapid deglaciation from a stable maximum when it retreats through an overdeepening. However, ice sheet advance is also shown to be as rapid unless a more complex bedrock response is considered. In particular, we show that a forebulge created by the displacement of the mantle adds a new stable branch to the volume/equilibrium line bifurcation diagram that results in slower growth of the ice sheet during glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Different geological, hydrological, environmental and engineering targets are located shallow underground. The information collected with ATEM systems might be very useful for their study; although there are many deeper targets that the ATEM systems are traditionally used for.\nThe idea to raise magnetic moment output and get deeper penetration response was one of the goals of ATEM systems development during the last decade. The shallow geology response was a trade for such systems, which sometimes were almost blind in the first hundred meter under surface. The possibility to achieve shallow end response from ATEM systems has become significant subject in last years.\nSeveral airborne TDEM systems got second higher frequency and lower magnetic moment signal to pick up shallow response together with deep one. Having a potential advantage such implementation raises complication and cost of the system. There’s no need to receive 500 meter deep response when exploring shallow geology.\nP-THEM system having a compact size transmitter and relatively light weight is working on one base frequency at a time, but this frequency can be preset before a flight considering survey goals.\nA study of shallow geology response of the P-THEM system working on different base frequency has been conducted in 2014 in Ontario.\nThe Alliston test area located in Southern Ontario has been flown with the P-THEM system working on base frequencies 30Hz and 90Hz. Results of the observations will be discussed in the presentation.\nThe shallow end data can be used for mineral exploration applications and also for hydrological and environmental studies.",

            "abstract": "As the quantity of data available from global, national, and regional arrays increases, it is easy to assume that adding more data to a tomographic inversion will result in a model that better reflects true Earth structure. New data are often immediately and semi-automatically incorporated into new models. Typical methods of testing models (e.g. predicting body-wave travel times) incorporate the same data that were used to construct the model.\nAs USArray passed through North America, it recorded many earthquakes within the continental interior, including several rare M > 5 events in the central and eastern US. These data provide an opportunity to validate global and regional tomographic models against new data. In this study, we seek to quantify the extent to which various tomographic models predict S and Rayleigh wavetrains for earthquakes recorded at regional distances (< 30 degrees) within North America.\nWe test the predictive power of several tomographic models by comparing synthetic data to observed waveforms using the time-frequency misfit methods of Kristekova et al. (2009). We also compare path-average mode-summation synthetics to spectral-element synthetics. We find that adding more data to a tomographic model does not always or everywhere improve its predictions of regional waveforms.\nWe also propose a novel method for testing and improving tomographic models by demonstrating that portions of the time-frequency phase misfit can be approximately linearly related to perturbations in the 3D velocity model. Using this relationship, we identify regions of tomographic models which contribute the best fits to our new waveform data.",

            "abstract": "I have two goals with my research.\n1. I proposed that sound recordings can be used to detect the amount of water flowing in a particular river, which could then be used to measure stream flow in rivers that have no instrumentation. My locations are in remote watersheds where hand instrumentation is the only means to collect data. I record 15 minute samples, at varied intervals, of the streams with a stereo microphone suspended above the river perpendicular to stream flow forming a “profile” of the river that can be compared to other stream-flow measurements of these areas over the course of a year. Through waveform analysis, I found a distinct voice for each river and I am quantifying the sound to track the flow based on amplitude, pitch, and wavelengths that these rivers produce.\n2. Additionally, I plan to also use my DVD quality sound recordings with professional photos and HD video of these remote sites in education, outreach, and therapeutic venues. The outreach aspect of my research follows my goal of bridging communication between researchers and the public. Wyoming rivers are unique in that we export 85% of our water downstream. I would also like to take these recordings to schools, set up speakers in the four corners of a classroom and let the river flow as the teacher presents on water science. Immersion in an environment can help the learning experience of students. I have seen firsthand the power of drawing someone into an environment through sound and video. I will have my river sounds with me at AGU presented as an interactive touch-screen sound experience.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the microbial metabolic pathways that most strongly influence ecosystem carbon (C) cycling requires a deeper understanding of the availability and accessibility of microbial substrates. A first step towards this goal is characterizing the relationships between microbial community function and soil C chemistry in a field context. For this perspective, soil aggregate fractions can be used as model systems that scale between microbe-substrate interactions and ecosystem C cycling and storage. The present study addresses how physicochemical variation among soil aggregate fractions influences the composition and functional potential of C cycling microbial communities. We report variation across soil aggregates using plot scale biological replicates from biofuel agroecosystems (fertilized, reconstructed, tallgrass prairie). Our results suggest that C and nitrogen (N) chemistry significantly differ among aggregate fractions. This leads to variation in microbial community composition, which was better characterized among aggregates than by using the whole soil. In fact by considering soil aggregation, we were able to characterize almost 2000 more taxa than whole soil alone, resulting in 65% greater community richness. Availability of C and N strongly influenced the composition of microbial communities among soil aggregate fractions. The normalized abundance of microbial functional guilds among aggregate fractions correlated with C and N chemistry, as did functional potential, measured by extracellular enzyme activity. Metagenomic results suggest that soil aggregate fractions select for functionally distinct microbial communities, which may significantly influence decomposition and soil C storage. Our study provides support for the premise that integration of soil aggregate chemistry, especially microaggregates that have greater microbial richness and occur at spatial scales relevant to microbial community functioning, may be necessary to understand the role of microbial communities on terrestrial C and N cycling.",

            "abstract": "The Early Mississippian Kinderhookian-Osagean (K-O) boundary transition represents one of the largest global perturbations of carbon cycle during Phanerozoic. This interval is characterized by large positive carbonate carbon isotope anomaly (δ13Ccarb) enriched to more than + 5‰ that has been globally recognized. Controversies exit regarding the origin and nature of this carbon isotope excursion. Here we report that a primary preservation of the K-O δ13Ccarb excursion was coupled by organic carbon isotope (δ13Corg) and organic nitrogen isotope (δ15Norg) from carbonate successions of Great Basin in Western USA. Our samples were obtained from Mountain Home (MH) and Alamo (AL) sections, represent shallow and deeper depositional environment, respectively. The values of δ13Ccarb covaried with δ13Corg in both sections, indicating photosynthetic origin of organic carbon isotope excursion during K-O. δ13Ccarb values from AL records 1–1.5‰ higher than MH, possibly related to locally higher production. Carbonate–organic carbon isotope differences (Δ13C = δ13Ccarb – δ13Corg) increase across the peak of δ13Ccarb excursion in AL section but remain invariant ∆δ13C in MH, suggesting that δ13Corg values in AL may have been imprinted with signature from secondary (chemo- and methanotrophic) biomass contribution as anoxia was developed in the distal carbonate platform. The contrasting ∆δ13C profiles in time-equivalent sections questioned the general concept that increase in ∆δ13C records elevated O2/CO2 ratios, as have been suggested for Late Cambrian and Permo-Carboniferous. Only when the temporal depositional environments did not change, the ∆δ13C may have implications for changes in O2/CO2 ratios. Nitrogen isotopes values increased to 4‰ across the K-O δ13C excursion indicating increased pelagic denitrification in response to the development of oxygen minimum zone as a result of enhanced organic carbon production, global cooling and sea-level fall. The integrated δ13Ccarb, δ13Corg, and δ15Norg data across the K-O transition support an organic carbon burial event associated with global cooling/oxygenation occurred during the Early Mississippian.",

It was found the valence and conduction bands of F-doped TiO2, with the doped F concentration of 1.19 %, consisted of the electrons of O2p and Ti3d.The small amount of electrons of F2p didn't change the band gap of TiO2. For S-F-codoped TiO2, with the same S, F concentration of 1.19 %, the upper valence appeared doping states due to additional S-doping, and the transition of S3p to the conduction band was the reason for the redshift of S-F-TiO2 compared with undoped TiO2.Results indicated that the S-F-codoped anatase TiO2is an intrinsic semiconductor with a band gap of 1.80 eV.\nExperimental results exhibited a figure-of-merit for photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis of S-F-codoped anatase TiO2 in visible light region. The removal efficiency of Acid Orange 7 reached 98.1 % in 180 min under visible light irradiation (I0 = 0.6 mW/cm2, λ＞400 nm) with a bias voltage of 0.25 V.

            "abstract": "Subglacial drainage is known to play an important role in glacier dynamics trough its influence on basal sliding. However, drainage is also the most poorly understood dynamic process due to the difficulties of observing, identifying and modeling the physics involved.\nIn an effort to improve understanding of subglacial hydrological processes, we have monitored a small, approximately 100 m thick surge-type alpine glacier for seven years. 225 boreholes, positioned to capture the spatial structure of the drainage system over a 0.4 km² study area in its upper ablation area, were instrumented with permanent pressure transducers, in addition to a permanent GPS array and weather station installed on the glacier.\nOur principal results are\ni) Each year the drainage system experiences a relatively brief (1-2 month) period of activity driven by diurnal surface melt, with a spring event and a spatial reorganization of the drainage system.\nii) The evolution of the drainage system can lead to very narrow main drainage axes, poorly connected laterally but traceable over long downslope distances (>500 m) with very little attenuation of the pressure signal, indicating that leakage into englacial or subglacial storage is relatively small. In at least one instance, a borehole have reached directly a channel with highly turbulent water flow.\niii) Our data also indicates the occurrence of distributed drainage over extended spatial regions, co-existing in close spatial proximity with channelized areas showing little evidence of hydraulic connection between them.\nv) Crevasses appear to have a significant influence on the pattern of drainage.\nvi) While most neighboring boreholes exhibit uncorrelated winter water pressures, there is strong evidence for winter-time drainage activity in the form of pressure oscillations along main drainage axes.\nvii) There is strong evidence for interannual variability in the distributed versus channelized character of drainage, with drainage axes shifting in space.\nSome of these results are consistent with established ideas about drainage physics, while others suggest refinements to existing understanding . We discuss how our results fit into current efforts to model subglacial drainage and alterations to drainage model physics that are suggested by our observations.",

            "abstract": "We present a detailed lithostratigraphic and structural analysis of the Archean Doolena Gap greenstone belt to shed light on the tectonic evolution of the EPT. The study area is divided into four structural domains: i) marginal orthogneisses of the MGC (Muccan Granitoid Complex), ii) a dominantly mafic mylonitic shear zone (South Muccan Shear Zone, SMSZ) enveloping the MGC, iii) a Central Fold Belt of dominantly mafic greenschists (CFB), and iv) a lower greenschist- to sub-greenschist southern domain. Toward the dome margin, abrupt increases in deformation intensity occur across domain boundaries. Domain boundaries and intra-domain shear zones are marked by significant carbonate +/- quartz alteration and high-strain non-coaxial deformation with dome-up kinematics. The southern domain comprises pillow basalts of the Mount Ada Formation (MAF), conformably overlain by clastic sediments and minor pillow basalts of the Duffer Formation (DF). The MAF and DF are overlain by an up to 1km thick package of quartzite (Strelley Pool Formation) across an angular unconformity. Isoclinal folds (F2) within the CFB to the North deform an early foliation (S1) within dominantly mafic schists and associated carbonate veins. F2 folds are preserved within lozenges that are parallel to the axial planes of F2 folds in a regional E-W trending foliation (S2) and to the SMSZ. Lozenges are often bound by zones of significant carbonate alteration. The lozenges are folded recumbently (F3), with sub-vertical fold axes pointing towards the dome. The F3 axes are parallel to mineral stretching lineations on S2 indicating dome-up movement. The entire belt is cut by late NE-SW-striking faults that exhibit dominantly brittle deformation in the southern domain but ductile drag folding (F4) in the CFB. Therefore, the southern domain must have overlain the CFB during this D4 event.\nWe propose a protracted structural history of the greenstone belt where successive deformation events relate to the episodic emplacement of the MGC. We demonstrate that the greenstone keel is mainly characterised by an anastomosing shear zone network, induced by hydro-chemical weakening of mafic schists. This implies that previous estimates of stratigraphic thickness are significantly overestimated.",

            "abstract": "Lunar swirls are enigmatic high-albedo surface markings co-located with magnetic anomalies. The existence of mini-magnetospheres has been proposed as a formation mechanism, making small-scale magnetic field interactions with the solar wind of interest. Using data from the Lunar Prospector, Clementine, and Advanced Composition Explorer missions, we develop three metrics for the identification of mini-magnetospheres: 1) presence of coherent magnetism at low altitude for magnetic field measurements taken in the solar wind; 2) directional field distortions that are correlated with changes in incident solar wind azimuth; 3) intensification of total field strength. These metrics are applied to four lunar magnetic anomalies with various reflectances and magnetic field strengths, ranging from fully developed swirls (Reiner-Gamma, Airy) to diffuse albedo patches which may or may not be swirls (Descartes, Crozier). Specifically, we compare magnetic field measurements in the solar wind to source magnetization models constructed from observations in the lunar wake and Earth’s magnetotail.\nBy applying these criteria, we confirm previous findings of magnetosphere-like phenomena at Reiner-Gamma. We also find evidence of these phenomena at Descartes and Airy, and propose that mini-magnetospheres may exist here. At Airy, very large upwind distortions are observed, comparable to the length scale of the anomaly itself. At Reiner-Gamma and Descartes, this distortion is significantly smaller, yet the average field strengths are higher, implying that the scale of distortion is linked to the anomaly’s field strength. Interestingly, at Crozier, the weakest anomaly considered, we do not observe this distortion. However, we do observe evidence of field intensification at high solar wind pressures (16 nPa).\nWhile Descartes and Reiner-Gamma are among the strongest anomalies on the Moon, and both exhibit magnetospheric properties, only Reiner-Gamma shows a well-developed swirl pattern. Similarly, Airy and Crozier both exhibit properties of magnetospheres, yet only Airy is clearly a swirl. This implies that even if some mini-magnetospheric characteristics are observed, this is not sufficient to create swirl morphology; distribution of the source magnetization may play a critical role.",

            "abstract": "Diversity and structure of the soil microbial community (SMC) significantly affects soil ecosystem services including, nutrient cycling, C-mineralization, and stabilization/formation of soil structure. SMC also responds to changes in soil moisture and chemistry. Stemflow, the concentration of precipitation to soils at the trunk base, is well known to alter these edaphic conditions near the stem. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the potential link between stemflow and SMC structure. Soil samples collected near stems of two tree species of contrasting stemflow character (Fagus grandifolia [AB] and Liriodendron tulipifera [YP]) were evaluated for changes in chemical properties and SMC structure via PCR-DGGE (denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis) in summer, winter, and spring. Variations within the SMC DGGE banding profiles were determined by GelCompare II software and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of dominant and unique DGGE bands was conducted to identify shifts in significant SMC organisms. Our results demonstrate that stemflow can alter edaphic conditions near individual tree trunks, and that temporal soil moisture trends, soil pH, PO43-, SO42-, and Ca2+ can further vary in response to species-specific stemflow supply characteristics. This, in turn, may explain SMC structural and diversity differences in the proximal area (< 0.5 m) of different SMC species’ near tree trunks. Specifically, SMC diversity (particularly bacterial) increases where stemflow resources are unevenly input for YP but decrease for AB which has more consistent stemflow inputs. Soil chemistry and microbial community differences between species’ proximal areas also indicate the potential for stemflow processes to influence soil pH, and therefore nutrient status, including SOM. Seasonal patterns in DGGE banding patterns and intensity further show that as stemflow characteristics change with canopy phenology and meteorological conditions, so do specific clades or species (e.g., ectomycchorizal and saprophytic fungi, or proteo- and actinobacteria).",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and model groundwater fluxes are first-order sources of error in streamflow forecasting. While near-surface estimates of soil moisture are now available from satellite, very few soil moisture observations below 5 cm depth or groundwater discharge estimates are available for operational forecasting. Radar precipitation estimates are subject to large biases, particularly during extreme events (e.g. Steiner et al., 2010) and their correction is not typically available in real-time. Streamflow data, however, are readily available in near-real-time and can be assimilated operationally to help constrain uncertainty in these uncertain states and improve streamflow forecasts.\nWe examine the ability of streamflow observations to diagnose bias in the three most uncertain variables: precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and groundwater fluxes. We investigate strategies for their subsequent bias correction. These include spinup and calibration strategies with and without the use of data assimilation and the determination of the proper spinup timescales. Global and spatially distributed multipliers on the uncertain states included in the assimilation state vector (e.g. Seo et al., 2003) will also be evaluated.\nWe examine real cases and observing system simulation experiments for both normal and extreme rainfall events. One of our test cases considers the Colorado Front Range flood of September 2013 where the range of disagreement amongst five precipitation estimates spanned a factor of five with only one exhibiting appreciable positive bias (Gochis et al, submitted). Our experiments are conducted using the WRF-Hydro model with the NoahMP land surface component and the data assimilation research testbed (DART). A variety of ensemble data assimilation approaches (filters) are considered.\n",

            "abstract": "Houston and the surrounding Harris County have experienced the detrimental effects of subsidence even prior to World War II, to the extent that the land along Galveston Bay had sunk as much as 20 feet since 1906. One dramatic example is the Brownwood subdivision, a coastal community in Baytown where continuous flooding due to subsidence forced the area to be deemed unlivable and consequently abandoned. Thus, Houston’s changes in groundwater and compaction of its aquifers are of relatively high concern to those in the public (infrastructure), private (oil & gas), and international (Port of Houston Authority) sectors. One of the key questions related to the subsidence issue in Houston area is what are the contributions of sediments at different depths, and what particularly is the contribution from shallow sediments? To address these questions, University of Houston has installed a vertical GPS array in the UH Coastal Center in March 2014. The GPS array includes four permanent GPS stations with the antenna pole foundations anchored at different depths below ground surface (-10 m, -7m, -4m, 0 m). A special, double-pipe GPS antenna monument was designed for GPS stations with the array. This project was funded by an NSF grant and a UH internal grant. Five groundwater wells with the depths ranging from 2 m to 100 m below the ground surface were also installed at the UH Coastal Center site. This study will investigate continuous GPS and groundwater level measurements (March-November, 2014) at the UHCC site. It is expected that the GPS array will provide total information on subsidence as well as compaction of aquifers within different depth ranges (0 to -4m, -4 to -7 m, -7 to -10m, and below -10 m). Correlation of land subsidence and groundwater fluctuation will also be investigated.",

We investigate two different scales of UAS platforms for monitoring coastal processes along the central Texas Gulf coast.\nFirstly, the eBee is a small-scale UAS weighing ~0.7 kg designed for localized mapping. The imaging payload consists of a hand held RGB digital camera and NIR digital camera, both with 16.1 megapixel resolutions. The system can map up to 10 square kilometers on a single flight and is capable of acquiring imagery down to 1.5 cm ground sample distance. The eBee is configured with a GPS receiver, altitude sensor, gyroscope and a radio transmitter enabling autonomous flight. The system has a certificate of authorization (COA) from the FAA to fly over the Ward Island campus of Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC). The campus has an engineered beach, called University Beach, located along Corpus Christi Bay. A set of groins and detached breakwaters were built in an effort to protect the beach from erosive wave action. The eBee is being applied to periodically survey the beach (Figure 1A). Through Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques, eBee-derived image sequences are post-processed to extract 3D topography and measure volumetric change. Additionally, when water clarity suffices, this approach enables the extraction of shallow-water bathymetry. Results on the utilization of the eBee to monitor beach morphodynamics will be presented including a comparison of derived estimates to RTK GPS and airborne lidar.\nSecondly, the RS-16 UAS has a 4 m wingspan and 11 kg sensor payload. The system is remotely piloted and has a flight endurance of 12 to 16 hours making it suitable for regional scale coastal mapping. The imaging payload consists of a multispectral sensor suite measuring in the visible, thermal IR, and ultraviolet ranges of the spectrum. The RS-16 is being used to conduct surveys along the shoreline of North Padre Island, which is a high wind energy and wave-dominated barrier island system (Figure 1B). Results on the utilization of the RS-16 to study alongshore variability in shoreline dynamics and surf zone processes, such as wave runup, will be presented.",

Using science as a context to help students engage in the engineering practices and engineering disciplinary core ideas is an essential step to students’ understanding of how science drives engineering and how engineering enables science. Real world examples and applications are critical for students to see how these disciplines are integrated. Furthermore, the interface of science and engineering raise the level of science understanding, and facilitate higher order thinking skills through relevant experiences.\nAstrobiobound! is designed for the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) and CCSS (Common Core State Standards). Students also practice and build 21st Century Skills. Astrobiobound! help students see how science and systems engineering are integrated to achieve a focused scientific goal. Students engage in the engineering design process to design a space mission which requires them to balance the return of their science data with engineering limitations such as power, mass and budget. Risk factors also play a role during this simulation and adds to the excitement and authenticity.\nAstrobiobound! presents the authentic first stages of NASA mission design process. This simulation mirrors the NASA process in which the science goals, type of mission, and instruments to return required data to meet mission goals are proposed within mission budget before any of the construction part of engineering can begin. NASA scientists and engineers were consulted in the development of this activity as an authentic simulation of their mission proposal process.",

            "abstract": "Many outer Solar System satellites have surfaces dominated by water ice and a mysterious material(s) causing strong visible to ultraviolet absorption along with trace other compounds with infrared absorptions, including CO2 and organics. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the UV absorber, including tholins, iron oxides, and nano-sized metallic iron particles (e.g. see Clark et al., 2012, Icarus v218 p831, and references therein). We have constructed extensive laboratory analog measurements and radiative transfer modeling of the materials and scattering conditions that can contribute to the optical properties seen on outer Solar System satellites. We have successfully modeled Rayleigh absorption and Rayleigh scattering to produce spectral shapes typical of those seen in spectra of icy Solar System satellites, including those in the Saturn system observed with the Cassini UVIS and VIMS instruments. While it is easy to create these absorptions with radiative transfer modeling, it has been more difficult to do with laboratory analogs. We are finding that laboratory analogs refine and restricts the possible mixing states of the UV absorber in icy satellite surfaces. We have found that just because a particle is highly absorbing, as in metallic iron, if the particle is not embedded in another matrix, scattering will dominate over absorption and Rayleigh absorption will not be observed. Further, the closer the indices of refraction match between the absorbing particle and the matrix, there will be less scattering and more absorption will occur. But we have also found this to be true with other absorbing material, like Tholins. It is very difficult to obtain the very low reflectances observed in the UV in icy satellite spectra using traditional intimate mixtures, as scattering and first surface reflections contribute significantly to the reflectance. The solution, both from radiative transfer modeling and laboratory analogs point to embedded absorbing materials. For example, nano-phase metallic iron embedded in a less absorbing silicate matrix as meteoritic dust infall onto satellite\nsurfaces is one explanation. An alternative would be tholins embedded in the ice. Spectral features should be able to distinguish between these and other possibilities and will be explored.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic region is a pristine environment with minimal anthropogenic influence. Aerosol measurements in this environment allow the study of natural aerosols and polar atmospheric dynamics. Measurements in this region have been limited primarily to continental and coastal locations where permanent stations exist, with a handful of measurements in the sea ice region. The MAPS campaign (Measurements of Aerosols and Precursors during SIPEXII) occurred as part of SIPEX II (Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems eXperiment II) voyage in Spring, 2012, and produced the first Antarctic pack-ice focused aerosol dataset aimed at characterizing new particle formation processes off the coast of East Antarctica (~65°S, 120°E). Numerous atmospheric parameters and species were measured, including the number of aerosol particles in the 3-10 nm size range, the range associated with nucleating particle formation. A latitudinal transect through the sea ice identified the Polar Front from sudden changes in nucleating particle concentrations, averaging 51cm-3 north of the front in the Ferrel cell, and 766 cm-3 south of the front, in the Polar cell region. The Polar Front location was also confirmed by meteorological and back-trajectory data. Background aerosol populations in the Polar cell fluctuated significantly but displayed no growth indicators, suggesting transport. Back-trajectories revealed that air parcels often descended from the free-troposphere within the previous 24-48 hrs. It is proposed that particle formation occurs in the free troposphere from precursors uplifted at the polar front region which, being a sea-ice/ocean region, is a significant precursor source. After tropospheric formation, populations descending at the poles are transported northward and reach the sea ice surface, missing continental stations. Current measurements of Antarctic aerosol suggest very low loading which may be explained by these circulation patterns and may underestimate total regional loading and the contribution of Antarctic aerosol production to global loading. As climate change intensifies and the ozone hole recovers, the Antarctic polar front may shift latitudes, potentially changing Antarctic and regional aerosol loading, resulting in changes to tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry and radiative budgets.",

            "abstract": "At the LDEO REU site, we take student health and safety very seriously. In 2014, we gave the students training on laboratory safety, fire safety, and a Title IX orientation covering discrimination and sexual harassment. We also compile emergency contact information for all the students and distribute it to students, mentors and the administration. Students choose a research project and mentors then pick the best student for their project. Because the mentors choose the student, they are more invested in the student. Students and mentors are encouraged to interact before the program starts, both through discussions and assigned background reading. During these discussions, research projects are often modified to better-fit students interests and skill levels. During the program, we facilitate student-mentor interaction by conducting three research-focusing sessions with small groups of students. Students give 20-minute long oral presentations on the progress of their research and answer questions about their project. Mentors prepare the students for these sessions, thereby increasing student knowledge about their research project. Mid-way through the summer, students write a 3-page proposal about their research as part of a special seminar on scientific writing. The students also participate in a final poster session that is attended by the LDEO community. We maximize student engagement by giving students a choice of research projects that are specifically selected for their suitability for and interest among undergraduates. The track record of mentors is also considered. Mentors must be in residence at LDEO during most of the intern program and arrange a suitable co-mentor during any absences. Mentors must be individuals who are able to encourage the students while giving them constructive input on the progress of their research project. We also encourage students to present their research results at a national scientific meeting. Students and mentors are given a schedule at the start of the summer that includes the abstract deadlines for major national meetings. When it is possible, we fund each student’s attendance of a national meeting. Enthusiastic students who wish to attend a second meeting are given information on how to apply for funding to support attendance.",

Such a comparison has significant and practical implications for deriving global climatology of important atmospheric turbulence parameters such as energy dissipation rates from routine high vertical resolution radiosonde data as suggested by Clayson and Kantha (2008). The DNS results can determine exactly all the turbulence quantities needed to evaluate Thorpe scale and Ozmidov scale in the simulation results thus can be employed to assess the accuracy and universality of expressions relating the two length scales identified in previous field measurements and other simulation results. We evaluate the ratio of the two length scales for an entire computational domain containing multiple turbulence events or for individual events in a subset of the full domain. This allows an evaluation of the possible dependence of the ratio on instability character, Re and other flow parameters.",

            "abstract": "Two numerical simulations that depict the entire life cycles of Atlantic hurricanes were recently developed and produced for use as \"nature runs\" in observing system simulation experiments. These hurricanes are down-scaled, high-resolution depictions of Atlantic cyclones simulated in the global nature run previously produced by ECMWF. By comparions to composited observations, the structural evolutions of the simulated storms were shown to be quite realistic. Both cases have periods of rapid intensification (RI), which is typically defined as 30 knots of surface wind speed increase in a 24 hour period. However, the modes of RI are quite different: RI in the first storm (NRH1) occurs over the open ocean after a significant decrease in wind shear, while RI in the second storm (NRH2) occurs after it moves off of Cuba and into the Florida Straits. This study will compare and contrast these two modes of RI to each other and to available observations from real hurricanes. During RI, NRH1 has a series of convective bursts that lead to a brief period of \"overshooting tops\" on the inside edge of the eyewall. The RI of NRH2 is much more asymmetric, with mesovortices generated on the downshear-leftquadrant of the eyewall that spiral into the center. The relative roles of diabatic heating and surface friction to intensification and contraction of the inner-core wind fields will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Comparing ancient channel and floodplain deposits provides insight into long-term channel and floodplain dynamics in alluvial basins. Channel lateral migration and avulsion behavior may be affected by floodplain characteristics, including sediment cohesion, vegetation cover, and floodplain-drainage conditions. Channel-deposit architecture reflects paleo-channel dynamics; for example, channel form, migration, and reworking can be inferred from bar deposits, while multi-storied sand bodies can indicate a complex history of channel avulsion, reoccupation and migration. Furthermore, associated floodplain deposits can be used to reconstruct some aspects of floodplain sedimentation patterns, drainage, and soil development. In order to better understand how channel mobility may be linked to floodplain conditions, we compare the three members of the Paleocene-Eocene Wasatch Formation, which were deposited under broadly similar basin subsidence conditions, and straddle the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) climate-change event. These ancient deposits show varying styles of channel and floodplain deposits. The Atwell Gulch (pre-PETM) and Shire (post-PETM) members of the Wasatch Formation are both mud-stone dominated, with abundant, well-developed paleosol deposits. In contrast, the middle Molina Member is sand-rich and contains more weakly developed paleosols. Using terrestrial lidar scans and high-resolution photo panels of outcrops, along with detailed field measurements, we identify key surfaces (including bar-accretion, and story-bounding surfaces) and facies within channel deposits, and describe floodplain deposits within each member. Concurrent changes in paleo-channel architecture and floodplain deposits observed within the succession suggest that floodplain conditions are important controls on channel mobility in Wasatch rivers.",

IGRB support the food security of hundreds of millions people in South Asia. The food production in IGRB strictly relies on the magnitude and spatiotemporal pattern of monsoon precipitation. Due to severe drought during the last decades and food production failure in IGRB, several studies have focused on understanding the main drivers for south Asia monsoon failures and drought characteristics based on the historical data. However, the period of available historical data is not enough to address the full characteristic of drought under a changing climate. In this study, an inverse Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) model is developed to retrieve the paleoprecipitation back to 700 years in the region, taking the inputs of available soil water capacity, temperature, and previous reconstructed PDSI based on tree-ring analysis at 2.5 degree resolution. Based on the retrieved paleoprecipitation, drought frequency and intensity are quantified for two periods of 1300-1899 (the reconstruction period) and 1900-2010 (the instrumental period). Previous studies have shown that in IGRB, a severe drought occurs when the annual precipitation deficit, compared with the long-term average precipitation, is greater than 10%. Climatic drought frequency is calculated as the percentage of years with predefined severe droughts. Drought intensity is defined as the average precipitation deficit during all of the years identified as severe droughts. Results show that the drought frequency, as well as the spatial extent, has significantly increased from the reconstruction period to the instrumental period. The drought frequency in the Indus River basin is higher than that in the Ganges River basin. Several mega-droughts are identified during the reconstruction period.",

Baltimore and Norfolk canyons were studied during the multidisciplinary Atlantic Deepwater Canyons project through funding from BOEM, NOAA, and USGS. Sediment and water column properties were assessed in the context of canyon physical dynamics and ecosystem ecology. Sediment samples were collected by NIOZ box corer in 2012 and 2013 along canyon axes and comparative adjacent slopes at standardized depths. Sediments were analyzed for grain size, organic content, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, chlorophyll a, and benthic infauna. Water column properties were sampled using CTD transects, and benthic landers and moorings positioned along canyon axes. Significant differences in sediment transport regimes were found for each canyon where observed nepheloid layers corresponded to shifts in infaunal community structure. Significant community shifts were observed in stations at depths > 900m in Baltimore Canyon, coinciding with higher organic matter concentrations at depths below the nepheloid layer. In contrast, adjacent slope communities exhibited a more uniform infaunal assemblage where distinct zonation patterns by depth were observed. Preliminary data for Norfolk Canyon suggest very different sediment deposition rates in the canyon and also show clear differences between canyon and slope benthic communities. Geological processes and canyon topography coupled with organic inputs and disturbance events are clear factors in determining benthic infaunal diversity and standing stock dynamics in and around these canyons.

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimation of capacity of suspended sediment load is critical for reconstruction of flows such as tsunamis or turbidity currents. Capacity of suspended load is a layer-averaged concentration at which suspended sediments are saturated in flows, and it works as a threshold between erosion and deposition from suspended sediments. Capacity of suspended load varies depending on sediment grain-size, flow velocity and flow height, and therefore it is useful for reconstructing paleohydraulic conditions of suspension-rich flows.\nGenerally, suspension capacity has been calculated from a simple equilibrium conditions of rates of sediment entrainment and suspension fallout. Various empirical functions of sediment entrainment are available, and suspension fallout rates can be estimated from theoretical distribution. However, Goto et al. (2014) recently revealed that sediment concentration of actual run-up flows of large-scale tsunamis is far below the estimated value based on the field observations of 2011 Tohoku-Oki Tsunami. Thus, it is necessary to reconsider existing models of suspension capacity.\n Here we propose a new method to estimate capacity of suspended load considering preservation of kinetic energy of turbulence. Density stratification caused by suspended sediments expends energy of turbulence in flows, but most of previous methods did not consider this effect. We employed a model to calculate preservation of turbulent kinetic energy proposed by Parker et al. (1986). As a result, it was revealed that capacity of high-velocity flows (e.g. 10 m/s) is quite low (e.g. 2 %) although previous models predict very high-concentration (e.g. ~20 %). Our estimation is quite conformable to the result of the observation of 2011 Tohoku-Oki Tsunami. Also, our model predict that friction of flows remarkably decrease due to expended turbulence energy. Decrease of Reynolds stress causes apparently low friction coefficient of flows.\nOur new method is especially important for considering high-velocity flows although the effect of density stratification of suspended sediments is not significant in cases of low-velocity flows (< 3 m/s). Thus, in future studies, our method can be expected to apply for inverse analysis of paleohydraulic conditions of flows such as tsunamis, turbidity currents or rivers on Mars.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the three-dimensional (3-D) shear-velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath the Atlantic Ocean. Phase velocity in the period range 30-130 seconds is measured for approximately 10,000 fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves traversing the Atlantic basin. In order to isolate the signal of the oceanic upper mantle, paths with >30% of their length through continental upper mantle are excluded. The lateral distribution of Rayleigh wave phase velocity in the Atlantic upper mantle is explored with two approaches. One, phase velocity is allowed to vary only as a function of seafloor age. Two, a general two-dimensional parameterization is utilized in order to capture perturbations to age-dependent structure. In both scenarios, phase velocity shows a strong dependence on seafloor age at all periods, with higher velocity associated with older seafloor. Removing age-dependent velocity from the 2-D phase-velocity maps highlights areas of anomalously low velocity, almost all of which are proximal to locations of hotspot volcanism. The age-dependent phase velocities for the Atlantic are not consistent with a half-space cooling model and are best explained by a plate cooling model with thickness of 75 km and mantle temperature of 1400oC. In contrast, age-dependent phase velocities for the Pacific basin determined by Nishimura and Forsyth [1989] can be fit reasonably well by a half-space cooling model with mantle temperature approximately 50oC warmer than the Atlantic. Comparison of Rayleigh wave phase velocity and fractionation-corrected Na concentrations in mid-ocean-ridge basalts erupted at 87 axial ridge segments reveals a positive correlation coefficient that increases with period, as expected if along-ridge variations in mantle potential temperature are controlling both quantities. Depth-dependent variations in vertically-polarized shear velocity are explored with a 3-D model and allow for comparison to previous whole-basin studies of the Atlantic [e.g., Moquet and Romanowicz, 1990; Silveira and Stutzmnn, 2002] and to global tomographic studies. We assess the relative contributions of temperature, composition, partial melt, and volatiles to the imaged shear-velocity anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Supporting life in icy world or exoplanet oceans may require global seafloor chemical reactions between water and rock. Such interactions have been regarded as limited in larger icy worlds such as Ganymede and Titan, where ocean depths approach 800 km and GPa pressures (>10katm). If the oceans are composed of pure water, such conditions are consistent with the presence of dense ice phases V and VI that cover the rocky seafloor. Exoplanets with oceans can obtain pressures sufficient to generate ices VII and VIII. We have previously demonstrated temperature gradients in such oceans on the order of 20 K or more, resulting from fluid compressibility in a deep adiabatic ocean based on our experimental work. Accounting for increases in density for highly saline oceans leads to the possibility of oceans perched under and between high pressure ices. Ammonia has the opposite effect, instead decreasing ocean density, as reported by others and confirmed by our laboratory measurements in the ammonia water system.\nHere we report on the completed equation of state for aqueous ammonia derived from our prior measurements and optimized global b-spline fitting methods We use recent diamond anvil cell measurements for water and ammonia to extend the equation of state to 400°C and beyond 2 GPa, temperatures and pressures applicable to icy worlds and exoplanets. Densities show much less temperature dependence but comparabe high-pressure derivatives to previously published ammonia-water properties derived for application to Titan (Croft et al. 1988). Thermal expansion is in better agreement with the more self-consistent equation of state of Tillner-Roth and Friend (1998).\nWe also describe development of a planetary NaCl equation of state using recent measurements of phase boundaries and sound speeds.\nWe examine implications of realistic ocean-ice thermodynamics for Titan and exoplanet interiors using the methodology recently applied to Ganymede for oceans dominated by MgSO4. High pressure ices should not be present on Titan if its ocean composition is Dead-Sea like, as recently inferred from tidal dissipation and topography, and if Titan’s moment of inertia has the published value of C/MR2 = 0.3414.",

            "abstract": "The variability of SST in the tropical Pacific associated with ENSO is well predicted in time scales from 6 months to 1 year advance. However, the prediction skills of ENSO in many ENSO prediction systems are lower in the 2000s than those in the 1980s and 1990s. Since late 1990s sea surface height and SST have increased in the western equatorial Pacific and easterly surface wind has increased in the decadal time scale. It has not been fully understood whether the decadal variability in the tropical Pacific could cause the lower prediction skill of ENSO during the recent decade. In this study, decadal variability of prediction skill of ENSO using ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation model and its relationship with decadal variability of tropical Pacific are examined. It is found that prediction skill of ENSO fluctuates in the decadal time scale. Anomaly correlation coefficient of NINO3 SST for the 1979-2006 period is 0.76 at 6-month lead time, but 0.40 for the 2003-2011 period. NINO3 SST error at 6-month lead time changes in the decadal time scale and has increased since late 1990s. The period of large SST error corresponds to that of large decadal anomalies of observed NINO3 SST. It is shown that decadal variability of NINO3 SST error is consistent with that of magnitude of initial SST anomalies in the prediction. Decadal anomalies of zonal gradient of observed thermocline depth in the equatorial Pacific are large in the early 1990s and late 2000s. However, those anomalies decrease rapidly in the prediction. Positive temperature errors at the depth of thermocline at the beginning of the prediction develop with propagating eastward accompanied by westerly surface wind anomalies. It is important for successful ENSO prediction to reduce errors of thermocline depth at the beginning of prediction and to understand how decadal anomalies in the equatorial Pacific are maintained in the observation and prediction.",

            "abstract": "An important challenge in understanding complex microbial mat communities is determining how groups of a single species balance metabolic requirements with the dynamics of resource supply. We have investigated this problem in the context of redox resources within a single-species bacterial biofilm. We developed a mathematical model of oxidant availability and metabolic response within biofilm features and we show that observed biofilm geometries maximize cellular reproduction and growth efficiency. Our model accurately predicts the measured distribution of two types of electron acceptors: oxygen, which is available from the environment, and phenazines, redox-active small molecules produced by the bacterium. Because our model is based on resource dynamics, we are also able to predict observed shifts in feature geometry based on changes in the availability of redox resources such as variations in the external availability of oxygen or the removal of phenazines. This analysis suggests various avenues for understanding microstructure and the evolution of spatial metabolism in microbial mats. ",

The projected deployment of the European Space Agency Sentinel 4, Korean Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Geostationary GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) and Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) sounders provides a unique opportunity to quantify the current and future trajectory of emissions and their impact on global pollution. We examine the potential of this constellation of air quality sounders to quantify the role of local and non-local sources of pollution on background ozone in the US. Based upon an adjoint sensitivity method, we compute the role of synoptic scale transport of spatially-resolved non-US pollution on US background ozone over months representative of different source-receptor relationships. This analysis allows us to compute potential emission trajectories of megacities, e.g. Beijing, or regions, e.g., western China, on downwind ozone. We subsequently explore how reductions of emission uncertainties from constellation observations could improve attribution of local versus non-local contributors to US background ozone. These results show how this unprecedented new international ozone observing system can monitor the changing structure of emissions and their impact on global pollution.",

It provides essential cultural, recreational, and aesthetic values and also plays a critical role in the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Recent analyses of water systems across the planet, summarized using high resolution, geospatial indicator maps of rivers, demonstrate that a wide array of stressors combine to produce a pattern of worldwide threat to much of the freshwater resource base that sustains human water supply and aquatic biodiversity. A pervasive, globally-significant pattern of management is evident in the contemporary setting, through which impairment accumulates as a function of wealth, but is then remedied by costly, after-the-fact technological investments. This strategy of treating symptoms while leaving unabated the underlying causes is practiced widely across rich countries, but it strands poor nations and much of the world's aquatic lifeforms at high levels of vulnerability. The seeds of such an approach to water management are hardly new and are evident throughout human history. This talk will explore the implications of these global realities and will focus on the role of 21st century engineering as in both contributing to the growing water crisis and stimulating innovation for more effective stewardship of our water resource systems. It will also present a first global synthesis of the geography of freshwater provisioning source areas, evaluating jointly the quantity and condition of freshwater produced from these areas, and the downstream populations served by these resources. A geospatial indicator is derived, the freshwater provisioning index for humans (FPIh), which constitutes an objective measure of the state of the resource base and its role in supporting human water security.",

            "abstract": "Drought-induced tree mortality worldwide has been recently reported in a review of the literature by Allen et al. (2010). However, a quantitative relationship between widespread loss of forest from mortality and drought is still a key knowledge gap. Specifically, the field lacks quantitative knowledge of tipping point in trees when coping with water stress, which inhibits the assessments of how climate change affects the forest ecosystem. We investigate the statistical relationships for different (seven) conifer species between Ring Width Index (RWI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), based on 411 chronologies from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank across 11 states of the western United States. We found robust species-specific relationships between RWI and SPEI for all seven conifer species at dry condition. The regression models show that the RWI decreases with SPEI decreasing (drying) and more than 76% variation of tree growth (RWI) can be explained by the drought index (SPEI). However, when soil water is sufficient (i.e., SPEI>SPEIu), soil water is no longer a restrictive factor for tree growth and, therefore, the RWI shows a weak correlation with SPEI. Based on the statistical models, we derived the tipping point of SPEI (SPEItp) where the RWI equals 0, which means the carbon efflux by tree respiration equals carbon influx by tree photosynthesis. When the severity of drought exceeds this tipping point(i.e. SPEI<SPEItp), trees might not be able to sustain their lives as the carbon assimilated by photosynthesis could not suffice the lowest need of trees maintain respiration. The ranges of the tipping points for seven species-specific trees vary between -2.45 and -1.40. The lower value of a tipping point represents the stronger ability to endure drought. The predicted tipping points can be used as reference of tree mortality for assessment of forest mortality risk under climate change.\nThis work was supported by the Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41321001), the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2012CB955401), the New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-10-0251), U.S. PSC-CUNY Award (PSC-CUNY-ENHC-44-83) and the High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2013AA122801).",

            "abstract": "Oil is in popular demand, but the worldwide amount of oil is decreasing and prices for it are steadily increasing. Leading scientists have been working to find a solution of attaining oil in an economically and environmentally friendly way. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have determined that “a small mixture of algae and water can be turned into crude oil in less than an hour” (Sheehan, Duhahay, Benemann, Poessler). There are various ways of growing the algae, such as closed loop and open loop methods, as well as processes of extracting oil, such as hydrothermal liquefaction and the hexane-solvent method. Our objective was to grow the algae (C. reinhardtii) and extract oil from it using NaOH and HCl, because we had easy access to those specific chemicals. After two trials of attempted algae growth, we discovered that a bacteria was killing off the algae. This led us to further contemplation on how this dead algae and bacteria are affecting our environment, and the organisms within it. Eutrophication occurs when excess nutrients stimulate rapid growth of algae in an aquatic environment. This can clog waterways and create algal blooms in blue-green algae, as well as neurotoxic red tide phytoplankton. These microscopic algae die upon consumption of the nutrients in water and are degraded by bacteria. The bacteria respires and creates an acidic environment with the spontaneous conversion of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid in water. This process of degradation is exactly what occurred in our 250 mL flask. When the phytoplankton attacked our algae, it created a hypoxic environment, which eliminated any remaining amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients in the water, resulting in a miniature dead zone. These dead zones can occur almost anywhere where there are algae and bacteria, such as the ocean, and make it extremely difficult for any organism to survive. This experiment helped us realize the consequences of our actions, and we saw for ourselves how we are polluting and killing the environment. Releasing excess nutrients into our waterways is creating a destructive chain reaction, but if we monitor our output of pollution, we can minimize the amount of damage we do to algae, organisms, and the environment in general.",

            "abstract": "There are about 34 observation wells of water temperature which can record the effect of earth tide in national earthquake precursory network center. In most of the 34 wells, tidal phase of water temperature lag behind that of water level, but the opposite phenomenon exists in several observation wells. We take Qi’xian well which has long recording history and continuous data as an example to analyze this phenomenon. We check the instrument’s time system by using water temperature and water level changes in response to some big earthquakes，and also check the tidal phase of water temperature and water level in Qi’xian well through harmonic analysis (Baytap-G software), as a result，we find the observation is objective.\nThe fact that Tidal phase of Water level lags behind that of water temperature in Qi‘xian observation well shows that water temperature changes may be independent from water level changes. Water temperature changes in this well might be interpreted by the stress-heat consumption hypothesis. This may be beneficial to the study of water temperature changes as an earthquake precursor.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "The interface between models and data is often explored through parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification techniques. In the management decision-making context, it is often desirable to forge a path from data, through analysis, to predictions that guide decisions. This path benefits from the insights gained in process modeling and parameter estimation, but often requires a more rapid timeframe. Metamodeling— emulating the behavior of a process using a statistical mode—provides the opportunity to make predictions in areas where data are sparse or a process model is not available. Statistical modeling or machine learning techniques can create a link between data and predictions based on correlations informed by process model results. The model informs the correlations either by indicating which data points inform various predictions, or more explicitly through emulating the process model itself.\nAs part of the USGS National Water Quality Assessment, several datasets–with and without related process models–are explored using Artificial Neural Networks, other machine learning techniques, and Bayesian Networks. The techniques vary in their abilities to characterize uncertainty of predictions and in the structure of correlative connections within the networks. Performance is evaluated over both calibration and predictions using cross validation. ",

This is a region with a subduction system including back-arc spreading as well as upper plate block rotation. We generate interstation empirical Green's Functions from stacked ambient noise cross-correlations recorded from station pairs of the GeoNet network and temporary experiments. Measurements of fundamental-mode Rayleigh-wave dispersion are made using multiple-filtering and frequency-time analysis and manual selection of the dispersion curves. This collection of dispersion curves is then inverted for lateral variations in both isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic wavespeeds at discrete periods using an LSQR method with lateral smoothing and slight norm and gradient damping. Each discrete period provides a different depth sensitivity range, yielding information on depth dependence of the velocity variations. We then use the isotropic solutions to develop a 3D shear wave velocity model for each node of a 50 km triangular grid. We define an anomalous region of slow velicities accompanying trench-perpendicular fast-propagation under the east coast, near the shallow Hikurangi subduction zone. The structure appears at periods of about 21 seconds and is most prominent at periods of about 28 seconds. Toward the western North Island, farther from the trench, the isotropic group velocity and shear-wave velocity is relatively fast with the fast-propagating axis parallel to the trench direction. The isotropic dispersion curves extract from our model are strongly suggestive of a thin (<10km) low-velocity zone within or above the subducting slab which is also present in our 3D shear-wave model.",

It has been shown that particulate matter mass concentrations (PM) can be retrieved from Lidar data using multiple wavelengths. In this paper we describe a technique that allows for semi-quantitative PM determination under a set of guiding assumptions using only one laser wavelength. The Space Dynamics Laboratory has designed an eye-safe (1.5 μm) single wavelength elastic Lidar system called CELiS (Compact Eye-safe Lidar System), which is described in a companion paper, to which this technique is applied.\nData utilized in the PM retrieval include the Lidar return signal, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, barometric pressure, particle size distribution, particle chemical composition, and PM measurements. Particle size distribution is measured with an optical particle counter. PM is measured with filter-based measurements. Chemical composition is determined through multiple analyses on exposed filter samples. Particle measurements are made both inside and outside of the plume of interest and collocated with the lidar beam for calibration.\nThe meteorological and particle measurements are used to estimate the total extinction (σ) and backscatter (β) for background and plume aerosols. These σ and β values are used in conjunction with the lidar return signal in an inversion technique based on that of Klett (1985, Appl. Opt., 1638-1643). Variable σ/β ratios over the lidar beam path are used to estimate the values of σ and β at each lidar bin. A relationship between β and PM mass concentrations at calibration points is developed, which then allows the β values derived over the lidar beam path to be converted to PM.\nA PM-calibrated, scanning Lidar system like CELiS can be used to investigate PM concentrations and emissions over a large volume, a task that is very difficult to accomplish with typical PM sensors.",

Relative change can have large impacts on these sensitive systems due to low variability of climate variables under current climate regimes.

Quantifying the global, regional, and temporal representativeness of these networks by quantifying the coverage of network infrastructure highlights the capabilities and limitations of the data collected, facilitates upscaling and downscaling for modeling purposes, and improves the planning efforts for future infrastructure investment under current conditions and future modeled scenarios. The current analysis utilizes multivariate spatiotemporal clustering (MSTC) and representativeness analysis with 4 km^2 global bioclimate data for quantitative landscape characterization and assessment of the Fluxnet, RAINFOR, and CTFS-ForestGEO networks.

            "abstract": "The attenuation rates of Earth's normal modes are the most important constraints on the anelastic state of Earth's deep interior. Yet current measurements of Earth's attenuation rates suffer from 3 sources of biases: the mode coupling effect, the beating effect, and the background noise, which together lead to significant uncertainties in the attenuation rates. In this research, we present a new technique to estimate the attenuation rates of Earth's normal modes – the epicentral stacking method. Rather than using the conventional geographical coordinate system, we instead deal with Earth's normal modes in the epicentral coordinate system, in which only 5 singlets rather than 2l+1 are excited. By stacking records from the same events at a series of time lags, we are able to recover the time-varying amplitudes of the 5 excited singlets, and thus measure their attenuation rates. The advantage of our method is that it enhances the SNR through stacking and minimizes the background noise effect, yet it avoids the beating effect problem commonly associated with the conventional multiplet stacking method by singling out the singlets. The attenuation rates measured from our epicentral stacking method seem to be reliable measurements in that: a) the measured attenuation rates are generally consistent among the 10 large events we used, except for a few events with unexplained larger attenuation rates; b) the line for the log of singlet amplitudes and time lag is very close to a straight line, suggesting an accurate estimation of attenuation rate. The Q measurements from our method are consistently lower than previous modal Q measurements, but closer to the PREM model. For example, for mode 0S25 whose Coriolis force coupling is negligible, our measured Q is between 190 to 210 depending on the event, while the PREM modal Q of 0S25 is 205, and previous modal Q measurements are as high as 242. The difference between our results and previous measurements might be due to the lower noise level we encounter after stacking, which has long been speculated to have caused the difference between modal Q and surface wave Q measurements. Overall, we believe our epicentral stacking method provides a more accurate and reliable means to measure Earth's attenuation rates.",

            "abstract": "Due to recent advances in hydroacoustic technology, such as the development of multibeam echo sounders, it is now possible to obtain highly accurate and detailed bathymetric data for river channels. These data provide the basis for detailed characterizations of bed form morphology ranging from individual ripples to composite dune fields. Theoretical models suggest that bed forms reach an equilibrium morphology based on hydraulic conditions during steady flow. However, at the scale of individual meander bends, bed form morphology will vary according to the local flow structure as influenced by overall bed morphology and planform curvature. Thus, the coevolution of flow structure, bed form morphology, and sediment transport should vary throughout a meander bend. This paper examines spatial variation in bed form characteristics and rates of bed form migration, and thus bed material transport, within a large, actively migrating, elongate meander loop. During a May 2013 flood event on Maier Bend, Wabash River (IL-IN, USA), repeat multibeam echo sounding surveys were conducted ~4 hours apart, providing estimates of dune celerity and volumetric rates of sediment transport at different locations around the bend. Three-dimensional velocity measurements, obtained using an acoustic Doppler current profiler, provide hydraulic data for evaluating interactions between flow structure and bed form morphology. Results show that bed form morphology is highly variable within the bend, ranging from barchans dunes on the upstream limb, 2D ripples across the point bar, and 3D composite dunes with wavelength of ~20 meters near the bend apex. Rates of dune celerity varied from 0.3 m/hr to 0.7 m/hr and were dependent on bed form geometry and local hydraulic conditions. The high-resolution data on flow and form are used to calibrate a 2D numerical model of sediment transport through the bend. Simulations using the calibrated model are used to evaluate the fluvial processes underlying spatial variation in bed form morphology and sediment transport. The findings from this research have implications for sediment transport and routing in meandering rivers, and linking bed form hysteresis to flow structure in curved channels.",

Our approach has been to break up tightly-coupled, specialised application packages into modules, with identified best techniques and algorithms repackaged either as data services or scientific tools that are accessible across domains. The data services can be used to manipulate, visualise and transform multiple data types whilst the scientific tools can be used in concert with multiple scientific codes.\nWe are currently designing a scalable generic infrastructure that will handle scientific code as modularised services and thereby enable the rapid/easy deployment of new codes or versions of codes. The goal is to build open source libraries/collections of scientific tools, scripts and modelling codes that can be combined in specially designed deployments. Additional services in development include: provenance, publication of results, monitoring, workflow tools, etc. The generic VL infrastructure will be hosted at NCI, but can access alternative computing infrastructures (i.e., public/private cloud, HPC).\nThe Virtual Geophysics Laboratory (VGL) was developed as a pilot project to demonstrate the underlying technology. This base is now being redesigned and generalised to develop a Virtual Hazards Impact and Risk Laboratory (VHIRL); any enhancements and new capabilities will be incorporated into a generic VL infrastructure.

            "abstract": "In prior work we presented high-resolution locations of 28 events in the 1999 Xiuyan sequence in China using only cross correlation measurements of Lg-waves and a double-difference technique solving for the epicenter. Only five regional stations 500 to 1000 km away were used. The resulting locations revealed a 4 km stretch of fault with 95% location errors ~150 m and 7 ms residuals from internal consistency. Based on this success, we now attempt to extend this work on a broader scale to all of China to see if similar results can be obtained for a significant fraction of the seismicity. We first examine in detail three other clusters. The first has 9 events, and has relocations in a 1 km box with location errors on the order of tens of m. The second has 10 events, and relocates in a 10 km box with location errors on the order of hundreds of m. The third cluster, relocates in a 25 km box, and has ~1 km location errors. From this we see that the location errors increase with increasing event separation. The Annual Bulletin of Chinese Earthquakes we have determined from a repeating event catalog has average errors of 16 km. Therefore we are able to demonstrate one to two orders of magnitude improvement in the location errors as compared to the bulletin. Then we apply a pair-wise location procedure for the repeating event catalog we have identified for China in earlier work. 13% of the events are classified as repeating events (2,379 out of 17,898). Of these there are 1,123 events (1,710 pairs and 6% of the catalog) that have two or more stations from which we can estimate the locations by the same procedure. 81% of these events are demonstrated to have locations separated by less than 1 km with another event. There are 677 events in the repeating event catalog that have observations at four or more stations which enables an estimate of the location errors for these high quality events to be about 200 m.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative prediction of the shear response and energy partitioning in granular layers with breakable particles remains a major challenge in earthquake physics. As a first step towards addressing this problem, we use the Shear Transformation Zone theory (STZ) to model irreversible plastic deformations in the gouge due to local rearrangements of the particles. To model grain breakage, we use an energy balance approach to augment the STZ theory with an equation for the grain size reduction as a function of the applied work rate and pressure.\nPrevious numerical and experimental work on grain breakage was inconclusive regarding whether grain breakage was a softening or a hardening mechanism. The outcome depends on the competition between evolving grain angularity and reduced particle size with both processes affecting force chain dynamics. To account for local force chain instabilities, we develop a small scale model for force chain buckling that is integrated within the STZ formulation through variations of the minimum flow stress of the system. We idealize a typical force chain as an array of particles with both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The relative motion between the particles is resisted by sliding and rolling friction. The sliding friction is provided by a rigid-plastic element. The rolling resistance is modeled by a torsional spring. The deflection of the force chain is resisted by an array of lateral springs representing the effective confinement provided by the rest of the granular medium\nOur results suggest that there exist a critical grain size below which the buckling stress for the force chain, and hence the flow stress, decreases linearly with the decrease of the particle size. Furthermore, we show that grain breakage is a potential weakening mechanism at high pressures and at strain rates high enough to reduce the grain size below the aforementioned critical limit. Grain breakage also promotes strain localization, particularly in compact layers, and may explain the long term persistence of shear bands in natural faults due to the permanent change in the layer fabric resulting from comminution. We discuss the implications of these findings on the stability of sliding of natural faults and earthquake energy budget.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite has been collecting data for almost three years. NOAA and NASA have been collaborating to validate numerous VIIRS data products capturing atmospheric, land and ocean parameters. For vegetation monitoring, standard VIIRS products currently include a top-of-canopy Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), thereby providing an opportunity to observe the recent land surface expression of drought conditions in the state of California as well as creating the potential for modeling gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and other carbon- and water- related variables. We mapped and compared 16-day composite VIIRS EVIs over California from January 2012 to 2014 with equivalent MODIS products from the Aqua satellite (the MYD13 product). Relative to MODIS EVI, VIIRS EVI showed a bias of less than 7% (larger values than MODIS) and a precision of 0.50 to 0.85%. The remaining small proportion of large errors seem to be related to cloud and snow cover. Substantial changes in the EVI time series can be clearly seen for both irrigated and semi-natural land as the recent drought deepened. We also used the VIIRS EVI as input to the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) model to generate ET and GPP, which illuminate drought effects more specifically. As the VIIRS products become more robust, they will make a valuable addition to the arsenal of satellite sensors capturing synoptic trends in vegetation response to drought conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Balloon Observation Platform for Planetary Science (BOPPS) mission is planning to observe several asteroids during its one-day mission in mid to late September, 2014. The observations of asteroids are secondary objectives designed to demonstrate the ability of the BIRC (BOPPS InfraRed Camera) to detect and characterize the extent of hydration on airless bodies. Hydrated asteroids are in part described by the presence of an infrared absorption band near 3-microns, due to the presence of OH complexed onto materials in their surfaces. This band is expected to begin near 2.6 microns, with a minimum between 2.7 and 2.8 microns based on laboratory measurements of vacuum desiccated carbonaceous meteorites materials [1]. Although this measurement is obscured in ground-based observations by the presence of water vapor in our atmosphere, the BOPPS mission will fly sufficiently high (~ 120K’) that telluric water absorptions will not be present potentially enabling precise identification of hydration features on airless bodies like asteroids. The BIRC measurements will be obtained with a cryogenic infrared camera equipped with a 9-position filter wheel with each infrared filter having a FWHM of ~ 3% of the center wavelength [2]. Six of these bands are selected to characterize the OH and H2O absorption feature, and are centered at 2.45 microns, 2.73 microns, 2.85 microns, 3.05 microns, 3.2 microns, and 4 microns. The other three bands are at 0.67 microns (astronomical R-band), 4.27 microns, and 4.6 microns (these last two are to characterize CO2 emissions from comets). The BOPPS mission plans to observe both 1Ceres and 4Vesta. Ceres has a strong water/hydroxyl band [3] whose position would be well characterized by this mission and has been reported to be a variable source of water vapor emission [4] . We will report initial results of BOPPS asteroid observations.\n",

            "abstract": "Single particles in the eastern US were characterized by a light scattering module coupled to a time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (LS-ToF-AMS) onboard the NOAA P-3 aircraft during the Southeastern Nexus (SENEX) campaign. Single particle data were collected for 30 seconds every 5 minutes. Aerosols larger than 200-300 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter can be optically detected by the 405 nm crystal laser and trigger the saving of single particle mass spectra. The measured single particles are internally-mixed as expected. The single particles were classified as prompt, delayed, and null based on the chemical ion signal arrival time difference between prediction from the light scattering signal and measurement by mass spectrometer and the presence or absence of a mass spectrum. On average the number fraction of particles detected as prompt, delayed, and null (no spectrum) is about 30%, 10%, and 60%. The number fraction of these three particle types varied with aerosol size, chemical composition and the investigation region and will be discussed in detail. For example, the number fraction of prompt particles was significantly higher for the flight to the Pennsylvania natural gas shale region on July 6, 2013, which is probably related to the chemical composition (more acidic) and phase of the ambient particles. These particle types and detection efficiency are related to the bouncing effect on the vaporizer and may provide insight into the non-unit AMS collection efficiency. Moreover, most of the particles larger than 800 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter sized with the traditional AMS PToF mode are delayed particles and their mass spectral signals appear to be affected by this process.",

            "abstract": "Best management practices (BMPs) are used to offset the impacts of urban developments known to decrease aquifer recharge, alter drainage networks, change feedbacks to the atmosphere and enhance contaminant transport. To evaluate the effectiveness of BMPs (i.e. engineered wetlands, grass swales, permeable pavements, etc.), a high-resolution study of these processes can be performed in the field using timely monitored instruments, or conceptually-based hydrologic models. However, this approach requires advancing stormwater modeling techniques using high performance computing. The goal of this work is to develop a novel approach to evaluate BMP implementation using an ultra-high-resolution domain and ParFlow, a physically-based hydrologic model that simulates surface and subsurface water interactions. This study domain is located in Aurora, CO, an area that experienced over 200% urban growth over the last 30 years. The ultra-high-resolution domain was constructed using LIDAR imagery and consisted of 1m x 1m horizontal resolution over a ~7.7 km by 2.1 km lateral extent up to 2 m in the subsurface, with a domain totaling more than 3x106unknowns. Three storm events (wet, dry and normal) were simulated with two pavement types, permeable (K=0.18 mhr-1,Φ=0.1) and impermeable (K=0.0018 mhr-1, Φ=0.06), amounting to 6 simulation scenarios. We investigated changes to stormwater routing and infiltration with and without BMP implementation. Contaminant transport was performed using SLIM-FAST, a Lagrangian, particle tracking approach that allows for complex, contaminant-loading scenarios common in the urban environment. Preliminary results show delayed particle movement within impermeable pavement scenarios and particle trapping along the gutters and rooftop locations. This approach is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of BMPs in trapping and reducing concentrations of emerging contaminants of concern within urban environments.",

Building on initiatives started for biological collections, GRSciColl expands this framework to encompass all scientific disciplines including earth and space sciences, anthropology, archaeology, biomedicine, and applied fields such as agriculture and technology. The goals of this registry are to (1) provide a single source of synoptic information about the repositories, their component collections, access and use policies, and staff contact information; and (2) facilitate the assignment of identifiers for repositories and their collections that are globally unique across all disciplines. As digitization efforts continue, the importance of globally unique identifiers is paramount to ensuring interoperability across datasets. Search capabilities and web services will significantly increase the web visibility and accessibility of these collections.\nInstitutional records include categorization by governance (e.g., national, state or local governmental, private non-profit) and by scientific discipline (e.g., earth science, biomedical, agricultural). Collection-level metadata categorize the types of contained specimens/samples and modes of preservation. In selecting the level of granularity for these categories, designers sought a compromise that would capture enough information to be useful in searches and inquiries and would complement the detailed archives in specimen-level databases such (which are increasingly digital) hosted by discipline-specific groups (e.g. SESAR) or the repositories themselves (e.g. KE EMu).",

            "abstract": "Pinpointing the sources of meltwater pulse (MWP) 1a—the most abrupt period of sea level rise during the last glacial termination—remains one of paleoclimatology’s greatest challenges, with implications for the understanding of rapid climate change, isostatic rebound, and past ocean circulation. Here, we present an annotated geomorphological map of a southern region of Svalbard, Norway, that we will use in the interpretation of a soon-to-be published  10Be chronology of this study area where no cosmogenic nuclide exposure data has yet been produced. From this map, we infer historic ice sheet thickness, flow rate, and erosivity. Together, this data will enable us to constrain ice sheet volume change over time in southern Svalbard. The map identifies raised beaches at an altitude of 40 m, indicating an ice sheet thickness of 400-800 m during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to other shoreline data from the region and ice sheet models. We also observed an abundance of glacially smoothed features in valleys, despite an absence of such features at higher elevations. This could suggest a transition from warm-based, erosive ice to cold-based, non-destructive ice with increasing elevation. It is also possible that mountain peaks in this region were not glaciated at LGM. It is important to assess the historic erosivity of an ice sheet because cosmogenic nuclides may be inherited from prior interstadials when the bedrock was deglaciated, if not “reset” by erosion. This can result in erroneously old exposure dates. If this portion of the Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBSIS) did contribute largely to MWP-1a, then we would expect exposure dates from sites differing in elevation by 100 m or more to fall within a 500-year range, centered around 14 ka. Expeditions to collect samples for exposure dating at other field sites in southern Svalbard, scheduled for the coming field season, will help to further inform our understanding of the SBSIS deglaciation and the MWP-1a.",

            "abstract": "GNSS has been largely used in Geodesy and correlated areas for positioning. The position and velocity of terrestrial stations have been estimated using GNSS data based on daily solutions. So, currently it is possible to analyse the GNSS coordinates time series aiming to improve the functional and stochastic models what can help to understand geodynamic phenomena. Several sources of errors are mathematically modelled or estimated in the GNSS data processing to obtain precise coordinates what in general is carried out by using scientific software. However, due to impossibility to model all errors some kind of noises can remain contaminating the coordinate time series, especially those related with seasonal effects. The noise affecting GNSS coordinate time series can be composed by white and coloured noises what can be characterized from Variance Component Estimation technique through Least Square Method. The methodology to characterize noise in GNSS coordinates time series will be presented in this paper so that the estimated variance can be used to reconstruct stochastic and functional models of the times series providing a more realistic and reliable modeling of time series. Experiments were carried out by using GNSS time series for few Brazilian stations considering almost ten years of daily solutions. The noises components were characterized as white, flicker and random walk noise and applied to estimate the times series functional model considering semiannual and annual effects. The results show that the adoption of an adequate stochastic model considering the noises variances of time series can produce more realistic and reliable functional model for GNSS coordinate time series. Such results may be applied in the context of the realization of the Brazilian Geodetic System.",

            "abstract": "The recent emphasis in higher education on both student engagement and online learning has encouraged us to work on the development of an active e-learning environment for our ~90 student undergraduate introductory geohazards course. To begin designing our course, we established a set of student learning outcomes (SLOs) focused on key scientific investigation skills, like analyzing data, evaluating hypotheses, and conveying information to peers. We designed these outcomes to provide students with powerful reasoning and critical thinking skills. Along with this new framework and increased student expectations, we found it beneficial to additionally establish student development outcomes (SDOs). Specifically, SDOs were constructed to address self-evaluation, student responsibility for learning, and valuing group work. Based on these new SLOs and SDOs, we developed a set of course components that engaged students in content, authentic scientific investigations, and group discussions, all within an online environment. The course includes common online learning features like video lectures and comprehension quizzes, but also uses 50% of class periods for student investigation assignments that are conducted using Google Earth and Microsoft Excel. For those assignments, students commonly utilize a short video tutorial demonstrating a new software skill and then apply that knowledge towards investigating topics such as predicting population growth in India or identifying types of volcanoes observed in Hawaii. Results from multiple semesters of teaching both a hybrid and completely online course show significant gains in the geoscience concept inventory over traditional and redesigned face-to-face courses. Additionally, student survey and evaluation data show that our online course improves on SLOs and SDOs when compared to a traditional lecture based course and achieve similar results to a redesigned face-to-face course focused on engagement. In particular, at the end of an active e-learning semester students reported a greater emphasis in analyzing and applying basic elements of a theory and contributing more to class discussions. Through this course redesign process, we have learned more about effective teaching and have worked to develop better means to inform our teaching through assessment.",

These newly-trapped particles may contribute directly to the seed populations that are subsequently heated to ring current and radiation belt energies, and may also provide a source of free energy for the generation of electromagnetic waves that affect the dynamic variations of the outer radiation belts. In this work, we examine the access of plasma sheet particles to the inner magnetosphere using a combination of global MHD/test particle simulations and observations from geosynchronous, THEMIS, and the Van Allen probes. We focus in particular on transient events associated with substorm activity and bursty bulk flows, and contrast particle access to geosynchronous orbit during these events with that observed during steady driving of the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "To examine the possibility that there was a petrological control on the location and nature of episodic tremor and slip (ETS), we compared the petrological characteristics of wedge mantle material to the results of recent geophysical observations in the Shikoku area, southwest Japan. This study revealed a close relationship between predicted mineral assemblages in the mantle wedge and the characteristics of slow slip behaviour recorded in the Shikoku area: Short-term ETSs take place in the antigorite +olivine stability field and silent long-term slow slip events (SSEs) take place in the antigorite+brucite stability field. The petrology of the mantle wedge may be an important control on the fluid pressure along the subduction interface and influence the time scales of SSEs. The Cretaceous Sanbagawa oceanic subduction complex of SW Japan preserves fragments of the former mantle wedge in contact with subducted slab units. P-T paths and peak P-T conditions show this belt formed as the result of subduction of a young slab under relatively warm conditions. These characteristics make the Sanbagawa belt a good analogue to modern warm subduction zones such as the Philippine Sea subduction zone beneath SW Japan and offer the possibility of directly examining the former plate boundary. Mantle wedge units derived from shallow depths show evidence for widely developed primary brucite and antigorite. In contrast, units derived from greater depths and higher peak temeratures consist dominantly of antigorite and olivine. Observations of the natural serpentinites suggest that the shallow serpentinite with brucite shows higher absorbency of water and provides fluid pathways that can reduce the fluid pore pressure on the subduction boundary.",

            "abstract": "We have implemented a parallel code that simulates earthquake cycles on a strike-slip fault in two dimensions. The fault is governed by rate-and-state friction with depth-dependent parameters. The upper portion of the fault, above the seismogenic depth, is velocity-weakening, while the lower portion is velocity-strengthening. The method uses a spatial discretization that accommodates variable off-fault material properties. To simulate tectonic loading, the remote boundaries are driven at half the relative long-term slip rate.\nPreliminary results suggest that material heterogeneity significantly affects system behavior in certain parts of parameter space. In a homogeneous half-space, events that rupture the full seismogenic depth occur periodically. In contrast, the presence of a sedimentary basin, represented by an elliptic region of decreased shear modulus and density, results in a more complex sequence of events. Two types of rupture emerge: sub-basin and surface-rupturing events. All ruptures nucleate at the seismogenic depth, but for the sub-basin events the rupture fails to penetrate through the basin to the surface. Each sub-basin event leaves a stress concentration at the bottom of the basin, the presence of which enables the next event to rupture to the surface. For deeper and more compliant basins, the number of sub-basin events required before the occurrence of a surface-rupturing event increases. We have begun to explore this, focusing particularly on the effects of varying basin depth and shear modulus. We are also investigating the effects of incorporating a lithostatic normal stress gradient on the fault and velocity-strengthening within the basin. Additionally, previous work was limited to a state evolution distance $D_c$ of 8~mm, several orders of magnitude greater than laboratory values. The parallel implementation allows us to investigate the effect of decreasing this value. Ultimately, this exploration will increase our understanding of how sedimentary basins affect the earthquake cycle.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphic and biogeochemical processes and hillslope morphology are partly controlled by the extent and degree of chemical weathering between soil and bedrock. The production of mineral specific surface area (SSA) via chemical weathering is a critical variable for mechanistic understanding of weathering and provides an interface between minerals and the soil carbon cycle. We examined two 21-meter deep drill cores in the Laurels Schist at 141 MASL (summit) and 130 MASL (interfluve) in a 900 ha first order watershed in the Laurels Preserve, a forested land use end member in the Christina River Basin CZO. In addition to mineral SSA, we report elemental and mineralogical changes through both weathering profiles. Despite highly variable bedrock composition, mobile elements (Ca & Na) are depleted within 3-5 m below the ground surface, which is consistent with the removal of Ca-Na-plagioclase ((Na,Ca)Al(Si,Al)3O8) at this interval; we consider this depth as a weathering front. The water table in both boreholes was ~123 MASL (5/2014), which is well below the weathering front, suggesting that weathering processes are not coupled with groundwater interactions in this system. Clay XRD reveals the presence of secondary phyllosilicates including vermiculite, illite, and kaolinite in the upper 3 m of the summit weathering profile, which are weathering products of primary plagioclase, muscovite, and chlorite. The currently available clay mineralogy results are consistent with the decrease in total SSA from up to 20 m2g-1 at the surface to <5 m2g-1 below 3 m depth. Within the first 3 m from the surface, citrate-dithionate extractable iron contributed 30-60% of the total surface area. Therefore transformation of primary minerals to secondary phyllosilicate minerals, involving leaching loss of cations, was partly responsible for SSA production, but iron oxides play a significant role in production of SSA above the weathering front. This observation did not differ between topographic locations, which may reflect that hillslope morphology predates the timeframe of pedogenic processes in this system. These findings suggest that the propagation rates of the weathering front and the trajectory and efficiency of mineral chemical weathering in producing SSA may be independent of topography over the time and length scales examined.",

Due to sparse data, the Southern Ocean is the least understood of these CO2 sink regions, with estimates of the annual air-sea CO2 flux varying by as much as 100%, depending upon the calculation method. This work investigates processes regulating air-sea CO2 flux in the Southern Ocean, with a focus on the Pacific sector east of Australia. We quantify the effects of temperature, biological drawdown, and the large-scale general circulation on seawater pCO2 on seasonal and annual timescales, and discuss the balance of these forcings. We expressly consider the impact of the general circulation on the air-sea CO2 flux, which we showed in a previous study to determine the location of the North Pacific carbon sink region. Worldwide, the regions of strong atmospheric CO2 uptake are all located in deep western boundary currents and their extensions, suggesting a larger role for the general circulation in forcing these sinks than is currently acknowledged or understood. Understanding the processes regulating air-sea CO2 flux in the Southern Ocean is critical for predicting how this gas exchange will change in the future.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane (CH4) is the second greenhouse gas, which is originally a natural atmospheric component, but the amount in the atmosphere has been dramatically increased due to addition of various anthropogenic sources especially after industrialization triggered in 18th century. Such coexistence of both natural and anthropogenic sources at the present make it difficult to quantitatively understand CH4 cycles on the globe. For example, CH4 concentration was increasing in 1990s, became stable in 2000s, and began to increase again from 2007, but discussions on what caused such intriguing long-term variations remain inconclusive. On the other hand, it is well known that wetlands is the largest natural source of CH4. Of them, wetlands in Arctic regions have been recently receiving remarkable attention, because high-latitude regions are more sensitive to global warming than low-latitudes, possibly enhancing CH4 emissions there. In West Siberia, there are large wetland areas significantly contributing to the global CH4 budget. In order to monitor atmospheric CH4 variability, which strongly reflects CH4 emissions from surrounding wetlands, continuous measurements of CH4 concentration from an expanding network of towers (JR-STATION: Japan–Russia Siberian Tall Tower Inland Observation Network) have been conducted mainly in West Siberia since 2004. A previous study on the measurements has revealed that CH4 concentration has large diurnal and seasonal variability, which are driven by seasonally varying wetland and fossil fuel emissions as well as by significant diurnal and seasonal variations of planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). While chemistry transport model can be a useful tool to understand atmospheric CH4 variations in many cases, model simulation for the JR-STATION seems to be slightly challenging, since it is well known that present transport models’ capability to reproduce PBLH is not enough. In this study, we validate model transport of the CCSR/NIES/FRCGC Atmospheric General Circulation Model based Chemistry Transport Model and several types of CH4 emission inventories including a process-based biogeochemical model for the tower CH4 measurements, and try to understand the observed atmospheric CH4 variations.",

            "abstract": "The concavity of an incising river system – a measure of the rate of change of its bed slope with increasing discharge downstream – is a commonly used metric in fluvial geomorphology. It is commonly used in assessing variation of factors such as uplift, climate, and rock type along a system in a qualitative way, and underpins a number of quantitative analyses in tectonic geomorphology, such as the normalized channel steepness index. However, the factors that fundamentally control channel concavities in rocky streams remain relatively poorly understood, especially in rivers that are undergoing transient response to a perturbation in their boundary conditions.\nHere we use a combination of field data and numerical modeling to demonstrate that elevated channel concavities are a common and shared response to the propagation of a convex-upward “knickzone” through a bedrock channel long profile. Simulations using the novel modeling framework Landlab exploring thresholded incision and saltation-abrasion theory indicate that the presence of the knickzone can perturb the relative sediment flux in the area immediately downstream of the convexity, allowing enhanced erosion there and systematic elevation of channel concavities in reaches downstream of this point. The reality of this effect is demonstrated using field and remotely sensed data from three sites – the Red River area, Yunnan, China; channels on the Ladakh batholith, Indian Himalaya; and the Fagaras Alps, Romania. All contain broad scale migrating knickzones, but the causes of the disturbances that produced them and scales of the systems differ. Nonetheless, the concavities of all the channels are all elevated in the same way downstream of knickzones, consistent with the modeling output. These results demonstrate the ubiquity of sediment flux effects on erosion rates in many natural channels, and have consequences for the way we read tectonic histories from landscapes.",

It produced copious rainfall along its track and was responsible for 41 direct deaths and economic losses around 4.3 billion dollars in the US. The Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used in this study to investigate the rainfall distribution of Irene. Compared with Stage IV rainfall, the WRF simulation showed the capability of reproduction of the spatial rainfall distribution. It was further proved through the comparison of hourly rainfall from the simulation and rain gauges. The two had a correlation coefficient of 0.62 and a root mean square error (RMSE) around 4.4 mm h-1. Through a Lagrangian approach in both simulated and Stage IV rainfall, it was found that most of Irene rainfall was concentrated in the front quadrant, especially in the front-left quadrant. The examination of the synotic-scale environment showed that a deep baroclinic zone was developed and strengthened in the front-left quadrant of Irene through the interaction with a mid-latitude trough, creating an environment beneficial for rainfall production in this region. The baroclinic environment promoted the extratropical transition (ET) of Irene, accompanying with more rainfall production in outer front-left rainbands. The rainfall amount in the inner rainband showed a strong correlation with Irene intensity through the lower thermal wind. A non-terrain experiment was set up to study the impact of topography (i.e., northern Appalachians) on rainfall distribution. Compared with the simulation using original terrain, the non-terrain simulation produced a slightly different track and reduced total storm rainfall around 100-200 mm in northern Appalachians.",

Andean and Choco blocks) has resulted in the Eastern Panama Deformed Belt, and 4) collision of the Cocos Ridge in the west is accommodated by crustal shortening, Central American Fore Arc translation and deformation across the Central Costa Rican Deformed Belt. In addition, there are several models that suggest internal deformation of this region by cross-isthmus strike-slip faults. Recent GPS observations for the PR indicates movement to the northeast relative to a stable Caribbean plate at rates of 6.9±4.0 - 7.8±4.8 mm a-1 from southern Costa Rica to eastern Panama, respectively (Kobayashi et al., 2014 and references therein). However, the GPS network did not have enough spatial density to estimate elastic strain accumulation across these faults. Recent installation and expansion of geodetic networks in southwestern Caribbean (i.e., Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia) combined with geological and geophysical observations provide a new input to investigate crustal deformation processes in this complex tectonic setting, specifically related to the PR. We use new and existing GPS data to calculate a new velocity field for the region and to investigate the kinematics of the PR, including elastic strain accumulation on the major plate boundaries. Expanding our GPS observations within these proposed small blocks could allow us to solve for Euler vectors and calculate their rotation, strain accumulation and slip rates on the major fault systems. Our results combined with the local seismicity could help authorities to reduce uncertainties in seismic risk evaluations.",

            "abstract": "The compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is nowadays an important and powerful tool in geochemical, environmental, and forensics field. In particular, the stable isotope ratio of pesticide is applied to biological process and reaction in the soil and distribution channel as forensics science. The aim of this study is to measure the stable isotope ratios of pesticide using various analytical methodologies, GC/IRMS, EA/IRMS, and LC/IRMS under high accuracy and precision. Therefore, these methods seemed to be important knowledge as geological field.\nIn particular case, we present the method to measure carbon isotope ratio of nine malathion emulsion pesticides using GC/IRMS with cryo-focusing system to identify the source. In December 2013, food poisoning occurred after eating frozen dumplings (i.e., pizza and chicken nuggets) in Japan. There was a very high concentration, maximum value 15,000ppm, of malathion (diethyl (dimethoxythiophosphorylthio) succinate) in products. This incident was caused by an employee of process, and threatened the food safety. We analyzed the δ13C of malathion ranged from −30.63‰ to −29.54‰ (S.D. 0.10‰), the differences less than 1.0‰. All malathion emulsion sold in Japan are imported from Cheminova India Lat., Denmark to Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan. After that, Japanese each manufacture buy from Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. And blended malathion and organic solvent (ethylbenzene and xylene). Therefore, ethylbenzene and xylene may be important tool as source identification. We measured the δ13C of ethylbenzene and m-,p-xylene, too. As the results, the δ13C of ethylbenzene and m-,p-xylene ranged from −28.20‰ to −20.84‰ (S.D. 0.16‰), −28.69‰ to −25.15‰ (S.D. 0.13‰), respectively. The δ13C of ethylbenzene and m-,p-xylene can be identified manufacture, although the δ13C of malathion indicated same value.\nIn addition, we measured five pesticides (acephate, acetamiprid, glufosinate, glyphosate, and oxamyl) using EA/IRMS and LC/IRMS. The correlation coefficient between EA/IRMS and LC/IRMS is 0.97. The detail results will be presented in this conference.",

            "abstract": "The oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) has a seismological expression that is characterized by a sharp velocity reduction located at relatively shallow depths (40-100 km). Observations suggest that the LAB deepens with age for relatively young oceans, and may be coincident with anisotropic gradients. Models to explain these features include partial melting, sub-solidus physical dispersion caused by grain-boundary sliding, and a change in anisotropic rock texture. To assess these models, we provide new seismological constraints using frequency-dependent harmonic decomposition of receiver functions. We analyze data from 17 ocean-bottom stations and 2 borehole stations in the Philippine Sea and Northwest Pacific ocean. Underneath young oceans, we observe that the depth of the LAB follows the ~1300°K thermal contour. For old oceans the LAB lies at a constant depth ~70 km. These results are consistent with the predictions of the grain-boundary sliding model. Preliminary analysis of the width of the velocity gradient, shows that at some young oceans, the velocity reduction is gradational, while at old oceans a sharper velocity reduction is required to fit the receiver function data. This behavior is also consistent with the prediction of the grain-boundary sliding model, where thermal relaxation in the young oceans leads to a gradational velocity reduction, while the water-dependent relaxation leads to a sharp velocity reduction at old oceans. Additionally, harmonic decomposition of the receiver functions suggests that strong anisotropic gradients do not coincide with the velocity reduction. At undisturbed ocean lithosphere, therefore, we argue that anisotropy is not a causal mechanism for the LAB. We also fail to observe oppositely-polarized Ps conversions from the top and bottom boundary of a putative melt-layer, except underneath stations above the subducting Pacific-plate slab.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations have revealed a small-scale (< 1000 km) air–sea coupling in regions of strong sea surface temperature (SST) fronts (e.g., currents, eddies, and tropical instability waves), where the surface wind and wind stress are altered by the underlying SST. Surface winds and wind stresses are persistently higher over the warm side of the SST front compared to the cool side, causing perturbations in the dynamically and thermodynamically curl and divergence fields. Capturing this small-scale SST–wind variability is important because it can significantly impact both local and remote (i.e., large scale) oceanic and atmospheric processes.\nThe SST–wind relationship is not well represented in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models, and the relative importance of the physical processes that are proposed to be responsible for this relationship is actively and vehemently debated. This study focuses on the physical mechanisms that are primarily responsible for the SST-induced changes in surface wind and wind stress, and on the physical implication on ocean forcing through Ekman pumping. This study shows that the baroclinic-related changes in Ekman pumping are significant (first-order) over a seasonal (2003 winter season) time scale and that the meso-scale impacts are quite important over larger spatial scales. These findings highlight the need to consider the small-scale SST–wind relationship even in coarser resolution model simulation, which may be feasible to parameterize because of the linear nature of the baroclinic-related effect.",

            "abstract": "Approximately one third of Canadians and Americans use groundwater as their source of drinking water. Porous media aquifers typically provide significant filtration of particulate contaminants (e.g., viruses, bacteria, protozoa). Fractured media, however, does not provide the same degree of filtration, and in fact often acts as a pathway for particulates to migrate, typically at much greater velocities than in porous media. Fractured aquifers, therefore, are significantly more vulnerable to particulate contamination than unconsolidated porous media. Thus, understanding in the mechanisms of particle migration and retention in fractures is important for the protection and management of these drinking water sources.\nThe purpose of this work was to investigate the role of hydrodynamics on particle transport in saturated, variable aperture fractures. A 2D fracture was randomly generated with an average aperture of approximately 2mm. The fracture was inscribed into pieces of poly(methyl methacrylate), thus creating a pseudo-2D fracture (the xy fracture domain is invariant in z). Transport experiments using fluorescent microspheres (0.05 um, 0.5 um, and 0.75 um) were performed at 2.6 m/day, 26 m/day and 113 m/day and the resulting breakthrough curves were measured. These breakthrough curves included various shoulders and artifacts that were repeatable and could be used to evaluate the quality of a model.\nCOMSOL Multiphysics, was used to generate an average flow field through the 2D fracture by numerically solving the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation. In order to have a 3D realization of the flow field, a parabolic flow regime was assumed in the z-axis and used to scale the average flow field. Random walk particle tracking was utilized to generate breakthrough curves; however, the Brownian motion and local fluid shear mechanisms needed to be considered in addition to the standard movement of particles via the local flow field in order to appropriately model the experimental results. These results suggest that local hydrodynamics are important in defining the transport of particles through a fracture. We plan to discuss further applications, general statistics, and particle retention in fractures due to hydrodynamics and ultimately the role of fracture geometry in particle transport.",

            "abstract": "A promising energy storage option to compensate for daily and seasonal energy offsets is to inject and store heat generated from renewable energy sources (e.g. solar energy) in the ground, oftentimes referred to as soil borehole thermal energy storage (SBTES). Nonetheless in SBTES modeling efforts, it is widely recognized that the movement of water vapor is closely coupled to thermal processes. However, their mutual interactions are rarely considered in most soil water modeling efforts or in practical applications. The validation of numerical models that are designed to capture these processes is difficult due to the scarcity of experimental data, limiting the testing and refinement of heat and water transfer theories. A common assumption in most SBTES modeling approaches is to consider the soil as a purely conductive medium with constant hydraulic and thermal properties. However, this simplified approach can be improved upon by better understanding the coupled processes at play. Consequently, developing new modeling techniques along with suitable experimental tools to add more complexity in coupled processes has critical importance in obtaining necessary knowledge in efficient design and implementation of SBTES systems.\nThe goal of this work is to better understand heat and mass transfer processes for SBTES. In this study, we implemented a fully coupled numerical model that solves for heat, liquid water and water vapor flux and allows for non-equilibrium liquid/gas phase change. This model was then used to investigate the influence of different hydraulic and thermal parameterizations on SBTES system efficiency. A two dimensional tank apparatus was used with a series of soil moisture, temperature and soil thermal properties sensors. Four experiments were performed with different test soils. Experimental results provide evidences of thermally induced moisture flow that was also confirmed by numerical results. Numerical results showed that for the test conditions applied here, moisture flow is more influenced by thermal gradients rather than hydraulic gradients. The results also demonstrate that convective fluxes are higher compared to conductive fluxes indicating that moisture flow has more contribution to the overall heat flux than conductive fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Coastal response to climate events is very important for both socio-economic and environmental reasons. In order to carry out a correct coastal management program, it is important to provide realistic analysis of the natural variability and trend associated with climatic events (i.e. hurricanes, storms). In a scenario of rising sea level and increasing wave heights, the coastline will suffer huge impacts in terms of erosion and flooding especially with respect to low-lying regions that may partly or entirely disappear. This work deals with the analysis of a 22 year long wave buoy dataset recorded at Cadiz (SW Spain) and Tenby (S Wales, UK) with the objective of find the existing relationships between wave climate and coastal response. The analysis consisted in the characterization of winter wave climate, extreme waves and storms characteristics and distribution and their relationships with regional cycles (Teleconnection Patterns) such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index, the East Atlantic (EA) pattern and the Arctic Oscillation (AO), among others. Wave climate showed clear cyclic variations in average monthly significant wave height (Hs). Winter waves rapidly increased in height, reaching peak values (Hs = 1.2 m, Cadiz, Hs = 2.1 m, Tenby) between December and January. Energy patterns calculated using the equation of wave energy flux, showed average values of 37 kW/m and 155 kW/m respectively, during winter. In the same way, storm characterization in each study area was carried out using the Storm Power Index (Dolan and Davis, 1992) and five classes were obtained, from class I (weak) to V (extreme). Storm occurrence probability was 95% for class I (i.e. almost one event per year) to 5 % for class V. The return period for class V was 25 years and ranged from 5 to 8 years for classes III and IV storms, e.g. significant and severe events. Classes I and II showed a period of recurrence ranging from 1 to 3 years. For both areas high energy wave values were observed when neutral to strong negative NAO and AO phases occurred and also when there were abrupt changes moving between positive and negative phases without passing through a neutral phase. Beach response to storm events greatly varied along both investigated littorals, and essentially depended on the sequence of storm events and the beach morphodynamic state.",

Excessive rainfall was also found over northern States especially the Northwest. At the same time, record dry condition prevailed in the southern US. Texas and New Mexico were stricken by the worst drought in recorded history.

A remarkable gravity wave signature with a period of ∼1h is the most prominent feature shown in the vertical wind on Nov 27, 2013 at Boulder. Similar wave signatures are also present in the temperature and Na density variations. From the USU lidar and the temperature mapper, the gravity wave oscillation with a period of ∼1h is also observed in the temperature and horizontal winds at Logan (41.7°N, 111.8°W), Utah. By combining the observations from these two stations, we determine the vertical wavelength is about 25 km and horizontal wavelength is about 327 km. This wave is propagating from Logan to Boulder with an elevation angle of 4.4° and an azimuth angle of 133°. The wave amplitudes in vertical wind, horizontal winds and temperature are provided and their ratios are in good agreement with the gravity wave polarization relation. This coordinated study has uniquely provided 3-D information and magnitude of the 1-h gravity wave, which has a great potential to be the seed of TIDs, affecting the ionospheric variabilities. Using the ray-tracing model, we find that the wave source is above 10 km. It is likely generated by the geostrophic adjustment of the jet stream, whose orientation is consistent with the horizontal propagation direction of the wave.",

            "abstract": "On the basis of our experience of modeling the other planetary atmospheres in the solar system, and in particular Mars and Triton, we have developed a Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model (GCM) for Pluto. In addition to a 3D dynamical core which solves the primitive equation of meteorology, the model takes into account the N2 condensation and sublimation, the vertical turbulent mixing, the radiative transfer through methane and carbon monoxide (using the correlated k method), molecular thermal conduction, and a detailed surface thermal model. The GCM also include a detailed model of the methane cycle, including its sublimation and condensation on the surface and in the atmosphere, mixing by turbulence in the planetary boundary layer, transport by the atmospheric circulation. It consistently predicts the 3D methane abundance in the atmosphere, which is used as an input for the radiative transfer calculations.\nThis model can be used to make some speculative predictions for the New Horizon flyby in 2015, including the distribution of N2 and CH4 ice on the surface and the possible presence of methane ice clouds. Moreover, we evaluate if Titan-like hazes made of organic aerosols could be visible. To address this question, we include a simple parametrization of the formation of organic aerosols resulting from the interaction of methane with the solar UV radiation, and we compute their sedimentation and transport by the general circulation.",

            "abstract": "Trichloroethene (TCE) is a prevalent groundwater contaminant across the USA. Dehalococcoides is the only known bacterium that can reductively dechlorinate TCE to the benign end product ethene. Sulfate is also a common ubiquitous compound in groundwater. Little research has been conducted on the toxicity of sulfate or sulfide on Dehalococcoides and its effect on dechlorination. This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of high sulfate/sulfide concentrations on pure cultures Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 (strain 195), sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVH) and the syntrophic co-culture of strain 195 with DVH.\nStrain 195 was maintained in defined medium with H2 as electron donor, acetate as carbon source, and 78 μmol TCE as the electron acceptor. 2.5 mM sulfate showed no inhibitory effect on strain 195 dechlorination rates (5.3 μmol d-1); whereas, 2mM sulfide completely inhibited ethene production and only 14 μmol of cis-DCE was produced. DVH was maintained using lactate as the energy and carbon source and sulfate as the electron acceptor. High sulfate concentrations (30 mM) did not show an inhibitory effect on DVH growth and 90% of the amended sulfate was reduced within 24 hours. The cell yield of DVH was 1.3±0.1x108 mL-1, which was comparable to the control (1.5±0.2x108 mL-1). Similarly, 5mM sulfide did not show an inhibitory effect on the cell growth of DVH (1.8±0.3x108 mL-1).\nIn the syntrophic co-culture containing strain 195 and DVH, DVH fermented lactate to H2 and acetate, and strain 195 used H2 as the electron donor for dechlorination. When 1 mM sulfate was amended to the consortia, the TCE dechlorination rate (13 μmol d-1) was similar to the control (no sulfate addition); whereas, the cell number of DVH increased from 8.7±0.4x107 (control) to 2.6±0.7x108 (1 mM sulfate). TCE dechlorination was completely inhibited when 5mM sulfate was amended, and only 10% of the total TCE added was dechlorinated to cis-DCE (8μmol). Accordingly, little growth of strain 195 was observed and DVH cell number in the 5mM bottles (7.7±0.6x108 mL-1) was 9 times higher than those maintained in control bottles (8.7±0.4x107). The results showed sulfide had a significant inhibitory effect on Dehalococcoides’ dechlorination and cell growth rates in this study.",

            "abstract": "During the summer of 2014 we taught a MOOC course on natural disasters under the auspices of McGillX and edX. The course was principally designed to provide students with an introduction to the science behind naturally hazardous phenomena and natural disasters. An important guiding element of the course was to link the solid earth (volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides, and avalanches) with the oceanic and atmospheric earth (hurricanes, tornadoes, El Nino). These Earth components were also coupled by a section on climate change and global warming near the end of the course. This integrated approach demonstrated to students the highly linked nature of the Earth System. The course comprised a variety of materials with which students could engage. For each topic, the professors provided lecture materials as 5-10 minute video blocks sequenced to form a complete lecture of about 90 minutes. Typically the lectures would progress from scientific principles through case studies to mitigation. For nearly every topic we also provided a practical demonstration (e.g., supercooled water driving ice storms, liquid fragmentation driving volcanic eruptions), in order to illustrate principles in a dynamic fashion. Students also worked independently on a wide variety of exercises, and there were two non-cumulative, multiple-choice exams, as well as a case study which students would themselves research and present to their peers in the course. Finally, the professors provided weekly screenside chats to answer students’ questions and to provide a more informal learning environment. This variety of approaches enhanced the course content. Two teaching assistants worked full-time during course delivery, ensuring that students received rapid feedback to their questions and issues. The initial course enrollment was approximately 10,000.",

These features are much exacerbated in winter because of the strong production of submesoscales triggered by mixed-layer instabilities. Using a high resolution primitive equation simulation, we show however that the balanced flow field (including the vertical velocity field) associated with the mixed-layer dynamics can still be diagnosed using the quasigeostrophic framework. The model used approximates the ocean as a two-layer system, composed of a diabatic finite-thickness surface layer with uniform stratification, and an adiabatic infinitely-deep interior layer with uniform and stronger stratification. The adiabatic dynamics of the system are driven by buoyancy anomalies on both the ocean surface and the interface between the two layers, the latter being due to vertical displacements of the interface. The diabatic vertical velocities are driven by turbulent vertical mixing of buoyancy. The model has improved skill for diagnosing buoyancy anomalies and vertical velocities near the surface compared to the adiabatic one-layer surface quasi-geostrophic model.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is expected to reduce streamflow in the southwestern USA due to reduction in precipitation and increases in evaporative demand. Understanding the effects of climate change in this region is particularly important for mountainous areas since these are primary sources of recharge in arid and semi-arid environments. Therefore we undertook to model effects of climate change on the hydrological processes in Valles Caldera (448 km2), located in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico.\nIn Valles Caldera modeling the surficial, hydrogeological, and geothermal processes that influence hydrologic fluxes each present challenges. The surficial dynamics of evaporative demand and snowmelt both serve to control recharge dynamics, but are complicated by the complex topography and spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics. Complex factors affecting evaporative demand include leaf area index, temperature, albedo, and radiation affected by topographic shading; all of these factors vary in space and time. Snowmelt processes interact with evaporative demand and geology to serve as an important control on streamflow generation, but modeling the effects of spatiotemporal snow distributions on streamflow generation remains a challenge. The complexity of Valles Caldera’s geology—and its associated hydraulic properties—rivals that of its surficial hydrologic forcings. Hydrologically important geologic features that have formed in the Valles Caldera are three-dimensionally intricate and include a dense system of faults, alluvium, landslides, lake deposits, and features associated with the eruption and collapse of this super volcano. Coupling geothermally-driven convection to the hydrologic cycle in this still-active geothermal system presents yet an additional challenge in modeling Valles Caldera. Preliminary results from applying the three-dimensional distributed hydrologic finite element model HydroGeoSphere to a sub-catchment of Valles Caldera will be presented.",

In the low-beta corona where a strong magnetic field domains, MHD studies show that Alfven waves turbulence primarily cascades to smaller scale perpendicular to the mean magnetic fields rather than the parallel direction. In our previous test-particle simulation, the inertial range MHD turbulence shows the existence of stochastic ion heating. However, most wave-particle interactions would be located near, or smaller than the transition region between the inertial scales and dissipation scales. Our Hall MHD simulation can provide this interesting background field including both Alfven wave and Kinetic Alfven wave. The new test particle simulation will provide more accurate stochastic heating rate. It will also reveal the difference of turbulence at different scales.",

This visualization tool makes it possible and easier for a researcher to visualize the biological metadata of a plant and interact with the graph on a webpage. Currently available visualization software like Cytoscape and Walrus are difficult to interact with and do not scale effectively for large data sets, limiting the ability to visualize interactions within a biological system.\nThe visualization tool developed is useful for viewing and interpreting the dataset of a gene interaction network. The graph layout drawn by this visualization tool is an improvement from the previous method of comparing lines of genes in two separate data files to, now having the ability to visually see the layout of the gene networks and how the two systems are related.\nThe graph layout presented by the visualization tool draws a graph of the sample rice and maize gene networks, linking the common genes found in both plants and highlighting the functions served by common genes from each plant. The success of this visualization tool will enable Dr. Feltus to continue his investigations and draw conclusions on the biological evolution of the sorghum plant as well.\nREU Funded by NSF ACI Award 1359223 Vetria L.

            "abstract": "In situ observations have shown that the measured electron temperature anisotropy in the expanding solar wind is regulated by the electron fire-hose instabilities (EFI), which could be excited by excessive parallel temperature anisotropy. It is known that for parallel propagation mode the enhanced transverse fluctuations driven by the parallel EFI are resonant with the ions. In the present study, nonlinear properties of the parallel EFI are investigated using one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with various initial proton plasma betas. It is found that the protons in resonance with the left-hand polarized EFI modes are anisotropically heated and subsequently their resonant interactions give rise to the excitation of the ion-acoustic waves (IAW). It is shown that the intensity of the excited IAW is proportional to the values of the electron to proton temperature ratio. In addition, the presence of the unusual electrostatic modes driven by nonlinear behavior of the protons, especially for the lower proton beta simulations, leads to the formation of the suprathermal component in the proton parallel velocity distribution, although the parallel proton temperature does not practically change throughout the simulation period.",

Marine sediments from boreholes on the seafloor off Taiwan in the northeastern South China Sea were also examined for comparison. The results show that the clay mineral composition of the Kaoping River display a similar pattern through the whole truck steam, with illite being dominant, chlorite being lesser abundant, and very scare kaolinite and smectite. Clay mineralogy shows some differences, like Smectite only examined in Qishan lake, one of the upper tributaries, which corresponed to the heterogeneous source rocks. The illite crystallity and the illite chemical weathering index both show rapid mechanical denudation. Compared with the other famous rivers in the world, clay mineral composition of sediments is influenced by the source and weathering based on the different gradients and environment. The data from marine sediments does not show obvious basin-wide differences, reflecting a distinct character of Taiwan source.",

            "abstract": "We will describe the benefits we realized using semantic technologies to address the often challenging and resource intensive task of ontology alignment in service of data integration. Ontology alignment became relatively simple as we reused our existing semantic data integration framework, SemantEco. We work in the context of the Jefferson Project (JP), an effort to monitor and predict the health of Lake George in NY by deploying a large-scale sensor network in the lake, and analyzing the high-resolution sensor data. SemantEco is an open-source framework for building semantically-aware applications to assist users, particularly non-experts, in exploration and interpretation of integrated scientific data. SemantEco applications are composed of a set of modules that incorporate new datasets, extend the semantic capabilities of the system to integrate and reason about data, and provide facets for extending or controlling semantic queries. Whereas earlier SemantEco work focused on integration of water, air, and species data from government sources, we focus on redeploying it to provide a provenance-aware, semantic query and interpretation interface for JP’s sensor data. By employing a minor alignment between SemantEco's ontology and the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology used to model the JP’s sensor deployments, we were able to bring SemantEco's capabilities to bear on the JP sensor data and metadata. This alignment enabled SemantEco to perform the following tasks: (1) select JP datasets related to water quality; (2) understand how the JP's notion of water quality relates to water quality concepts in previous work; and (3) reuse existing SemantEco interactive data facets, e.g. maps and time series visualizations, and modules, e.g. the regulation module that interprets water quality data through the lens of various federal and state regulations. Semantic technologies, both as the engine driving SemantEco and the means of modeling the JP data, enabled us to rapidly align the two ontologies without needing the projects to change models and allowed us to adopt the existing software development effort invested in SemantEco as a portal for exploring Lake George's water quality data. We plan to extend the registration of modules and facets to handle climate data, hydrology data, and food web data.",

            "abstract": "For a carbon-rich core, iron carbides might be the major phase crystallizing to form the Earth’s solid inner core. On basis of high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, Fe3C, Fe7C3 and more recently Fe2C have been considered as the most stable carbide phase under the inner core conditions. The identity of the stable carbide phase in a carbon-containing inner core is still a topic under active debate. It is crucial to determine the elastic and acoustic properties of the relevant carbide phases to core conditions, in order to test the carbon-rich core composition model. In this study, we have performed nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) measurements of both Fe7C3 and Fe3C up to core pressures at 300 K and determined their shear-wave (VS) and compressional-wave (VP) velocities for comparison with seismic observations of the inner core. The high-pressure magnetic properties of both phases have also been investigated by X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES) and Synchrotron Mössbauer Spectroscopy (SMS). Our results show that the magnetic transitions from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic and then to nonmagnetic in Fe7C3 and Fe3C significantly affects their VS and VP at high pressures. Extrapolating the sound velocities of the nonmagnetic phases to the inner core conditions, we found that sound velocities, particularly VS, of the iron carbides are markedly low comparing with iron and other iron-rich alloys, making them compelling candidates to explain the seismic observations of the inner core. Our hypothesis of a carbon-rich core may also be consistent with geochemical and petrological evidence on deep carbon inventory in Earth’s interior.",

            "abstract": "The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) and the northern midwest footprint of USArray’s Transportable Array recorded continuous ground motion for a period of 2.5 years. From around 400 M>5.5 teleseismic earthquakes recorded at 337 stations, we measured body wave delay times for 255 of these earthquakes. The P wave delays are accumulated over more than 45 thousand wave paths with turning points in the lower mantle. We combine these delay times with a similar number delay times used in previous tomographic studies of the study region. The latter delay times stem from fewer stations, including Polaris and CNSN stations, and nearly a thousand earthquakes. We combine these two sets of delay times to image the three-dimensional distribution of seismic velocity variations beneath the southern Superior Province and surrounding provinces.\n This combined data coverage is illustrated in the accompanying figure for a total number of 447 stations . The coverage and the combined delays form the best configuration yet to image the three-dimensional distribution of seismic P and S-wave velocity variations beneath the southern Superior and surrounding provinces. Closely spaced stations (~12 km) along and across the MRS provide higher resolving power for lithospheric structure beneath the rift system.\n Conforming to expectations that the entire region is underlain by thick, cool lithosphere, a mean delay of –.55 +/- .54 s. This is very similar to the mean delays -.6s +/- .37s measured for this region before 2012. Event corrections range from -.2 +/-.54 s and correlate with tectonics for 80% of the earthquakes.\n An inversion of these nearly one hundred thousand P and around thirty thousand S-wave delay times for high-resolution P and S-wave velocity structure, respectively, does not show structures that are obviously related to the crustal signature of the MRS. None of structures imaged, align with or have a similar shape to the high Mid-continent Gravity Anomaly (MGA). However, a low-velocity structure is imaged in the lithosphere just east of the MGA.",

However, recently some mangrove areas in the Dong Tranh estuary are being eroded seriously. Based on the field measurements in SW and NE monsoons as well as data of topography changes in 10 years, it is proved that hydrodynamics of waves, tidal currents and riverine currents are the main reasons for erosion-deposition processes at the studied site. The erosion-deposition process changes due to monsoon. The analysed results show that high waves and tidal oscillation cause the increase of the erosion rate in NE monsoon. However, high sediment deposition occurs in SW monsoon due to weak waves and more alluvium from upstream. Many young mangrove trees grow up and develop in the SW monsoon. From the research, it is strongly emphasized the role of mangrove forests in soil retention and energy dissipation.",

In many areas, changes in vegetation species and succession may be a response to underlying hydrological and geomorphological changes to the land surface. Others note significant decreases in productivity as a result of drought, but direct linkages and underlying causes remain elusive. Long-term records of satellite imagery have provided proxy indicators of the complex interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere, as well as disturbances over a variety of space and time scales. The following study compares long-term gridded climate patterns with historical remote sensing-based changes in vegetation productivity within a north to south transect of the Canadian boreal forest and into the zone of sporadic permafrost. The objective is to identify significant ecological and morphological changes associated with long-term climate trends. Areas of natural variability are identified within the western boreal plains and parts of the northern boreal forest associated with increased drying. Geomorphological and ecological changes as a result of thawing sporadic permafrost are also assessed.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing provides a potentially fast, cost-effective, and efficient tool for mapping and monitoring mangroves located in relatively inaccessible areas where field measurements are often difficult and expensive. In this study, we examined the utility of combining Landsat-8 (LDCM), ALOS-PALSAR, and SRTM satellite imagery for mapping mangrove species composition, its canopy height and biomass distribution in the Mimika District of Papua, Indonesia. Image segmentation of ALOS-PALSAR radar data were used to delineate mangrove areas, while flexible statistical expert-based classification of spectral signatures from Landsat-8 (LDCM) images were used to classify mangrove associations. The overall accuracy of mangrove mapping for the entire area was 94.38% with kappa coefficient of 0.94 when validated with field data and QuickBird image data with 2.44 m spatial resolution. Mangrove height and biomass were mapped using the SRTM-based elevation, which were calibrated with field-measured canopy height via regression models. There was a strong linear relationship between the SRTM data and field-measured vegetation height (r = 0.87 and adjusted R2 = 0.76). A bootstrap simulation of 10,000 runs with replacement resulted in an error of 3.03 m (RMSE) and 2.33 m (MAE) for mean tree height over 30 m pixels. SRTM-derived canopy height and plot-level biomass from the 22 mangrove plots showed a strong non-linear relationship with an R2=0.75. Our results showed that mangrove standing biomass in the Mimika District varies from 70.32 Mg/ha to 511.80 Mg/ha with mean biomass error of 65.23 Mg/ha (RMSE) and 58.10 Mg/ha (MAE) over a pixel of 90 m. This study explored a set of reliable methodologies which can be applied for mapping and monitoring mangrove dynamics of large areas in Indonesia.",

Core EW0408-22JC, an 11.84 m long piston core, was retrieved in 2004 from 188 m water depth in Crawfish Inlet, a deglaciated fjord of Baranof Island, Southeast Alaska, which opens to the eastern Gulf of Alaska (GOA). The core contains a nearly complete Holocene record constrained by 14C and tephrochronology with relatively high sedimentation rates of ~100-200 cm/ky, favorable to high-resolution climate investigations. High-resolution geochemical measurements indicate increasing opal and total organic concentrations and decreasing lithic and CaCO3 concentrations from early to late Holocene. Diatom ecology is quantified by counting of diatom taxa at approximately 170-year stratigraphic intervals, and evaluated for climatic and oceanographic significance using the modern analog technique (MAT) and factor analysis. Diatom proxy variability from this site is inferred to result from changes within the GOA climatic and oceanographic regime. Within this region, the strength and positioning of the Aleutian Low and the Alaska Current influence oceanographic parameters including sea surface temperature, downwelling, and nutrient availability, all of which are reflected in diatom ecology fluctuations. The adjacent North American terrestrial hydroclimate is largely controlled by these factors, and its past conditions are inferred by this reconstruction of GOA paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital resource in the country of Uruguay. Here we propose new methods using remotely sensed data for assisting ranchers, land managers, and policy makers in the country to better manage their crops. Firstly, we created a drought severity index based on the climatological anomalies of land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) data also using MODIS. The use of the climatological anomalies on the variables has improved the ability of the index to correlate with known drought indices versus previously published indices, which had not used them. We applied various coefficient schemes and vegetation indices in order to choose the model which best correlated with the drought indices across 10 sites throughout Uruguay’s rangelands. The model was tested over summer months from 2009-2013. In years where drought had indeed been a problem in the country (such as 2009) the model showed intense signals of drought. Secondly, we used Landsat images to identify winter and summer crops in Uruguay. We first classified them using ENVI and then used the classifications in an ArcMap model to identify specific crop areas. We first created a polygon of the classifications for soils and vegetation for each month (omitting cloud covered images). We then used the crop growing cycle to identify the times during the year for which specific polygons should be soil and which should be vegetation. By intersecting the soil polygons with the vegetation polygons during their respective time periods during the crop growing cycle we were able to create an accurately identify crops. When compared to a shapefile of proposed crops for the year the model obtained a kappa value of 0.60 with a probability of detection of 0.79 and a false alarm ratio of 0.31 for the south-western study area over the 2013-2014 summer.",

The resulting diagram identifies:\n1. “points of intervention” at which curation processes can be moved upstream, and\n2. data products that may be important for sharing and preservation.\nThe Site-Based Data Curation project, an Institute of Museum and Library Services-funded project hosted by the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship at the University of Illinois, previously inferred a geobiologist’s planning, field and laboratory workflows through close study of the data products produced during a single field trip to Yellowstone National Park (Wickett et al, 2013). We have since built on this work by documenting post hoc curation processes, and integrating them with the existing workflow. By holistically considering both data collection and curation, we are able to identify concrete steps that scientists can take to begin curating data in the field. This field-to-repository workflow represents a first step toward a more comprehensive and nuanced model of the research data lifecycle.\nUsing our initial three-phase workflow, we identify key data products to prioritize for curation, and the points at which data curation best practices integrate with research processes with minimal interruption. We then document the processes that make key data products sharable and ready for preservation. We append the resulting curatorial phases to the field data collection workflow: Data Staging, Data Standardizing and Data Packaging. These refinements demonstrate:\n1) the interdependence of research and curatorial phases;\n2) the links between specific research products, research phases and curatorial processes;\n3) the interdependence of laboratory-specific standards and community-wide best practices.\nWe propose a poster that shows the six-phase workflow described above. We plan to discuss with attendees how well this applies to other types of field-based research, and seek additional opportunities for future case studies.\n",

            "abstract": "There is no operational system to monitor drought-induced changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) -- the amount of water stored as soil moisture, groundwater, snow, and in surface water bodies. Existing drought indices, such as the USDM, rely primarily on meteorological and shallow soil moisture data. Measuring changes in TWS is difficult because in situ networks do not provide collocated measurements of all TWS components. GRACE satellite data can be used to retrospectively analyze TWS variations caused by drought, but cannot be used for real-time drought monitoring. Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments can be used to estimate TWS variations because the solid Earth responds elastically to changes in hydrologic loading. A decrease (increase) in TWS yields upward (downward) motion, which is apparent in GPS vertical position anomalies, u. GPS vertical position anomalies have been compared to the seasonal cycle of hydrologic loading. However, these data have not been used to monitor TWS fluctuations caused by drought, even though they have attributes that make them well-suited for this application: (1) availability in near real-time (2) widespread spatial distribution; and (3) sensitivity to both local (~10 km) and regional loading.\nHere, GPS vertical position data, u, are used to assess the timing and duration of TWS anomalies in the High Plains caused by the 2012 drought. u indicates an initial TWS minimum in 2012 consistent with GRACE TWS, several months after the most severe meteorological forcing. Standard drought indices show recovery from drought during spring 2013. In contrast, u indicates that the TWS anomaly intensified by approximately 15% during summer 2013, an interval when no GRACE data are available. Hydrologic observations indicate that depletion of groundwater, not soil moisture, is the source of the persistent TWS anomaly. Our results show how GPS vertical position records can be used to monitor TWS in near real-time during drought. TWS based on u complements GRACE data, given their differences in latency, sensing footprint, and error sources.",

            "abstract": "The northwestern China is one of the most arid regions in the middle latitudes, where water is scarce year round. This study investigated the variations of summer moisture in this region using Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) derived from instrumental data and tree-ring records. Based on rotational Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis, the observed summer moisture variations in northwestern China can be classified into three major patterns: the south Xinjing, north Xinjing and eastern parts of the northwestern China. The areal-averaged PDSI in south Xinjing is steading increasing while the PDSI in the eastern parts of the northwestern China is steading decreasing since 1951. The PDSI in north Xinjing, however, was decreasing before middle 1970s followed by abrupt increasing in recent three decades. The tree-ring reconstructed PDSI (MADA) replicates the three major moisture patterns, and has been used to search possible paleo-analogs during the past 700 years. The observed multi-year droughts in south Xinjing occurred 10 times since 1300AD. The spatial distribution of those droughts show extended dry conditions in northwestern China and stretched southeastward to cover the middle and lower Youngtze River Valley. The droughts associated with north Xinjing pattern are more local, mostly confined in north Xinjiang and neighboring regions. The droughts that affected the eastern parts of the northwestern China also affected majority of the eastern China. Overall, there are no noticeable changes in the drought intensity and duration in south and north Xinjing during the past 700 years. However, the modern droughts in the east parts of the northwestern China are much stronger than that during the historical time. The recent drought during 1995-2005 in this region was the most severe during the past 700 years.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, Arctic peatlands have released approximately 35 Tg (3.5 x 1012g) of CH4 annually, corresponding to around 1/3 of the aggregate wetland CH4 fluxes and 16% of all natural emissions. As climate models increasingly suggest that current warming trends in the Arctic (4-8 °C higher annual surface air temperatures) will continue by century’s end, carbon (C) cycling in these northern climes may be further amplified. Although much has been learned in recent decades, uncertainty remains in regard to the spatial and temporal extent of CO2 and CH4 emissions from these systems.\nChamber based carbon flux measurements were gathered for three growing seasons from June 2007 to September 2013 in Barrow, Alaska to investigate the diurnal, weekly, and monthly patterns of CO2 and CH4 flux in the North American Arctic. For the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons, high temporal frequency auto-chambers (LI-8100A Automated Soil Flux System, LI-COR Biosciences) were used to gather over 18,000 individual flux measurements. From July to September 2013 an Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (Los Gatos Research Inc.) was deployed in concert with this soil flux system to gather high temporal frequency soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Nearby eddy covariance towers provided auxiliary meteorological and environmental data, while weekly transects amassed further surficial hydrological measures (pH, thaw depth, water table).\nFor earlier periods of data, respiratory fluxes were partitioned into five microtopographic classes (polygon rims and troughs, low centered basins, high ridges, and flat mesic terrain). Conversely, for the later periods of data covered chamber fluxes were partitioned into three ‘habitat’ types (High, Medium, Wet) based on corresponding aboveground average water table extent.\nMarked dissimilarities were noted across habitat types and microtopographic classes. In general more mesic, waterlogged regions released greater quantities of CO2 across the growing season, while intermediate (Medium) water table regimes dominated CH4 release in the fall. Additionally, temperature generally delimited CO2 release throughout the growing season, while CH4 release was strongly tied to thaw depth expansion. This large dataset thus greatly underscores the importance of microscale heterogeneity on C flux in the Arctic.",

We investigated the widely changing Arctic sea ice using the daily sea ice concentration data. Sea ice data is generated from brightness temperature data derived from the sensors: Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-F13 Special Sensor Microwave/Imagers (SSM/Is), the DMSP-F17 Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument on the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite. We tried to figure out appearance of arctic sea ice melting region of polar cap from the data of passive microwave sensors. It is hard to explain polar sea ice melting only by atmosphere effects like surface air temperature or wind. Thus, our hypothesis explaining this phenomenon is that the heat from deep undersea in Arctic Ocean ridges and the hydrothermal vents might be contributing to the melting of Arctic sea ice.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the thermal histories of sedimentary basins is fundamental to a range of geologic applications including tectonics, petroleum system analysis, and the genesis of ore deposits. Carbonate rocks can serve as archives of basin thermal histories through solid-state reordering of their 13C-18O, or ‘clumped isotope’, bonds at elevated burial temperatures. Here we present one of the first applied studies of carbonate clumped isotope reordering to explore the diagenetic and thermal histories of exhumed brachiopods, crinoids, cements, and host rock in the Permian Palmarito Formation, Venezuela and the Carboniferous Bird Spring Formation, Nevada, USA. Carbonate components in the Palmarito Formation, buried to ~4 km depth, yield statistically indistinguishable clumped isotope temperatures (T(∆47)) ranging from 86 to 122 °C. Clumped isotope temperatures of components in the more deeply buried Bird Spring Formation (>5 km), range from ~100 to 165 °C and differ by component type, with brachiopods and pore-filling cements yielding the highest T(∆47) (mean = 153 and 141 °C, respectively) and crinoids and host rock yielding significantly cooler T(∆47) (mean = 103 and 114 °C). New high-resolution thermal histories are coupled with kinetic models to predict the extent of solid-state C–O bond reordering during burial and exhumation for both sites. Application of these models suggests that brachiopods in the Palmarito Formation experienced partial bond reordering without complete equilibration of clumped isotopes at maximum burial temperature. In contrast, clumped isotope bonds of brachiopods from the Bird Spring Formation appear to have completely equilibrated at maximum burial temperature, and now reflect blocking temperatures ‘locked-in’ during cooling. The 40–50 °C cooler clumped isotope temperatures measured in Bird Spring Formation crinoids and host rock can be explained by both recrystallization and cementation during shallow burial and a greater inherent resistance to solid-state reordering than brachiopods.",

            "abstract": "A large field (245km2) seabed mega-pockmarks (~1 km to 4 km in diameter) was recently imaged on the western edge of the Cocos Ridge near the Middle American Trench. The pockmarks are part of a vast mega-pockmark field (~10x150 km) and were imaged using high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and backscatter and 3D seismic reflection data. On the seafloor, multiple pockmarks exhibit a two-tiered geomorphology, some of which contain small high-backscatter mounds, possibly indicating recent seafloor seepage. 3D seismic data reveal that the two-tiered morphology is caused by collapse structures at depth with large pockmarks above the walls of the former. Observed collapse structures are characterized by steep walls that truncate surrounding strata, apparent normal “ring” faults, chaotic internal reflections interpreted as infill, and circular morphologies. Younger pockmarks located above the walls of the collapse structures are larger in diameter, have gently dipping walls that do not truncate surrounding strata, and typically show elliptical morphologies. Physical properties results at IODP Site U1414 that intersects the 3D seismic volume suggest that observed reverse polarity lens-shaped zones, which are truncated by the deeper collapse structures, represent anomalous regions of high porosity and low density. In addition, a rapid drop in Ca concentrations observed within this interval at Site U1414 suggests a relationship with possible carbonate dissolution. Correlation of the collapse structures stratigraphic timing with nanno-fossil data at Site U1414 suggests formation occurred ~8-10 Ma, approximately during the Late Miocene eastern Pacific carbonate crash. Based on 3D seismic analysis and recent drilling results, we propose a two-stage formation process that consists of initial collapse caused by carbonate dissolution during the late Miocene, followed by sustained fluid-flow along the walls of established collapse features, resulting in pockmark formation. This process resulted in a two-tiered seafloor geomorphology along the western flank of the Cocos Ridge, similar to that observed on the Carnegie Ridge (see Michaud et al., Mar. Geol., 216:205-219).",

This new evaluation project used mixed methods, including an online survey, usability studies, phone interviews, and web statistics, providing multiple lines of evidence from which to draw conclusion and recommendations.\nIn the session, we will explore how the NOAA Climate.gov teams used the literature review and new CIRES research to address underlying challenges to achieving the portal’s goals. The research in these studies finds that people seek information in ways that are complex and that they do so by consulting a vast array of technologies. Improved and different modes of access to information have, throughout history, been led by technological innovation, but human behavior tends to be constant. The NOAA Climate.gov portal improved its design informed by the first literature review and evaluation. We will discuss how the follow-up study will inform continual audience-focused design and innovation for maximizing the effectiveness of the multiple audience portal. ",

The region of ULF wave activity is spatially localized in the ion foreshock. Observational evidence of the ULF wave foreshock boundary has accumulated over the last three decades. In particular, it has been shown that the geometrical characteristics of the boundary are very sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) cone angle. In the present work, we aim at investigating the statistical properties of the ULF wave foreshock boundary. For this purpose, we make use of the first three years of magnetic field data from the flux gate magnetometer (FGM), and the plasma densities and velocities from the Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) on board Cluster (SC-1). A new identification of the ULF wave foreshock boundary is presented, using specific and accurate criteria for a correct determination of boundary crossings. In particular, the criteria are based on the degree of IMF rotation as Cluster crosses the boundary. To reconstruct the foreshock geometry, we use two different 3-D gas dynamic bow shock models. The ULF wave foreshock boundary is compared with previous results reported in the literature as well as with theoretical predictions.",

The temporal variability of the flux and angular distribution is governed by the complex interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field within 1 AU and provides the means also to learn about solar wind conditions. As part of a heliospheric mission, measurements made by the NDA will determine the size-dependent flux of nano-dust and its variations, it will characterize the composition of nano-dust, and may determine their source processes. The nano-dust particles arrive at 1 AU approximately from the direction of the Sun, thus, the NDA is designed specifically to operate while being exposed directly to solar UV radiation. Here, we report on the performance analysis of the NDA under UV illumination. Solar UV radiation is most likely the largest source of noise for the instrument. A fraction of incident photons will scatter into the ion detector and generate background noise, reducing the instrument's sensitivity. The detailed modeling is conducted using a commercial ray-tracing program. The instrument's performance while exposed to UV radiation is optimized in terms of instrument geometry and surface materials/optical properties, and the requirements on all optical surfaces that are necessary to reduce the effect of UV to the required level are defined and presented here.",

            "abstract": "Rice is a staple food crop for the majority of the world’s population, yet paddy fields are threatened by urban expansion, climate change, and degraded agricultural land. For example, Vietnam, the second largest exporter of rice globally, grows most of its rice in the Mekong River Delta at the country’s southern tip, yet this low-lying and heavily populated area is proving susceptible to land cover changes in the area. To properly monitor and manage the rice crops in this region, remote sensing of satellite imagery has been particularly useful; however, most efforts to map regional paddy area utilize coarse resolution MODIS or AVHRR data since the high temporal resolution of these datasets can overcome missing data issues due to clouds. Here, we aim to map the landscape using finer-scale Landsat data by generating dense time stacks over multiple growing seasons. First, we exploit dense stacks of data for circa 2000 and circa 2010 to classify rice using vegetation trajectories (EVI and NDWI). Next, these pixel-based rice maps are combined with image-based segments (generated using the open-source Mean-shift region-growing segmentation algorithm, which has been proven to optimally identify clusters within an image) to generate a polygon-based rice map using the majority rule. Results show that this method can map rice paddy agriculture with over 90% accuracy at a much finer spatial resolution than has ever been produced. Finally, this work also aims to differentiate between double- and triple-cropped rice paddies in the region, again by exploiting EVI trajectories, in an effort to determine how management practices have changed over the decade-long study period. Increasing the number of annual cropping cycles over the area can lead to soil degradation and lower yields per harvest, albeit larger total annual yields, so monitoring these practices is vital to understanding the sustainability of these agricultural systems.

            "abstract": "Precipitation events are expected to become substantially more intense under global warming, but few global comparisons of observations and climate model simulations are available to constrain predictions of future changes in precipitation extremes. We present a systematic comparison of changes in historical annual-maximum daily precipitation between station observations (archived in HadEX2) and the suite of global climate models contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5), from 1901 to 2010 in global scale. We use both parametric and non-parametric tests to quantify the strength of trends in extreme precipitation in observations and models, taking care to spatial and temporal sample them both in comparable ways. We find that both observations and models show generally increasing trends in extreme precipitation since 1901 with larger changes in tropical zones, although annual-maximum daily precipitation has increased faster in the observations than in most of the CMIP5 models. Global average of observational annual-maximum daily precipitation has increased by approximately 10% per degree kelvin of global warming since 1901 which is larger than the average of climate models with 8.3%/K. The rate of increase in extreme precipitation per kelvin of warming in both models and observations are higher than the rate of increase in atmospheric water vapor content per kelvin of warming expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.",

            "abstract": "Sediment trapping at a salt wedge front differs from trapping in a partially mixed estuary, because the lengthscale of a salt wedge frontal zone is an order of magnitude shorter than that of a partially mixed estuary. As a result, fine sediment is much more likely to bypass the frontal zones of a salt wedge, leading to a coarser estuarine sediment bed than would be found in a partially mixed estuary with the same riverine sediment input. A field and numerical study of frontal dynamics and sediment trapping in the Connecticut River provides clear evidence of the bypassing of fine sediment and the dominance of sandy estuarine sediment even in the presence of a large riverine input of suspended mud. Almost all of the newly delivered mud is exported during the spring freshet, but some mud does return during low flow conditions, remobilized and transported by the advancing salt wedge. The mud that returns is a small fraction of the total riverine delivery, and it tends to be sequestered in low-energy zones along the flanks of the estuary and adjacent embayments. This study suggests that the sedimentary environment of an estuary depends more on the characteristics of its frontal regime than on the characteristics of the sediment input.",

In particular, the location of b1e, b1i, b2e, and b2i boundaries defined by Newell at al. [1996], was obtained from the electron and ion precipitating fluxes, measured by the SSJ/4 particle detectors onboard the F16, F17, and F18 satellites.\nAccording to Newell at al.

It was found that during the main phase of the strom, on average, all boundaries move towards the equator, and return to its previous location during recovery phase. Deviations from the common trend could be related to the changes in the solar wind conditions.

            "abstract": "The Variations of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of one glacier could determine the glacier’s behaviors, i.e., advance, stable, retreat, or disappeared. In the Asian High Mountains, there exist a huge number of glaciers, but only few monitoring glaciers. This means that we could only obtain the ELA data sets from these few monitoring glaciers in the region, which restrained our understanding for the spatial distribution pattern of the ELA. Considering that the firn line altitude can indicate the equilibrium line altitude, we may investigate the variations of the firn line altitudes on many glaciers to understand the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of the ELA in the Asian High Mountains. Albedo of the firn is usually larger than that of the glacier ice. This phenomenon can be used to discern the location of the firn line on a glacier in remote sensing image. By using the Landsat TM/ETM+ data, HJ-1A/B data and DEM data, we obtained the firn line altitudes on more than 3000 glaciers in the Asian High Mountains, and found that the highest firn line altitude, over 6000 m a.s.l., was located in the Qiangtang area, which imply that the Indian monsoon moisture cause the firn line altitudes lower to the south of the Qiangtang area, in other words, the Qiangtang area is the northern boundary of the Indian monsoon. The firn line altitude was lower than 5200 m a.s.l. in the southeast Tibetan Plateau while lower than 3500 m a.s.l. in the Altai Mountains in 2010. Over the past decade, the firn line altitudes increased by about 30 to 300 m in different areas of the Tibetan Plateau, but decreased by about 80 m in the Altai Mountains.",

            "abstract": "The mixing ratio of methane in the atmosphere has increased in recent years for reasons that are not completely understood. Stable isotopes allow us to elucidate sources of methane due to the relatively distinct isotopic signatures from fossil fuel, biomass burning, and microbial sources. The Stable Isotope Laboratory at INSTAAR has been measuring δ13C of CH4 from a subset of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division’s Cooperative Air Sampling Network since 1998. Here we examine our 15 year record and show that since 2007, the global average atmospheric methane δ13C value has decreased by 0.08‰. This is coincident with an increase in the growth rate of atmospheric methane after a period of near steady-state conditions from 1999 to 2006. The decrease in δ13C of CH4 is evident at sites in the Arctic as well as in the northern mid-latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. There has been no change in the inter-hemispheric difference of atmospheric methane isotopes, suggesting that the increased emissions do not originate predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Likewise, Miller-Tans plots, which examine regional, higher-frequency deviations from the background signal, show that sources of methane have become depleted in 13C since 2007 across latitudes, implicating stronger microbial emissions (such as those from wetlands). We use a 3-box model (Northern, Tropical and Southern) to test scenarios of increased methane sources and find that increased microbial emissions from the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions are necessary to explain the isotopic shift. Furthermore, because there is not a change in the north-south gradient of δ13C of CH4, and because fossil fuel emissions are primarily from northern latitudes, fossil fuel sources alone cannot explain the increase in methane emissions since 2007. This study shows the value of including stable isotopes in long-term, global observation networks to constrain sources of atmospheric methane.",

Snowpacks are integral to many regions' water supply and management strategies. Snow cover also alters surface albedo, providing an important feedback in the climate system. The main objective of this study is to diagnose and understand the spatial patterns of any trends in snow cover frequency, magnitude, and persistence using National Climatic Data Center's Cooperative Observer Network (COOP) data supplemented with Natural Resources Conservation Service's Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) data. The station data are investigated over the period 1950-2010 directly and without spatial averaging. Additionally, a subset of the COOP stations, selected for relative homogeneity with regard to stations moves, time-of-observation changes, instrument changes, and other disruptive factors, are analyzed to assess any disagreements with trend patterns in the full dataset. Temporal variability underlying the long-term trends is also examined. Key results include widespread declines in the length of the snow-cover season (the period between first and last days of snow cover at a site) and in the total number of days with snow cover per year. Trends in occurrence of snow cover are most pronounced toward the end of the snow-cover season (spring-summer), and occur despite a widespread increase in precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The biochar community is excellent at pointing to individual cases where biochar amendment has changed soil properties, with some studies showing significant improvements in crop yields, reduction in nutrient export, and remediation of pollutants. However, many studies exist which do not show improvements, and in some cases, studies clearly show detrimental outcomes. The next, crucial step in biochar science and engineering research will be to develop a process-based understanding of how biochar acts to improve soil properties. In particular, we need a better mechanistic understanding of how biochar sorbs and desorbs contaminants, how it interacts with soil water, and how it interacts with the soil microbial community.\nThese mechanistic studies need to encompass processes that range from the nanometer to the kilometer scale. At the nanometer scale, we need a predictive model of how biochar will sorb and desorb hydrocarbons, nutrients, and toxic metals. At the micrometer scale we need models that explain biochar’s effects on soil water, especially the plant-available fraction of soil water. The micrometer scale is also where mechanistic information is neeed about microbial processes. At the macroscale we need physical models to describe the landscape mobility of biochar, because biochar that washes away from fields can no longer provide crop benefits.\nTo be most informative, biochar research should occur along a lab-greenhouse-field trial trajectory. Laboratory experiments should aim determine what mechanisms may act to control biochar-soil processes, and then greenhouse experiments can be used to test the significance of lab-derived mechanisms in short, highly replicated, controlled experiments. Once evidence of effect is determined from greenhouse experiments, field trials are merited. Field trials are the gold standard needed prior to full deployment, but results from field trials cannot be extrapolated to other field sites without the mechanistic backup provided by greenhouse and lab trials.",

            "abstract": "Observations of dune orientation provide information on unknown wind regimes, e.g. on other planets or in past climates. While orientation can be used to infer e.g. dominant wind directions, a more comprehensive ‘forward modeling’ approach first predicts the long-term wind field, then combines it with theory to predict dune orientation. Theory includes the gross bedform normal transport model (GBNT), in which dunes in unlimited sand availability orient normal to the direction of maximum gross transport, or the ‘fingering mode’ of Courrech du Pont et al. (2014), in which dunes align with the direction of resultant transport, R, in limited sand availability. A good match between observed and predicted orientations suggests the theory is sound and the simulated wind field realistic. Conversely, a poor match suggests either the simulated wind field is unrealistic or the theory lacking, and that the assumptions and parameters contained in one or both must be modified.\nAspects of the approach may be tested on Earth, where ground truth wind data are often available. We used (1) surface wind data to predict dune orientations in the Arabian Peninsula; and (2) uncalibrated surface winds predicted by a regional climate model (WRF) to predict dune orientations in the Namib Sand Sea. We then compared the observed orientations with those predicted using the forward modeling approach. (1) provides a direct test of dune formation theory, while (2) provides a test of the complete ‘blind’ forward modeling approach.\nFor (1) we predicted dune characteristics using 2000-2009 wind data for 20 stations in or near dune fields to calculate potential sand flux and thereby GBNT dune orientation and R. GBNT theory was a good predictor of crescentic dune orientation, but performed poorly for small and large linear dunes, which were well-predicted by R. This suggests the crescentic dunes formed in unlimited sand, whereas the linear dunes may have formed in areas with limited sand.\nFor (2) we used a year of WRF winds at 3km resolution. The match between observed and predicted orientations appears much better for GBNT theory, compared to R (though mismatches remain), which may reflect high sand availability. The next steps are to vary the assumed saltation threshold, and to use winds after calibrating WRF to match nearby observational wind data.",

            "abstract": "Frequent volcanism on the Big Island of Hawaii allows researchers to take high-resolution measurements of ancient geomagnetic field intensity from lavas. Many laboratory and data analysis techniques are unable to consistently recover the intensity of lava flows erupted in known fields. Published paleointensity results from historic lava flows generally overestimate the expected field strength, suggesting that paleointensity data acquired from ancient lavas erupted in unknown fields are also biased high. A recent investigation of modern lavas on the Big Island of Hawaii was able to reproduce the expected field strength within 8% by collecting quenched volcanic material and applying strict selection criteria. We apply the same collection and analysis techniques to 67, 14C dated, lavas erupted during the last 10 ka on the Big Island and evaluate the long-term strength of the Holocene magnetic field in Hawaii. Preliminary results from our laboratory experiments show that 24 lava flows meet our rigorous selection requirements. The average field strength of these flows is 50.5 µT, a value substantially higher than the present day field (~36 µT), but similar to other paleofield estimates for the last few thousand years. Our methodology suggests that we can accurately recover the ancient field intensity, therefore we will compare the geomagnetic observations in our new dataset to previously published data from Hawaii, including some results from the same lava flows, and examine the differences in long-term field strength estimates, if any, between results with varying laboratory and sample collection techniques. This study will help constrain the variability of existing paleointensity results and offer an updated long-term field estimate for the Holocene in Hawaii.",

They are compressive waves characterized by strong deeps in the magnetic field magnitude and anti-correlated with density. Furthermore, MMW share a common origin with the Ion Cyclotron Waves (ICW), requiring the condition of anisotropy in the plasma temperature (pressure) (T⊥/T‖>>1). In this work we analyze four Cassini's orbits, with low inclination angle <0.5º, of 2005. The data were obtained from MAG and CAPS instruments. We perform a study about the wave properties and their region of occurrence. We found that the MMW can appear between 6 Rs and 6.9 Rs, with respect to Saturn’s center, indicating that they are further away than ICW. Finally, we use linear kinetic theory, using WHAMP code, in order to determine conditions for wave growth in a plasma resembling the regions where these modes were observed.",

            "abstract": "Every lightning flash contributes energy to the TEM mode of the natural global waveguide that contains the Earth’s Schumann resonances. The modest attenuation at ELF (0.1 dB/Mm) allows for the continuous monitoring of the global lightning with a small number of receiving stations worldwide. In this study, nine ELF receiving sites (in Antarctica (3 sites), Hungary, India, Japan, Poland, Spitsbergen and USA) are used to provide power spectra at 12-minute intervals in two absolutely calibrated magnetic fields and occasionally, one electric field, with up to five resonance modes each. The observables are the extracted modal parameters (peak intensity, peak frequency and Q-factor) for each spectrum. The unknown quantities are the geographical locations of three continental lightning ‘chimneys’ and their lightning source strengths in absolute units (C2 km2/sec). The unknowns are calculated from the observables by the iterative inversion of an evolving ‘sensitivity matrix’ whose elements are the partial derivatives of each observable for all receiving sites with respect to each unknown quantity. The propagation model includes the important day-night asymmetry of the natural waveguide. To overcome the problem of multiple minima (common in inversion problems of this kind), location information from the World Wide Lightning Location Network has been used to make initial guess solutions based on centroids of stroke locations in each chimney. Results for five consecutive days in 2009 (Jan 7-11) show UT variations with the African chimney dominating on four of five days, and America dominating on the fifth day. The amplitude variations in absolute source strength exceed that of the ‘Carnegie curve’ of the DC global circuit by roughly twofold. Day-to-day variations in chimney source strength are of the order of tens of percent. Examination of forward calculations performed with the global inversion solution often show good agreement with the observed diurnal variations at individual receiving sites, lending confidence to the 3-chimney model for global lightning.",

            "abstract": "As the foundation of soil fertility, soil organic matter (SOM) formation and break-down is a critical factor of agroecosystem sustainability. In tropical systems where soils are quickly weathered, the link between SOM and soil fertility is particularly strong; however, the mechanisms controlling the stabilization and destabilization of SOM are not well characterized in tropical soils. In western Uganda, we collected soil samples under different levels of land use intensity including maize fields, banana plantations and inside an un-cultivated native tropical forest, Kibale National Park (KNP). To better understand the link between land use intensity and SOM stability we measured total soil C and N, and respiration rates during a 369 d soil incubation. In addition, we separated soils into particle size fractions, and mineral adsorbed SOM in the silt (2-50 µm ) and clay (< 2 µm) fractions was dissociated, purified and chemically characterized via pyrolysis-GC/MS.\nCultivated soil C and N have declined by 22 and 48%, respectively, in comparison to uncultivated KNP soils. Incubation data indicate that over the last decade, relatively accessible and labile soil organic carbon (SOC) pools have been depleted by 55-59% in cultivated soils. As a result of this depletion, the chemical composition of SOM has been altered such that clay and silt associated SOM differed significantly between agricultural fields and KNP. In particular, nitrogen containing compounds were in lower abundance in agricultural compared to KNP soils. This suggests that N depletion due to agriculture has advanced to pools of mineral associated organic N that are typically protected from break-down. In areas where land use intensity is relatively greater, increases in polysaccharides and lipids in maize fields compared to KNP indicate increases in microbial residues and decomposition by-products as microbes mine SOM for organic N. Chemical characterization of post-incubation SOM will help us better understand how microbes preferentially break-down SOM. Agricultural intensification over the past decade in western Uganda has depleted SOC, on average, by 1427 g m-2. In addition, depletion of organic nitrogen reserves in stable SOM pools corresponds with reported declines in crop yields and productivity in this region.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock strength is a key parameter in slope stability, landscape erosion, and fluvial incision, though it is typically ignored or at best indirectly constrained in models, as with the k erodability parameter in stream-power formulations. Indeed, empirical datasets of rock strength suited to address geomorphic questions are rare, in part because of the difficulty in measuring those rocks that are heterolithic, weak, or poorly exposed. We have completed a large dataset of measured bedrock strength organized by rock units exposed along the length of the trunk Colorado-Green river through the Colorado Plateau of the western U.S. Measurements include Selby RMS, fracturing, and field compressive tests at 168 localities, as well as 672 individual-sample tensile-strength tests in the laboratory. These rock strength results are compared to geomorphic metrics of unit stream power, river gradient, valley-bottom width, and local relief through the arid Colorado Plateau.\nOur measurements trend coherently and logically with bedrock type and age/induration, especially in the case of tensile strength and when the influence of fracturing is also considered, signs that the dataset is robust. Focusing on bedrock (rather than alluvial) reaches of the fluvial transect and tensile strength, there is a positive rank-correlation and a strong power-law correlation between reach-averaged rock strength and unit stream power, as well as an elegant linear relation between tensile strength and river gradient. To address the problem of immeasureable rock types, we utilize the inverse power-law scaling between tensile strength and valley-bottom width to estimate the “effective” tensile strength of heterolithic, shale-rich bedrock in alluvial reaches. These results suggest that tensile strength varies to at least an order-of-magnitude smaller values than evident with directly testable rocks in this landscape, with implications for scaling erodibility parameters. Overall, results lead to the conclusion that bedrock strength is, in fact, the first-order control on large-scale fluvial geomorphology in the Colorado Plateau. On one hand this is intuitive, yet it highlights the erroneous but common assumption that bedrock erodibility is uniform or of secondary importance in fluvial morphology and landscape evolution.",

The origin, drift and collisional history of such terranes can be addressed with an integrated magmatic, paleomagnetic and sedimentary perspective.\nThe Barroso Formation is a Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequence that outcrops in the western Cordillera. It is made of basaltic lava flows with interbedded pillow and marine sediments that was formed as part of an oceanic plateau associated to the Caribbean plate. Limited paleomagnetic results have suggested the existence of significant south to north terrane translation of this block from the Pacific.\nThis unit is intruded by numerous gabbroic, tonalitic and granodioritic plutons that record the formation of an oceanic arc on top of the plateau unit that finally collide with the continental margin in the Late Cretaceous.\nThe sedimentary record associated to this magmatic units has been included in the Penderisco Formation which widely outcrop as a series of lenses tectonically intermixed with the basaltic rocks of the Barroso Formation. Despite its extension, the tectonostratigraphic meaning of such record has been scarcely address.\nTwo different sedimentary members have been recognized within the Penderisco Formation. The Nutibara member include mostly pelagic and chemical sedimentary rocks and the Urrao member characterized by intercalation of sandstones mudstones and chert that resembles a turbiditic facies. The sedimentary provenance of sandstones beds associated to the Urrao member include mainly monocrystallyne quartz with undulose and straight extinction, plagioclase, minor volcanic and metamorphic lithics and significant contents of muscovite.\nWhereas the Nutibara member is interpreted as related to the oceanic drift of the volcanic terrane that include the Barroso formation, the turbidites from the Urrao member that include a bimodal arc and metamorphic ensialic provenance can be interpreted as a sealed sequence formed associated to the collision of the oceanic unit with the continental margin. Fourteen new paleomagnetic sites have been recently collected on the Barroso formation to refine the understanding of the origin and intra-oceanic drift phases.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography reveals two antipodal large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVP) at the base of the mantle, rising up to ~1900 km above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). A compositional distinction between the LLSVPs and the ambient mantle is supported by anti-correlation of bulk-sound and shear-wave velocity (Vs) anomalies as well as steep lateral gradients in Vs along the edges of the LLSVPs. These seismic observations however are mainly restricted to the bottom ~600 km of the mantle. Mineral-physics constraints on elastic properties of high-pressure rocks suggest that the seismic signature of these deep distinct domains (DDD) is unlikely to be caused by the presence of subducted basalt, but rather by that of primitive mantle. They further suggest that the LLSVP’s top domains (that reach from heights of ~600 km to 1900 km above the CMB) are either composed of hot basaltic or warm average-mantle material. From a geodynamical point of view, however, the former explanation appears to be more consistent with the top domain’s large widths.\nHere, we present a series of 2D numerical models of mantle convection with three distinct materials (representative of pyrolite, primitive and basaltic material), exploring the effects of their distinct densities and compressibilities. We find (1) that the dense primitive materials accumulate as Superpiles at the CMB, similar to the DDDs, and (2) that the moderately dense basaltic materials evolve into Superplumes sitting on top of the Superpiles, similar to the top LLSVP domains. We here refer to Superplumes as thermochemical domes that are buoyant at depth but negatively buoyant in the mid-mantle (due to excess heat and relatively low compressibility), where they stagnate. Small plumelets intermittently rise from the roofs of the Superplumes to entrain basalt that has evolved in the lower mantle and form hotspots at the surface. This prediction addresses the geochemical and geochronological record of intraplate Pacific volcanism. The predicted sub-horizontal compositional boundary between the basal Superpiles and the overlying Superplumes further provides an explanation for steep vertical gradients in Vs observed at 400-700 km height above the CMB. Such a LLSVP subdivision holds implications for the early and ongoing differentiation and thermal evolution of our planet.",

We determine the number of streamer tips present after splitting and the number of splitting events as a function of angle from the local vertical for a variety of different sprites. We also compare the relative distances between splits, as well as the streamer widths immediately preceding splitting for different sprite events.

            "abstract": "Irrigation with saline water, together with poor leaching of the salts in the root zone, are the major causes of human-caused soil salinization, or secondary salinization. About 20% of irrigated land are salt-affected, and nearly four million acres of farmland are estimated to be lost to excessive salt every year. The development of a high percentage of sodium in the soil exchangeable complex is especially problematic, changing the soil structure and greatly reducing its hydraulic conductivity. This condition, called sodicity, mainly affects arid and semi-arid areas, where precipitation is not adequate to leach salts.\nWe investigate the coupled water and salt balance equations in the root zone irrigated with saline water. By describing the fractions of sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) cations in the irrigation water, soil water, and exchangeable complex, we determine the dynamics of the total salt concentration in the soil water (C) and of the Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP). We found that the dynamics of the ESP can be one order of magnitude slower than that of C: while the typical time scale of convergence of C to its steady-state value is of the order of 1 year, the ESP evolves in a typical time scale of 1 decade and more.\nThese results provide useful indications for the reclamation of sodic soils, which can be accelerated through the replacement of Na cations by Ca ions in the exchangeable complex, often by means of the application of gypsum to the irrigation water. We show that a two-phase managing scheme can shorten the time scale of reclamation, when compared to irrigation with same volumes of water of better quality (low C levels): first irrigation water with high salt concentration and low fraction of Na brings the ESP to low levels in relatively short time scales; then good quality irrigation water (low C) can be applied, decreasing total salinity levels. We also explored the effects of high sodicity on the soil hydraulic conductivity by adding a feedback between ESP and infiltration rate. Finally, the extension to stochastic inputs of water of different quality yields a probabilistic description of C and ESP, with special attention given to the influence of a changing climate to secondary salinization process.",

            "abstract": "More than 50% of global wetland area has been lost over the last 200 years, resulting in losses of habitat and species diversity as well as decreased hydrologic and biogeochemical functionality. Recognition of the magnitude of wetland loss as well as the wide variety of ecosystem services provided by wetlands has in recent decades led to an increased focus on wetland restoration. Restoration activities, however, often proceed in an ad hoc manner, with a focus on maximizing the total restored area rather than on other spatial attributes of the wetland network, which are less well understood. In this study, we have addressed the question of how human activities have altered the size distribution and spatial organization of wetlands over the Prairie Pothole Region of the Des Moines Lobe using high-resolution LIDAR data. Our results show that as well as the generally accepted 90% loss of depressional wetland area, there has been a disproportionate loss of both smaller and larger wetlands, with a marked alteration of the historical power-law relationship observed between wetland size and frequency and a resulting homogenization of the wetland size distribution. In addition, our results show significant decreases in perimeter-to-area ratios, increased mean distances between wetlands, particularly between smaller wetlands, and a reduced likelihood that current wetlands will be located in upland areas. Such patterns of loss can lead to disproportionate losses of ecosystem services, as smaller wetlands with larger perimeter-to-area ratios have been found to provide higher rates of biogeochemical processing and groundwater recharge, while increased mean distances between wetlands hinder species migration and thus negatively impact biodiversity. These results suggest the need to gear restoration efforts towards understanding and recreating the size distribution and spatial organization of historical wetlands, rather than focusing primarily on an increase in overall area.",

Two potential targets of a BOPPS flight in September 2014 are comets C/2012 K1 PanSTARRS and C/2013 A1 Siding Spring. The UV-VIS science camera has been outfitted with four filters from the NASA’s Hale-Bopp filter set: an OH filter at 308 nm, a CN filter at 385 nm and continuum filters at 345 and 445 nm. UV-VIS can potentially measure OH emission from the cometary targets if the BOPPS flight extends past sunset; the sky background due to Rayleigh scattering at 310 nm is too high for daytime observations, even from float altitudes near 35 km.\nThe BOPPS telescope is stabilized at the few arcsecond level by inertial-guidance gyroscopes that control coarse elevation and azimuth reaction wheels. The UV-VIS bench includes a fast guide camera and an FSM (fine steering mirror) – both COTS items – to bridge the pointing gap from a few arcseconds to a tenth of an arcsecond. In two separate hang tests, the guide camera was able to provide a 50 Hz pointing error signal on a star, and the resulting FSM-corrected images were reduced in areal size by 50% (e.g., linear PSF widths reduced from 2.4” to 1.6”). The FSM performance is expected to achieve the 0.1” stability goal in the stratosphere, where the image degradation is caused by motion of the optical system instead of atmospheric turbulence.",

The values of Ep were related to the topographic distribution especially mountain ranges, and larger over continents than oceans. The monthly mean values of Ep showed a quasi-biannual variation which is correlated to the zonal wind filed in the equatorial region, and an annual variation at mid-and high-latitudes. The climatological behaviors of Ep were compared with deep convections in the tropical region, and more evidence showed that the gravity wave activity was affected not only by convective activities but also other large-scale meteorological systems in mid-latitudes.",

Arridge et al. show that Cassini data from the noon, midnight and dawn local time sectors clearly indicate this bending and they present an azimuthally independent model to describe this bowl shaped geometry. We have used our global MHD model, BATS-R-US/SWMF, to study Saturn’s magnetospheric current sheet under different solar wind dynamic pressures and solar zenith angle conditions.\nWe find that under typical conditions the current sheet does bend upward and take on a basic shape similar to the Arridge model in the noon, midnight, and dawn sectors. However, the MHD model results show significant variations from the Arridge model including the degree of bending, variations away from a simple bowl shape, non-uniformity across local time sectors, drastic deviations in the dusk sector, and a dependence on the solar wind dynamic pressure. We will present a detailed description of our 3D MHD model results and the characteristics of the current sheet in the model. We will point out variations from the Arridge model.

            "abstract": "The physical properties of melts at temperature and pressure conditions of the Earth’s mantle have a fundamental influence on the chemical and thermal evolution of the Earth. However, direct investigations of melt structures at these conditions are experimentally very difficult or even impossible with current capabilities. In order to still be able to obtain an estimate of the structural behavior of melts at high pressures and temperatures, amorphous materials have been widely used as analogue materials.\nIn particular the investigation of sound wave velocities of amorphous SiO2 and MgSiO3 as analogues for silicate melts indicate structural changes at about ~30-40 GPa and ~130-140 GPa [1]. The transition pressures are lower for MgSiO3 than for SiO2 indicating that these transitions are affected by the degree of polymerization of the SiO2 network of the glasses. Nevertheless, these measurements only give a hint about the occurrence of structural transitions but lack information on the actual structural changes accompanied by the sound wave velocity discontinuities.\nThe pressure of the second structural transition at ~130-140 GPa is of vital importance for geophysics. If it causes silicate melts to become denser than the surrounding solid material, it would result in negatively buoyant melts close to the core-mantle boundary, which could be a major factor affecting the chemical stratification of the Earth’s mantle during an early magma ocean after the moon forming impact.\nIn order to resolve the structural transition and estimate the effect of a different degree of polymerization further, we studied the structural behavior of Mg2SiO4 glass up to 140 GPa using X-ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis. The measurements were performed at the GSECARS 13-IDD beamline at the APS employing the newly developed multichannel collimator (MCC) setup. The MCC effectively removes unwanted Compton scattering of the diamond anvils and enables easy extraction of X-ray total scattering intensity up to the highest pressures achieved.\nWe will present data on structural changes and densification mechanisms of Mg2SiO4glass at high pressures, and elaborate on the potential of negatively buoyant melts at the core-mantle boundary.\n [1] Murakami et al., 2011.

            "abstract": "Current global climate models predict climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will result in altered precipitation regimes by the end of the 21st century. Although there is still uncertainty regarding how mean annual rainfall will change in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., it is predicted that there will be larger rainfall events followed by extended dry periods. How this will affect greenhouse gas emissions across the landscape remains unclear. Here, we investigate the response of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from soil cores taken from a riparian-upland transect in southwest Virginia to changes in simulated rainfall magnitude and frequency. A preliminary experiment was conducted in early spring 2014 using soil cores collected in a riparian wetland in Virginia Tech’s StREAM Lab. These cores were divided into three different treatment groups. Each group received the same total amount of water, but the magnitude and frequency of the application of water was altered to simulate a single large storm event, three medium storm events, or seven small storm events. Concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the chamber headspace were measured with a cavity ring-down spectrometer and used to calculate fluxes from the soil cores. Our preliminary results suggest that larger storm events result in greater temporary suppression of CO2 emissions, and higher temporal resolution is needed to fully characterize the response of N2O emissions to storm events. In late summer 2014, additional soil cores will be taken from three different zones along a riparian-upland transect, divided into treatment groups, and subjected to a refined version of the previously mentioned experimental procedures. Additionally, the soil from the three different zones will be characterized with chemical and physical methods. Statistical analyses will be performed to compare the effects of the different treatments and to determine the controls on the response of the soil cores. These results will provide insight into possible feedback loops that may exist between soil greenhouse gas emissions and altered precipitation regimes resulting from climate change.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation models are needed to assess how crop productivity may be altered due to variations in climatic conditions. Stomatal conductance controls both diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere into the leaf and water losses from the soil-plant system to the atmosphere through transpiration (E). Despite its significance, stomatal conductance and its links to climatic variables remains empirically specified in current crop models thereby challenging their application to future climatic conditions. It has long been conjectured that stomata has evolved so as to allow terrestrial plants to assimilate CO2 in a desiccating atmosphere while minimizing water losses. Hence, the hypothesis that stomata adapt optimally to their environment so as to maximize assimilation (A) for a given amount of water loss has received significant attention over the past 4 decades. Here, a new approach to implement optimization theory of stomatal conductance into a dynamic canopy gas exchange model is introduced. A key variable in this theory is the so-called marginal water use efficiency (MWUE), which is assumed to be constant on time scales commensurate with fluctuations in stomatal aperture. However, on time scales relevant to crop productivity (daily to seasonal), the boundary conditions on the optimization problem evolve in time prompting the question of how to assign MWUE on such time scales. To address this question, MWUE was formulated as a function of time-integrated leaf-water potential and atmospheric CO2. Next, leaf water potential was linked to root and soil pressure using a soil water balance model based on a modified Richards' equation that considers vertical distribution of root water uptake. The adequacy of the new approach was tested by comparing predicted diurnal cycles of A and E as well as variability of soil moisture with long-term observations at a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.Cubus) field in southwest Germany (see Figure), where transpiration and assimilation rates were derived from eddy-covariance measurements of latent heat flux and net ecosystem exchange. To place those results in the broader context of climate change and food security issues, a sensitivity analyses on water and carbon fluxes with respect to climatic variables, soil texture, and root-density distribution is also presented.",

            "abstract": "Because of its high visible albedo, snow plays a large role in Earth’s surface energy balance. This role is a subject of intense study, but due to the wide range of snow albedo, variations in the characteristics of snow grains can introduce radiative feedbacks in a snow pack. Snow grain size, for example, is one property which directly affects a snow pack’s absorption spectrum. Previous studies model and observe this spectrum, but potential feedbacks induced by these variations are largely unknown. Here, we implement a simple and inexpensive technique to measure snow grain size in an instrument we call the Near-infrared Emitting Reflectance Dome (NERD). A small black styrene dome (~17cm diameter), fitted with two narrowband light-emitting diodes (LEDs) centered around 1300nm and 1550nm and three near-infrared reverse-biased photodiodes, is placed over the snow surface enabling a multi-spectral measurement of the hemispheric directional reflectance factor (HDRF). We illuminate the snow at each wavelength, measure directional reflectance, and infer grain size from the difference in HDRFs measured on the same snow crystals at fixed viewing angles. We validate measurements from the NERD using two different reflectance standards, materials designed to be near perfect Lambertian reflectors, having known, constant reflectances (~99% and ~55%) across a wide range of wavelengths. Using a 3D Monte Carlo model simulating photon pathways through a pack of spherical snow grains, we calculate the difference in HDRFs at 1300nm and 1550nm to predict the calibration curve for a wide range of grain sizes. This theoretically derived curve gives a relationship between effective radius and the difference in HDRFs and allows us to approximate grain sizes using the NERD in just a few seconds. Further calibration requires knowledge of truth values attainable using a previously validated instrument or measurements from an inter-comparison workshop.",

            "abstract": "Substantial populations, such as Mexico City, Auckland, and Portland, are built within or near monogenetic fields, so it is important to understand both eruption precursors and magma plumbing systems in such areas. Directly observing the plumbing systems of this rarely witnessed eruption style provides valuable insight into the nature of magmatic transport and storage within the shallow crust, as well as the associated monogenetic eruptive processes. Within the San Rafael Desert of Central Utah is an exposed Pliocene complex of approximately 2000 mapped dikes, 12 sills, and 60 conduits eroded to a depth of 800 m below the paleosurface. A combination of airborne LiDAR (ALS), provided by NCALM, and terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) surveys are used to map the dip of 5 major sills within a 35 sq km area. The ALS provides a 1 m aerial resolution of exposed volcanic features and the TLS gives vertical measurements to cm accuracy. From these data we determine that the 5-25 m thick sills in this area dip approximately 1 to 6 degrees. Field observations show that steps in sills and related fabrics indicate flow direction in sills during emplacement and that sills normally propagate down dip in the Entrada sandstone host rock away from apparent feeder dikes and conduits. Some sills have foundered roofs, especially near conduits, suggesting that nearly neutrally buoyant magmas emplaced into sills along bed partings in the Entrada, differentiated, and in some cases flowed back into conduits. By volume, at 800 m depth in the San Rafael, nearly all igneous rock (approximately 90 percent) is located in sills rather than in dikes or conduits. These observations are consistent with geochemical models that suggest differentiation in shallow sills explains geochemical trends observed in single monogenetic volcanoes in some active fields. Deformation associated with sill inflation and deflation may be a significant precursor to eruptive activity in monogenetic volcanic fields.",

However, objective public learning that integrates these components is essential for improving public environmental literacy. ENERGY-NET (Energy, Environment and Society Learning Network) is a National Science Foundation funded initiative that uses an Earth Systems Science framework to guide experimental learning for high school students and to improve public learning opportunities regarding the energy-environment-society nexus in a Museum setting. One of the primary objectives of the ENERGY-NET project is to develop a rich set of experimental learning activities that are presented as exhibits at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). Here we detail the evolution of the ENERGY-NET exhibit building process and the subsequent evolution of exhibit content over the past three years. While preliminary plans included the development of five “exploration stations” (i.e., traveling activity carts) per calendar year, the opportunity arose to create a single, larger topical exhibit per semester, which was assumed to have a greater impact on museum visitors. Evaluative assessments conducted to date reveal important practices to be incorporated into ongoing exhibit development: 1) Undergraduate mentors and teen exhibit developers should receive additional content training to allow richer exhibit materials. 2) The development process should be distributed over as long a time period as possible and emphasize iteration. This project can serve as a model for other collaborations between geoscience departments and museums.

            "abstract": "Episodic flood events can have major effects on biogeochemistry of estuary and deltaic systems. In 2011, the Great Flood event that transpired in the Missouri-Mississippi River watershed resulted in likely the highest discharge of water and sediments at the Atchafalaya outflow in several thousand years (since the last time the mainstem discharge flowed through this area). We sampled the event hydrograph starting near the peak and measuring through the falling leg of the flood event. Here we describe particulate organic carbon (POC) age spectra from these samples referenced to selected samples from a >60 month time series of samples from several sites along the Atchafalaya outlet and building submarine delta. Similar to past work on high-water events, age spectra become older during the flood event. However, this flood event did not return ages as old as previous events analyzed, suggesting a provenance control on age spectra. Age spectra showed relatively youngest ages during the return to baseline conditions immediately following the flood hydrograph and then returned to intermediate ages afterwards. Our response to the event missed the early rising limb of the event, when sediment transport was highest, however the peak and falling limb of the Atchafalaya hydrograph were well-represented in our time series. We hypothesize that during the initial pulse of sediment, age spectra may have been older, but subsequent discharge at near bank-full and over bank flow at some river reaches carried more recent POC than initial erosion of bank deposits during the rising limb of the flood. Still, the age spectra observed in an extreme event do not approach the breadth of the spectra observed in more erosive and steep mountainous river systems.",

            "abstract": "The catchment area is considered as the planning unit of natural resources where multiple factors as biotic, abiotic and human interact in a web of relationships making this unit a complex system. It is also considered by several authors as the most suitable unit for studying the water movement in nature and a tool for the understanding of natural processes.\nThis research implements several hydrological models commonly used in water resources management and planning. It is the case of Témez, abcd, T, P, ARMA (1,1), and the lumped conceptual model TETIS. This latest model has been implemented in its distributed version for comparison purposes and it has been the basis for obtaining information, either through the reconstruction of natural flow series, filling missing data, forecasting or simulation.\nHydrological models make use of lumped data of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, as well as the following parameters for each one of the models which are related to soil properties as capillary storage capacity; the hydraulic saturated conductivity of the upper and lower layers of the soil, and residence times in the flow surface, subsurface layers and base flow.\nThe calibration and the validation process of the models were performed making adjustments to the parameters listed above, taking into account the consistency in the efficiency indexes and the adjustment between the observed and simulated flows using the flow duration curve.\nThe Nash index gave good results for the TETIS model and acceptable values were obtained to the other models. The calibration of the distributed model was complex and its results were similar to those obtained with the aggregated model.\nThis comparison allows planners to use the hydrological multimodel techniques to reduce the uncertainty associated with planning processes in developing countries. Moreover, taking into account the information limitations required to implement a hydrological models, this application can be a good approach to water resources management. This project can be an important tool for decision making of different actors, such as local government, environmental agencies (CORTOLIMA), risk management office. Finally, the establishment of an improved network of hydro-meteorological stations that allow acquiring a better quality information.",

In order to study the mechanism of cover-collapse sinkhole formation, we set up a two dimensional experimental model and analyze the critical conditions of soil cavity expansion and collapse and discuss the role of the seepage force in the formation of sinkhole. A forecasting model of sinkhole collapse coupled the mechanics and flow is established in which a critical dimensionless number was used to evaluate the sinkhole development. The results show that: The impact of hydrologic conditions on the cave expanding is generally dramatic and geology (the scale of the opening, soil property, thickness of soil layer, etc.) plays a critical role in sinkhole development. The weak opening of the limestone by karst processes under the clay layer is the essential condition which can cause an arch in clay immediately; due to downward seepage force, the arch develops into soil cave which would expand upward stage by stage as a result of failure of soil. A short false stability exists between two contiguous stages until the arch of the soil cave cannot support the soil roof and then the sinkhole collapses. Moreover during the process the cohesive force of the soil is the major resisting force of sinkhole development.",

            "abstract": "Cassini had its 96th close flyby of Titan on Dec. 1, 2013. This was the first flyby that found Titan situated outside Saturn’s bowshock in the solar wind. During a several hour period in the solar wind leading up to closest approach, beginning when Cassini was about 22 RT from Titan, the Cassini/CHEMS sensor, covering the energy per charge range 3-220 keV/e, detected three species of pickup ions: H+, H2+, and a species near m/q = 16 (possibly O+). All three species had cutoff energies of about 4.3 keV/nuc, implying a solar wind speed of about 450 km/s. The solar wind slowed upon approach to Titan, presumably as it was loaded with ions of Titan origin. T97 occurred about a month later on Jan. 1, 2014, with Titan located in the magnetosheath. However, Cassini did enter the solar wind for a 12 hour period beginning on Dec. 30, 2013, at a distance of about 325 RT from Titan. During that period CHEMS observed a weak H+ pickup ion signal but no H2+or heavier pickup ions, indicating that high intensities of those species are confined to a somewhat limited region near Titan. We will discuss these observations and multiple ion acceleration events (>100 keV) that occurred during the several day period around T96 during which Cassini crossed Saturn’s bowshock 16 times.\n.",

We describe the algorithms for generating the product and the evaluations of it using in-situ measurements. TES and MLS standalone CO profile retrievals are sensitive respectively to lower-mid troposphere and upper troposphere and above. We pair TES nadir and MLS limb tangent locations within 6-8 min and less than 220 km. The paired radiance measurements of the two instruments per location are optimally combined to retrieve a single CO profile along with other interfering species. This combined CO profile has improved vertical resolution and vertical range over the two standalone products, especially in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere. For example, the degree of freedom for signal (DOFS) between surface and 50hPa for TES alone is < 2, and for the combined CO profiles is 2-4. We will present the comparison results between the Aura CO and AirCore, HIPPO, and MOZAIC observations.

            "abstract": "The Lake Champlain Basin is a critical socioeconomic resource for the Northeastern US and Southern Quebec. While global climate models (GCMs) provide an overview of climate change in the region, they lack the spatial resolution necessary to fully assess the effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on hydrologic and ecologic processes. One approach to address this limitation is statistical downscaling, which both bias corrects and increases the spatial resolution of GCM simulations. However, even the increased spatial resolution of most statistically downscaled products (~1/8°) is not sufficient for detailed hydrologic, ecologic, and land-use modeling in the small watersheds of the Lake Champlain Basin.\nAn ensemble of very high resolution (30”) precipitation and temperature projections (1950-2099) is developed for the Lake Champlain Basin by applying an additional level of downscaling based on topography and the dense station network in Vermont and Quebec to intermediately downscaled (1/8°) data. The additional downscaling consists of two main steps. First, maximum likelihood estimation is used to derive the observed relationships between precipitation and elevation, and temperature and latitude and elevation. Then, these relationships are combined with spatial interpolation to enhance the resolution of intermediately downscaled GCM projections.\nThe resulting very high resolution dataset is analyzed both for its ability to reproduce station observations over a historical period (1970-1999), as well as add value when compared with spatial interpolation only. The sensitivities of the projections and additional downscaling to GCM, greenhouse gas emissions scenario, interpolation method, and intermediately downscaled dataset are evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Spectral observations of the solar transition region (TR) and corona typically show broadening of the spectral lines beyond what is expected from thermal and instrumental broadening. The remaining non-thermal broadening is significant (10-30 km/s), correlated with the intensity, and has been attributed to waves, macro and micro turbulence, nanoflares, etc... Here we study spectra of the low TR Si IV 1403 Angstrom line obtained at high spatial and spectral resolution with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). We find that the large improvement in spatial resolution (0.33 arcsec) of IRIS compared to previous spectrographs (2 arcsec) does not resolve the non-thermal line broadening which remains at pre-IRIS levels of 20 km/s. This surprising invariance to spatial resolution indicates that the physical processes behind the non-thermal line broadening either occur along the line-of-sight (LOS) and/or on spatial scales (perpendicular to the LOS) smaller than 250 km. Both effects appear to play a role. Comparison with IRIS chromospheric observations shows that, in regions where the LOS is more parallel to the field, magneto-acoustic shocks driven from below impact the low TR leading to strong non-thermal line broadening from line-of-sight integration across the shock at the time of impact. This scenario is confirmed by advanced MHD simulations. In regions where the LOS is perpendicular to the field, the prevalence of small-scale twist is likely to play a significant role in explaining the invariance and the correlation with intensity.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has revealed an along-strike topographic discontinuity in the Himalaya of western Nepal. We interpret this discontinuity as reflecting a change in geometry and architecture of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). Specifically, the ~4-km high Greater Himalayan mountainfront that characterizes much of the central Himalaya diffuses into a gentler, two-step mountainfront in western Nepal. This observation suggests that the belt of rapid rock uplift that has been identified along much of the range front (commonly interpreted as a result of of transport of the orogenic wedge over a mid-crustal ramp in the MHT) widens or bifurcates into two bands in western Nepal. This tectonic discontinuity could perhaps be explained by recent southward migration of the Main Himalayan Thrust ramp in western Nepal, a hypothesis supported by the presence of several high-elevation, low-relief landscape remnants between the two topographic steps.\nIn an effort to test the above hypothesis, we will present a suite of apatite and zircon U-Th/He cooling ages collected along several relief transects in western Nepal. Transects were situated such that they will capture exhumation histories above the southern and northern topographic steps as well as the high elevation, low-relief plateau between them. Exhumation rates and histories will be interpreted with the aid of thermo-kinematic modeling.\nThis work will: 1) provide important constraints on possible tectonic models explaining the anomalous topography of western Nepal; 2) allow comparison with cooling ages collected along strike to the NW and E; and 3) ultimately provide insight into the mechanisms of orogen growth and evolution. If this work confirms the presence of a bifurcation or recent forward propagation of the MHT in western Nepal, it will have key implications for the seismic hazard presented by the plate boundary as well as for our understanding of the longevity of mid-crustal structures within the Himalaya.",

Basalts erupted at several intraplate oceanic islands, including Hawaii, Iceland, Galapagos and Samoa, have hosted the highest 3He/4He ratios (> 30 Ra, where Ra is atmospheric 3He/4He ratio) globally that are far in excess of the 3He/4He typical of the upper mantle sampled at mid-ocean ridges (8 Ra). These lavas have been suggested to be melts of a primitive, or possibly slightly depleted, mantle reservoir, i.e., either fertile or a depleted peridotite. We report evidence for geochemical enrichment in the high 3He/4He mantle sampled by lavas with the highest 3He/4He from Hawaii, Samoa and possibly Galapagos. The titanium concentrations in high 3He/4He lavas from Samoa are too high to be explained by melts of a mantle peridotite, even at infinitesimally small degrees of melting, and the elevated Ti corresponds to elevated Pb-isotopic ratios. The highest 3He/4He lavas from Loihi, Hawaii have Ti concentrations that are too high to be melts of primitive mantle peridotite at the degrees of melt extraction proposed for those ocean islands. Thus, Ti-rich material must have been added to the high 3He/4He mantle reservoir, and this material is likely to be recycled mafic crust similar to MORB-like eclogite, which is consistent with the elevated Pb-isotopic ratios. We show that fractionation corrected, major element compositions of high 3He/4He alkalic lavas can be satisfactorily modeled by melting and melt-rock interaction scenario in a fertile peridotite-MORB-eclogite hybrid system. Primitive peridotitic and recycled eclogitic reservoirs are suggested to be intimately associated in the deepest mantle and far from being primitive, the high 3He/4He lavas may sample a mantle source that hosts a component of recycled oceanic crust.",

The project will be implemented in the typical extreme drought area based on comprehensive and systemic observation network and numerical experiments It will show a complete feedback mechanism among the atmospheric, water, biological and other spheres for forming drought. First, the atmospheric droughts that leads to agriculture and hydrologic drought and the possible causes for these disasters will be explored using our observation data sets. Second, the capability of monitoring, forecasting and early warning for drought will be developed with numerical model (regional climate model and land surface model, etc.). Last but not the least, evaluation approaches for the risk of drought and the strategy of predicting/prohibiting the drought at regional scale will be proposed. Meanwhile, service system and information sharing platform of drought monitoring and early warning will be established to improve the technical level of drought disaster preparedness and response in China.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic activity of the Lau and North Fiji backarc basins in the South Pacific is complex and not well delimited. Rapid subduction of the Pacific plate at the Tonga trench, together with rifting between the Tonga and Australian plates and Niuafo'ou microplate, has created multiple types of volcanic activity as a function of this complex tectonic setting (1). In addition to extensional volcanism producing depleted mantle melt (2), a number of hotspots (Samoa, Rurutu, Rarotonga, Macdonald and Louisville) have passed near the area, each at distinct time periods, possibly contributing mantle plume components to the magmatism of the Lau Basin. During the summer of 2013, three transects in the Lau Basin and southwest of Samoa were dredged onboard the R/V Roger Revelle (Expedition RR1310). We present here the results of 10 new step heating experiments by the 40Ar/39Ar method using the ARGUS-VI multi-collector mass spectrometer, comprising groundmass and plagioclase separates from 9 basalt samples. These high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages will allow us to determine whether some of the volcanic activity in the Lau Basin correlates with known ages of hotspot transits through the area, clarifying evidence from corresponding geochemical analyses for a subset of these samples, which support incorporation of Samoan (EMII), Rurutu (HIMU), and Rarotonga (EMI) mantle components into spreading center volcanism across a larger area than previously reported (presented by Price et al., this volume). These ages thus provide insights into the complex construction of the Lau Basin through time.\n1. Zellmer, K.E.; Taylor, B.

            "abstract": "The Vienna Basin in the northeastern part of Austria between the Eastern Alps and the West Carpathians is a pull-apart basin crossed by the Danube river. The structure is filled with marine and terrestrial sediments showing thicknesses of up to 6 km. An increase in glacial melt water discharges, typically linked to high productivity of Alpine glaciers, had an essential impact on the formation of the investigated terrace. The scale of erosion and sediment transport translates to deposition rates in the foreland and is influenced by the magnitude of melt water discharges in Alpine catchment areas. Variations in layer characteristics (i.e. grain size, sorting, thickness) are an indicator for glacial pulses. Burial dates of ten quartz pebbles originating from the Gaenserndorfer terrace, situated in the northeastern part of the basin, set time dependent constraints on the required hydrological regime for mobilization, transport and sedimentation of bedloads and allow relating the deposition of glacial sediments to past glacial periods. But the geomorphic evolution of the Vienna Basin was not only determined by sedimentation processes. A number of irregularities manifest that tectonics affected the area as well: Terrace tilts are dipping against the slope of the Danube and offsets of some decameters between sediment layers showing the same facies, but located several kilometers apart from each other, could be identified. An extensive Miocene fault system was partly reactivated during the Middle Pleistocene and could have caused the formation of these discontinuities. It is of great interest to discriminate impacts on the area due to deposition from morphological elements formed by seismic events. The preliminary burial ages afford for putting the sampled terrace segment into a coherent geochronological context and provide a dataset to compare ages of the Gaenserndofer terrace to ages of sediment layers at other locations within the basin in order to either validate or reject the hypothesis that they belong to the same stratigraphical unit. The dating of the terrace helps to analyze the processes dominating this complex area and can contribute to a better understanding of the prevalent climate conditions in the Alps, the Alpine foreland and the inner Alpine basins during the Quaternary.",

As the first major scientific outcome of the IPY, LIMA supports current scientific polar research, encourages new projects, and helps the general public visualize Antarctica and changes happening to this southernmost environment.\nAs the latest satellite of Landsat mission, the Landsat-8 images the entire Earth every 16 days in an 8-day offset from Landsat-7. Data collected by the instruments onboard the satellite are available to download at no charge within 24 hours of reception. The standard Landsat 8 products provided by the USGS EROS Center consist of quantized and calibrated scaled Digital Numbers (DN) in 16-bit unsigned integer format and can be rescaled to the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and/or radiance.\nWith the support of USGS portal, we searched and downloaded more than 1600 scenes of Level 1 T- Terrain Corrected Landsat 8 image products covering Antarctica from late 2013 to early 2014. These data were converted to planetary radiance for further processing. Since the distribution of clouds in these images are random and much complicated, statistics on the distribution of clouds were performed and then help to decide masking those thicker cloud to keep more useful information left and avoid observation holes.\nA preliminary result of the Landsat-8 mosaic of Antarctica under the joint efforts of Beijing Normal University, NSIDC and University of Maryland will be released on this AGU fall meeting.

            "abstract": "The Pariette Wetlands located in the Uinta Basin, UT, were developed by the BLM in part to mitigate salinity associated with irrigation drainage and runoff from flowing to the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The wetlands are fed by runoff from upstream agricultural irrigation, and natural subsurface and overland flow through the Uintah formation, which is seleniferous, and saline. Concentrations of Total Dissolved Salts (TDS), boron (B) and selenium (Se) in the wetlands exceed the total maximum daily loads developed to meet the US EPA’s water quality planning and management regulations (40CFR 130). This is of concern because the wetlands are home to populations of migratory birds, waterfowl, raptors, and numerous small mammals. A mass balance of the Se concentrations of water flowing into and out of the wetlands indicates that 80% of the Se is stored or lost within the system. Additional data suggest that the majority of the Se is associated with the sediments. Little information is available regarding the TDS and B. Therefore we will determine the whether B and other salts are accumulating in the wetland systems, and if so where. We sampled water, sediment, benthic organisms, and wetland plants, in 4 of the 23 ponds from the flood control inlet to water flowing out to the Green River. Sediments were collected at 3 depths (0-2 cm, 2-7 cm, and 7+ cm) at 3-4 locations within each pond including the inlet, outlet and at least one site near a major wetland plant community. Benthic organisms were sampled from the 0-2 cm and 2-7 cm sediment layers. Sediment and organism samples were digested with HNO3 and HClO4 prior to analysis of total Se by HGAAS. Hot water extractable B and DPTA extractable B were analyzed by ICP-AES. TDS was estimated from EC in the sediment and organisms extracts and direct analysis in the water. Preliminary results found that Se in the sediments decreases with depth. Se concentrations in the benthic organisms is approximately 4 times higher than in the associated sediments. Data from this study will contribute to a water quality risk assessment to the wetland fish and birds.",

            "abstract": "As sediment is transported downstream as bedload, it collides with the bed causing sharp edges to chip and wear away, rounding the rock through the process of abrasion. Previous work has linked abrasion to downstream fining and rounding of grains, however, there has been little attempt to understand the underlying kinematics of abrasion. Furthermore, most studies neglect the fine particle produced during the abrasion process, as the initial grain gets smaller and rounder. In this research, we preform well-controlled laboratory experiments to determine the functional dependence between impact energy and mass lost from abrasion. We use a double-pendulum “Newton’s Cradle” set-up to examine the abrasion between two grains and with a high-speed camera, we can quantify the impact energies during collision. Results from experiments verify that mass loss is proportional to kinetic energy. We define a material parameter that incorporates material density, Young's modulus, and tensile stress and show that this parameter is directly related to the proportionality between mass loss and energy. We identify an initial region of the mass loss curves in which abrasion is independent of energy and material properties; results suggest this region is determined by shape. We show that grain size distributions of daughter products are universal and independent of material; they follow a Weibull distribution, which is expected distribution from brittle fracture theory. Finally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show a thin damage zone near the surface, suggesting that collision energy is attenuated over some small skin depth. Overall, we find that pebble abrasion by collision can be characterized by two universal scaling relations - the mass loss versus energy curves and the size distribution of daughter products. Results will be useful for estimating expected abrasion rates in the field, and additionally demonstrate that low-energy collisions produce large quantities of sand and smaller grains.",

            "abstract": "We systematically mapped (scales >1:500) the surface rupture of the 4 April 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake through Sierra Cucapah to understand how faults with similar structural and lithologic characteristics control rupture zone fabric, which is here defined by the thickness, distribution and internal configuration of shearing in a rupture zone. Fault zone architecture and master fault dip showed the strongest controls on rupture zone fabric. Highly localized slip was observed along simple narrow fault cores (<20 m), whereas wide cores (>>50 m) composed of multiple zones of high shear strain had wider and more complex rupture zones that generally lacked principal-displacement scarps. Rupture zone thickness also increases systematically with decreasing fault zone dip. We observed that coseismic slip along faults that dip >40° was mostly confined to the fault core, whereas faults that dip as low as 20° had surface rupture entirely developed entirely outside of the fault zone. The lack of large off-fault strain along faults dipping >40° is contrary to predictions by dynamic stress modeling (e.g., Ma, 2009). We show that static tectonic loading, which varies significantly with fault orientation, has a significant effect not only on rupture zone fabric but also on the evolution of fault zone architecture in this transtensional setting.\nRupture zones in undeformed alluvium are dominated by secondary fractures associated with fault-tip propagation, and arrays of fault scarps become wider and more complex with oblique slip compared to pure normal dip-slip or pure strike-slip. Field relations show that as magnitude of coseismic slip increases from 0 to 60 cm, the linkages between kinematically distinct fracture sets increases systematically to the point of forming a through going principal scarp, which is contrary to many analogue models (e.g., Tchalencko, 1970; Naylor et al., 1995) Our data indicate that secondary faults and penetrative off-fault strain continue to accommodate the oblique kinematics of coseismic slip after the formation of a through going principal scarp.",

            "abstract": "For processing land seismic data, the near-surface problem is often very complex and may severely affect our capability to image the subsurface. The current state-of-the-art technology for near surface imaging is the early arrival waveform inversion that solves an acoustic wave-equation problem. However, fitting land seismic data with acoustic wavefield is sometimes invalid. On the other hand, performing elastic waveform inversion is very time-consuming. Similar to a web search engine, we develop a full elastic waveform search engine that includes a large database with synthetic elastic waveforms accounting for a wide range of interval velocity models in the CMP domain. With each CMP gather of real data as an entry, the search engine applies Multiple-Randomized K-Dimensional (MRKD) tree method to find approximate best matches to the entry in about a second. Interpolation of the velocity models at CMP positions creates 2D or 3D Vp, Vs, and density models for the near surface area. The method does not just return one solution; it gives a series of best matches in a solution space. Therefore, the results can help us to examine the resolution and nonuniqueness of the final solution. Further, this full waveform search method can avoid the issues of initial model and cycle skipping that the method of full waveform inversion is difficult to deal with.",

            "abstract": "Numerous life cycle assessment (LCA) and field studies have estimated natural gas (NG) fugitive emissions rates (FER) – the fraction of produced NG, mostly CH4, emitted to the atmosphere, unintentionally or by design, during extraction, processing, transport, and distribution – at local, regional, and national scales. In a recent study, we estimated for the first time the global mean FER using long-term (three decades) atmospheric CH4, δ13C-CH4, and C2H6 measurements from global monitoring networks. As a further development, this work investigates the global mean FER uncertainty range (factor of 2) in more detail to increase confidence in the results. The objectives of this research are to (i) estimate probability distribution functions (PDF) of global mean FER, and (ii) identify long-term trends in global fossil fuel (FF) and other CH4 sources. In order to achieve these objectives, global atmospheric δ13C-CH4 measurements since the mid-1980s are analyzed using a box-model of the global CH4 sources and sinks. First, we derive PDFs of the key model parameters including literature isotopic source signatures, atmospheric lifetimes, natural and anthropogenic emissions, and FF hydrocarbon gas composition. Second, a Monte Carlo simulation of the box-model is performed to quantify FER confidence intervals. While our model attributes the majority of increased CH4 levels over the past three decades to microbial sources, FF sources have also increased slightly. However, FER – an indicator of NG life cycle efficiency – has decreased over the same period given the large NG production increase worldwide. Results are most sensitive to global average microbial isotopic signatures (weighted by source strength) and bottom-up estimates of biomass burning emissions, which will be discussed in more detail.",

            "abstract": "Radio frequency heating of the ionosphere produces local plasma heating and the resulting pressure gradient leads to plasma currents. Modulated heating excites waves at the modulation frequency which propagate away from the heating region. The wave generation modulated heating of the F-region ionosphere is modeled using a numerical code with the conducting ground as the lower boundary and the magnetosphere as the top boundary. The diamagnetic current due to the pressure gradient resulting from the localized RF heating oscillates at the modulation frequency and excites hydromagnetic waves, mostly the magnetosonic mode. As these waves propagate away from the heated region in the F-region it encounters regions of different conductivity, driving an oscillating Hall current in the E-region where Hall conductivity is dominant. These currents produce shear Alfven waves propagating along the field lines. Simulations with modulation frequencies in the range 2 – 10 Hz in the high- and mid-latitude ionosphere show their dependence on the ionospheric conductivity, modulation frequency and size of the heated region. In the high-latitudes the wave propagation is simulated using an essentially vertical magnetic field. For the mid-latitudes a dipole magnetic field in polar coordinates is used. With a source at L = 1.6 and altitude of 300 km the EMIC and whistler waves are generated, and field-aligned waves propagate to the conjugate region. In the case of modulation at 10 Hz the EMIC waves encounter the resonance layer, while the whistler waves propagate along the field lines to the conjugate region. These simulations correspond to the ionospheric heating by the Arecibo facility.",

This study investigated the simulated changes in AAO during 850AD to 2100AD using fully coupled climate models participating in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The output from 11 models with specific historical anthropocentric and natural forcing during 850-1850AD (last millennium run) and 43 models during 1850-2005 (historical runs), as well as 40 models with 21st century changes in greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols following the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5) for 2006-2100 are analyzed. Those models were classified into ‘good’ and ‘poor’ models based on their performance in simulating the observed AAO spatial pattern, interannual variability and trend. The AAO during 850-1850AD show considerable interannual variations. However, there are no noticeable decadal and centennial variations during this periods regardless of the models are good or poor. These results are inconsistent with the proxy-based AAO reconstructions and suggested that the models may underestimate the natural forcing during the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The multiple-model ensemble (MME) shows similar AAO variations as the reanalysis data during 1850-2005. The seasonal AAO has being steadily increasing before 1960s followed by abrupt increasing during 1970-2005. The increasing of AAO is projected to continue during the 21st century. Under RCP4.5 scenario, the AAO will be weakly but steadily increasing until 2050s and then leveled off or slightly decreasing in the second half of this century. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the AAO will continue to increase in the 21st century. Though the MME of the poor and good models show similar seasonal AAO variations during 1850-2005, the poor models projected much stronger AAO in the future under both scenarios compared to good models.",

            "abstract": "Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) calls for students across grade levels to understand climate change and its impacts. To achieve this goal, the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC program paired an educator with scientists studying carbon cycling in the Arctic. The data collection and fieldwork performed by the team will form the basis of hands-on science learning in the classroom and will be incorporated into informal outreach sessions in the community.\nOver a 16-day period, the educator was stationed at Toolik Field Station in the High Arctic. (Toolik is run by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Institute of Arctic Biology.) She participated in a project that analyzed the effects of sunlight and microbial content on carbon production in Artic watersheds. Data collected will be used to introduce the following NGSS standards into the middle-school science curriculum: 1) Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence.\n2) Develop a model to explain cycling of water. 3) Develop and use a model to describe phenomena. 4) Analyze and interpret data. 5) A change in one system causes and effect in other systems. Lessons can be telescoped to meet the needs of classrooms in higher or lower grades. Through these activities, students will learn strategies to model an aspect of carbon cycling, interpret authentic scientific data collected in the field, and conduct geoscience research on carbon cycling.\nCommunity outreach sessions are also an effective method to introduce and discuss the importance of geoscience education. Informal discussions of firsthand experience gained during fieldwork can help communicate to a lay audience the biological, physical, and chemical aspects of the arctic carbon cycle and the impacts of climate change on these features. Outreach methods will also include novel use of online tools to directly connect audiences with scientists in an effective and time-efficient manner.",

Higher priority users are less likely to face shortage due to the demands of other users, but may be limited by reduced availability of water. An integrated set of water right allocation models was developed to determine optimal allocation of shortage for riparian and appropriative water right holders, which also allows for including required flows for the environment and public health and safety, and operational reliability for senior water right-holders. Riparian water right holders have equal priority, with water shortage allocated as an equal proportion of normal diversions for all riparian users within each sub-basin. These proportions are determined by water availability, with downstream users likely to receive higher proportions due to downstream accumulations of streamflow. Appropriative users as a class have a lower priority than riparian users. Shortages allocated among appropriative water right holders are made strictly by water right seniority.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of groundwater discharge to streams can alter stream water chemistry, thereby affecting riverine ecosystems and surface water quality. Point groundwater discharge to streams can be measured using a variety of techniques; however, integrating point and diffuse discharge is difficult over large stream reaches. We applied an automated radon-in-water technique for continuous measurements of 222Rn activities along a 5 km length of the spring-fed Ichetucknee River in north-central Florida. Integration of longitudinal 222Rn distribution, measured on three separate occasions, with groundwater and spring water end members in a mass balance equation allowed temporal and spatial assessment of groundwater flow to the stream. The 222Rn activities indicate groundwater fluxes are higher in the upper reach of the river, which has a narrow flood plain, than in the lower reach, with a wide flood plain. A wide flood plain enhances evapotranspiration, which may cause the observed difference in groundwater seepage. Groundwater flow to the upper reach increases following rain events as diffuse recharge within the catchment increases hydraulic gradients toward the river. Groundwater recharge to the lower reach is smaller and less variable than the upper reach regardless of the river flow. The lower reach can back flood when the Santa Fe River, the receiving stream, floods because of the low gradient of the Ichetucknee River (<2 m/km). Back flooding reduces flow, increases water level and inundates the floodplain, reducing the hydraulic head gradient and groundwater inflow. Based on the 222Rn mass balance, cumulative groundwater inflow is estimated to be 2.5 ± 1 m3/s (±SD) during low flow and 3.2 ± 1.5 m3/s during high flow. The estimated ground water inflows to the Ichetucknee River from the 222Rn mass balance are about twice the estimates of 1.2 m3/s and 1.5 m3/s obtained from dye tracer and ionic chemical tracer methods, respectively. The estimated higher fluxes from 222Rn method than the other techniques could reflect an additional input of 222Rn to the stream, possibly through the hyporheic exchange. The 222Rn mass balance technique appears useful for distinguishing relative amounts of groundwater and hyporheic inflow when combined with the other techniques.",

Census of a 35 ha plot on Prospect Hill was completed during the winter of 2014 by researchers at Harvard Forest. Census data were collected according to CTFS protocol; measured variables included species, stem diameter, and relative X-Y locations. Airborne lidar data were collected over the censused plot using the high spatial resolution Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal sensor package (G-LiHT) during June 2012. As part of a separate study, 39 variable radius plots (VRPs) were randomly located and sampled within and throughout the Prospect Hill CTFS/ForestGEO plot during September and October 2013. On VRPs, biometric properties of trees were sampled, including species, stem diameter, total height, crown base height, crown radii, and relative location to plot centers using a 20 Basal Area Factor prism. In addition, a terrestrial-based lidar scanner was used to collect one lidar scan at plot center for 38 of the 39 VRPs.\nLeveraging allometric equations of crown geometry and tree height developed from 374 trees and 16 different species sampled on 39 VRPs, a 3-dimensional stem map will be created using the Harvard Forest ForestGEO Prospect Hill census. Vertical and horizontal structure of 3d field-based stem maps will be compared to terrestrial and airborne lidar scan data. Furthermore, to assess the quality of allometric equations, a 2d canopy height raster of the field-based stem map will be compared to a G-LiHT derived canopy height model for the 35 ha census plot. Our automated crown delineation methods will be applied to the 2d representation of the census stem map and the G-LiHT canopy height model. For future work related to this study, high quality field-based stem maps with species and crown geometry information will allow for better comparisons and interpretations of individual tree spectra from the G-LiHT hyperspectral sensor as estimated by automated crown delineation of the G-LiHT lidar canopy height model.",

At the same time, many of these urban centers are expanding rapidly, giving rise to the phenomenon of megacities. In recent decades air pollution has become not only one of the most important environmental problems of megacities, but also presents serious consequences to human health and ecosystems and economic costs to society. Although the progress to date in combating air pollution problems in developed and some developing world megacities has been impressive, many challenges remain including the need to improve air quality while simultaneously mitigating climate change.\nThis talk will present the results and the lessons learned from field measurements conducted in Mexico City Metropolitan Area – one of the world’s largest megacities – over the past decade. While each city has its own unique circumstances, the need for an integrated assessment approach in addressing complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy in solving air pollution problems in megacities; a mix of policy measures based on sound scientific findings will be necessary to improve air quality, protect public health, and mitigate climate change.",

            "abstract": "In-situ pH is among the key factors affecting chemical reactions involved with fluid-rock interaction and metal transport in hydrothermal systems. A small variation in pH will often result in a large difference in dissolved metal concentrations. For instance, at 400oC, a decrease of ~0.15 pH unit will cause dissolved Fe concentration to double in fluid coexisting with a Fe-bearing mineral assemblage. This parameter also offers us an opportunity to better understand processes controlling the temporal evolution of hydrothermal vent fluid chemistry at mid-ocean ridges. During our recent cruise AT 26-17 with newly upgraded DSV2 Alvin, in-situ measurements of pH were carried out along with gas-tight sampling of vent fluids. Our efforts were focused at MEF and ASHES on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. These hydrothermal systems have been shown to be particularly responsive to subseafloor seismic and magmatic events. The measured fluid temperature was approximately 333˚C and 300˚C at Dante vent orifice of MEF and Inferno vent orifice of ASHES, respectively. The corresponding measured in-situ pH values for both vents are: 4.94 and 4.88, respectively. Dissolved gases and other species were also measured from gas-tight fluid samples providing a means of comparison with the in-situ data.\nAs we have known the earthquake and magmatic activity often places the system at higher temperature and more reducing conditions in connection with a new evolutionary cycle. Comparing these relatively low in-situ pH values with those measured in the past, especially with the ones obtained at MEF in 1999 after an intense swarm of earthquakes, we see the system trending towards more acidic conditions along with decreasing temperature and dissolved H2 and H2S. Taking an example from Dante vent site, in-situ pH value of 5.15 was recorded with a measured temperature of 363oC two month after the event in 1999, which gives 0.2 pH unit greater than the more recent data. Measured dissolved H2 and H2S concentrations in 1999 were also much higher. Altogether these results reveal an ongoing trend toward more oxidizing and acidic stage along with cooling.\nMore results will be discussed in this presentation with the emphasis on the factors that may have played the role in acidifying the system during the evolution cycle and its effect to metal mobility.",

Although high electrical conductivities (~10 Ωm below 6 m depth) were expected to result in weak electrical fields, we were encouraged by the availability of an IVI Minivib 1 vibroseis source, and by the presence of interfacial targets including the top of bedrock at ~23 m depth as well as porosity and textural changes within the overburden revealed by geotechnical logs.\nSeismic and seismoelectric shot records were acquired separately using both the MiniVib and an in-hole shotgun source. The recording system included 26 grounded dipoles, 4.5 m in length, all equipped with custom-made differential amplifiers. Harmonic subtraction, remote reference subtraction, and stacking of shot records were used to combat electrical noise levels associated with unstable powerline harmonics and apparent AM radio demodulation. Seismic and seismoelectric shot records bear a striking resemblance to each other; direct and refracted P-waves as well as P, S, and PS wave reflections all appear clearly in the seismoelectric records. At first glance, these would appear to be simply co-seismic seismoelectric effects. However, closer inspection reveals that some precede their corresponding seismic arrivals by several milliseconds, and exhibit broader bandwidths (up to 600 Hz) and better coherency. They are inferred to have been generated beneath each dipole receiver by upward travelling P and S-waves arriving at an interface, defined by contrasts in porosity and clay content, 7 m below the surface. These arrivals do not conform to either true co-seismic or true interfacial effects and therefore present a new challenge to our understanding of seismoelectric phenomena.",

            "abstract": "We present a new N budget for the Earth based on extensive literature review and compilation. The Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) contains 11.6±6.7×1018 kg N, which is 2.9±1.7 times the present atmospheric mass of N (PAN). The continental crust (2.3±0.1×1018 kg N, 0.5 PAN) and the mantle (9.3±6.3×1018 kg N, 2.3 PAN) are significant N reservoirs.\nIn addition, the transition zone and lower mantle may sequester a much greater mass of N, due to the presence of Fe-metal, but the absence of samples precludes any robust estimates. We use the N content of lunar basalts to estimate the N content of the BSE after core segregation to be between 25±1×1018 to 118±4×1018 kg. Based on experimental results and comparison with iron meteorites, we suggest that the core itself is likely a major reservoir of N. Estimates for the N content of the core are 240±40×1018 to 420±40×1018 kg N. Our work supports the notion that N retention in the core could help explain the \"missing\" N dilemma. Assuming a chondritic source for the accretion of Earth and 10% N retention during accretion gives a closed, self-consistent budget.\nDetermining the current distribution of N on Earth is important, since many aspects of its long-term cycling between the surface and deeper Earth remain unresolved.\nSurface N has clearly been subducted and cycled through the mantle, as revealed by correlation between N2 and 40Ar in mid-ocean ridge basalts. In contrast, N2 does not correlate with primordial 36Ar, strengthening the case for a surficial origin. The timing, rate, and magnitude of N movement to the deeper Earth is somewhat constrained for modern subduction zones, but fluxes in the past and the amount of N retained in the mantle in are more enigmatic.\nN sequestration into the solid Earth has a direct impact on atmospheric evolution. It is possible that the atmosphere during the Archean contained up to 2-3x the present mass of N, though other evidence suggests the N content has been constant since that time. Any attempt to verify these states with a model would be greatly enhanced if a starting N content of the Earth could be obtained, which we have attempted to undertake herein.",

            "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of clouds within the troposphere contributes to modulate the radiative balance of the earth-atmosphere system. Depending on their cloud phase, clouds may have different microphysical and macrophysical properties, and hence, different radiative effects.\nIn this study, we took advantage of climate runs from the GASS-YoTC and AMIP multi-model experiments to document the differences associated to the cloud phase parameterizations of 16 GCMs. A particular emphasize has been put on the vertical structure of the transition between liquid and ice in clouds. A way to intercompare the models regardless of their cloud fraction is to study the ratio of the ice mass to the total mass of the condensed water. To address the challenge of evaluating the modeled cloud phase, we profited from the cloud phase climatology so called CALIPSO-GOCCP, which separates liquid clouds from ice clouds at global scale, with a high vertical resolution (480m), above all surfaces.\nWe also used reanalysis data and GPCP satellite observations to investigate the influence of the temperature, the relative humidity, the vertical wind speed and the precipitations on the cloud phase transition. In 12 (of 16) models, there are too few super cooled liquid in clouds compared to observations, mostly in the high troposphere. We exhibited evidences of the link between the cloud phase transition and the humidity, the vertical wind speed as well as the precipitations. Some cloud phase schemes are more affected by the humidity and the vertical velocity and some other by the precipitations.\nAlthough a few models can reproduce the observe relation between cloud phase and temperature, humidity, vertical velocity or precipitations, none of them perform well for all the parameters.\nAn important result of this study is that the T-dependent phase parameterizations do not allow simulating the complexity of the observed cloud phase transition. Unfortunately, more complex microphysics schemes do not succeed to reproduce all the processes neither. Finally, thanks to the combined use of CALIPSO-GOCCP and ECMWF water vapor pressure, we showed an updated version of the Clausius-Clapeyron water vapor phase diagram. This diagram represents a new tool to improve the simulation of the cloud phase transition in climate models.",

            "abstract": "The International GNSS Service (IGS) has been providing high accuracy GNSS orbits, clocks and Earth Rotation Parameters (ERP) in three different time intervals. The quality of the IGS core products are regularly monitored since 2010, and the level of accuracies has not been changed noticeably. The Final and Rapid orbit's accuracies are known to be about ~2.5 cm and the near-real time (observed) Ultra-rapid orbit is about 3 cm. The real-time orbits obtained by propagating the Ultra-rapid orbits shows an accuracy of about 5 cm. The most significant error source of the real-time orbit is the sub-daily variation of the Earth orientation. Number of IGS08 core sites has been decreasing with the rate of ~0.13 stations per week due to equipment changes and natural disasters such as Earthquakes. This paper summarizes the quality state of the IGS core products for 2014, and the upcoming new official product IGV, Glonass Ultra-rapid orbit product which have been experimental for last 4 years. Eight IGS Analysis Centers (ACs) have completed their efforts to participate in the second reprocessing campaign (repro2). Based on their input, this paper summarizes the models and methodologies each AC have adopted for this campaign.",

In this study, we compare a state-of-the art ice flow model, the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), to GRACE mascon solutions over the Greenland ice sheet at large spatial scales (~300 km), and monthly temporal resolution. With the use of established ISSM capabilities, we investigate how errors and variations in surface mass balance (SMB) forcing propagate through the model resulting in uncertainties in ice discharge. We identify which SMB components contribute the most to model uncertainty, as well as quantify leakage errors due to land/ocean boundaries in the GRACE solution. Additional errors sourced in the ISSM spinup (e.g. errors in bedrock, lack of physics) are identified. Rigorous uncertainty quantification of the surface mass balance models, GRACE solutions, and the ISSM ice flow model is performed via comparison of average trends and estimated seasonal amplitudes.",

            "abstract": "Lowland rivers in broad alluvial floodplains create one of the most dynamic landscapes, governed by multiple, and commonly nonlinear, interactions among geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecologic processes. Fluvial landforms and land-cover patches composing the floodplains of lowland rivers vary in their shapes and sizes because of variations in vegetation biomass, topography, and soil composition (e.g., of abandoned meanders versus accreting bars) across space. Such floodplain heterogeneity, in turn, influences future river-channel evolution by creating variability in channel-migration rates. In this study, using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data and alternative image-classification approaches, we investigate geomorphic and vegetation spatial patterns in a dynamic large tropical river. Specifically, we examine the spatial relations between river-channel planform and fluvial-landform and land-cover patterns across the floodplain. We classify the images using both hard and soft classification algorithms. We characterize the structure of geomorphic landform and vegetation components of the floodplain by computing a range of class-level landscape metrics based on the classified images. Results indicate that comparable classification accuracies are accrued for the inherently hard and (hardened) soft classification images, ranging from 89.8% to 91.8% overall accuracy. However, soft classification images provide unique information regarding spatially-varying similarities and differences in water-column properties of oxbow lakes and the main river channel. Proximity analyses, where buffer zones along the river with distances corresponding to 5, 10, and 20 river-channel widths are constructed, reveal that the average size of forest patches first increase away from the river banks but they become sparse after a distance of 10 channel widths away from the river.",

            "abstract": "Combining garnet geochronology with thermodynamic analysis permits construction of the P-T history of subducted lithologies. This may record the thermal state of the slab, which is controlled in part by mantle T, convergence rate, slab age and dip. These parameters are also primary inputs into subduction zone geodynamical models. Here, an integrated geochronologic and thermodynamic analysis seeks to both determine the P-T evolution of subducted lithologies from Sifnos, Greece, and compare aspects of this evolution to results of geodynamic subduction models. High precision Sm-Nd garnet geochronology on several lithologies elucidated a metamorphic history involving slow initiation of garnet growth at 53.4 ± 2.6Ma, followed by a period of rapid growth between 46.95 ± 0.61Ma and 44.96 ± 0.53Ma. Individual samples exhibit entire porphyroblast growth durations spanning just hundreds of thousands of years. This chronology is coupled with phase equilibria modeling of several lithologies, constraining a minimum heating rate during garnet growth close to peak P. The pulse of growth described above coincides with a period of near isobaric heating, at a rate of >75°C/Myr, terminating at the peak P and T estimated for Sifnos (~2.2 GPa and 560°C; [1]). This heating rate initially seems high, so a comparison has been made with results from 2D thermal models that represent the global range of active subduction zones [2]. In each model, the P-T paths derived for the top of the slab experience a region of relatively isobaric heating, consistent with that determined for Sifnos. A common feature in each case is the existence of a sharp thermal gradient, separating a colder fore-arc from a warmer regime dominated by viscous flow of the mantle wedge. For appropriate convergence rates, this sharp thermal gradient is traversed at similar rates to that derived above for Sifnos. We infer that peak metamorphism (and the early stages of exhumation) on Sifnos may have occurred along this transition in thermal regime, with resultant pulsed metamorphism stemming from these elevated heating rates. We explore petrologic features such as the kinetics of garnet nucleation/growth under such rapid heating at high pressure.\n[1] Dragovic et al., 2012. Chem.

            "abstract": "Aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS) and Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors (ACSM) commercialized by Aerodyne Research Inc. are used widely to measure mass concentrations and size distributions of non-refractory species in submicron particles. With the “standard” vaporizer that is installed in all commercial instruments to date, the quantification of ambient aerosol mass requires the use of collection efficiency (CE) for correcting the loss of particles due to bounce on the vaporizer. However, CE depends on aerosol phase, and thus can vary with location, airmass, and season, and typically contributes the most uncertainty to quantification. To address this limitation, a new “capture” vaporizer has been designed to reduce or eliminate particle bounce and thus the CE correction.\nTo test the performance of the capture vaporizer, two AMS, one with the standard vaporizer and one with the capture vaporizer were operated side by side in the lab and field during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) campaign in Alabama, 2013. Scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) size distribution measurements were made in parallel. Good agreement was observed between the time series of mass concentration of the main species between the capture (without use of CE) and standard vaporizers (with the composition-dependent CE correction), verifying that CE~1 in the capture vaporizer. However, compared to the standard vaporizer, fragmentation of organic and inorganic species was shifted to smaller fragments on the capture vaporizer, suggesting additional thermal decomposition arising from the increased residence time and surface collisions of molecules in the vaporize and also consistent with the observed longer particle vaporization times which lead to artificially broadened particle size distribution measurements. The impact of the size distribution broadening is significant for lab studies using monodisperse particles, but limited in field studies since ambient distributions are typically quite broad. The influence of vaporizer temperature on the shape of the size distributions was also investigated. Relative ionization efficiencies were recalibrated in the capture vaporizer. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was performed on both data sets to compare the results of this source apportionment technique.",

Although soil moisture availability to trees is largely dependent on climate, the depth and texture of soil exerts a key secondary influence. Multiple Pleistocene glacial events have shaped the landscape of the central Rocky Mountains creating a patchwork of soils differing in age and textural classification. This mosaic of soil conditions impacts hydrological properties, and montane conifer forests potentially respond to climate variability quite differently depending on the age of glacial till and soil development. We hypothesized that the age of glacial till and associated soil textural changes exert strong control on growth and photosynthetic gas exchange of lodgepole pine.\nWe examined physiological and growth responses of lodgepole pine to interannual variation in maximum annual snow water equivalence (SWEmax) of montane snowpack and growing season air temperature (Tair) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) across a chronosequence of Pleistocene glacial tills ranging in age from 700k to 12k years. Soil textural differences across the glacial tills illustrate the varying degrees of weathering with the most well developed soils with highest clay content on the oldest till surfaces. We show that sensitivity of growth and carbon isotope discrimination, an integrated measure of canopy gas exchange properties, to interannual variation SWEmax , Tair and VPD is greatest on young till surfaces, whereas trees on old glacial tills with well-developed soils are mostly insensitive to these interannual climate fluctuations. Tree-ring widths were most sensitive to changes in SWEmax on young glacial tills (p < 0.01), and less sensitive on the oldest till (p < 0.05). Tair correlates strongly with δ13C values on the oldest and youngest tills sites, but shows no significant relationship on the middle aged glacial till. It is clear that growth and photosynthetic gas exchange parameters are sensitive to glacial till surfaces, which is evident by the different responses to SWEmax and Tair across sites.",

Our sample of red clay was about 5 cubic cm in size. After wet-sieving for the size fraction greater than 38 microns, we hand-picked grains of interest under a binocular microscope. We found 40 microtektites (glass spherules, mostly devitrified), 12 olive-green aggregates composed of talc/magnetite, and 3 green and blue crystals of silicon carbide (SiC). There are many quartz grains having decorated deformation lamellae or mosaic structures.\nThe olive-green talc/magnetite particles have textures and composition similar to materials found in chondritic meteorites, whereas, SiC crystals are known to occur in carbonaceous chondrites. These particles seem to implicate an affinity to meteorites. Ir-rich deposits world-wide are believed to have settled from dust produced by the Chicxulub Impact, but what object from space created the impact crater is rather uncertain. Our results reported here cannot rule out the possiblilty of impact by comets, because the nature of cometary dust particles are not very well known.",

            "abstract": "Developing a better understanding of the controls on biomass allocation in forested systems and the consequences for carbon stocks and fluxes is required for improved ecosystem and climate modeling. A simple model, based largely on resource distribution networks, was presented by West, Brown and Enquist (1999). Their model predicts that the exponents of allometric relationships between many forest structural and functional properties will be constants, irrespective of environment or species. In this research we assess the validity of model predictions across the United States and examine their independence with respect to environment. We focus on two relationships with particular importance to biomass:\nHt ∝ DBH2/3\nnDBH ∝ DBH-2\nwhere Ht is height, DBH is Diameter at Breast Height, and nDBH is the number of trees in a given DBH size class.\nWe obtained DBH and height data from the U.S. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) dataset, and fit an exponent to each relationship for every FIA plot across the US. We extracted environmental data from the FIA plots (forest maximum height, species type, age, topography) and the North American Regional Reassessment dataset (precipitation, temperature, PAR) and performed random forest regression to estimate observed exponents as a function of environment. We found that forest height, age, and forest type were the most important drivers of allometry, explaining about 40% of observed variability. We found that for both relationships, as forest height and age increase, exponents constrain to the theoretical predictions presented by WBE. This suggests that WBE predictions are valid and may be useful constraints in biomass mapping and ecosystem flux models. However, they deviate from predictions in younger, shorter stands where forests have not had time to develop a complex size structure. Additionally, there is a significant difference in both relationships between conifer and deciduous-dominated stands, suggesting that species type must be considered in the further development and application of this work.",

            "abstract": "The Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) on the central Alpine Fault, South Island, New Zealand, has motivated a broad range of geophysical and geological studies aiming to characterize the fault system in the locality of the drill site at various scales. We have been developing three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity models of the region by double-difference tomography utilizing datasets from multiple seismic networks (WIZARD, SAMBA, ALFA, GeoNet, and others). In our previous work, the quality of the S-wave model has been poor due to the small number of available S-wave picks. We have utilized a new high-accuracy automatic S-wave picker to increase the number of usable S arrivals by an order of magnitude, thereby dramatically improving the S-wave velocity model. Compared to previous studies, e.g. Eberhart-Phillips and Bannister (2002) and Feenstra et al (2013), our updated P-wave model shows a clear high Vp body (Vp > 6km/s) at depths of 5–15 km near the drill site. With our better resolved S-wave velocity model, we can see a sharp high Vs body (Vs > 3.7 km/s) in the same region. The newly added S-picks help to improve the accuracy of the relocations of the earthquakes . This in turn has highlighted the presence of earthquake swarms within the low velocity zone. Together with the updated earthquake relocations, the P- and S-wave tomography results reveal the Alpine Fault to be marked by a velocity contrast throughout most of the study region. The fault dips steeply from 5 to 20 km depth with an average dip of 50-60° SE, as inferred from the velocity structure and the seismicity.",

Geol., 2013; Liu et al., IJGGC, 2013; Tao and Clarens, ES&T, 2013] have suggested the possibility of geological CO2 sequestration in depleted shale gas formations, motivated by large storage capacity estimates in these formations. The kinetics and practicality of injecting large amounts of CO2 into shale gas wells at the appropriate scale remain as open questions. To further investigate the feasibility of CO2 sequestration, models of gas flow and storage in a horizontal shale gas well were developed based on observed behavior of gas production data and the associated models that are consistent with those observations [Patzek et al., PNAS, 2013]. Both analytical and numerical models were used to investigate the well-scale kinetics of CO2 injection into a typical shale gas well. It was found that relatively low rates could be injected into individual wells compared with CO2 emissions from large industrial sources, and that injection rates would rapidly decline with time. Based on typical well parameters, 170 wells would be required to inject the emissions from one large coal-fired power plant over a 15 year period. Significant practical and logistical challenges to industrial-scale CO2 sequestration in depleted shale gas formations arise due to the relatively low injection rates, low storage capacity of individual wells and large numbers of wells required. These challenges include the difficulty of managing the required large, ever-changing networks of injection wells, potentially prohibitive energy requirements, and leakage concerns in hydraulically fractured wells. The combination of these factors, and the fact that they are all likely less of an issue for other potential geological sequestration targets such as deep saline aquifers, mean that targets in conventional formations are more likely to be suitable for industrial-scale CO2 sequestration.",

This is a significant reduction in the time interval required for real-time transmission compared to data delivery algorithms available in digitizers currently used in other Earthquake Early Warning networks.\nBoth acceleration and displacement data are recorded and transmitted to the processing site in a specially developed Multiplexed Recording Format (MRF) that minimizes the bandwidth required for real-time data transmission. In addition, a built in algorithm calculates the τc and Pd once the event is declared. The SG160-09 System keeps track of what data has not been acknowledged and re-transmits the data giving priority to current data.\nModified REF TEK Protocol Daemon (RTPD) receives the digital data and acknowledges data received without error. It forwards this “good” data to processing clients of various real-time data processing software including Earthworm and SeisComP3. The processing clients cache packets when a data gap occurs due to a dropped packet or network outage. The cache packet time is settable, but should not exceed 0.5 sec in the Earthquake Early Warning network configuration.\nThe rapid data transmission algorithm was tested with different communication media, including Internet, DSL, Wi-Fi, GPRS, etc. The test results show that the data latency via most communication media do not exceed 0.5 sec nominal from a first sample in the data packet.\nDetailed acquisition algorithm and results of data transmission via different communication media are presented.",

            "abstract": "Sulfates may constrain the salinity and acidity of martian paleo-fluids, with consequent impact on the planet’s habitability. However, information about sulfate mineralogy, subsurface abundance, and hydration remains unclear owing to shallow sampling and limited ability of infrared spectroscopy to distinguish among some sulfates. We address this with H2O and S chemical maps, derived from the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) spectra, sampling at regional scales and decimeter depths[1]. Resulting chemical constraints apply primarily to bulk soil, which dominates at such spatial scales.\nWe assess trends in the association of H2O and S, with bivariate correlations(r) across 10° wide latitudinal bands, corresponding molar ratios H2O:S denoted as hydration state, and hydration states across compositional extremes. We characterize the hydration state distribution with kernel density estimated frequency histograms (KDE). Twenty seven sulfate minerals confirmed or suggested on Mars, from in situ, orbital, and analog observations, provide 13 reference hydration states.\nBivariate correlations across latitudinal bands show consistency with hemispheric results. The strengths of correlations are similar at extreme north and south latitudes, with r values of 0.2 at ±55° centered latitudinal bands. However, most southern latitudinal bands manifest r values no less than 0.60, while northern bands remain below 0.60. Accordingly, at the coarsest hemispheric scale and the finest latitudinal scale, H2O may associate with S in bulk soil of the southern hemisphere. Regions of compositional extremes show that H2O concentration, not S, affects the degree of sulfate hydration. Variable soil thickness, ground ice table depths[2], atmospheric processes[3], and insolation may contribute hemispheric differences in the progression of hydration with latitude. KDE results suggest Fe-sulfates as a possibly key hydrous mineral group[4]. This encourages further modeling of Fe-sulfate distribution and deliquescence, potentially derived from local hydrothermalism[5], at regional scales.\n",

            "abstract": "The Space-Atmosphere Interaction Region (SAIR), encompassing the mesosphere, thermosphere and ionosphere, is an intersection between geospace and the Earth’s atmosphere, and is exposed to vacillating conditions of both space and terrestrial weather. Recent observational and modeling studies have revealed clear reaches of terrestrial weather far beyond the mesosphere lower-thermosphere region into the topside ionosphere. At the same time, the region lends itself to forcing originating from the Sun and solar-wind magnetosphere interactions. The predictability of the SAIR is a fundamental question in Heliophysics, and calls for a paradigm shift from a deterministic to a probabilistic modeling framework. To meet with this contemporary modeling and simulation challenge, we will systematically compare and combine ensemble simulations of a comprehensive whole atmosphere model, coupled with an ionosphere and plasmasphere model called the Integrated Dynamics in Earth’s Atmosphere (IDEA) with global Earth and geospace observations. Building on the National Weather Service's operational ensemble forecasting and data assimilation systems as well as our earlier efforts, we will construct an ensemble forecasting and data assimilation system that will ultimately be capable of assimilating observations from the ground to SAIR. We will present the project overview along with some initial results from our new interdisciplinary initiatives.",

The Water Strategy outlines water-related issues and opportunities that fit within the general GEOSS framework that will be developed over the next decade (2016-2025). Implementation of a water strategy within the GEOSS framework can be complex because GEO Members and Participating Organizations contribute to GEO on a voluntary basis. In spite of these limitations efforts to consolidate an implementation plan have made significant advances during the past nine months.\nProgress towards the final GEOSS Water Strategy Implementation Plan will be reported and gaps in the plan will be identified. Specific responses to the strategy will address the need for user engagement, the development of integrated of data products, model hierarchies and user support systems, and the research that will be needed to expand the capabilities of GEOSS and its water services. One challenge for the implementation plan involves building a framework from the diverse and wide range of activities and opportunities presented by GEO Members and Participating Organizations. The priority themes within the GEO Water Strategy are being used to provide more focus for new initiatives. New activities related to these priority areas involving projects that link water and other GEO Societal Benefit Areas, as well as initiatives related to the Water-Energy-Food nexus and the Sustainable Development Goals will be described. The presentation will also explore the needs and opportunities for new satellites and other observational and information technologies to advance the implementation of the GEOSS water strategy objectives.",

            "abstract": "Seismic data from earthquakes originating in the Fiji-Tonga region exhibit waveform complexity which appears to be caused by anomalous structure at the core-mantle boundary. The data, recorded by the dense USArray network, exhibits variation in multipathing, that is, the presence of secondary arrivals (called the S* phase) following the S phase at diffracted distances (Sd). The amplitude of S* is usually smaller than Sd and is lagged up to 10 seconds with distinct patterns. Here, we examine these patterns with a multipathing detector to establish characteristic length scales and the relationships of amplitudes with travel times. Generally, delayed Sd arrivals have lower amplitudes which are associated with delayed S* phases, indicative of 3D structures. Multipathing from neighboring earthquake events suggests that the waveform complexity is due to structures at the edge of the mid-Pacific LLSVP rather than isolated structures or plumes because of the presence of secondary arrivals at large distances. Using earth flattening transformations and 2D finite difference methods, numerical simulations of dome-like structures of low velocity material can produce such features. Preliminary results from a multipathing analysis of these models indicate that a variety of shapes, some as large as 6º in radius, along with a variety of velocity reductions, can produce the observed waveform complexity. Such shapes appear to be compatible with recently reported iron-rich oxide mixtures.",

            "abstract": "Reactions of OH with volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as CH4 and isoprene produce formaldehyde (CH2O). The concentration of OH and the chemistry of peroxy radicals, a reactive intermediate of VOC + OH reactions, depend strongly on the concentration of NOx. Here, we investigate the influence of NOx on the formation of CH2O in an isoprene-rich atmosphere (Martin Lake Power Plant, NE Texas) and in a “background” atmosphere (Navajo Power Plant, N Arizona) using conceptual models and the WRF-Chem regional chemistry-transport model alongside satellite-based (Aura-OMI) and flight-based (ARCTAS) measurements. In the conceptual model, the enhancement of CH2O in an NO2 plume is large and depends on the magnitude of the OH enhancement, the lifetime of the parent VOC, the concentration of intermediate oxidation products, and the impact of NOx on the branching ratios of peroxy radicals. Preliminary analysis of WRF-Chem results supports these findings. For a large point source of NOx in a low NOx-background, the enhancement of the CH2O concentration in the NOx plume is more than two times that of the surrounding region in both the isoprene-rich and the “background” WRF-Chem simulations. Furthermore, the spatial correlation of OH and CH2O in these simulated plumes suggests that simultaneous measurement of CH2O and NO2 offers the potential to better constrain the processes affecting the reaction of VOC with OH, and thus the factors controlling O3 production and the NOx lifetime. The precision of UV/Visible spectrometers planned for future geostationary missions, such as TEMPO, suggest that the routine measurement of these relationships will be possible.",

            "abstract": "The river terraces overlain by fluvial and debris-flow deposit are widely distributed in Taiwan due to its active tectonic situation. They are not only critical in reconstructing the river evolution, but also of importance in understanding neotectonics. However, the age estimation for the terraces has their own problems by C-14 as well as OSL (Optical Stimulated Luminescence) dating method. For C-14 method, the major problem is the difficulty in discovering the suitable samples, but for OSL method the zeroing effect of the sediments becomes the major barrier if quartz SAR (Single Aliquot Regenerative) procedure is applied. In order to test the residual dose from different drainage areas in Taiwan, modern deposits were collected from 13 main rivers and 3 samples for each from upper-stream to downstream. The apparent dose of modern fluvial deposit was defined as residual dose and believed to be able to give a hint for estimating the zeroing effect for river terraces. Quartz SAR OSL procedure on small aliquot was adopted for all samples in this study.\nOur results show the residual dose in western Taiwan strongly relies on the source from. If we further apply the mean value of smallest 5% on samples from modern debris flow deposits in upper-stream, the residual dose rise up as high as ~40Gy but lower down to ~15Gy for samples collected from river mouth estuary. It implies that there will be a large error when evaluating the age of debris deposit terrace by quartz SAR OSL procedure. However, if the modern river does not suffer from debris flow in upper-stream, the residual dose is ~5Gy in upper stream and only -0.7~2Gy to the lower steam estuary, which provide better chance to derive relatively reliable ages. We also find that the luminescence characteristics is different between the samples in western and eastern Taiwan respectively. The quartz grains from eastern Taiwan are much dimer than those of the western Taiwan. We may therefore face severe challenge to approach a reliable age for a river terrace located in eastern Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 January 20th M6.2 Eketahuna earthquake occurred in the subducted crust of the Pacific plate at the Hikurangi subduction zone, beneath North Island, New Zealand. Moment tensor analysis together with aftershock relocations show that this event was an oblique-normal faulting intraplate event, with hypocentre depth ca.30 km, and with rupture on a northwest-dipping fault extending through the subducted crust up to the subduction megathrust at ca.18-20 km depth. More than 3500 aftershocks were subsequently recorded by the New Zealand GeoNet network, with only minor migration of the aftershocks away from the inferred mainshock rupture, and with very few aftershocks within +/- 1 km of the subduction megathrust. The megathrust in this particular region is inferred to be interseismically locked with no seismic or aseismic slip, although slow slip is occurring ca.15-30 km down-dip (Wallace et al, 2013).\nSimilar oblique-normal faulting events have previously occurred along the Hikurangi subduction margin, including in 1985 (ML5.7) and 1990 (Mw6.2). Earlier earthquakes in 1942 (Mw6.8) and 1921 (Mw6.8) are also inferred to have occurred at a similar depth within the subducted crust. The 1990 earthquake sequence occurred ~40 km along-strike from the 2014 Eketahuna event, and involved a Mw6.2 oblique-normal faulting event in the subducted crust, which was quickly followed by a Mw6.4 event in the overlying crust, with both thrust and dextral strike-slip components, possibly responding to deeper aseismic slip.\nDeeper earthquakes of similar type at other subduction margins are thought to be high stress drop. We calculate the stress drops of the mainshock and larger aftershocks, using a direct wave, empirical Green’s function (EGF) approach that includes measurement uncertainties and objective criteria for assessing the quality of each spectral ratio (Abercrombie, 2013). We compare the results to those for earthquakes in other tectonic regions of New Zealand, calculated using the same method. We investigate whether there are any well-resolved differences in stress drop between these relatively deep earthquakes in the subducted plate and those in other tectonic environments.\nWallace, L.M., et al., AGU 2013 Fall meeting abstracts, 2013.\nAbercrombie, 2013, JGR v118, 2013.",

            "abstract": "We present an approach for understanding the origin and nature of seismic anomalies in the continental crust of the Northern Middle East. We have constructed detailed models of crustal attenuation and velocity structure for the Northern Middle East based on the analysis of waveforms of the regional seismic phases Lg and Pg from regional earthquakes recorded at more than 550 stations in Turkish and Iranian Plateaus and the surrounding regions. The attenuation and velocity models are assumed to serve as proxies for the bulk average effective crustal P-wave and S-wave attenuation (Qa and Qb) and velocities (Vp and Vs). About 30000 reliable spectra were collected for both Lg and Pg phases and used to measure the Two-Station Method (TSM) and Reverse Two-station/event Method (RTM) Lg and Pg Q at 1 Hz (QLg0 and QPg0) and their frequency dependence factor (η). The QLg0 and QPg0 and η values measured over the individual TSM and RTM paths are then used to perform an LSQR tomographic inversion for lateral variations in Q0 and η. We observe a strong correlation between the effective Q and velocity models. Our models show lateral variations that coincide with the major tectonic boundaries in the region. The tomographic models as well as the individual TSM and RTM measurements show lower values of QLg0 and QPg0 over the Turkish-Anatolian Plateau (QLg0<150 and QPg0<200) than those observed over the Iranian Plateau (150< QLg0<300 and 150< QPg0<400). Furthermore, we obtained the Lg and Pg group velocity models (VLg and VPg) by inverting the time of the first arrival of the Lg and Pg envelopes. Our QLg0 and QPg0 models are strongly correlated with the VLg and VPg models suggesting that the source of many of the low Q and velocity anomalies is likely the same. Our Q models have implication for any hazard assessment in different regions of the northern Middle-East and can also be used for the magnitude determination of the local and regional seismic events. A combined knowledge about the attenuation of Pg and Lg waves has also application in developing reliable seismic discriminants.",

            "abstract": "A large number of people around the globe depend on groundwater as a source of fresh water. Groundwater dependence will be further intensified by the world’s exponentially increasing population and climate change. Therefore, quantification of groundwater storage (GWS) changes is a critical issue in the densely populated regions of the world. Approximately, 90% of groundwater withdrawals are associated with irrigational activities in the Indian subcontinent. We used a combination of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations, hydrological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) together with groundwater level measurements and ERA-Interim precipitation, for the period 2003-2012 to estimate regional GWS changes and to regionally evaluate the anthropogenic and climatic forcing control on the observed changes. Rapid GWS depletion (>10 mm/year) has been observed in the northern and eastern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Most of the groundwater depleted regions coincide with the highly fertile alluvial aquifers of Ganges-Brahmaputra basin, which is subjected to intense groundwater withdrawals associated with crop irrigation. Our GWS change estimates are consistent with ground-based water level measurements (n> 13,000) from the region. Over this ten year period, GWS data show little to moderate replenishments in southern and western regions of Indian subcontinent, probably because of advanced water resource management in these areas. Precipitation is the key factor controlling the renewability of groundwater resources, however, precipitation during the period was generally near normal to historical levels, suggesting strong anthropogenic influence on GWS change in the northern and eastern parts of India during the study period.",

            "abstract": "The Black Carbon (BC) is designated by one of the potential factor for global warming (IPCC, 2007). Furthermore, carbon monoxide (CO) is also important gas to modify chemical, physical and climatological properties of tropospheric chemistry. Both CO and carbonaceous aerosol, especial to the black carbon, are similar emission sources, fuel combustion and biomass burning. Previously, the MODIS-OMI algorithm (MOA) identified the BC amount and its location by using Angstrom Exponent (AE) from MODIS and Aerosol Index (AI) from OMI. In addition, the CO amount has been traced by the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) since 1999. Therefore, the correlation between the AOD of BC (AODBC) and total column densities of CO (TCDCO) can be estimated by MOA and MOPITT. The correlation between AODBC and TCDCO becomes better than that between fine mode AOD and TCDCO in most global regions. Highly correlated case is the region with biomass burning and wild fires. In Southern Africa, however, the correlation coefficient between AODBC and TCDCO is lower than those between fine mode AOD and TCDCO. It is explained by the characteristics of wind fields, sources of aerosols, and distance from the source regions from the difference in the correlation. The results from correlation studies propose the possibilities that CO can be used as surrogates of BC and reference of the validation for the aerosol classification algorithm of BC from satellite measurements.",

            "abstract": "Scientists predict a number of climate changes for the US Midwest with expected declines in crop productivity as well as eco-hydrological impacts. More frequent extreme rain events particularly in the spring may well increase saturated soils thus complicating agronomic interests and also exacerbate watershed scale impairments (e.g., sediment, nutrient loss). In order to build more resilient production systems in light of climate change, farmers will increasingly need to implement conservation practices (singularly or more likely in combination) that enable farmers to manage profitable businesses yet mitigate consequential environmental impacts that have both in-field and off-farm implications. Cover crops are empirically known to promote many aspects of soil and water health yet even the most aggressive recent estimates show that only 1-2% of the total acreage in Iowa have been planted to cover crops.\nIn order to better understand why farmers are reluctant to adopt cover crops across Iowa we combined agronomic and financial data from long-term field trials, working farm trials and model simulations so as to present comprehensive data-driven information to farmers in focus group discussions in order to understand existing barriers, perceived benefits and responses to the information presented. Four focus groups (n=29) were conducted across Iowa in four geographic regions. Focus group discussions help explore the nuance of farmers’ responses to modeling outputs and their real-life agronomic realities, thus shedding light on the social and psychological barriers with cover crop utilization. Among the key insights gained, comprehensive data-driven research can influence farmer perspectives on potential cover crop impacts to cash crop yields, experienced costs are potentially quite variable, and having field/farm benefits articulated in economic terms are extremely important when farmers weigh the opportunity costs associated with adopting new practices. Our work represents multidisciplinary collaboration necessary to gain greater understanding of what it will take for farmers to cover the ground to prevent erosion and nutrient losses in the context of a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The angular distribution of solar wind superhalo electrons carries important information on the electron acceleration location and scattering in the interplanetary medium. Here we present a comprehensive study of the angular distribution of ~20–300 keV superhalo electrons measured at 1 AU by the WIND 3DP instrument during quiet-time periods from 1995 January through 2013 December. For quiet-time intervals, we re-bin the observed electron pitch angle distributions into the outward-traveling and inward-traveling bins, according the direction of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The inward-outward anisotropy of superhalo electrons at energy E is defined as A = 2(fout – fin)/(fout + fin), where fout (fin) is the average flux of outward-traveling (inward-traveling) electrons. We find that among all the ~640 quiet-time intervals, ~5% have an A > 0.1 (referred to as “outward events”), ~5% have an A < -0.1 (referred to as “inward events”), and ~90% have an |A| ≤ 0.1 (referred to as “isotropic events”). Isotropic events show no clear correlation with solar wind parameters (nSW, Vsw and Tp), IMF and solar wind turbulence spectrum. Inward and outward events also have no association with the IMF and nSW. But the occurrence ratio of outward (inward) events over all the events, α, roughly decreases (increases) with increasing VSW. Moreover, for outward (inward) events, α roughly increases with ρe/ρTp, where ρTp is the solar wind thermal proton gyroradius that is related to the separation between the turbulence inertial and dissipation ranges. These results suggest that quite-time superhalo electrons are generally isotropic due to the wave-particle interaction in the interplanetary medium; outward-traveling (inward-traveling) superhalo electrons may come from the acceleration occurring beyond (within) 1 AU, probably by CIRs or turbulence. We will also present a case study of several quiet-time electron events with the anisotropy A increasing with the electron energy E. ",

            "abstract": "Understanding the underlying causes of interannual variation in snowfall and extreme hydrologic events in the Sierra Nevada is hampered by short instrumental records and the difficulties in reconstructing climate using a traditional paleo-record such as tree-rings. New paleo proxies are needed to provide a record of snowpack water content and extreme precipitation events over millennial timescales which can be used to test hypotheses regarding teleconnections between Pacific climate variability and water supply and flood risk in California. In October 2013 we collected sediment cores from Pear Lake (z = 27 m), an alpine lake in Sequoia National Park. The cores were split and characterized by P-wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility and density scanning. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the Pear Lake cores contain a 13.5K yr record of lake sediment. In contrast to other Sierra Nevada lakes previously cored by our group, high-resolution scanning revealed alternating light-dark bands (~1 mm to 5 mm thick) for most of the Pear Lake core length. This pattern was interrupted at intervals by homogenous clasts (up to 75 mm thick) ranging in grain size from sand to gravel up to 1 cm diameter. We hypothesize that the light-dark banding results from the breakdown of persistent hypolimnetic anoxia during spring snowmelt and autumn overturn. We speculate that the thicknesses of the dark bands are controlled by the duration of anoxia which in turn is controlled by the volume and duration of snowmelt. The sand to gravel sized clasts are most likely associated with extreme precipitation events resulting from atmospheric rivers intersecting the southern Sierra Nevada. We hypothesize that centimeter-sized clasts are deposited in large avalanches and that the sands are deposited in large rain events outside of the snow-cover period.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause is the dominant process allowing energy entry from the solar wind into the magnetosphere especially during southward IMF periods. Before reaching the magnetopause, the solar wind plasma transits through a bow shock, which decelerates the plasma and changes the magnetic field magnitude and orientation, and thus the local reconnection geometry. Differences of the shock physics in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular side cause asymmetries in the magnetosheath plasma that impacts the coupling processes at the magnetopause. Fluctuations in the magnetic field or plasma density and velocity can also contribute to the efficiency of the energy transfer processes both during southward and northward IMF conditions. We use the OMNI measurements in the solar wind and ionosphere together with the THEMIS observations in the magnetosheath to study the effects of the magnetosheath processes and IMF and velocity fluctuations on the energy and plasma input into the magnetosphere. MHD simulations both in global and local scales complement the observational analyses, which allow us to draw more quantitative conclusions and develop understanding of the underlying physics.",

Caves require equipment to cope with high humidity, high velocity flows, submersion, sediment loads, and harassment from local fauna. Equipment taken into caves is often considered \"consumable\" due to the extreme nature of cave environments and the difficulty of transport. Further, because many interesting monitoring locations within caves can be considered remote, it is ideal for electronic monitoring platforms to require minimal maintenance of parts and power supplies.\nTo partially address the challenge of scientifically monitoring such environments, we have developed an arduino based platform for environmental monitoring of cave systems. The arduino is a general purpose open source microcontroller that is easily programmed with only a basic knowledge of the C programming language. The arduino is capable of controlling digital and analog electronics in a modular fashion. Using this capability, we have created a platform for monitoring CO2 levels in cave systems that costs one-tenth of a comparable commercial system while using a fraction of the power. The modular nature of the arduino system allows the incorporation of additional environmental sensors in the future.",

            "abstract": "Historically, operational space weather tools have focused on the large-scale. The Sun, solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere were the domains that, rightly so, needed the attention of experimentalists and scientists to fashion the best sensors and physics-based models available. These initiatives resulted in significant improvements for operational forecasters. For example, geomagnetic storm predictions now do not have to rely on proxies for CMEs, such as type II sweep, but rather make use of available actual observations of CMEs from which the true velocity vector may be determined.\nThe users of space weather services profited from the better large-scale observations, but now have expressed their desire for even better spatially and time-resolved granularity of products and services. This natural evolution towards refining products has ushered in the era of the smaller mission, the more efficient sensor. CubeSats and compact ionospheric monitors are examples of the instrumental suite now emerging to bring in this new era.\nThis presentation will show examples of the new mix of smaller systems that enable finer, more well-resolved products and services for the operational world. A number of technologies are now in the marketplace demonstrating the value of more observations at a decreasing cost. In addition, new models are looming to take advantage of these better observations. Examples of models poised to take advantage of new observations will be given.",

We find that, after sea level change (and excluding the local variations in suspended sediment availability), CO2 fertilization is likely to have the largest effects on marsh stability, followed by changes in nutrient concentration and temperature. We further show that the responses brought about by such changes in forcing are spatially dependent. Even though shifts from marsh to tidal flats may be locally abrupt, whole-marsh responses to environmental changes are likely to be gradual.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, filamentary regions of enhanced water vapor transport whose presence has been observed to coincide with extreme precipitation and major flooding events along the west coast of North America. Criteria for their visual identification were previously developed based on fields of integrated water vapor (IWV) from either satellite retrievals or numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This approach, including thresholds on the width, length, and IWV content, was then incorporated into an automated, objective tool termed the Atmospheric River Detection Tool (ARDT) for IWV. The ARDT-IWV has been demonstrated to be successful in reproducing manually derived climatologies of landfalling AR events and was employed in evaluations of the ability of NWP models to forecast the characteristics and landfall of ARs along the west coast of North America. While highly valuable for its ability to be employed on fields directly available from satellite retrievals, the technique does not address the integrated vapor transport (IVT) that most directly characterizes an AR.\nAn enhanced version of the ARDT has now been developed for application to fields of IVT derived from NWP models and reanalyses. The 2 cm threshold for IWV has been replaced with regionally varying thresholds on IVT and the maximum width and minimum length criteria of 1000 km and 2000 km, respectively, have both been relaxed to 1500 km. Further invoking the river analogy, an additional requirement for the IVT to be aligned with the primary axis of the feature has been imposed. This presentation details implementation of the new ARDT for IVT, its initial evaluation over the northeastern Pacific, and comparison of statistics of landfalling ARs based on IWV and IVT criteria. Regional modification of the technique for application within the southeastern U.S. is also described and the function of the tool in that region demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "The Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) took place July-August 2014 with an emphasis on measuring emissions relevant to air quality throughout the Northern Front Range Metropolitan region of Colorado. Extensive focus on this region has been due in part to its large and variable emission sources, such as the Denver-metro area and nearby oil and gas production in the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin. The Denver urban area is frequently out of compliance with the national air quality standards for ozone during summer. Photochemical ozone precursors, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) are prevalent in urban emissions. Oil and natural gas production is also known to contribute to VOC emissions in the Denver urban area, and may affect ozone levels in the region.\nThe focus of this presentation will be on NOx–NOy-O3 measurements conducted from a tall tower at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO), approximately 33km north of Denver, Colorado. The tower is unique in that it is tall (300m) and located between the Denver metro area to the south and the D-J basin to the north (Fig. 1). During this campaign a suite of instruments were mounted in a carriage, external to the BAO tower, to collect in-situ measurements with vertical resolution or at fixed heights above ground level. A cavity ring-down instrument was used to measure NOx, ozone, and total reactive nitrogen (NOy). Additional instruments mounted in the carriage and at the BAO ground site (Picarro, HR-TOF-CIMS, and GC) provided VOC data and other tracers of air mass origin. This presentation will discuss methods for determining contributions of different emission sources to Front Range ozone, with an emphasis on high ozone days during FRAPPE.",

These responses are driven by differences in large-scale circulation that result in significant low cloud anomalies in the subtropical southeastern Pacific. Both the vertical profile of cloud fraction and cloud water content are reduced during the eastern Pacific El Niño; however, the shift in the distribution of cloud characteristics and the physical processes underlying these changes need further analysis. The NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS) Clouds and Radiation Working Group will use a synthesis of NEWS data products, A-Train satellite measurements, reanalysis, and modeling approaches to further explore the differences in the low cloud response to changes in the large-scale forcing, as well as try to understand the physical mechanism driving the observed changes in the low clouds for the 2006/07 and 2009/10 distinct El Niño events. The distributions of cloud macrophysical, microphysical, and radiative properties over the southeast Pacific will first be compared for these two events using a combination of MODIS, CloudSat/CALIPSO, and CERES data. Satellite and reanalysis estimates of changes in the vertical temperature and moisture profiles, lower tropospheric stability, winds, and surface heat fluxes are then used to identify the drivers for observed differences in the clouds and TOA radiative effects.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, Great Beijing area has experienced rapid and widespread urbanization, which has significantly modified the land surface physical characteristics and affects urban regional climate.\nA single layer urban canopy module has been developed based on the Community Land Surface Model Urban Module (CLMU) with improvements: the energy balances on the five surface conditions are considered separately: building roof, sun side and shaded side wall, pervious and impervious land surface. A method to calculate sky view factor is developed based on the physically process while most urban models simply provide an empirical value. This method improves the solar and long wave radiation simulation on each surface; a new scheme for calculating the latent heat flux is applied on both wall and impervious land; the anthropogenic heat is considered in terms of industrial production, domestic wastes, vehicles and air condition.\nThe urban effect on summer convective precipitation under the unstable atmospheric condition over Beijing was investigated by simulating a heavy storm event in July 21st 2012. In this storm, precipitation of averagely 164 mm was brought to Beijing within 6 hours, which is the record of past 60 years in the region. Numerical simulating experiment was set up by coupling Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)/SSiB3 model with the Modified CLMU (MCLMU). Several control cases without MCLMU were set up. The horizontal resolution in the inner domains was set to be 2 km.\nWhile all of the control results drastically underestimate the urban precipitation, the result of WRF/SSiB3/MCLMU is much closer to the observation. Sensitive experiments show that the existence of large area of impervious surfaces restrain the surface evaporation and latent heat flux in urban while the anthropogenic heat and enhanced sensible heat flux warm up the lower atmospheric layer and strengthen the vertical stratification instability, which is the key factor for storm while moisture is sufficient.",

Slope failure is still the main one of the natural disasters.\nSlope failure mechanism is not understood well, for example, it unable to predict the timing of failure.\nTherefore, a method with extensometers were applied for prediction of slope collapse.\nHowever, the accurate prediction is very difficult because the allowable time for warning is sometimes too short.\nThe warning system must be improved for the specific each slope.\nNew rational index to predict slope failure with early stage also must be studied through such experiments.\nSlope failure(shallow landslide) occurs on the weathered layer with a thickness of about 1 to 2m.\nIn such conditions, ease of infiltration by heavy rainfall makes land collapsing quite often and repeatedly.\nMechanism of slope failure is induced by 1) water pressure or table by rainfall, 2) reduction of strength like cohesion, 3)increase of self weight by water. This must be verified.\nSo we conducted the large-scale model slope test with rainfall to understand the process of slope destabilization by large-scale rainfall simulator at National research Institute for earth science and disaster prevention.\nWe will express the part of the results to discuss the mechanism of slope failure.\nIn one of the main results, complex movement of groundwater in the slope play the main roll of slope destabilization.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric properties may be significantly modified by introduction of urbanization processes, through changes in surface albedo, sensible and latent heat balances, and aerosol emission amounts and distributions. In this study, we choose to focus on East-Asia, as one of the most densely and rapidly economically growing areas, to explore the connection between extensive urbanization processes and cloud properties.\nFor this purpose, a 14 yearlong surface meteorological observation dataset is co-located with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol and cloud product, and with land usage product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We find that in the densely urbanized areas in East Asia, the averaged low-cloud fraction has decreased by ~4% in the recent 10 years. Additional result shows that the low-cloud fraction in East Asia is constantly lower in urbanized areas than it is in rural areas, and that hazy days are characterized by smaller coverage of low clouds. These results, that found to have the opposite trends in any other region of interest, show that in East-Asia, urbanized environment high pollution levels lead to less low-cloud coverage, unlike the expected trend due to the known microphysical (“indirect”) and radiative-dynamical (“semi-direct”) effects of aerosol on clouds.\nThe observed trend of cloud coverage over urbanized areas in East Asia may influence both radiation budget and precipitation distribution in regional and probably global scales, and therefore should be carefully addressed and assessed. We suggest a combined dynamical and microphysical mechanism to explain this unique trend that is observed in East Asia, and study the optional range of urbanization and climate conditions that may lead to the decrease of cloud coverage due to extensive urbanization processes, using regional and cloud resolving simulations.",

            "abstract": "Increase in glacier number and decrease in glacier area are perceived significantly in recent decades in Nepal. The observed glacier changes are one of the key indicators of climate change. In order to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers a repeat decadal glacier inventory since 1980s based on landsat images were carried out in the Langtang and Imja valleys. The recent glacier outlines were delineated semi-automatically from the images using object based image classification (obic) in Definien Developer. The glacier outlines of other decades were obtained by manual editing on the glacier polygons of semi-automatically derived glaciers polygons by overlaying separately on the images of respective years. The result shows that the glacier area has been decreased by 26% in Langtang valley in the period 1976-2009 and 28% in Imja valley in the period 1979-2010. The lowest elevation of glaciers has been shifted upward by 50m and 115m in Imja and Langtang valley respectively. The annual mean temperature from 1988 to 2008 were found to be 4.2oC and 0.3oC in Langtang valley and Imja valley respectively. The rate of temperature rise in this period was 0.116oC yr-1 and 0.09 oC yr-1 in Langtang valley and Imja valley respectively. The rise of mean decadal and annual mean temperature in Langtang and Imja valleys are one of the key factors of shrinking and retreating of glaciers.",

In this work we present recent time series of CO2 measured at the station located in the university campus in Mexico City, and compare them to total vertical columns of this gas measured at the same location. In situ measurements are continuously carried out with a cavity ring-down spectrometer (Picarro Inc., G2401) since July 2014 and the columns are retrieved from solar absorption measurements taken with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Vertex 80) when conditions allow. The retrieval method is described and results of the comparison of both techniques and a detailed analysis of the variability of this important greenhouse gas is presented. Simultaneous surface and column CO2 data are useful to constrain models and estimate emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf of Maine is a marginal sea adjacent to the subpolar North Atlantic gyre. It similarly exhibits canonical seasonal phytoplankton blooms. An array of moorings was deployed on the shelf and deep basins in the Gulf of Maine in 2001 with real-time hydrographic and optical sensor packages. Daily climatologies of calibrated chlorophyll fluorescence (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), temperature and salinity provide quantitative models for the spatial progression of seasonal patterns in stratification and bloom development. Anomaly time series indicate an abrupt change in the seasonal patterns beginning in 2005. Prior to 2005, seasonal blooms were triggered by the onset of thermally-driven stratification, the timing of which was primarily determined by latitude without influence of location on the shelf or deep basins. Spring blooms propagated from southwest to northeast, while fall blooms propagated from northeast to southwest following autumnal cooling and destratification. Beginning in 2005, an increase in the amount and intensity of precipitation yielded significant changes in river discharge patterns, particularly associated with the spring freshet. Springtime stratification patterns , and hence spring phytoplankton blooms, appeared much earlier and synoptically across the Gulf, in some locations up to 2 months earlier than observed prior to 2005. The consequences of such large variations in the timing and spatial patterns of spring phytoplankton blooms include large variations in specific growth rates, mismatch with grazing populations, and cascading changes in ecosystem structure throughout the Gulf of Maine.",

An important area of uncertainty, highlighted by the MESSENGER observations of Mg and Ca at Mercury, and the recently concluded LADEE observations at the Moon, is the role of micrometeoroid bombardment as a source process for liberating surface species. Unlike sputtering or photon stimulated desorption processes, the physics of micrometeoroid impacts are still poorly understood; in particular, no comprehensive model exists to predict partitioning of impact products between ejecta fragments, charged particles, and neutrals.\nWe present initial experiments at the IMPACT dust accelerator facility (University of Colorado Boulder) aimed at directly measuring the fraction of neutral species liberated in micrometeoroid impacts. Simulated micrometeoroids (micron- and submicron-sized iron spheres) are fired at targets containing refractory elements, including fused silica (SiO2), sapphire (Al2O3), and magnesium fluoride (MgF2). Total quantities of specific impact-generated neutral species are measured using a mass spectrometer, as a function of impactor speed and mass, and compared with well-established scaling laws for charged particle production.",

            "abstract": "Injection of large volume of CO2 into deep geological reservoirs for geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is expected to cause significant pressure perturbations in subsurface. Large-scale pressure increases in injection reservoirs during GCS operations, if not controlled properly, may limit dynamic storage capacity and increase risk of environmental impacts. The high pressure may impact caprock integrity, induce fault slippage, and cause leakage of brine and/or CO2 into shallow fresh groundwater resources. Thus, monitoring and controlling pressure buildup are critically important for environmentally safe implementation of GCS projects. Extraction of native brine during GCS operations is a pressure management approach to reduce significant pressure buildup. Extracted brine can be transferred to the surface for utilization or re-injected into overlying/underlying saline aquifers. However, pumping, transportation, treatment and disposal of extracted brine can be challenging and costly. Therefore, minimizing volume of extracted brine, while maximizing CO2 storage, is an essential objective of the pressure management with brine extraction schemes. Selection of optimal well locations and extraction rates are critical for maximizing storage and minimizing brine extraction during GCS. However, placing of injection and extraction wells is not intuitive because of heterogeneity in reservoir properties and complex reservoir geometry. Efficient computerized algorithms combining reservoir models and optimization methods are needed to make proper decisions on well locations and control parameters. This study presents a global optimization methodology for pressure management during geologic CO2 sequestration. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) algorithm is introduced for solving optimization problems involving well placement and injection/extraction control. The CDE methodology is tested and applied for realistic CO2 storage scenarios with the presence of uncertainty in reservoir properties. Optimal placements of wells and selection of pumping rates are evaluated for different realizations of reservoir heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Fertilized agricultural lands, wastewater injection, and areas with high septic system density each have substantial potential for contributing excess nutrients to the coastal waters of islands via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). We evaluated the coastal impacts of such land-use around the island of Maui using stable isotopes (δ15N of NO3-; δ18O and δ2H of H2O) and nutrient concentrations from wells, springs, beach seeps, SGD, and coastal waters, and coupled these to coastal water SGD and nutrient fluxes using 222Rn mass balance. Flowpaths and recharge elevations for groundwater samples were determined using the δ18OH2O of samples, recharge data, modeled groundwater head, and published local meteoric water lines. Coastal groundwater samples whose flowpaths transect sugarcane plots showed highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN - NO3- + NO2-) concentrations, ranging from 225 - 450 µM, and the δ15N of those samples was on average 3.3 ± 0.6 ‰ (n = 15), as expected for urea fertilizers applied to commercial sugarcane. Samples whose flowpaths transect large amounts of septic sources showed moderate DIN concentrations (max. 100 µM), but had higher δ15N values (9.7 ± 4.8 ‰, n = 5), reflecting their sewage influence. Due to nitrate reduction during subterranean transit, groundwater and coastal waters proximal to deep, near-coast wastewater injection (Kahului) display the highest average δ15N values encountered (δ15NNO3- 18.8 ± 11.1 ‰, n = 19) and moderate DIN concentrations (max 90 µM). Average SGD nutrient fluxes among the different field sites ranged from 700 - 1,500,000 µmol/d/m of shoreline for DIN and 600 – 22,000 µmol/d/m for orthophosphate. These results indicate that areas with the highest N and P fluxes are areas where coastal groundwater flowpaths transect large tracts of sugarcane production. Although highest SGD rates occur near the Kahului wastewater injection wells (~ 2800 m3/day) the relatively low nutrient concentrations in the groundwater end member lead to comparatively modest nutrient fluxes of 270,000 and 13,000 µmol/d/m for DIN and orthophosphate, respectively. This study demonstrates the utility of coupling stable isotope and SGD-radioisotope tracers to (1) determine the source of nutrients in SGD as well as (2) the trajectories and specific fluxes of those nutrients to the coast.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate that the first four statistical moments of sub-daily surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies exhibit large spatial patterns, globally, which differ from moment-to-moment and that many regions have statistically significant trends in moments from 1950-2010; these results imply that high-frequency SAT anomaly distributions are nearly identically distributed over very large spatial scales and that these distributions are undergoing characteristic changes in shape due to either decadal variability or climate change. Further, we examine the spatial scaling structure of higher-order and non-linear spatial correlations up to fourth-order which determine the variability distributions of SAT at larger spatial scales. Higher-order moment statistics suggest that SAT scales as an approximately locally homogeneous and isotropic quasi-Gaussian random field whose higher-order moments can be determined by functions of pair correlations, which in turn are related to regionally varying decorrelation length scales. These results have implications for the study of multi-scale atmospheric variability, extremes, and climate change involving geographically smooth variables and helps to define the theory which underlies the success of statistical downscaling techniques.",

Uniquely combining physical landscape models with predictive models of exploration activities, including drilling, pipeline construction and road reconstruction, the tools quantify the potential impacts of drilling activities for communities and landscapes in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nDividing the state into 9836 watershed sub-basins, we first describe the current state of Marcellus related activities through 2014. We then describe and report the results of three scaled predictive models designed to investigate probable sub-basins where future activities will be focused. Finally, the core of the paper reports on the second level of tools we have now developed to engage communities in planning for unconventional gas extraction in Pennsylvania. Using a geodesign approach we are working with communities to transfer information for comprehensive landscape planning and informed decision making. These tools not only quantify physical landscape impacts, but also quantify potential visual, aesthetic and cultural resource implications.",

            "abstract": "Barrier islands reduce impacts of storms and hurricanes on coastal areas, and provide habitat for migrating waterfowl and other species such as turtles. Scientific investigations are prerequisites to effective habitat management. Different habitats usually associate with different prevalent plant associations. For examples, emergent areas closest to estuarine waters consist of regularly flooded salt-tolerant grasses. In brackish areas, species composition changes to brackish-water assemblage. Conventional mapping methods include visual interpretation on aerial photographs and field investigation, which is conducted to compare various plant communities in the field with corresponding photographic signatures on aerial photos for mapping purposes. The low-cost, low-altitude flying UAV provides an opportunity to obtain the vital plant community information. The UAV remote sensing system usually adopts off-the-shelf cameras. Although the cameras have low spectral and radiometric resolution, they typically have high spatial resolution. The prevalent plant associations may have similar spectral reflectance, however they usually have different appearances. The hyperspatial images acquired by close-range cameras and low-altitude UAV cameras are used to generate geometric characterization of plant communities. The experiment has two study areas, transects on Mustang Island and beach on South Padre Island. The images used in the experiment consists of close-range photos along transects on Mustang Island and the UAV images over South Padre Island beach. After interior orientation and geo-orthorectification, predominant spatial properties such as texture and geometric properties are calculated on these images. The effectiveness of these parameters for identifying plant communities will be evaluated. The experiment tries to build the spatial signatures of typical coastal plant communities. Positive results will further the use of UAV technology into coastal environmental management.",

            "abstract": "An investigation of the crust and mantle structure beneath the northern part of the Mid-Continent Rift Zone (MCRZ) is carried out using through seismic tomography from both teleseismic earthquake data and ambient seismic noise, using data from the EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) and from the Flexible Array (FA) project SPREE (Superior Rifting EarthScope Experiment). The SPREE project deployed 83 temporary broadband seismic stations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ontario during 2011-2013. The goal is to study the ancient Superior Province rifting via the related crustal and upper mantle modification to the petrologic and thermal structures. Continental rifting 1.1 Ga ago produced an enigmatic horseshoe-shaped rift system that is only exposed in the Lake Superior Region, but shows strong gravity and magnetic anomalies. Cross-correlation between all station pairs of the SPREE and concordant TA stations are used to obtain ambient noise Rayleigh-wave Green’s functions, which are in turn used to obtain group and phase velocity dispersion curves in the 8 – 50 s period range. In addition, the two-plane-wave method with finite frequency kernels is used to determine teleseismic earthquake-generated Rayleigh wave phase velocities in the 20 – 182 s period range. Combining the phase velocity measurements from both techniques provides an opportunity to invert for 1-D shear wave velocity structure in the 8 – 182 s period range. Phase velocities generally agree well where the period bands overlap. A three-dimensional S-wave velocity model of the crust and upper mantle is obtained from the 1-D shear wave velocity profiles at each location, also incorporating receiver function estimates of crustal thickness. For the shear inversion the overlapping phase velocities are averaged, with noise correlation results preferentially weighted at short periods and teleseismic results at longer periods. The model shows slow shear velocities at shallow depths along the rift zone due to sediment infill. Slightly slow velocities are also seen in the uppermost mantle along much of the rift zone, perhaps due to Compositional variation. The other clear feature is fast velocities at deeper lithospheric levels in the Superior craton.",

Here we show that inadvertent cloud modification by anthropogenic emissions from Chile and Peru has increased cloud brightness and lifetime throughout the region’s extensive stratocumulus, resulting in net shortwave surface climate forcing and boundary layer cooling consistent with the vertical profile of observed cooling. The extensive stratocumulus observed in the region throughout the satellite era are more widespread and brighter than pre-industrial conditions.

            "abstract": "The Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in southern Bolivia has repeatedly sourced large-volume ignimbrite eruptions since 11 Ma. Though eruption rates have waned since 3 Ma, ­it is uncertain whether eruptions of a similar scale will occur in the future. Uturuncu volcano, a long-dormant dacite stratovolcano located within the APVC in southern Bolivia, currently exhibits sustained surface deformation over a broad, 70 km diameter area, with a peak uplift rate of ~1-2 cm/yr. This deformation corresponds to a magmatic source within the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB), a zone of partial melt within the mid-crust of the APVC that is thought to have sourced its large-volume ignimbrites. Given the short timescale of current geodetic measurements, however, it is unclear how this modern unrest relates to the evolution of Uturuncu’s underlying magmatic source. As geomorphic processes operate on timescales similar to those of magma chamber growth, we use the topography of lakes and rivers surrounding Uturuncu as strain markers to constrain its surface deformation history since the late Pleistocene. We investigate Uturuncu’s geomorphology through both field surveys and analysis of a high-resolution (0.5 m) digital elevation model (DEM). We focused our field efforts on two lakes proximal to Uturuncu: Laguna Mama Khumu and Laguna Loromayu. OSL data reveal shorelines of Tauca age (~15 ka), suggesting a regional basin response to climate. Differential GPS surveys of Mama Khumu’s shorelines show no evidence of deformation along the volcano’s flanks. Assuming a constant inflation rate, we estimate a maximum onset of Uturuncu’s present deformation phase at ~1 kyr before present. DEM-derived shoreline elevations match well with dGPS surveys, and DEM-derived river longitudinal profiles similarly show a lack of sustained surface deformation since the Tauca highstand. Together these observations imply a relatively stable topography at Uturuncu over the late Pleistocene, and thus the recent unrest here likely reflects a transient pulse of inflation rather than a snapshot of long-term tumescence. These results provide a valuable constraint for modelers seeking to link surface deformation to magmatic processes at depth, and more generally highlight the time-transient nature of large silicic magma chamber systems.",

            "abstract": "Information on crop phenological state such as flowering, maturing, drying, senescence, and harvesting is essential for crop production surveillance and yield prediction. Earth Observation data provide an important information source for monitoring crop development at various temporal and spatial scales. In particular, the availability of many high-spatial-resolution space sensors offers a powerful tool for precision farming. This study reports the results of a two-year (2012, 2013) study over spring wheat and canola fields using six different vegetation indices derived from the high-resolution (6.5m) RapidEye optical satellite data in northern Ontario, Canada. The study revealed that for both wheat and canola, significant relationships were observed between the ground-derived leaf area index (LAI) and all 6 vegetation indices tested. For spring wheat, the strongest relationship was found between LAI and the Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2 (MTVI2), with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95. For canola, a R2 of 0.92 was achieved. Strong relationships were also found between all six vegetation indices and the chlorophyll concentration index (CCI) measured in the fields using a CCM-200 device. The strongest correlation exists between CCI and the ratio of Modified the Chlorophyll Absorption Reflected Index (MCARI) and the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), with an R2 of 0.86. It suggests that RapidEye data can be used to track field-scale crop LAI and monitor crop chlorophyll content.",

            "abstract": "Emulsions are commonly used as amendments during remediation; yet, the processes controlling the distribution of droplets within the subsurface are not well understood. Given that inadequate spatial and/or temporal delivery of amendments often leads to ineffective treatment, there is a need to better understand emulsion transport. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the transport and retention of emulsion droplets in columns containing Ottawa sands. Breakthrough curves and deposition profiles from these experiments were interrogated using a mathematical model capable of describing attachment, detachment, and straining to begin to elucidate the physical processes controlling delivery.\nEmulsions were constructed by stabilizing soybean oil droplets within a continuous aqueous phase. Physical properties of the resulting oil-in-water emulsions were favorable for subsurface delivery (nominal properties: 1 g/mL density; 10 cP viscosity; and 1.5 µm droplet d50). Emulsions were introduced to the columns for approximately two pore volumes and followed by an extended flush of background solution. Effluent droplet size distributions did not vary significantly over the course of the experiment and remained similar to those measured for the influent emulsion. Emulsion breakthrough curves exhibited tailing, and deposition profiles were found to be hyper-exponential and unaffected by extended periods of background flow. Depending on emulsion composition and flow characteristics, 10-30% of the injected emulsion was retained on the sand suggesting a non-negligible influence on accessible porosity over the course of the experiment. Experimental results were further interpreted using a droplet transport model that accounts for temporal and spatial variation in porosity due to the retention of the emulsion droplets. At present the model assumes a uniform size distribution of inelastic emulsion droplets which are transported by advection and dispersion, and exchanged with the solid phase through attachment, detachment, and straining processes. Results examine the relative roles of attachment-detachment and straining in reducing the accessible porosity. Evaluation of how the porosity change influences the flow regime for moderately and slightly clogged media is currently under investigation.",

We strive to accomplish this by the application of the NOAA Environmental Modeling System/Global Forecasting System (NEMS/GFS) aerosol component (NGAC), which corresponds to the first global interactive atmosphere-aerosol forecast system ever implemented at NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and which has been operational since September 2012. Specifically, our approach will include the implementation of an improved satellite sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval methodology, that allows for better representation of the atmospheric state under dust-laden conditions. Specifically, the new algorithm will be included within the NGAC aerosol product to improve the accuracy of the SST analysis and examine the impact on NWP, particularly in tropical cyclone genesis regions in the eastern Atlantic.  The results of these corrections are validated against observed measurements from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, which is dominated by Saharan dust throughout most of the year and that is also a genesis region for Atlantic tropical cyclones. These observations are obtained from the NOAA Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE) and PIRATA Northeast Extension (PNE) buoys network. We believe that the improved physical SST methodology has the potential to allow for improved representation of the geophysical state under dust-laden conditions",

            "abstract": "Urban tree canopy processes affect the volume and biogeochemistry of inputs to the hydrological cycle in cities. We studied stemflow from 37 isolated deciduous trees in an urban park in Kamloops, British Columbia which has a semi-arid climate dominated by small precipitation events. Precipitation and stemflow were measured on an event basis from June 12, 2012 to November 3, 2013. To clarify the effect of canopy traits on stemflow thresholds, rates, yields, percent, and funneling ratios, we analyzed branch angles, bark roughness, tree size, cover, leaf size, and branch and leader counts. High branch angles promoted stemflow in all trees, while bark roughness influenced stemflow differently for single- and multi-leader trees. The association between stemflow and numerous leaders deserves further study. Columnar-form trees often partitioned a large percentage of precipitation into stemflow, with event-scale values as high as 27.9 % recorded for an Armstrong Freeman Maple (Acer x freemanii 'Armstrong'). Under growing-season conditions funneling ratios as high as 196.9 were derived for an American Beech (Fagus grandifolia) individual. Among meteorological variables, rain depth was strongly correlated with stemflow yields; intra-storm break duration, rainfall intensity, rainfall inclination, wind speed, and vapour pressure deficit also played roles. Greater stemflow was associated with leafless canopies and with rain or mixed events versus snow. Results can inform climate-sensitive selection and siting of urban trees towards integrated rainwater management. For example, previous studies suggest that the reduction in storm-water generation by urban trees is accomplished through canopy interception loss alone. However, trees that partition large quantities of precipitation canopy-drainage as stemflow to the base of their trunks, where it has the potential to infiltrate into the soil media rather than fall on impervious surfaces as throughfall, may assist in reducing stormwater flow.",

            "abstract": "We present results of the first detailed microanalytical study of aerodynamic glassy fallout from Trinity, the world’s first nuclear device. The aerodynamic morphology of trinitite beads is consistent with their origination inside the nuclear cloud and solidification prior to reaching the ground. Existing conceptual models of aerodynamic fallout formation involve progressive condensation about a nucleus of ground material, followed by diffusive compositional homogenization. Microstructural and chemical composition data from eleven trinitite beads instead suggest that fallout records a multitude of physiochemical processes, including partial melting, agglomeration, volatile exsolution, condensation, melt mingling, and quenching. SEM-based mapping and EPMA data show that beads are composed of variable amounts of four distinct constituents ­– alkali-rich glass; silica glass (lechatlierite); Ca-Mg-Fe-bearing glass; and unmelted or partially melted mineral aggregates. Smooth, ovoid trinitite beads (2-5 mm diameter) comprise vesicular alkali and silica glass blebs with the compositions of fused feldspar and quartz grains, respectively, embedded within CaMgFe glass. Flattened or elongate beads (4-8 mm long axis) are mineral aggregates encased in a rind of predominantly CaMgFe glass. Increasing vesicularity toward the glass-aggregate interface suggests volatile exsolution as hotter melt contacted cooler mineral debris. CaMgFe glass is compositionally heterogeneous, with SiO2 contents ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic, and compositional banding indicating low-viscosity flow. Contacts between alkali, silica, and CaMgFe glasses are sharp to slightly diffuse, and EPMA traverses across glass contacts confirm limited diffusive exchange of major and minor elements. Autoradiography of trinitite shows that radioisotopes are confined to the CaMgFe glass, where they are patchily distributed, supporting limited diffusive mobility of trace elements as well. Overall, the microscale compositional heterogeneity of CaMgFe glass suggests that its precursor melt formed by condensation from the detonation-generated plasma (~8400 K) and quenched rapidly upon contact with cooler minerals and melts during turbulent mixing within the nuclear cloud.",

This case had previously been modeled [DOI: 10.1029/2008JA013582] using the 1D-DNLS equation including the effects of dissipation which showed that any profile with a nonlinear component will inevitably lead to the formation of a train of so-called one-parameter dark solitons with a corresponding decrease in field strength. We report on an extension of this earlier work to the rotationally asymmetric case. The magnetic field structure for ‘solitons’ in this case has not been developed in the literature, but we have found that the direct scattering problem shows the same dynamics as the symmetric case. Connections between these results and magnetic decreases observed in our numerical simulations will be presented.",

The four ponds on Little Darby exhibit a range of salinities (10-69) and sedimentary deposits that record the evolution of ponds from restricted shallow marine embayments to isolated hypersaline ponds. Only the largest and most hypersaline pond, Anaconda, was covered by a classically defined multi-layered microbial mat (3 cm thick) with calcium carbonate precipitates. Microbial laminations and organosedimentary layers were preserved throughout the 90cm sediment core. The brackish ponds had thinner (< 0.5cm) microbial mats and appeared to be non-carbonate precipitating, with no preserved laminated mats in the subsurface. Despite differences in observed precipitation, molecular and geochemical evidence for microbially induced carbonate precipitation and diageneiss was observed in all four ponds. High-throughput 454 pyrosequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes identified the same dominant bacterial groups in all four ponds, such as Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes, with metabolisms previously linked to carbonate producing mat systems. Sulfate reduction and heterotrophic degradation of exopolymeric substances were identified as the primary mechanism for microbial carbonate precipitation. The δ13C values of carbonate sediments ranged from -5.5‰ to 3‰, with the more negative values representing the heterotrophic involvement in carbonate precipitation. The more positive values (0-3‰) were associated with the deeper sediments deposited in a marine environment before the ponds were isolated. Pore fluid chemical ratios of Ca2+/Cl-, Mg2+/Cl-, and Sr2+/Cl- ratios also suggest that precipitation and recrystallization of carbonate minerals is occurring in the buried sediments and indicates that the microbial influence on buried sediments is not limited to surface mats. The results reported here demonstrate that the absence of microbially induced sedimentary structures, such as laminations in hypersaline ponds, does not imply the absence of microbially mediated carbonate precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux is the most prominent feature of outer heliospheric ENA emission as observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). Here, we study the systematic variation of ENA flux in the ribbon and in its vicinity as a function of angle from the ribbon center at ecliptic (219°, 40°) as projected in the sky. We find that the ENA emission on the interior of the ribbon (between the ribbon and the ribbon center) is correlated with the emission brightness of the ribbon peak, whereas ENA emission on the exterior of the ribbon (between the ribbon and the antipode of the ribbon center) is not correlated with ribbon brightness. The ribbon flux falls to zero beyond a great circle in the sky at 90º from the ribbon center and is thus constrained to a hemisphere of emission that is centered on the ribbon center. These results are consistent with the “secondary” emission process of ribbon formation in the outer heliosheath [Heerikhuisen et al., 2010; McComas and Schwadron, 2013]. We additionally deconvolve the IBEX point spread function from analytical fits to the ribbon shape. We find that the ribbon peak is approximately 5% brighter than observations that do not consider the PSF. We also find a wide but consistent variation of ribbon widths, with the full width at half maximum ranging from 14º and 34º for 0.7-2.7 keV. At 4.3 keV the ribbon is consistently wider, with a 24º minimum ribbon width. We discuss the implications of the sharpness of the ribbon peak for observations of the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP).",

            "abstract": "Pleistocene glacial cycles are a foremost influence on the genetic diversity and species distribution patterns observed today. Though much work has centered on biotic response to such climatic forcing, little of it has regarded estuarine or other aquatic coastal taxa whose habitat formation is a function of sea level, hydrography, and coastal geomorphology. These physical parameters required for habitat formation suggest that glacial cycles impart a significant effect on such taxa through glacially driven eustatic changes. Additionally, the steepened coastline and rainfall-limited Mediterranean climate suggest limited glacial habitat for estuarine species in southern and Baja California. Here we present GIS modeled habitat for tidal estuaries for three co-distributed estuarine fishes (Gillichthys mirabilis, Quietula y-cauda, Fundulus parvipinnis) since the last glacial maximum. Parameterization of sea level and slope enables biologically relevant temporal resolution of near-millennial scale. At lowstand our approach reveals two refuges along the coast at 1000km distance from each other, with habitat rapidly increasing 15 - 12 ka during meltwater pulse 1A. Habitat area peaked in the early Holocene and began decreasing with the current stillstand roughly 7 ka, probably as a result of coastal maturation towards less tidal systems.\nTo target the postglacial recolonization process we applied discriminant function analysis to highly polymorphic microsatellite data to partition out the alleles associated with refuges identified a priori by habitat modeling. The frequencies of these alleles were calculated for all individuals at intervening populations and regressed against geographic distance. This analysis revealed nonlinear mixing curves, suggesting uneven allelic mixing efficiency along the coastline, perhaps as a result of differential habitat origination times as indicated by the habitat models. These results highlight the dynamism of estuarine habitat in recent geologic time, and the widespread extirpation-recolonization dynamic that may be common to species isolated in habitat ‘islands’ populations. Finally, this interdisciplinary approach afforded a more thorough view of estuarine system evolutionary dynamics through time than achievable through either discipline alone.",

            "abstract": "The recent Iquique Earthquake 2014 did not break as it was expected, many authors proposed a large seismic gap in northern Chile, which potentially could break as a Mw 9.0 - 9.1. The 2014 Iquique earthquake broke the middle segment of the mega-thrust zone, from 30 to 55 km along dip, reaching a magnitude Mw 8.1-8.2. The northern and southern segments are still unbroken. Thus, there still is a large area that could break Mw 8.8-8.9 with its potential tsunami. To improve tsunami hazard mapping in the near-field region, we characterize size for the largest expected seismic event, and incorporate a good description of the source parameters that controls seafloor co-seismic displacement during an earthquake. Considering this background, we generate stochastic finite fault models taking into account the geometry of the slab. We construct a set of possible earthquakes with its respective tsunamis, including the effect of the recent 2014 Iquique earthquake to study the potential impact of a tsunami in northern Chile, assuming there still is enough energy to generate a Mw 9.0 earthquake. We model our preferred earthquake sources. The results show a maximum run-up of ~25 mt. The minimum run–up, coincides with a seismic source with uniform slip. This underestimates run-up by a factor of 6 at some places along the coast, showing agreement with near field run-ups calculated by Geist (2002) using a similar methodology. The tectonic setting and subsidence produced by subduction type earthquakes make Arica prone to have higher run-up in numerous scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Brownfields or urban sites that have been contaminated as a result of historic practices are present throughout the world. In the United States alone, the National Research Council has estimated that there are approximately 300,000 to 400,000 sites which have been contaminated by improper use and disposal of chemicals (NRC 1993). The land available at these sites is estimated at several million acres; however, the presence of high levels of contamination in the soil and groundwater makes it difficult to utilize these sites for traditional purposes such as agriculture. Further, the time required to remediate these contaminants to regulated levels is in the order of decades, which often results in long-term economic consequences for the areas near these sites. There has been significant interest in developing these sites as potential sources of renewable energy production in order to increase the economic viability of these sites and to provide alternative land resources for renewable energy production (EPA 2012). Solar energy, wind energy, and bioenergy from lignocellulosic biomass production have been identified as the main sources of renewable energy that can be produced at these locations. However, the environmental impacts of such a policy and the implications for greenhouse gas emissions, particularly resulting from changes in land-use impacting the biogeochemical cycle at these sites, have not been studied extensively to date.\nThis study uses the biogeochemical process-based model DNDC to simulate carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions and methane emissions from typical urban brownfield systems in the United States, when renewable energy systems are deployed. Photovoltaic solar energy and lignocellulosic biomass energy systems are evaluated here. Plants modeled include those most widely used for both bioenergy and remediation such as woody trees. Model sensitivity to soil conditions, contaminant levels and local weather data and the resulting impacts on greenhouse gas emissions are explored. Tradeoffs between renewable energy production,contaminant removal, and mitigation of greenhouse gases are also evaluated. Results indicate that a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions of 29-43% is possible, together with an estimated increase in renewable energy production of 7-22%.",

Our study of the 35°–40°E segment of the Southwest Indian Ridge\n(SWIR) seeks to link geochemical and geological observations with the underlying mantle\nprocesses.\nBoth plate and plume modes interact and combine at the SWIR 35°–40°E segment.

When interacting\nwith the mid-ocean ridges, hotspots like the Azores, Iceland, Galápagos, and Rodriguez\nproduce distinctive patterns, such as propagating rifts, triple junctions, and enriched MORB\nsignatures. The Marion hotspot does not have a similar effect on the SWIR even though\nit is associated with a bathymetric high and residual mantle Bouguer anomaly low. A\nnotable feature along the ridge is a V-shaped bathymetric anomaly around one of the non-\ntransform discontinuities (NTD).\nAs for the SWIR 10°-16°E area (Montési et al., 2011) geodynamics modeling predicts\nmagma focusing to highly segmented non-transform oblique segments (NTOS) along the\nridge. However, geophysical observations show a thinning crust at these regions. Modeling\nwithout the segmentation along the oblique segments shows much better agreement with\nthe observations. So either the NTOS are a crustal structure that does not influence mantle\nupwelling, melt extraction parameters vary along the ridge, or the density of the crust is\nanomalous in NTOS due to a different fractionation history.\nWe will incorporate whole rock chemistry (including trace element, & REEs) constraints\nto the evaluation of our hypotheses by modeling melt evolution and crystallization under\ndifferent conditions and comparing model predictions with collected samples.",

Models and workflows have been applied successfully to understand and even to predict chaotic systems in other scientific fields, including electrical engineering, neurology and oceanography. Unfortunately, the high levels of noise characteristic of our planet’s chaotic processes often render these frameworks ineffective. This contribution presents techniques for the reduction of noise associated with measurements of nonlinear systems.\nOur ultimate aim is to develop data assimilation techniques for forward models that describe chaotic observations, such as episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events in fault zones. A series of nonlinear filters are presented and evaluated using classical chaotic systems. To investigate whether the filters can successfully mitigate the effect of noise typical of Earth science, they are applied to sunspot data. The filtered data can be used successfully to forecast sunspot evolution for up to eight years (see figure).",

            "abstract": "The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 348 extended the borehole of Site C0002, Nankai Trough, down to over 3000 meters below sea floor (mbsf) collecting core samples and in-situ geophysical data from the inner accretionary prism. In order to investigate the in-situ stress state within the prism, we characterized the occurrence and shapes of wellbore failures as observed by resistivity image logs and sonic caliper logs collected in the vertical well of Hole C0002P.\nMost wellbore failures were observed in the top 70 meters of Hole C0002P (2150 to 2218.5 mbsf), where resistivity images were acquired several days after the borehole was initially exposed by previous drilling and coring runs. Wide breakouts spanning up to 140 degrees are observed in the NW/SE to NNW/SSE direction suggesting that the maximum horizontal principal stress in the cored interval is in the direction generally consistent with those observed in the shallower sections of Site C0002 from earlier expeditions. In the remaining section of the borehole below, wellbore failures are much sparse and subtle in the resistivity image possibly due to the short exposure time between drilling and image acquisition (about 2 hours). Preliminary examination suggest that these features are breakouts aligned in the direction consistent with the upper section, but examination in combination with the sonic caliper data is required for further confirmation.\nThese observations suggest that the occurrence of breakouts exhibit significant time-dependence due to processes such as pore pressure diffusion or time-dependent rock deformation. Moreover, sonic caliper data suggests that shapes and width of the wellbore failures in the studied dataset is influenced by the formation strength anisotropy (in the horizontal direction) enhanced by the steeply dipping bedding planes (60-90 degrees). Thus, constraints on in-situ stress magnitudes will be provided through comparison of wellbore failures, borehole cross section, bedding dips, downhole mud pressure records, and formation mechanical properties.",

            "abstract": "Mono Basin, located in the southwestern corner of the US Great Basin, has long been known to have experienced large lake level changes, particularly during the last deglaciation. But until recently it was not possible to establish a reliable lake level time series. We discovered many visually clean, white, shiny, dense calcite samples in the basin, associated with tufa deposits from high terraces. Their low thorium, but high uranium contents allow precise and reproducible U/Th age determinations. A highly resolved history of a minimum lake level through the last deglaciation can therefore be inferred based on sample locations and their ages.\nWe found that the lake level reached ~2030 m asl at ~20.4 ka, evidenced by calcite coatings on a tufa mound at the upper Wilson Creek. The lake then rose to ~2075 m by ~19.1 ka, shown by calcite cements on conglomerates from the Hansen Cut terrace. The lake climbed to at least ~2140 m at ~15.9 ka, indicated by beach calcites from the east Sierra slope. Such timing of the highest lake stand, occurring within Heinrich Stadial 1, is reinforced by U/Th dates on calcite coatings from widespread locations in the basin, including the Bodie Hills and Cowtrack Mountains. The lake then dropped rapidly to ~2075 m at ~14.5 ka. It stood near this height over the next ~300 years, evidenced by a few-centimeter thick, laminated calcite rims on the Goat Ranch tufa mounds. It subsequently plunged to ~2007 m at ~13.8 ka, indicated by calcite coatings from cemetery road tufa mounds. The lake level came back to ~2030 m at ~12.9 ka, as seen in upper Wilson Creek tufa mounds. The lake level had a few fluctuations within the Younger Dryas, and even shot up to ~2075 m at ~12.0 ka. It then fell to levels in accord with Holocene climatic conditions.\nRelative to the present lake level of ~1950 m, Mono Lake broadly stood high during Heinrich Stadial 1 and Younger Dryas, when the climate was extremely cold over the North Atlantic, and the Asian monsoon was much weakened. When the climate shifted from cold to warm, the lake dropped significantly, during the transition between Heinrich Stadial 1 and the Bølling time interval, and then during the Allerød period. The U/Th ages on the tufa samples therefore not only establish a highly resolved chronology of hydroclimate history in the Mono Basin, but also put the lake level oscillations in a global context.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, the western US experienced increased sever, frequent, and prolonged droughts resulting in significant water availability issues, which raised questions as to how electricity sector might be vulnerable to future droughts. To improve our understanding of potential risks of electricity generation curtailment due to drought, an impact analysis was performed with a series of modeling tools including climate downscaling, competitive water-use calculator, hydrologic model for various hydrologic processes, and power-plant specific models. This presentation will demonstrate the predicted effects of potential droughts on power generation at a local level of the USGS 8-digit watersheds and individual power plants within the context of current and future characteristics of power system and water resource system.\nThe study identified three potential drought scenarios based on historical drought records and projected climate changes from the GFDL and the PCM global climate models, for greenhouse gas emission scenarios A1B, A2, and B1 defined by the IPCC. The potential impacts under these three drought scenarios were evaluated with a hydrologic model constructed for the Pacific Northwest River Basin and California River Basin. The hydrologic model incorporates competitive water uses, climate forcing data corresponding to each of drought scenarios, and all major reservoirs that are currently supporting water withdrawal for various sectors and hydroelectric power generation. The hydrologic responses to drought scenarios predicted for each of the USGS 8-digit watersheds and reservoirs are used as input to power-plant specific models to quantify potential risk of curtailment at each power plant. The key findings from this study will help to improve understanding of spatial distribution of vulnerable power plants and watersheds as well as the scale of potential reduction of electricity generation under various drought scenarios. Beyond impacts to the existing fleet of power plants, the results also provide insights to the sitting of future power plants to support the long-term transmission planning.",

            "abstract": "Ocean acidification (OA) is a serious concern for the health of calcifying ecosystems in the near future. During the past century, surface ocean pH has decreased by ~0.1 pH units, and is expected to decrease further by 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of this century. The process of OA will likely result in both decreased calcification rates and increased rates of carbonate mineral dissolution, particularly involving the magnesian calcite (Mg-calcite) calcifiers found in shallow-water reef and other carbonate environments. Many Mg-calcite compositions are the most soluble of the carbonate phases commonly found in reef environments (often comprising much of the cementation and structure within a reef), and are therefore potentially the most susceptible to dissolution processes associated with OA. However, the dissolution kinetics of these phases is poorly known, limiting our ability to understand their behavior in nature. Laboratory experiments designed to investigate the mechanisms and dissolution rates of biogenic Mg-calcite mineral phases in distilled water and seawater over a range of CO2 and T conditions were conducted employing both batch and fluidized-bed reactor systems and using a variety of cleaned and annealed biogenic Mg-calcite phases.\nOur initial results have shown that the dissolution rate at 298 K and a pCO2 of ~350 ppm of the crustose coralline alga Amphiroa rigida (~20 mol% MgCO3) in seawater undersaturated with respect to this phase is 3.6 µmol g-1 hr-1, nearly 50% greater than that under similar conditions for aragonite. This rate and the derived experimental rate law are consistent with the preliminary findings of Walter and Morse (1985). Additional kinetic (and also solubility) data will be presented for the following species: Chiton tuberculatus (~0-4 mol% MgCO3); Echinometra mathei and/or Lytechinus variegatus (~8-12 mol% MgCO3); Homotrema rubrum (12-16 mol% MgCO3); and Lithothamnion sp. (~18-24 mol% MgCO3). Quantification of the rates of dissolution for a broad range of Mg-calcite phases, along with determination of sediment mineralogy, is necessary to allow managers to model and predict quantitatively the impacts of OA on a variety of coral reef and other carbonate-dominated sedimentary environments.",

While industrial users have disclosed several hundreds of compound and mixture identities, it is unclear which of these are used and where, in what proportion, and with what frequency. Furthermore, while flowback and production waters contain both fracturing additive and geogenic compounds, they may contain potential reaction byproducts as well. Here, we identified several hundred organic compounds present in six hydraulic fracturing flowback waters over the Fayetteville shale. Identifications were made via non-target analysis using two-dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry for hydrophobic organic compounds and liquid chromatography- orbitrap mass spectrometry. Compound identities were confirmed using purchased standards when available. Using the SkyTruth database and the Waxman list of disclosed compounds, we assigned compounds as either fracturing-fluid-derived or geogenic (or both), or a putative transformation products thereof. Several unreported halogenated compounds were detected, including chlorinated, brominated, and iodated species that have no known natural sources. Control studies indicated that these could not be formed under typical laboratory or field storage conditions, suggesting that halogenation reactions may give rise to novel compounds in the subsurface, presumably via reaction between fracturing fluid additives and shale-derived brines. Further, the six samples were strikingly heterogeneous, reflecting the diversity in fracturing fluid composition and flowback handling procedures at the time of the study.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is one of two instruments manifested aboard the South Korean Geostationary Earth Orbit KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite-2B (GEO-KOMPSAT-2B or GK2B), which is scheduled to launch in 2018. Jointly developed/built by KARI and Ball Aerospace, GEMS is a geostationary UV-Vis hyperspectral imager designed to monitor trans-boundary tropospheric pollution events over the Korean peninsula and Asia-Pacific region. The spectrometer provides high temporal and spatial resolution (3.5 km N/S by 7.2 km E/W) measurements of ozone, its precursors, and aerosols. Over the short-term, hourly measurements by GEMS will improve early warnings for potentially dangerous pollution events and monitor population exposure. Over the 10-year mission-life, GEMS will serve to enhance our understanding of long-term climate change and broader air quality issues on both a regional and global scale. The GEMS sensor design and performance are discussed, which includes an overview of measurement capabilities and the on-orbit concept of operations.\nGEMS Sensor Overview: The GEMS hyperspectral imaging system consists of a telescope and Offner grating spectrometer that feeds a single CCD detector array. A spectral range of 300-500 nm and sampling of 0.2 nm enables NO2, SO2, HCHO, O3, and aerosol retrieval. The GEMS field of regard (FOR), which extends from 5°S to 45°N in latitude and 75°E to 145°E in longitude, is operationally achieved using an onboard two-axis scan mirror. On-orbit, the radiometric calibration is maintained using solar measurements, which are performed using two onboard diffusers: a working diffuser that is deployed routinely for the purpose of solar calibration, and a reference diffuser that is deployed sparingly for the purpose of monitoring working diffuser performance degradation.",

            "abstract": "Professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields do not reflect the diversity of the US population. Among the most effective ways to attract and retain underrepresented students in STEM disciplines is to provide opportunities for participation in the scientific process and interaction with practicing scientists.\nProject HEAT (Hot Environments, Animals, & Temperature) is “boot-camp”-style workshop aimed at increasing interest in STEM topics among underrepresented, first-generation, college-bound middle school students. Linking to our NASA-funded research project “Desert Birds in a Warming World”, we focused on how surprisingly variable temperature is in space and time, why temperature is important to plants, animals, and people, and how we measure temperature in the field and from space. Perhaps more importantly, this theme was a vehicle for students to experience science as a process: field observations, brainstorming questions and hypotheses, designing experiments to test them, and analyzing and reporting their data. The centerpiece was a set of experiments with small temperature sensors and radiation shields that teams of students designed, executed at a local park, analyzed, and reported.\nTwo years of pre and post assessments revealed that Project HEAT participants increased understanding in content areas and showed slight increases in STEM interest. Year two results were markedly stronger than year one in both assessments as well as our perception. We attribute this to earlier summer timing of the workshop, a change from two half-day weeks to one full-day week, and a more age-homogeneous selection of students. In comments, participants expressed their special enjoyment of the hands-on nature of the program and the outdoor learning. Though providing such opportunities can be challenging, our experience here suggests that it can be worth while. Project HEAT also benefited our cadre of graduate student mentors by providing exposure to K-12 learning. Although successful on the whole, the limited improvement in STEM interest suggests a fundamental challenge of making an impact during a short period of time.",

The P-3B aircraft provided in situ vertical profiles of meteorological quantities, trace gases, and aerosols over six Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) air quality monitoring sites over fourteen flight days. Additionally, two sites launched ozonesondes and operated tethersondes during the campaign, supplementing the P-3B profiles. A major goal of DISCOVER-AQ is to understand the processes linking column abundances to surface concentrations for O3 and NO2, which includes understanding the variability of the in situ O3 and NO2 profile shapes used to compute the lower tropospheric column abundances. In support of this goal, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed for the O3 and NO2 P-3B and sonde profiles for the Maryland 2011 campaign, allowing classes of profile shapes to be identified at each surface site. These classes were related to differences in vertical mixing, as indicated by profiles of potential temperature, CO, and short-lived trace gas species, as well as the impact of the bay breeze at one site. Such an analysis of profile variability will also be useful to assess the representativeness of the assumed profile shapes used in satellite retrievals for O3 and NO2. Further, profile shapes for these species were compared with those from the CMAQ model to assess its performance. Lastly, the average diurnal variation of the O3 and NO2 column abundances over the July 2011 campaign was assessed at each site to elucidate the diurnal cycle for these columns and results were compared to the once-per-day OMI column observations.",

The HR-ToF-AMS provided quantitative measurement of non-refractory submicron aerosol composition and size distribution with high temporal resolution. Time series of mass concentrations of organic material, sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate (in order of average relative importance) and the changes in the concentrations of each component with respect to a photochemical airmass age metric (based on oxidation of nitrogen oxides) are reported. The relative importance of secondary ammonium and sulfate increases with values of the airmass age metric. While the contributions of organic and nitrate aerosol to total particle concentration decrease with increasing airmass age, organic aerosol concentration normalized by carbon monoxide (CO) constantly increases with age. However, the nitrate concentration normalized by CO appears relatively independent of the age metric. For a better understanding of organic aerosol processing, atomic ratio (oxygen/carbon and hydrogen/carbon) and carbon oxidation state (OSc) analyses of bulk organic aerosol are investigated.",

            "abstract": "Models of the glacial isostatic adjustment process, which are designed to explain the influence of the Late Pleistocene cycle of glaciation and deglaciation on planetary shape and sea level, require two fundamental inputs. These consist of a model of mantle viscosity as well as a global history of ice sheet loading and unloading. Various geophysical and geological observables enable the testing and refinement of these global models: among these, geological inferences of sea level history based upon appropriate relative sea level indicators and modern space geodetic observations of uplift of the surface of the solid Earth obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments have proven to be particularly important.\nHigh-quality relative sea level history reconstructions have been central not only to the development of existing spherically symmetric models of the internal visco-elastic structure of the mantle, but also to the development of current global ice sheet histories for the Late Quaternary, such as the most recently constructed ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model of Peltier et al. (JGR-Solid Earth, in press). In particular, observations of relative sea level evolution along the East coast of the United States (such as provided by the high-quality database of Engelhart et al. (2011, Geology)) are of special interest, given their location along a transect of the forebulge associated with the former Laurentide ice sheet.\nIn this paper, we examine how the misfits identified in the literature for the southern part of the U.S. East coast can be eliminated by appropriate changes in mantle viscosity structure represented by VM5a and ice sheet loading history variations represented by ICE-6G_C, focusing mainly on the sensitivity of sea level history predictions for sites along the eastern seaboard to depth-dependent mantle viscosity variations. The impact of ice sheet loading history variations upon these misfits is also discussed, and proves to be especially important in the context of maintaining an appropriate fit to the GPS observations of present-day vertical uplift over North America. In this regard, data from the US West coast proves to be especially useful as a means of confirming the validity of the adjustments to the model determined on the basis of the East coast data set.",

Those missions involve high-volume, multi-source, and multi-modal imagery data analysis. Analytical models intend to reveal inner structure, dynamics, and relationship of things. However, they are not necessarily intuitive to humans. Conventional scientific visualization methods are intuitive but limited by manual operations, such as area marking, measurement and alignment of multi-source data, which are expensive and time-consuming. A new development of video analytics platform has been in progress, which integrates the video game engine with satellite and in-situ data streams. The system converts Earth Observation data into articulated objects that are mapped from a high-dimensional space to a 3D space. The object tracking and augmented reality algorithms highlight the objects’ features in colors, shapes and trajectories, creating visual cues for observing dynamic patterns. The head and gesture tracker enable users to navigate the data space interactively. To validate our design, we have used NASA SeaWiFS satellite images of oceanographic remote sensing data and NOAA’s in-situ cell count data. Our study demonstrates that the video game system can reduce the size and cost of traditional CAVE systems in two to three orders of magnitude. This system can also be used for satellite mission planning and public outreaching.",

These systems were found to have good performance, with location uncertainty as low as 150 m. However, with only 4 microphones, the solution to the source location is not heavily overdetermined, and sources are frequently located far away from the lightning channel. In an attempt to correct these outlier sources, and to improve the overall accuracy of acoustic localization of lightning, a pilot study was initiated for the 2014 storm season exploring the possibility of locating lightning with dense acoustic arrays. To do this, a large array containing 12 microphones, 150 m by 50 m in diameter was deployed at Langmuir Laboratory in central New Mexico. The larger number of microphones, and the longer baselines should improve the angular uncertainty of acoustic source locations. In addition, it may be possible to distinguish and separate multiple acoustic sources which arrive simultaneously at the array. We will present lightning mapping for a triggered flash that occurred about 600 m from the acoustic array, as well as data for a natural lightning flash. Improvement to the accuracy of acoustic localization can then be determined by comparing the acoustic map with the mapping produced by the Langmuir Lightning Mapping Array.",

            "abstract": "For quasi-dynamic earthquake cycle simulations (ECSs) using BIEM, we have developed a method of calculating slip response function (SRF) in a homogeneous elastic medium with an arbitrary shaped Earth’s surface topography (Ohtani and Hirahara, 2013; Paper1). In this study, we report the improvement in our method.\nFollowing Hok and Fukuyama (2011), we set the Earth’s surface as a free surface, in addition to the fault interface, in a homogeneous full-space medium. Then, using the analytic solution in full-space, we can calculate the Earth’s surface deformation, then the SRF change.\nThe surface cell setting determines the accuracy. For reducing the computational amount, we use the different sizes of the surface region and its divided subfault cells, depending on the fault depth. Paper1 used the uniform size for surface cells. Here, we improved our method where the Earth’s surface cells closer to the trench have the finer sizes for achieving more accuracy.\nWith such numerical SRF, we performed the quasi-dynamic ECS on a model, where the Earth’s surface is convex upward. Basically, with this topography, the slip behavior approaches the full-space case, from the half-space with flat surface case. This is because the distance from the Earth’s surface to the fault becomes large. When we set two asperities with negative A – B in the positive A – B background at 10km and 35km depths, the two asperities rupture independently. The recurrence time of the shallow asperity is Trshalf = 34.95, Trsflat = 34.89, and Trsactual =32.82 years, when using analytic SRF in half-space, and numerical SRF with flat surface and with actual topography, respectively. For each case, the recurrence time of the deep asperity is Tr1_dhalf = 26.80, Tr1_dflat = 26.89, and Tr1_dactual =26.69 years. Thus, the shallower asperity is more affected by the Earth’s surface topography than the deeper one, because the distance change rate from the surface to the fault is larger. On the other hand, when we set the entire seismogenic zone as negative A – B to produce coseismic slip, the slip behavior showed almost no change. This is because the rupture starts from the deep portion, and the deep area has less affected by the Earth’s surface topography.\nWe also examined the realistic case assuming the Nankai Trough, the subduction zone located in southeast, Japan.",

            "abstract": "We established a rainfall and temperature manipulation experiment in June 2012 in a pinon-juniper woodland near Los Alamos, NM. In situ, mature trees were exposed to one of the five following treatments: drought (-40% precipitation), warming (+4° C), drought and warming, control, and chamber control. Respiration of leaf tissue (CO2 efflux) was measured once per month during the growing season (April - October) from 2012 to 2013 using polycarbonate branch chambers and a closed-path infra-red gas analyzer. Growth was recorded concurrent with respiration during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. In October 2013, we measured respiration temperature response curves over a 10° to 20° C range overnight.\nOur results show that heated treatments have higher cumulative rates of leaf respiration than drought or control groups, generally applied to both species, during most of the growing season. During periods of high growth and high heat, instantaneous respiration rates were highest. Little growth was observed in heat or drought treatments compared to control treatments each year measured and in October 2013, growth had ceased in all treatments for both species. The October 2013 measurement cycle revealed no differences between treatments in the Q10 of respiration, with a mean of 2.6 for each species. Data from previous months suggested a possible decoupling of respiration from temperature for the non-drought juniper groups, but the October measurement period showed a well-coupled response.\nThese results suggest that neither the heat nor drought treatment affected leaf maintenance respiration in October 2013. Although measurements during the two seasons of protracted precipitation and temperature stress of the treatment groups indicated diverging patterns in the respiration signal, by the end of the second season, any acclimation or temperature decoupling response was not observed, possibly due in whole or part by a large input of precipitation in September 2013.",

            "abstract": "Ultimately, effective climate change communication results in a change in behavior, whether the change is individual, household or collective actions within communities. We describe two efforts to promote climate-friendly behavior via climate communication and behavior change theory. Importantly these efforts are designed to scale climate communication principles focused on behavior change rather than soley emphasizing climate knowledge or attitudes. Both cases are embedded in rigorous evaluations (randomized controlled trial and quasi-experimental) of primary and secondary outcomes as well as supplementary analyses that have implications for program refinement and program scaling. In the first case, the Girl Scouts \"Girls Learning Environment and Energy” (GLEE) trial is scaling the program via a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for Troop Leaders to teach the effective home electricity and food and transportation energy reduction programs. The second case, the Alliance for Climate Education (ACE) Assembly Program, is advancing the already-scaled assembly program by using communication principles to further engage youth and their families and communities (school and local communities) in individual and collective actions. \nScaling of each program uses online learning platforms, social media and “behavior practice” videos, mastery practice exercises, virtual feedback and virtual social engagement to advance climate-friendly behavior change. All of these communication practices aim to simulate and advance in-person train-the-trainers technologies.\nAs part of this presentation we outline scaling principles derived from these two climate change communication and behavior change programs.",

            "abstract": "Natural resource managers often ask scientists to answer questions that cannot be answered, and scientists commonly offer research that is not useful to managers. To produce management-relevant science, managers and scientists must communicate clearly to identify research that is scientifically doable and will produce results that managers find useful. Scientists might also consider that journals with high impact scores are rarely used by managers, while managers might consider that publishing in top tier journals is important to maintain scientific credentials. We offer examples from climate change and river restoration research, in which agency scientists and managers worked together to identify key management questions that scientists could answer and which could inform management. In our first example, we describe how climate scientists worked with agency staff to develop guidance for selecting appropriate climate change scenarios for use in ecological impacts assessments and Endangered Species Act decision making. Within NOAA Fisheries, agency researchers provide science to guide agency managers, and a key question has been how to adapt river restoration efforts for climate change. Based on discussions with restoration practitioners and agency staff, we developed adaptation guidance that summarizes current science to lead managers to develop climate-resilient restoration plans, as well as maps of population vulnerability for endangered steelhead. From these experiences we have learned that collaborative definition of relevant and producible knowledge requires (1) iterative discussions that go beyond simply asking managers what they need or scientists what they can produce, and (2) candid conversation about the intended applications and potential limitations of the knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Several marine-terminating outlet glaciers on the Greenland Ice Sheet have undergone dynamic thinning, acceleration, and retreat, largely driven by ocean-ice interactions at the glacier terminus. Commensurate with these changes, surface melt rates are also increasing, resulting in enhanced runoff and infiltration known to influence regional ice velocity and mass flux. In particular, Jakobshavn Isbræ has experienced some of the most dramatic changes relative to the other major outlet glaciers largely responsible for Greenland’s contribution to sea level rise. The fast-flowing trunk of Jakobshavn Isbræ is well within the ablation zone and is exposed to significant accumulated runoff and drainage from water-filled crevasses within the shear margins during the summer. The impact of drainage from these structures on Jakobshavn’s response to terminus instability is not well understood. There are seven major water-filled crevasse regions along the margins, with the largest demonstrating potential drainage volume on order of that from large supraglacial lakes. This effort explores the impact of meltwater injection on shear-margin weakening. Meltwater can reduce lateral drag through enhanced sliding due to distributed basal lubrication or reduced ice viscosity due to cryo-hyrologic warming. The finite-element Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) was used to evaluate the impact of meltwater input into the shear margins on basal sliding and ice stiffness. Ratios of misfit between modeled and measured velocity for inversions of basal friction and ice viscosity show a shift from basal friction-to-viscosity dominated conditions from the winter to the summer, at locations where water-filled crevasses exist. Forward models were perturbed to evaluate the magnitude of shear weakening due to enhanced sliding versus changes in ice hardness.",

            "abstract": "The effects of large-scale cropland irrigation on precipitation patterns have been studied extensively over the last several years, but most studies have focused on monthly or seasonal timescales. Since irrigation impacts on precipitation may vary widely on shorter timescales with changing synoptic and mesoscale conditions, we present a modeling analysis of the daily and sub-daily impacts of irrigation on precipitation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model. In particular, we focus on changes in precipitation over and downwind of the US Great Plains, where irrigation has experienced rapid development over the last sixty years. When an irrigation scheme is implemented in the model, preliminary results of simulations for one growing season suggest that precipitation intensity is more likely to be enhanced downwind of, rather than over, the irrigated areas. In addition, the proportion of precipitation events with moderate and heavy precipitation seems to increase downwind of irrigated areas. We discuss other changes in the precipitation distribution (e.g., frequency, duration, and total precipitation) and in precipitation extremes (for both no-rain days and heavy precipitation) both in and downwind of irrigated areas. We also explain certain atmospheric and surface conditions that create a more favorable environment for potential irrigation enhancement of precipitation. Finally, we show preliminary results from a precipitation recycling model to better attribute the irrigation-induced changes in precipitation to either moisture enhancement or stability changes in the affected regions.",

            "abstract": "We will present a method for the quantitative assessment of the soil water storage capacity of each pixel in a Landsat or MODIS image using the information available in the historic Landsat and MODIS archives. The soil water storage capacity represents the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the soil and/or bedrock so that it is available for release into the atmosphere through transpiration by vegetation and/or evaporation from the land surface. First, the METRIC algorithm is used to convert 15 images representative for growing seasons in wet, dry and normal years into evaporative fraction maps. The evaporative fraction is an expression of the relative evapotranspiration and is strongly correlated to soil moisture conditions in the root zone: high and low evaporative fractions indicate, respectively, high and low root zone soil water contents. We use an experimental relationship to derive a normalized root zone soil moisture value between 0 (dry) to 1 (saturation) from the evaporative fraction. Then, the wetness score for each pixel is calculated as the sum of its 15 “normalized root zone soil moisture” values; it is a relative measure of the overall wetness of a pixel compared to other pixels with values between 0 and 15. Large and small values for the wetness score indicate, respectively, large and small values for the soil water storage capacity. The challenge is to convert the ranking of the wetness scores for each pixel into a quantitative soil water storage capacity. For this operation we use the hydrological Distributed Parameter Watershed Model (DPWM). After construction of seven physically realistic conversion functions between wetness score rank and soil water storage capacity, we evaluate the seven distributions of the differences between the 15 METRIC observed and DPWM simulated “normalized root zone soil moisture” maps. The conversion function that yields the smallest sum of differences is considered the optimal function and is used for generation of the final map of soil water storage capacities. This map can be used for the parameterization of any hydrological model for simulations of hydrological events either in the past before availability of satellite imagery or in the future. The method is demonstrated with a case study in the San Gabriel Mountains in California.",

            "abstract": "Earth is dynamic and beautiful. Understanding why, when, how, and how fast its surface changes yields information and serves as a source of inspiration. The artistic use of geoscience information can inform the public about what is happening to their planet in a non-confrontational and apolitical way. While individual images may clearly depict a landscape, photographic comparisons are necessary to clearly capture and display annual, decadal, or century-scale impacts of climate and environmental change on Earth’s landscapes. After years of effort to artistically communicate geoscience concepts with unenhanced individual photographs or pairs of images, the authors have partnered to maximize this process by using digital image enhancement technology. This is done, not to manipulate the inherent artistic content or information content of the photographs, but to insure that the comparative photo pairs produced are geometrically correct and unambiguous.\nFor comparative photography, information-rich historical photographs are selected from archives, websites, and other sources. After determining the geographic location from which the historical photograph was made, the original site is identified and eventually revisited. There, the historical photos field of view is again photographed, ideally from the original location. From nearly 250 locations revisited, about 175 pairs have been produced.\nEvery effort is made to reoccupy the original historical site. However, vegetation growth, visibility reduction, and co-seismic level change may make this impossible. Also, inherent differences in lens optics, camera construction, and image format may result in differences in the geometry of the new photograph when compared to the old. Upon selection, historical photos are cleaned, contrast stretched, brightness adjusted, and sharpened to maximize site identification and information extraction.\nTo facilitate matching historical and new images, digital files of each are overlain in an image enhancement program. The new image is resized to match the historical photo and then, using a pixel warping tool, portions of the new image are reconfigured and matched to historical pixels to create a perfect match. Through the use of digital image technology we are able to ‘clearly’ convey the realities of our changing planet.",

Precipitation and temperature data for model input were based on the A2 emissions scenario and the average of 12 Global Circulation Models downscaled to the Virtual Climate Station Network (VCSN) database for the baseline (1980-1999), 2040s (2030-2049) and 2090s (2080-2099) periods. The percentage differences between 2040s and baseline median annual runoff range from 0-34%, 4-13% and 0-94%, and differences between 2090s and baseline are 0-70%, 10-30%, and 2-111% for the Pukaki, Ahuriri, and Hakataramea catchments, respectively. The spearman’s rank correlation coefficient showed correlations between median flows and elevation in the Pukaki (0.71) and Ahuriri (0.43) catchments (α = 0.05). However, correlation between median flows with slope and elevation were -0.37 and -0.68, respectively, in the Hakataramea catchment. There was also correlation between median flows with ice (0.84) and bedrock (0.51) in Pukaki subcatchments, and with ice (0.41) and bedrock (0.54) in Ahuriri subcatchments (α = 0.05).

            "abstract": "Increasing recognition of transitional flow deposits in submarine fans has shown that the evolution of flow rheology in sediment-gravity currents can have a significant impact on the heterogeneity of deepwater sediment accumulations. Sea-cliff exposure of the Cretaceous Point Loma Formation in San Diego, California, provides a unique opportunity to document the internal variability and spatial distribution of thin, fine-grained event beds. Upper portions of beds which commonly appear as featureless mud in exposures of typical quality are revealed as thin, clast-rich debrites in areas where sea cliffs are polished by waves. The ubiquity of these deposits in distal lobe strata suggests complex rheological evolution for nearly all currents that were able to run out to lobe margins. Here we supplement qualitative outcrop characterization with statistical analysis to quantify relationships between deposit thickness, grain size, and the spatial distribution of sedimentary facies. Intervals dominated by transitional flow deposits are shown to occur vertically near the base of coarsening-upward successions and laterally toward lobe margins, reflecting a combination of dynamic processes during individual events and the spatial distribution of consecutive deposits. We show that the ability to distinguish patterns of bed-scale variability reflecting flow evolution from patterns associated with larger-scale processes, such as distributary channel avulsion and compensational stacking, is critical if one is to accurately model heterogeneity within submarine fan systems. Furthermore, the observation that thin, fine-grained debrites can be nearly impossible to distinguish from featureless mud intervals unless exceptionally well-exposed may cast doubt on existing interpretations where outcrop quality is less than remarkable.",

More recently, though, the availability of room-temperature, higher-power single-mode lasers at the mid-infrared wavelengths used by DACOM has made it possible to replace both the cryogenic lasers and detectors with thermoelectrically cooled versions. And the relative stability of these lasers has allowed us to incorporate an all-digital wavelength stabilization technique developed previously for the Diode Laser Hygrometer (DLH) instrument.

We measured root-derived 13C in respired CO2 collected at the soil surface and in leachate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) collected from the lysimeters during the growing season and in soil harvested in August 2014.\nWe found (1) soil temperature at two depths (10- and 40-cm) have been elevated by 4±0.2°C in the warmed compared to the ambient lysimeters; (2) surface (10-cm) volumetric soil moisture followed this order (unplanted-ambient > planted-ambient > planted-warming), while subsurface (40-cm) soil moisture showed little variation among treatments; (3) ecosystem respiration was enhanced by soil warming during the early growing season (March 15th and April 5th) when soil moisture was not limiting (>20%), while it was suppressed by soil warming during the late growing season (May 7th) when soil moisture was limiting (<20%), and was not significantly different among treatments towards the end of growing season (May 20th); and (4) aboveground plant biomass increased 25% with soil warming. More data including 13C values of ecosystem respiration, DOC loss, and harvested soil samples, as well as soil nutrient supply rates, microbial biomass and community structure will be presented during the meeting. Overall, these results suggest that the impact of soil warming and plant rhizosphere on ecosystem carbon cycling is dependent on season (or soil moisture level) in this Mediterranean grassland ecosystem.",

Turbulent flow is driven in the sodium by differential rotation of the inner and outer spherical shells, while an external coil applies a magnetic field in order to study hydromagnetic effects such as dynamo action. An array of 31 external Hall sensors measures the Gauss coefficients of the resulting field. The flow state is strongly dependent on Rossby number Ro = (ΩI - ΩO)/ΩO, where ΩI and ΩO are the inner and outer sphere rotation frequencies. The flow state is inferred from the torque required to drive the inner sphere. The generation of internal toroidal magnetic field through the Omega effect is measured by a Hall probe inserted into the sodium. A self-sustaining dynamo has not yet been observed at rotation speeds up to about half of the design maximum. However, continuous dipole amplification up to ~12% of a small applied field has been observed at Ro = -17.7 while bursts of dipole field have been observed up to 15% of a large external applied field at Ro = +6.0 and up to ~20% of a small applied field at Ro = +2.15.",

            "abstract": "We recently developed a new point cloud registration algorithm. Compared to Iterated Closest Point (ICP) techniques, it is robust to noise and outliers, and easier to use, as it is less sensitive to initial conditions. It minimizes the entropy of the joint point cloud (including intensity attributes to help register areas with poor relief), uses a voxel space and B-Spline interpolation to accelerate computation.\nA natural application of registration is swath alignment in airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Indeed, due to uncertainty in the inertial navigation system (INS), attitude angles are subject to time-dependent errors. Such errors can be understood as a sum of three terms: 1) a global term, or boresight error, which can be addressed using several existing techniques; 2) a low-frequency term, which is modeled as a constant attitude error for regions several hundred meters along-track; 3) a high-frequency term, responsible for corduroy artifacts (not addressed here). We propose to use the new registration algorithm to correct the low-frequency attitude variations. Relative geometric errors are significantly reduced, as pairs of swaths are registered onto each other local corrections. Absolute geometric errors are reduced during a second step, by applying all the corrections together to the entire dataset.\nWe used a test area of 200 km2 in Portugal, with a density of 3-4 pts/m2. The point clouds were derived from waveform data, and include predictive range uncertainties estimated within a Bayesian framework. The data collection was supported by FCT and FEDER as part of the AutoProbaDTM research project (2009-2012).\nModeling and reducing geometric error helps build consistent uncertainty maps. After correction, residual errors are taken into account in the final 3D error budget. For gridded elevation models a vertical uncertainty map is computed.\nFinally, it is possible to use the inter-swath registration parameters to estimate the distribution of horizontal error, which is usually difficult to assess.",

(Ulrich, et al, 2010) AutoClass identifies classes by a two-step process in which it: (1) finds, without human supervision, a set of class definitions based on specified attributes of a sample of the image data pixels, such as magnetic field and intensity in the case of MWO images, and (2) applies the class definitions thus found to new data sets to identify automatically in them the classes found in the sample set.\nHMI high resolution images capture four observables-magnetic field, continuum intensity, line depth and line width-in contrast to MWO's two observables-magnetic field and intensity. In this study, we apply AutoClass to the HMI observables for images from May, 2010 to June, 2014 to identify solar surface feature classes. We use contemporaneous TSI measurements to determine whether and how variations in the HMI classes are related to TSI variations and compare the characteristic statistics of the HMI classes to those found from MWO images. We also attempt to derive scale factors between the HMI and MWO magnetic and intensity observables.\nThe ability to categorize automatically surface features in the HMI images holds out the promise of consistent, relatively quick and manageable analysis of the large quantity of data available in these images. Given that the classes found in MWO images using AutoClass have been found to improve modeling of TSI, application of AutoClass to the more complex HMI images should enhance understanding of the physical processes at work in solar surface features and their implications for the solar-terrestrial environment.\nUlrich, R.K., Parker, D, Bertello, L. and Boyden, J. 2010, Solar Phys. , 261 , 11.",

The primary method used to control stormwater discharge and prevent downstream erosion is the use of best management practices (BMP’s) such as retention basins, detention basins and rain gardens.

The formation of the ductile shear zone under a compressional tectonic setting induces tectonic over-pressure. We first propose that an apparent shear zone originated from an elastic heterogeneity in the phase loop, which is the two-phase (i.e., olivine and spinel) coexistence interval around the 410 km boundary within subducting slabs, can cause tectonic over-pressure with a range from 0.3 to 1.5 GPa. This over-pressure significantly impacts the formation of the olivine-spinel phase transition. The flattening of the olivine-spinel interface by over-pressures are well-resolved. Therefore, we argue that the over-pressure should be applied when analyzing the phase boundary within the subducting slab. Our results provide a new insight on the interplay among the phase transition, shear zone formation and tectonic over-pressure.\n* The draft including the abstract above was submitted on 3rd Aug, 2014 with slight modification.",

Lunar calibrations are operated in April/May for investigation of continuous annual radiometric trends and in June/July, corresponding to the annual Railroad Valley Cal/Val campaign.\nJAXA’s Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) is since 2009 in polar orbit to monitor greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 from space. GOSAT consists of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) and a Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI). The FTS has 3 polarized SWIR narrow bands and a TIR wide band. The FTS observes globally with gridded points of 10 km FOV using discrete pointing. The CAI carries 4 radiometers in the UV to SWIR with high spatial resolution of 0.5-1.5 km and a wide swath of 1000 km.\nSince the 3rd year, lunar calibration has been planned to observe at a phase angle around 7 degrees from normal incidence. This choice avoids the reflectance opposition surge in order to target the nearly-unchanged and brightest reflectance as a function of phase angle. The Railroad Valley vicarious calibration campaign is conducted by measuring the surface reflectance and atmospheric parameters coincident with a dedicated GOSAT target observation, to derive top-of-the-atmosphere radiance. The nadir surface reflectance is collected in 500x500 m areas corresponding to the CAI resolution. The off-nadir reflectance is measured simultaneously with BRDF values, for correction.\nWe will summarize the radiometric study of the GOSAT lunar calibration compared with the vicarious calibration. In-flight coincident calibration activities will continue with GOSAT and OCO-2.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is regulated by biotic and abiotic processes. Feedback interactions between such processes may act to dampen oscillatory responses to perturbations from equilibrium. Indeed, although biological oscillations have been observed in small-scale laboratory incubations, the overlying behavior at the plot-scale exhibits a relatively stable response to disturbances in input rates and temperature. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of microbial models to capture nonlinear feedbacks in SOM decomposition that linear Century-type models are unable to reproduce, such as soil priming in response to increased carbon input. However, these microbial models often exhibit strong oscillatory behavior that is deemed unrealistic. The inherently nonlinear dynamics of SOM decomposition have important implications for global climate-carbon and carbon-concentration feedbacks. It is therefore imperative to represent these dynamics in Earth System Models (ESMs) by introducing sub-models that accurately represent microbial and abiotic processes.\nIn the present study we explore, both analytically and numerically, four microbe-enabled model structures of varying levels of complexity. The most complex model combines microbial physiology, a non-linear mineral sorption isotherm, and enzyme dynamics. Based on detailed stability analysis of the nonlinear dynamics, we calculate the system modes as functions of model parameters. This dependence provides insight into the source of state oscillations. We find that feedback mechanisms that emerge from careful representation of enzyme and mineral interactions, with parameter values in a prescribed range, are critical for both maintaining system stability and capturing realistic responses to disturbances. Corroborating and expanding upon the results of recent studies, we explain the emergence of oscillatory responses and discuss the appropriate microbe-enabled model structure for inclusion in ESMs.",

            "abstract": "From 2002-2012, number of Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs) increased from 36,000 to 1.6 million (44 times) and is projected to reach 4.0 million by 2020. Deploying NGVs is an effective way to relieve Chinese air pollution, since NGVs can reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM) and NOx by 91% and 59% compared to gasoline vehicles (GVs). However, previous studies in US showed that NGVs might emit more methane (CH4) than GVs, which is an important greenhouse gas and a precursor to air pollution. Despite the tremendous growth of NGVs and importance of CH4, CH4 emissions from NGVs in China haven’t been carefully studied yet. During CAREBEIJING field campaign in 2013 and 2014, we used a mobile platform to conduct on-road measurement of CH4, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and NH3 (ammonia) in Beijing, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, China. We found that the mean on-road CH4:CO2 ratio from NGVs is (0.004±0.0003) g CH4/g CO2, which is 20 times higher than previous report on CH4:CO2 emission ratio from US cars. Although NGVs can reduce 25% CO2 compared to GVs, CH4 emitted from NGVs would diminish this number to 19%. Using this emission ratio, we estimate that NGVs in China emitted 37 Gg CH4 in 2010. CH4 emissions from NGVs would increase to 207 Gg in 2020 (by a factor of 560%) if no regulation of CH4 emissions from NGVs were implemented. Most of these emissions occur in urban areas, requiring analyses of their impacts on air quality in such regions. Therefore, a mass balance model is used to study the proportion of CH4 emissions from NGVs in total urban CH4 emissions for Baoding city. Finally, in order to better inform policy decisions, a life-cycle analysis is made to estimate potential CH4 emissions from NGV related industrials. Overall, NGVs are promising alternative fuel vehicles in China, but more attention should be paid to quantify their CH4 emissions.",

This study diagnoses the temporal and spatial evolution as well as the thermodynamics and dynamics of LSMPs during extreme CCV hot spells.\nHot spells begin when at least 6 of 15 CCV stations are in the highest 5% of their normalized daily maximum temperature anomaly (using each station’s long term daily mean, LTDM, and LTDM standard deviation). Hot spells must persist at least 3 consecutive days and be separated from other events by 6 days or longer. 22 such events occur during summer (JJAS) 1981-2010. Air parcel trajectories arrive at the critical region for high temperature anomaly from different origins. During the last 4 days leading up to a hot spell onset, air parcels commonly move downward several hundred hPa. Prior to this sinking, two thirds of the parcels (cluster 1) come from the far west (west of 160W) while the rest (cluster 2) from various directions near the CCV.\nThe LSMP evolves as follows: a strong ridge off NE Asia and a stronger trough to the east both upstream of North America, amplify a west coast ridge. In both clusters wave activity flux (WAF) propagates across the North Pacific. In mid to lower troposphere, sinking motion over western North America is coupled to offshore flow. In cluster 1 the upper troposphere WAF off Asia is from the middle and higher latitudes; in the lower troposphere warm anomalies form and amplify along the California coastline. Cluster 2 WAF off Asia is from middle and subtropical latitudes, revealing Rossby wave propagation from the tropics not seen in cluster 1. Also in contrast, warm anomalies in cluster 2 are first prominent off the US/Canada west coast then amplify and expand southward towards California’s coast.\nObjective clustering techniques classify CCV hot spell events based on the evolution of temperature in key parts of the LSMPs. Additional dynamical and adiabatic and diabatic thermal analyses are ongoing and will be shown for each cluster.",

            "abstract": "We have conducted a sequence of high pressure experiments to study water solubility in aluminous magnesium silicate perovskite as a function of pressure at 1900oC. The experimental high pressures were generated using multi-anvil presses at Bayerisches Geoinstitut (BGI) for pressures up to 28 GPa and at Geodynamics Research Center (GRC) for pressures above 30GPa. The starting material for these experiments was a mixture of oxides (Mg(OH)2, Al2O3 and SiO2) with equivalent of about 5 mol % of Al2O3 and 15 wt % of H2O. The structure and composition of the perovskite phase after high P/T syntheses were examined using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Water concentration in the sample was measured using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The measurements yield that the aluminous magnesium silicate perovskite with about 2 wt% of Al2O3 may take as much as 0.13 wt % of H2O at the P/T condition of the top of the Earth’s lower mantle and this solubility increases significantly with pressure. At the bottom of Earth’s lower mantle, this perovskite may take nearly a couple of weight percent of water according to simple extrapolation of the experiment result, indicating that the capacity of water reservoir of the lower mantle can be as large as a few to ten oceans of water.",

            "abstract": "Arroyos in the Southwestern United States have experienced multiple cut-and-fill cycles in the late Quaternary. Extensive studies fo the Lower Rio Puerco, New Mexico, USA, show that it has most recently progressed from an (1) unincised state with a broad floodplain in the mid 1800s, through a period of (2) incision, forming a deep gully with steep walls by the early 1900s, and to the (3) present-day stage of arroyo widening and filling. The arroyo cycle is driven by a combination of autogenic processes and external forcings, although the relative influence of each process is under debate.\nWe use the morphodynamic model ANUGA to explore the influences of discharge, sediment transport, and vegetation on the geomorphic evolution of the Lower Rio Puerco through the arroyo cycle. The predictive power of the numerical model is first established by using it to hind-cast the morphologic evolution of a reach of the river during a large flood in 2006, and comparing the model predictions to real-world magnitudes and patterns of topographic change recorded for this event by multi-temporal airborne lidar. The morphodynamic model is then used to simulate the response of this stream to floods in the past. A comprehensive dataset of the topography and hydrology of the Lower Rio Puerco since the 1920s is used to reproduce the morphology of the arroyo at multiple points in time, and historical descriptions serve to extrapolate these into the 19th century. We test the sensitivity of the reconstructed landscapes to changes in peak discharge, sediment supply, and the distribution and characteristics of vegetation in order to determine the relative influence of each forcing in the evolution of the stream, and to understand how the interactions of different processes could drive its progression through the arroyo cycle.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds are one of the largest sources of uncertainties in predicting future climate. Ice nucleation and ice crystal growth inside cirrus clouds require ice supersaturation (ISS). Previously, remote sensing observations have shown that the locations of cirrus clouds’ cloud top height are highly correlated with the thermal tropopause height (Pan and Munchak, 2011). However, it is unclear if the initial conditions of cirrus clouds – ice supersaturated region (ISSRs) – have similar features in the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS). In fact, the dynamical processes and conditions that contribute to ISS formation from the microscale (~100 m) to the mesoscale (~100 km) are still not well understood.\nIn this work, we present in-situ observations of ISS and ice crystals with ~200 m horizontal resolution at temperatures ≤ -40°C. Our analyses are based on the NSF Stratosphere Troposphere Analyses of Regional Transport (START08) Campaign, which sampled chemical and microphysical variables under various dynamical conditions near the extratropical tropopause and upper level jets.\nOne of the key analyses is about the influences of jet stream and extratropical thermal tropopause on the formation of ice supersaturated regions (ISSRs) and ice crystals. We found that most of the ISSRs are vertically constrained by the thermal tropopause height, agreeing with the findings of cirrus cloud top constraint (Pan and Munchak, 2011). In addition, the number of ISSRs observed on the anti-cyclonic side of the jet is ~1.6 times of that on the cyclonic side, consistent with previous model simulations (Gierens and Brinkop, 2012). Based on the O3-CO and O3-H2O tracer-tracer correlations, two different air mass mixing scenarios are found: stratosphere-troposphere mixing and troposphere-troposphere mixing. These different mixing scenarios are also associated with different dynamical conditions: small-scale waves/turbulence and large scale uplifting, respectively. Understanding the dynamical conditions of ISSR and cirrus clouds and the related microphysical properties will ultimately improve the simulation of cirrus clouds and the prediction of their radiative forcing in the future climate.",

            "abstract": "Given that K-12 students have numerous alternative conceptions, it is critical that teachers have an understanding of the fundamental science underlying climate change (Feldman et al., 2010). Many teachers, however, do not demonstrate adequate understanding of these concepts (Daskolia et al., 2006).\nArgumentation has been identified as a mechanism for conceptual change (Mercer et al., 2004). Even with several educational initiatives promoting and supporting the use of argumentation as an instructional practice, teachers often struggle to implement argumentation in the classroom (Sampson & Blanchard, 2012).\nTo remedy both issues above, we have designed an innovative methods course to provide background in climate change knowledge and argumentation instruction. In our methods course, we utilize Climate Science Investigations (CSI), an online, interactive series of modules and teaching resources funded by a NASA grant to support teachers learning about the basic science concepts underlying climate change. A key assignment is to develop and present an evidence-based scientific argument. The teachers were assigned a typical question and claim of climate skeptics and asked to conduct research on the scientific findings to prepare a counter-argument (rebuttal).\nThis study examined changes in 60 preservice teachers’ knowledge and perceptions about climate change after participation in the course. The teachers’ understanding of fundamental concepts increased significantly. Their perceptions about climate change became more aligned to those of climate scientists. Findings suggest that scientific argumentation can play an effective role in the preparation of science educators. In addition to reporting findings in more detail, methods course activities, particularly in argumentation, will be shared in our presentation.",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution of the b value under volcanoes and other tectonic environments is not uniform but it rather shows pockets of anomalies related to different phenomena. We analyzed the frequency-magnitude distribution of the 2191 best located volcano-tectonic events with MD ≥ 2.1 under the Popocatepetl volcano and performed 2D and 3D maps using a griding technique. For the 3D mapping we used samples of 100 events within spherical volumes with radii ≤ 3 km. Also, only volumes with σ ≤ 0.3 were taken into account. Three main anomalies with b ≥ 2.2 were detected within a normal crust (b ≤ 1.6). The first anomaly is observed north of the crater summit at depths 4-8 km and comprises a volume of approximately 15 km3. The second lies slightly to the E and SE of the crater at depths between 2 and 5 km, and the third and latter anomaly is located SE of the summit at depths of 6-12 km and spans over a volume of 40 km3 (or greater). In any case, we interpret our high b values anomalies as regions were high pore pressures (low effective stresses), high thermal gradients and/or high heterogeneity take place due to the presence of a magmatic body nearby. Whilst we cannot know with certainty if the source of the anomaly located N of the crater is a dyke complex or a shallow magma chamber, we infer that the shallowest volume mapped is related to Popocatepetl’s plumbing system. The greatest anomalous volume located at the SE is thought to represent the main shallow magma chamber, since it is located at depths similar to those found in other volcanoes in the world and correlates with previous geophysical studies carried out at Popocatepetl.",

We have shown that dimmings occurred in most of the 31 X-class flares that occurred between SDO launch and the end of April 2014. Based upon earlier X-ray observations, we interpret these dimmings as the result of CME mass ejections from the low corona. We can estimate the masses involved in these dimmings by deriving a best pre-event temperature and emission measure in the dimmed region from EVE, and a source volume from AIA images. The dimming for SOL2011-02-15, the first of these events, \"peaked\" at -3.4% in Fe IX in terms of the pre-event emission from the whole Sun, with smaller relative depletions in higher ionization states of Fe. Because of its high photon throughput, EVE data determine line centroids with precisions of a few km/s equivalent. In the present study we analyze the wavelengths of the dimmed regions, characterizing their displacements from the mean wavelengths as functions of heliographic position, time, event magnitude, and excitation state of Fe.",

            "abstract": "With the rate of Arctic sea ice decline increasing over the past decade, and ice-free conditions in the central Arctic predicted for the second half of this century, it is increasingly important to put sea-ice decline in the context of natural variability. Unfortunately, satellite observations of sea ice only extend back to 1979, and direct observations before then are spotty at best. Recently, there have been several advances in sea ice proxies. Specifically improvements in diatom-based proxies and the molecular biomarker, IP25, have allowed quantitative reconstructions of Arctic sea ice.\nHere we apply our own IP25 and diatom assemblage sea ice calibrations for the Bering and Chukchi seas to two cores in the Bering Sea that extend to the Last Glacial Maximum in order to explore differences in the proxy records. In addition, we present high-resolution grain size analyses as a way to test the presence or absence of sea ice.\nBefore 14.5 ka, the sediments are composed of up to 20% clay by volume, reflecting transport by sea ice or from a proximal coastline during this time of lowered sea level. IP25 indicates extensive sea ice and the diatom assemblages are dominated by Thalassiosira antarctica and pennate benthic diatoms. Today, T. antarctica is associated with heavy winter and spring sea ice and forms resting spores during an abrupt advance of sea ice in the fall. The pennate benthic taxa include rare instances of IP25-producing species as well as other Naviculoid species that are commonly found attached to spring sea ice.\nBetween 14.5 and 12 ka, clay sized particles make up only 8% of the sediments and IP25 indicates that sea ice was absent from both locations. However, diatoms commonly found in the marginal ice zone today such as Fragilariopsis spp. Thalassiosira hyalina, and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii are common.\nSea ice was extensive (up to 60% annual coverage) at both sites during the Last Glacial Maximum and it declined during the deglaciation. IP25 indicates that sea ice was absent at both sites after 14.5 ka, except for a minor advance during the Younger Dryas. However, in contrast, diatom assemblages indicate that sea ice was present until 11 ka. We hypothesize that two different ice conditions existed, with the more recent ice unsuitable for IP25-producers.",

The adjoint of the data assimilation process is needed to evaluate the effect of observations on forecasts.

The retrospective optimal interpolation (ROI) is a new data assimilation scheme which was derived from the quasi-static variational assimilation (QSVA) algorithm and introduced by Song et al. (2009).\nThe Kalman gain of the reduced-rank ROI includes the tangent linear of the forecast model and the adjoint of the forecast model. Therefore, using the Kalman gain of the reduced-rank ROI, the four dimensional distribution of optimal observations can be estimated properly. In addition, because the Kalman gain of the reduced-rank ROI is defined in a low dimension subspace, it is easy to calculate the transpose of the Kalman gain matrix. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 40-variable model. \nKey words: adaptive observation, forecast sensitivity to observation, retrospective optimal interpolation.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) composition is a key property that underpins ecosystem productivity. Understanding its physical, chemical and biological properties is important for evaluating its role in carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, the stability of SOM (i.e., resistance to microbial degradation) has important implications in ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling, emission of greenhouse gases from soil, and C sequestration. Thus there is interest in developing new ways to measure and quantify the labile and stable forms of soil organic carbon.\nIn this presentation, we describe the combined use of thermal decomposition methods based on pyrolysis, and chemical properties using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), to describe the stability of soil organic matter. Soils (n=81) for this study were obtained from a wide geographical range and management practices. Controlled respiration studies were conducted on the soils to determine the biodegradability of organic C after 98 days. In the thermal analysis, the sample is subjected to a temperature ramp and pyrolyzed/volatilized organic C was recorded as a function of temperature. Analysis by XAS provided information on the types of C functional groups present in a soil sample. We show that biological stability is well described using a two component model which included thermal stability and C composition chemistry.",

            "abstract": "To account for the presence of seismic anisotropy within the crust and to estimate the relevant parameters, we first discuss a robust technique for the analysis of shear-wave splitting in layered anisotropic media by using converted shear phases. In (weakly) anisotropic media, the P-to-S converted phases (Ps) exhibit a distinct variation in arrival time (cosine moveout) as function of back-azimuth. This variation can be exploited by time-shifting and stacking radial receiver functions to constrain a range of possible splitting parameters (i.e. the fast-polarization direction and the delay time) for an anisotropic layer. Then, the minimization of the transverse-component energy is used to select the pair of splitting parameters that best describes the anisotropic properties of the layer. This 2-step approach stabilizes the inversion process and significantly reduces the time for computing the best splitting parameters. In multi-layered anisotropic media, the splitting parameters for the individual layers can be inferred by a layer-stripping approach, where the splitting effect due shallower layers on converted phases from deeper discontinuities is successively corrected. The method represents a computationally-efficient extension to multiple anisotropic layers. We further investigate the influences of noise and of gaps in the azimuthal distribution of events.\nThe effect of anisotropy on the estimate of crustal thickness and average bulk Vp/Vs ratio can be significant. Here, we present a stacking scheme that extends the approach of Zhu & Kanamori (2000) to include P-to-S converted waves and their crustal reverberations generated in the anisotropic case. A ray-based algorithm is used to calculate amplitudes and arrival times of all phases generated in an anisotropic medium with hexagonal symmetry and a horizontal symmetry axis. The anisotropic parameters of the medium are first estimated using the splitting analysis of the Ps-phase as described above. Then, a grid-search is performed over layer thickness and Vp/Vs ratio, while accounting for all relevant arrivals in the anisotropic medium. Synthetic examples show the robustness of the stacking approach in the anisotropic case. Further applications of the stacking approach to real data illustrate the feasibility of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic fields depending on three spatial coordinates generally have the feature that neighboring field lines exponentiate away from each other and become stochastic. Such a generic condition usually occurs in space and astrophysical plasmas, such as coronal magnetic field entangled by photospheric footpoint shuffling, as well as in fusion plasmas in the presence of multiple tearing modes. Under the condition of large exponentiation, the ideal constraint of preserving magnetic field line connectivity becomes exponentially sensitive to small deviations from ideal Ohm's law, which may potentially lead to rapid magnetic reconnection. This idea of breaking field line connectivity by stochasticity is tested with numerical simulations based on reduced magnetohydrodynamics equations with a strong guide field line-tied to two perfectly conducting end plates. Starting from an ideally stable force-free equilibrium, the system is allowed to undergo resistive relaxation. Two distinct phases are identified in the process of resistive relaxation. During the quasi-static phase, it is found that regions of high field line exponentiation (akin to quasi-separatrix-layers) are associated with rapid change of field line connectivity and strong induced flow. However, although the field line connectivity of individual field lines can change rapidly, the overall pattern of footpoint mapping appears to deform gradually. From this perspective, field line exponentiation appears to cause enhanced diffusion rather than reconnection. In some cases, it is found that resistive quasi-static evolution can cause the ideally stable initial equilibrium to cross a stability threshold. Onset of the instability leads to formation of intense current filaments, followed by rapid change of field line mapping into a qualitatively different pattern. It is in this onset phase that the change of field line connectivity may be more appropriately designated as magnetic reconnection. Our results reveal and address the difficulty in distinguishing magnetic reconnection from enhanced diffusion in the presence of field line stochasticity. Rapid change of field line connectivity appears to be a necessary, but may not be sufficient, condition for fast reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Abyssal θ-S variations observed since June 2011 by the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) reveal a potential temperature range of 0.025°C, and a salinity range of more than 0.0025 g kg-1. The very large temperature range is associated with episodic cold events (Lukas et al.2001; Alford et al. 2011). The salinity range, while not large in absolute terms, is an order of magnitude larger than the precision of the Sea-Bird Microcat. The absolute salinity is calibrated against simultaneous Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) full-depth CTD profiles that have an accuracy of ~10-3 g kg-1. A slow drift of the SBE-37 conductivity sensor is seen, along with a sudden offset that may have been caused by a nearby glass ball implosion.\nθ-S variations are dominated by changes in density that are associated with dynamic processes. Large cooling events are associated with increases of salinity ultimately deriving from the neighboring Maui Deep. The slopes of these excursions in θ-S space are consistent with the slopes of HOT CTD depth profiles, suggesting that these are vertical changes due either to gravity currents associated with cold, salty overflow events from the Maui Deep, or to internal seiches within the Kauai Deep.\nθ-S variations that are nearly isopycnal are also seen during the slow recovery from a major cooling event in 2011. This may be due to diapycnal mixing with fresher waters above the controlling sill depth. It cannot be ruled out that some apparent salinity changes may be associated with sediment resuspension events, with subsequent deviations from the PSS-78 empirical relationship between conductivity, salinity, temperature and pressure.\nADCP records show large vacillations of along- and cross-isobath flow. Large vertical current variations are measured that are correlated with horizontal flows, likely due to the bottom slope, even after minimizing correlations to account for the unknown orientation of the ADCP.\nThe primary conclusion is that abyssal dynamics preclude the use of a time-invariant θ-S relationship for calibrating instantaneous CTD profiles.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic bubbles, which originate from breaking waves, can reflect solar radiation and thus introduce perturbations to ocean surface reflectance patterns. Unlike whitecaps, which are also generated from breaking waves, the impacts of oceanic bubbles on atmospheric aerosol retrievals have yet to receive attention from the community. In this study, a linked oceanic and atmospheric radiative transfer model is constructed. The linked radiative transfer system is validated through inter-comparison with MODIS radiance data and is further applied for evaluating the potential uncertainties in satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals due to oceanic bubbles. An emphasis of the study is to explore the contribution of oceanic bubbles to the Elevated Southern Oceans Anomaly (ESOA), a band of unusually high AOD values present in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol products over high latitude southern oceans. Past studies suggest that the greatest part of the ESOA feature is from cloud contamination but that clouds cannot explain the entire observed AOD anomaly. This study examines the linkage between the ESOA phenomenon and oceanic bubbles.",

            "abstract": "Differences in lava composition between Hawaiian volcanoes likely result from the melting of a heterogeneous mantle source containing variable amounts and/or types of ancient recycled oceanic crust (sediment, basalt, and/or gabbro). Our previous model calculations based on average incompatible trace element abundances suggest that the mantle sources of Hawaiian volcanoes contain ~8-21% recycled oceanic crust (ROC) [1]. The ROC within the Hawaiian mantle plume (basalt and gabbro, with no marine sediment) was altered by interaction with seawater or hydrothermal fluids and then variably dehydrated in an ancient subduction zone. The uppermost portion of the residual slab (gabbro-free and strongly dehydrated) is best expressed in the source of Loihi lavas, whereas the lowermost portion of the residual slab (gabbro-rich and weakly dehydrated) is best expressed in the source of Mauna Loa and Koolau lavas. Here we investigate the origin of chemical heterogeneity within the mantle source of a single Hawaiian volcano based on new modeling of trace element abundances in 80 Kilauea lavas and tephra erupted over the last millenium. The results using our simplest model [1] suggest that the amount of recycled basalt (dehydrated from ~2-9%) and gabbro within the mantle source tapped by Kilauea has ranged from ~9-14% and ~0-3%, respectively. The total amount of ROC correlates with the inferred melt fraction (~3-9%), which indicates that the fertility of the mantle source is the primary control on the degree of partial melting at Hawaiian shield volcanoes. These model results for Kilauea bridge those for the neighboring active volcanoes (Mauna Loa and Loihi), confirming that the Hawaiian plume is heterogeneous on a small scale with a NW-SE oriented spatial gradient in the amount, type (i.e., basalt vs. gabbro) and extent of dehydration of the ancient ROC [1].\n[1] Pietruszka et al.

            "abstract": "Steep rocky hillslopes dominate the areal extent of rapidly uplifting mountain ranges, and pose a significant hazard to encroaching population centers. Existing models for hillslope sediment transport developed for soil-mantled landscapes are poorly suited to explain the evolution of steep hillslopes characterized by: (1) intermittent or patchy soil cover, (2) slopes that exceed the angle of repose, and (3) transport events that often involve long travel distances. Recently, nonlocal formulations of hillslope sediment transport laws that account for long travel distances have been proposed to overcome the limitations of traditional continuum-based models. However, their application to natural landscapes has been limited owing to few field constraints on key parameters, and computational difficulties expanding the framework to two-dimensions. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a series of field experiments on natural hillslopes to inform a simple particle-based model of hillslope sediment transport. We compiled the distribution of average velocity and transport distance for over 300 stones ranging in diameter from 2-10 cm using a video camera and laser range-finder. To characterize surface roughness, we used a tripod-based laser scanner to generate a 1 cm-resolution digital elevation model of each 30 m long hillslope. We find that hillslope travel distance follows a heavy-tailed distribution that varies systematically with the ratio of particle diameter to roughness height, in general agreement to published laboratory experiments. Mean particle velocity ranges from 1-3 m/s and scales weakly with distance traveled. Our modeling exercise reveals three key effects that should be included in any treatment of steep hillslope evolution: (1) there is a strong grain-size and surface roughness dependence on sediment transport distance, (2) sediment storage on slopes steeper than the angle of repose is possible due to vegetation or topographic roughness, and (3) sediment flux from steep rocky hillslopes depends on both slope and the temporal evolution of surface roughness, e.g., due to landslides or wildfire.",

            "abstract": "Ecological discussions concerning alternative stable states theory suggest that tropical forest ecosystems could shift to qualitatively different alternative states upon catastrophic disturbances which exceed forest resilience. In this regard, it is expected that changes in the fire regime facilitated by climate and land use alterations could lead to rapid forest cover loss, creating conditions likely to push tropical forests to tipping points, beyond which forest resilience is lost. However, there is a dearth of empirical examples of fire-driven alternative stable states involving tropical forests. Key among the constraints for this scarcity are the requirements for large scale disturbances and long-term data, both of which are scarce. However, in the West African tropical forest (referred to as the Upper Guinean forest, UGF) a number of protected areas were impacted by large fire events during the 1980s El Niño–driven droughts, providing an opportunity for testing hypotheses concerning alternative stable states in tropical forest ecosystems. This paper aims to demonstrate fire-driven alternative stable states in the deciduous forest zone of the UGF by analyzing fire activity and forest recovery in fire-impacted forest reserves. We analyzed historical Landsat and MODIS imagery to map and quantify vegetation cover change, fire frequency and fire severity patterns. Our analyses suggest that the historic fires in the 1980s were catastrophic enough to remove forest canopy, thereby triggering a landscape-scale alternative stable states. Forest cover declined substantially becoming replaced by a novel ecosystem with low tree density. Our results also indicate the establishment of a positive fire-vegetation feedback effect, such that the new vegetation which displaced severely burned forests is more pyrogenic and maintained through frequent burns. This study expands our knowledge on the vulnerability of tropical forest ecosystems to state transitions in response to fire regime changes.",

            "abstract": "Tropical peat swamp forests are widely recognized as one of the world’s most efficient ecosystems for the sequestration and storage of carbon through both their aboveground biomass and underlying thick deposits of peat. As the peat characteristics exhibit high spatial and temporal variability as well as the structural and functional complexity of forests, tropical peat ecosystems can act naturally as both carbon sinks and sources over their life cycles. Nonetheless, few reports of studies on the ecosystem-scale CO2 exchange of tropical peat swamp forests are available to-date and their present roles in the global carbon cycle remain uncertain. To quantify CO2 exchange and unravel the prevailing factors and potential underlying mechanism regulating net CO2 fluxes, an eddy covariance tower was erected in a tropical peat swamp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. We observed that the diurnal and seasonal patterns of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components (gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE)) varied between seasons and years. Rates of NEE declined in the wet season relative to the dry season. Conversely, both the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) were found to be higher during the wet season than the dry season, in which GPP was strongly negatively correlated with NEE. The average annual NEE was 385 ± 74 g C m-2 yr-1, indicating the primary peat swamp forest functioned as net source of CO2 to the atmosphere over the observation period.",

            "abstract": "On 1 April, 2014 a magnitude Mw 8.2 earthquake occurred off the coast of northern Chile less than 100 km NW of Iquique within a region of historic quiescence termed the northern Chile seismic gap. The ensuing tsunami inundation caused mostly minor damage centered in Iquique and neighbouring stretches of coastline. Fortunately, ancestral knowledge from the past 1868 and 1877 tsunamis in the region along with the recent 2010 Maule tsunami, as well as tsunami education and evacuation exercises prompted most coastal residents to spontaneously evacuate to high ground after the earthquake. There were no tsunami victims, while a handful of fatalities were associated to the earthquake and the tsunami evacuation. The local scientist deployed in the morning hours to start the tsunami survey in Iquique on the day after the earthquake. The international scientist joined the local effort from April 6 to 11. The international tsunami survey team (ITST) documented flow depths, runup heights, inundation distances, sediment deposition, damage patterns, performance of the navigation infrastructure and impact on the natural environment. The ITST covered a 700 km stretch of coastline from the Mejillones Peninsula (23.5° S) north of Antofagasta in Chile up to Vila Vila (18.1° S) in southern Peru. We surveyed 30 locations with differential GPS and laser range finders. The tsunami impact peaked in the vicinity of Iquique exceeding 4 m in tsunami height. A significant variation in tsunami impact was observed along the coastlines of Chile and Peru both at local and regional scales. The tsunami occurred in the evening hours limiting the availability of eyewitness video footages. Observations from the 2014 Chile tsunami are compared against the 1868, 1877 and 2010 Chile tsunamis. Given the magnitude of the 1 April 2014 earthquake the tsunami could have been significantly larger. However the absence of a massive tsunami may mislead residents in the future to believe another minor tsunami may be generated after an earthquake of similar magnitude. Hence the April fool’s day event poses significant challenges to community-based education. The team interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and educated residents about tsunami hazards since awareness programs are essential to save lives in locales at risk from locally generated tsunamis.",

            "abstract": "For the past several years, our research group has been developing low-cost (for reference, each unit costs under $1000) next generation air quality monitors, which utilize metal-oxide semiconductor sensors and non-dispersive infrared sensors to collect data on various gaseous pollutants. The pollutants of focus for this deployment were CO2, O3, and NO2. Additional data collected by the monitors includes temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and some information on hydrocarbon levels. A main focus of our research has been sensor characterization and exploring research applications of the technology. During summer 2014, the DISCOVER-AQ and FRAPPE sampling campaigns provided our group with the opportunity to deploy twenty monitors throughout the sampling region with the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory Tower in Erie CO at the center of our monitoring area. Thirteen of these monitors were located at ground-level within an approximately 10 by 10 km grid cell, and the rest were outside of this area at various distances. This placement was intended to provide information on pollutant variability, specifically ozone, within a remote-sensing sized grid cell. Additionally, the availability of reference monitors in the field provided opportunities for co-location during the deployment and hence, opportunities to quantify monitor performance. Analysis will include both an evaluation of low-cost sensor performance and a look at temporal and spatial variability. For example, land-use regression modeling will be used to explore population density, distance to roadways, and distance to oil and gas activity as covariates. Additionally, we will explore how the spatial distribution varies with time and look for temporal patterns.",

In order to facilitate the Sulfur isotopic ratio and Sulfur chemistry model determination, now we present Ames-296K line lists for both 626 (upgraded) and other 4 symmetric isotopologues: 636, 646, 666 and 828. The line lists are computed on an ab initio potential energy surface refined with most reliable high resolution experimental data, using a high quality CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z dipole moment surface. The most valuable part of our approach is to provide “truly reliable” predictions (and alternatives) for those unknown or hard-to-measure/analyze spectra. This strategy has guaranteed the lists are the best available alternative for those wide spectra region missing from spectroscopic databases such as HITRAN and GEISA, where only very limited data exist for 626/646 and no Infrared data at all for 636/666 or other minor isotopologues. Our general line position accuracy up to 5000 cm-1 is 0.01 – 0.02 cm-1 or better. Most transition intensity deviations are less than 5%, compare to experimentally measured quantities. Note that we have solved a convergence issue and further improved the quality and completeness of the main isotopologue 626 list at 296K. We will compare the lists to available models in CDMS/JPL/HITRAN and discuss the future mutually beneficial interactions between theoretical and experimental efforts.",

            "abstract": "Medical imaging has shown promise for unraveling the influence of physical, chemical and biological processes on contaminant transport. Micro-CT scans, for instance, are increasingly utilized to image the pore-scale structure of rocks and soils, which can subsequently be used within modeling studies. A disadvantage of micro-CT, however, is that this imaging modality does not directly detect contaminants. In contrast, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) can provide the three-dimensional distribution of gamma emitting materials and is thus ideal for imaging the transport of radionuclides. SPECT is of particular interest as a tool for both directly imaging the behavior of long-lived radionuclides of interest, e.g., 99Tc and 137Cs, as well as monitoring shorter-lived isotopes as in-situ tracers of flow and biogeochemical processes. We demonstrate the potential of combining CT and SPECT imaging to improve the mechanistic understanding of flow and transport processes within a heterogeneous porous medium. In the experiment, a column was packed with 0.2mm glass beads with a cylindrical zone of 2mm glass beads embedded near the outlet; this region could be readily identified within the CT images. The column was injected with a pulse of NaCl solution spiked with 99mTcO4- and monitored using SPECT while aliquots of the effluent were used to analyze the breakthrough of both solutes. The breakthrough curves could be approximately replicated by a one-dimensional transport model, but the SPECT data revealed that the tracers migrated around the inclusion of larger beads. Although the zone of large-diameter beads was expected to act as a preferential pathway, the observed behavior could only be replicated in numerical transport simulations if this region was treated as a low-permeability zone relative to the rest of the column. This simple experiment demonstrates the potential of SPECT for investigating flow and transport phenomena within a porous medium.",

However, recent study has suggested that the inner part of the inner core has a fast symmetry axis near the equator with a different form of anisotropy from the outer part (Wang et al., this session). To confirm the observation, we use data from dense seismic arrays of the China Regional Seismic Networks. We perform autocorrelation (ACC) of the coda after major earthquakes (Mw>=7.0) at each station and then stack the ACCs at each cluster of stations. The PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 phases (round-trip phase from the Earth’s surface reflections) can be clearly extracted from the stacked empirical Green’s functions. We observe systematic variation of the differential times between PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 phases, which are sensitive to the bulk anisotropy of the inner core. The differential times show large variations with both latitudes and longitudes, even though our ray paths are not polar (with our stations at mid-range latitudes of about 20 to 45 degrees). The observations cannot be explained by an averaged anisotropy model with the fast axis along the rotation axis. The pattern appears consistent with an inner inner core that has a fast axis near the equator.",

For our entire reanalysis period, our products also include information from the network solutions on the phase biases for the widelane data combination. This information enhances precise point positioning for single receivers, by enabling integer resolution of the GPS carrier phase biases without the need for nearby reference stations.\nIn this paper we present the processing strategy that we have used for this campaign, as well as results from the evaluation of precision and accuracy of our estimates of orbit positions, clocks, and Earth orientation parameters. This reanalysis of historical GPS data is the third that we have performed over the last 7 years. We show the evolution of the products from each campaign, highlighting the impact of successive changes to our processing approach. The most significant improvements in our most recent reanalysis occurs for the periods from 2008 onward, with 3-D orbit and clock precision reaching 2 cm and 50 picoseconds, respectively.

            "abstract": "We investigate the geometry of the Moho interface in the southern California region including the San Andreas fault (SAF), San Jacinto fault zone (SJFZ) and Elsinore fault(EF) with systematic analysis of receiver functions. The used data set consists of 145 teleseismic events recorded at 188 broadband stations throughout the region. The analysis utilizes a 3D velocity model associated with detailed double-difference tomographic results for the seismogenic depth section around the three major faults combined with a larger scale community model. A 3D ray tracing algorithm is used to produce effective 1D velocity models along each source-receiver teleseismic ray. Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacks are calculated using the set of velocity models extracted for each ray. The CCP stacks are analyzed with volumetric plots, maps of maximum CCP stack values, and projections along profiles that cross the major faults and other features of interest. The results indicate that the Moho geometry in the study area is very complex and characterized by large prominent undulations along the NE-SW direction. A zone of relatively deep Moho (~35-40 km) with overall N-S direction crosses the three major faults. A section of very thin Moho (~10 km) below and to the SE of the Salton Trough, likely associated with young oceanic crust, produces large Moho offsets at its margins. The observations also show vertical Moho offsets of ~8 km across the SAF and the SJFZ close to Cajon pass, and sections with no clear Moho phase underneath Cajon pass and adjacent to the SJFZ likely produced by complex local velocity structures in the brittle upper crust. We test and confirm the robustness of these features with respect to various parameters of the analysis procedure.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) is reaching even the most remote ecosystems. There has been an abundance of research investigating how these subsidies of reactive N may alter fundamental ecosystem characteristics such as soil organic matter (SOM) pool size. Previous studies have reported that additions of reactive N have the potential to both increase and decrease SOM content. While there are a series of different variables that may affect the size of the SOM pool it has been suggested that the lability or recalcitrance of the SOM may be related to its chemical composition (kind and relative abundance of constituent molecules). To address this we sampled 6 experimental plots in a sub-alpine forest in Rocky Mountain National Park (3 control and 3 treated with reactive N for 18 years) during two months in the summers of 2011 and 2012. We found the SOM content of the control plots was greater than that of the experimental plots. To assess lability of each SOM sample we extracted the SOM from each plot with water and incubated the dissolved organic carbon with a common aquatic microbial community from a lake within the watershed. To assess structure of the SOM pool we used ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with MS of each extract before incubation with the bacterial community.\nThe dissolved component of the SOM showed clear differences in lability both in total quantity and rate of decomposition during incubation with aquatic microorganisms. Principle components analysis indicated season was a stronger driver of DOM composition than fertilization, describing the majority of the variability between July and September 2012. When samples were considered within a season and year there were additional differences in both lability and composition of DOM. Here we evaluate the relative influence of inter- and intra-annual variability and reactive N on both the characteristics and composition of SOM. By linking UPLC-MS with a functional assay of lability we attempt to define chemical characteristics of lability that can be assessed across ecosystems. Doing so will allow us to better understand linked biogeochemical cycles (C and N) across a wide range of soil ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Growing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are increasing global temperatures. This is projected to impact human society in negative ways. Multiple geoengineering approaches have been suggested that might counteract problems created by greenhouse warming, but geoengineering itself can be problematic as some proposed methods would pose environmental risks to the oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere. I propose a new approach that would remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in the cryosphere. Carbon dioxide would be captured by seeding the atmosphere over a designated small region of central Antarctica with monoethanolamine (MEA), a well known compound commonly used for CO2 capture in submarines and industrial processes. Monoethanolamine captures and retains carbon dioxide until it encounters water. Because MEA crystals are stable when dry, they would fall from the atmosphere just in the local area where the seeding is done, and they would be naturally buried by snowfalls and preserved in the upper parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, where thawing does not occur. The carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by this process could reside safely in this geologic reservoir for thousands of years, based on known flow characteristic of the ice sheet. Also, carbon dioxide stored in this way could be recovered in the future by drilling into the ice sheet to the frozen storage zone. The CO2 Antarctic Pumpdown (CAP) concept could potentially be used to stabilize or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and then to store the carbon dioxide safely and inexpensively in a stable geologic reservoir",

These simulations are driven by the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) at the lateral boundaries, and correspond to representative concentration pathway 8.5. Comparison of the two simulations, for the current and future periods, suggests significant impact of organic soil on the sub-surface climate, including the active layer thickness and therefore the regional hydrology for the permafrost regions. The impact of organic soil on the CRCM5 simulated surface climate is modest for the current period, but appear amplified for the future period for the RCP scenario considered in this study. This study thus demonstrates the important linkages between organic soil and the regional climate characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Controlling manure-borne pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes are crucial for protecting surface and ground water as well as mitigating risks to human health. In California dairy farms, flushing of dairy manure (mainly animal feces and urine) from freestall barns and subsequent liquid-solid manure separation is a common practice for handling animal waste. The liquid manure fraction is generally pumped into the settling ponds and it goes into aerobic and/or anaerobic lagoons for extended period of time. Considering the importance of controlling pathogens in animal waste, the objective of the study was to understand the effects of anaerobic and aerobic digestions on the survival of three human pathogens in animal waste. The pathogen inactivation was assessed at four temperatures (30, 35, 42, and 50 °C), and the relationships between temperature and pathogen decay were estimated. Results showed a steady decrease of E. coli levels in aerobic and anaerobic digestion processes over the time; however, the decay rates varied with pathogens. The effect of temperature on Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes survival was different than the E. coli survival. In thermophilic temperatures (42 and 50 °C), decay rate was considerable greater compared to the mesophilic temperatures (30 and 35°C). The E. coli log reductions at 50 °C were 2.1 in both aerobic and anaerobic digestions after 13 days of incubation. The Salmonella spp. log reductions at 50 °C were 5.5 in aerobic digestion, and 5.9 in anaerobic digestion. The Listeria monocytogenes log reductions at 50 °C were 5.0 in aerobic digestion, and 5.6 in anaerobic digestion. The log reduction of E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogens at 30 °C in aerobic environment were 0.1, 4.7, and 5.6, respectively. In anaerobic environment, the corresponding reductions were 0.4, 4.3, and 5.6, respectively. We anticipate that the outcomes of the study will help improving the existing animal waste management processes to control manure-borne pathogens.",

            "abstract": "Spanning over Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is the home of several hundred million people and the “bread basket” for much of South Asia. The flat terrain, fertile soils, and favorable climate of the IGP make it agriculturally productive. However prolonged droughts caused by consecutive monsoon failures can seriously affect crop production and social wellbeing, in particular for the eastern part of the plains where agriculture remains largely rain-fed. Severe droughts were observed in the IGP historically, and recent paleoclimate studies reveal that more severe and long-lasting “mega-droughts” had happened in the distant past. Agricultural losses from major droughts can dramatically affect food systems and increase the vulnerability of resource-poor people given the delicate balance between food supply and demand under growing natural resource scarcity. To estimate the potential impacts of “mega-droughts” on the water and food systems in the IGP, we develop worst-case drought scenarios through inverse modeling of tree-ring-based PDSI reconstruction that covers the period 1300-1899 (A.D.), and analyze these historic mega-drought scenarios using IFPRI’s IMPACT global water and food projections model. The base year of the IMPACT model is parameterized using socioeconomic and engineering data that reflect today’s water management and infrastructure, agricultural technologies, population, income, and market institutions. The base year simulation is validated against observations to ensure model fidelity. Anticipated changes of the above factors in the future out to 2050 are specified using demographic and economic growth projections and literature data. Model simulation results represent the consequences of mega-droughts in the IGP given technological and socioeconomic conditions of today and in the future. We also explore policy options for increasing the resilience of water and food systems in the IGP, through scenario analysis, and recommendations are made concerning investment in water infrastructure and agricultural technologies, in addition to trade policies.",

The presence of molecules above the transition region provides an extreme example of complex structure and dynamics at the chromosphere-corona interface. There are two morphological models that can explain the absorption features: cool plasma hundreds of kilometers above the photosphere or a localized transition region deeply embedded in the photosphere.

            "abstract": "Tightly coupled to biodiversity, terrestrial carbon, climate change, and land value, forest-cover change is among the most drastic land cover changes on Earth’s surface. The size of individual events of forest loss and gain are important for inferring natural and anthropogenic drivers of forest change and for estimating carbon flux due to disturbance and regrowth. The size-frequency distribution of forest-change patches, usually modeled using power-law functions, provides a mechanism for prescribing disturbance scenarios in carbon and ecosystem models. Using a global, Landsat-based forest-cover and -change dataset, we examine the patch-size distribution of forest-cover changes in China from 2000 to 2005. China has reported a 19,860 km2/yr increase in forest area in the 1990s and 30,000 km2/yr after 2000. However, recent results show a disagreement between remotely sensed forest-area changes and official national forest inventories, observing that forest gains were offset by losses in the same periods. Understanding the spatial pattern of gains and losses is therefore of considerable importance for evaluating and making forestry policies. We examine the hypothesis that each province has a unique relationship between size and frequency for forest losses or gains and seek explanation for this variation in the different drivers of forest change among the provinces.",

            "abstract": "The Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina are characterized by surface exposures of Precambrian basement blocks. These uplifts segment the modern Andean foreland basin. This study uses the synorogenic sedimentary record to determine the timing of basin reorganization in the northwest Sierras Pampeanas tectonic province. Results shown here will test if basin reorganization coincides with the hypothesized onset of flat slab subduction determined using independent data sets. Specifically, this study focuses on the Los Colorados Range near Vinchina, La Rioja, Argentina (~ 28 ̊S). Here, we apply new geochronological constraints using U-Pb geochronology on zircons in intercalated ash layers to provide age control on a >10 km synorogenic section. We couple this age control with changes in paleoflow direction determined from provenance analysis on detrital cobbles and paleocurrent indicators. An abrupt change from thick channelized fluvial deposits to thin paleosol horizons requires a major change in the regional environment. We hypothesize that this basin reorganization is the result of basement block uplifts driven by the onset of flat slab subduction in the Miocene. The Sierras Pampeanas are an important natural laboratory for studying the interaction between slab orientation and surface geology. Here, the onset of modern flat slab subduction occurs shortly before a change in basin organization which is preserved in the sedimentary record. This link is important in interpreting the geological history of areas where the slab orientation is no longer preserved.",

            "abstract": "While the heterogeneous oxidation of atmospheric organic aerosols influences their effects on climate, air quality, and visibility, a more detailed understanding of the chemical mechanisms in heterogeneous oxidation is crucial for improving models of their chemical evolution in the atmosphere. Previous experimental work in our lab has shown two general reaction pathways for organic aerosol upon oxidation: functionalization, which adds additional oxygen functional groups to the carbon skeleton, and fragmentation, which leads to C-C bond scission and lower molecular weight oxidized products. Furthermore, these pathways were also found to be dependent on molecular structure, with more branched or oxidized hydrocarbons undergoing more fragmentation than less branched or oxidized hydrocarbons. However, while the mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation have been studied extensively in the gas phase, to what extent the gas phase mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation can be reliably applied to heterogeneous or bulk oxidation in aerosol remains unclear.\nTo investigate the role of the condensed phase and molecular structure in the mechanism of heterogeneous organic aerosol oxidation, stochastic kinetics models are developed and compared to measurements of the products in the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Within the aerosol bulk, condensed phase rate coefficients and product branching ratios for peroxy reactions lead to different product distributions than those expected from gas phase peroxy reactions due to the presence of the liquid radical cage at the reaction site. As a result, tertiary alcohols and ketones were found to be the predominate products in the oxidation of squalane as observed in experiments. As the aerosol becomes further oxidized, β-scission of alkoxy radicals with neighboring functional groups is the primary fragmentation pathway leading to lower volatility products. In conjunction with this fragmentation mechanism, elimination of CO2 from acyloxy radicals was also found to be an important reaction leading to further fragmentation.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of trends in peak snow water equivalent (SWE) have underscored the value of long-term series of peak SWE. Since the late 1970s the US Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has used snow pillows at snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL) stations to measure the pressure of the overlying snowpack to provide a real-time daily record of SWE. The SNOTEL stations therefore provide direct observations of peak SWE whenever it occurs. However, snow-course SWE measurements recorded manually by the NRCS and its predecessor, the Soil Conservation Service, date back as far as the 1930s, but typically include only four SWE measurements per year, on the first of February, March, April, and May. While the April 1 measurement is typically assumed to represent annual peak SWE, this has been shown to underestimate the actual peak by as much as 12%.\nTo more accurately estimate peak SWE for snow-course sites, a procedure was developed to estimate daily niveographs (graphs of SWE versus time) for these sites using median daily niveographs derived from period-of-record daily SWE values for selected nearby SNOTEL sites. Recognizing that different physical processes drive the shape of the niveograph during the accumulation, peak, and melt phases, separate techniques were used to adjust the shape of the median niveographs for each of these phases. The procedure was tested by selecting two SNOTEL sites in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, and treating them as though they were Snow course sites with just 4 SWE measurements per year. The estimated peak SWE values were then compared with the actual observed values. Results showed good agreement between estimated and observed peak SWE values, and an improvement over the assumption that April 1 SWE represents the peak.",

Second, 2-D Microscope images of the replicates are collected and 3-D ice crystal shapes are generated by a specialized photogrammetry method.

            "abstract": "According to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration (EIA), domestic production of natural gas from shale formations is currently at the highest levels in U.S. history. Shale gas production may also result in the production of natural gas plant liquids (NGPLs) such as ethane and propane as well as natural gas condensate composed of a complex mixture of non-methane hydrocarbons containing more than ~5 carbon atoms (e.g., hexane, cyclohexane, and benzene). The amounts of natural gas liquids and condensate produced depends on the particular reservoir. The source signature of primary emissions of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere within each shale play will therefore depend on the composition of the raw natural gas as well as the industrial processes and equipment used to extract, separate, store, and transport the raw materials. Characterizing the primary emissions of VOCs from natural gas production is critical to assessing the local and regional atmospheric impacts such as the photochemical formation of ozone and secondary formation of organic aerosol.\nThis study utilizes ground-based measurements of a full suite of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in two western U.S. basins, the Uintah (2012-2014 winter measurements only) and Denver-Julesburg (winter 2011 and summer 2012), and airborne measurements over the Haynesville, Fayetteville, and Marcellus shale basins (summer 2013). By comparing the observed VOC to propane enhancement ratios, we show that each basin has a unique VOC source signature associated with oil and natural gas operations. Of the shale basins studied, the Uintah basin had the largest overall VOC to propane enhancement ratios while the Marcellus had the lowest. For the western basins, we will compare the composition of oxygenated VOCs produced from photochemical oxidation of VOC precursors and contrast the oxygenated VOC mixture to a “typical” summertime urban VOC mixture. The relative roles of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and cycloalkanes as precursors for C2-C6 aldehydes and ketones, and C3-C4 alkyl nitrates will be investigated.",

            "abstract": "It is generally accepted that oxygen in the atmosphere rose in two major steps at around 2.4-2.2 and 0.7-0.5 billion years ago. The variation in atmosphere oxygen over the last 500 million years, is considered to have been relatively minor by comparison. Sedimentary pyrite from marine shales efficiently captures many trace elements from the oceans, providing a novel proxy for seawater chemistry. Here we use temporal changes in the selenium and cobalt content of Phanerozoic marine pyrite, coupled with the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in marine carbonate, to argue for five dramatic pO2 cycles, each starting with a period of oxygenation, followed by a period of de-oxygenation. The selenium proxy is based on the premise that increased erosion of continental rocks leads to the release of selenium as both the selenate and selenite species. Under neutral to alkaline, oxygenated conditions the selenate species remains highly soluble, where it can be readily transported via river systems to the ocean. Cobalt on the other hand becomes less soluble under increasing pO2 as the oxidized species Co2+ and CoO are immobilised by Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides, that form during weathering. Thus variations in the Se and Co composition of marine pyrite enable us to propose a new oxygenation proxy; the ratio Se/Co, which increases in marine pyrite during periods of increasing pO2 (oxygenation) and decreases during periods of decreasing pO2 (deoxygenation). The first half of each of the five Phanerozoic pO2 cycles involves an increase in atmosphere/ocean oxygenation driven initially by supercontinent dispersal, increased continental erosion and nutrient trace element flux to the oceans. Increased marine productivity leads to carbon and sulphur sequestration, producing metalliferous black shales, and further drives oxygenation to the peak of the cycle. The cycle downside suggests decreasing oxidative erosion and nutrient delivery, resulting in a drop in productivity. Continued drawdown of ocean trace elements leads to a productivity crisis and widespread depletion of trace elements in the oceans, ultimately contributing to three of the five major Phanerozoic marine mass extinction events. Continental erosion rates and trace element nutrient flux are suggested as the prime drivers of the cycles.",

Middleton is a tectonically uplifted island in the Gulf of Alaska and perfectly positioned to record changes in climate over the North Pacific. Organic matter accumulation at the site, determined by radiocarbon dating, is closely related to the site’s hydrology. Climate-related vegetation changes are determined using distributions of leaf wax n-alkanes, pollen, and macrofossils. D/H ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes reconstruct temperature and hydroclimate changes, while dust flux measurements provide paleo-wind information. We sampled the upper portion of the Middleton Island peat stratigraphy at 0.25 cm resolution (approximately annual) to establish a connection between our paleo-proxies and the instrumental climate record. We then analyzed the entire stratigraphy at 1 cm resolution (4-6 years per sample) to complete a record of North Pacific climate spanning ~6,000 years. Beyond the importance of this record to our understanding of the climate system, our record of climate and dust flux at Middleton impacts our understanding of the role of dust in the global carbon cycle. Iron-rich dust—such as that carried offshore from the Alaskan mainland—is crucial for marine productivity, especially in the Fe-limited North Pacific. By reconstructing climate and dust flux in the same samples at this sensitive location, we can better understand the climate conditions that favor the North Pacific as a carbon sink.",

            "abstract": "The goal of the Indianapolis Flux Project (INFLUX) is to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Indianapolis using high-resolution atmospheric inversions. The mesoscale model WRF is being used to simulate regional meteorology over the area. In order to accurately quantify the GHG emissions, it is important to optimize atmospheric transport, including simulation of the meteorological conditions characteristic of urban environments. Urban environments have their own unique effects on local meteorology, which typically include but are not limited to: increases in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height, increases in surface air temperature, decreases in surface water vapor flux, and an increase in the land surface temperature, all relative to a rural, more heavily vegetated environment. Our goal is to evaluate the modeled meteorology with observations, identify discrepancies, and identify ways to reduce these discrepancies, which will lead to a more accurate assessment of GHG emissions through the use of an atmospheric inversion.\nUsing different urban canopy models that are available in WRF, discrepancies in the meteorology over the urban areas of Indianapolis were assessed. The modeled results, which spanned from July to August 2013, have been compared to the following meteorological observations: surface air temperatures, surface wind data, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. A custom WRF modification was created in order to reduce the overestimation of urban land cover that was present in the default version of WRF. This modified version of WRF allowed for a more realistic representation of the land surface characteristics and led to more accurate modeled meteorology over the urban domain. By reducing the errors in the meteorology through the use of these WRF modifications, we hope to increase the accuracy of GHG emission estimate that will be produced by the INFLUX project.",

            "abstract": "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) modeling is an emerging field in hydrology. Investigation of groundwater change using remote sensing data helps overcome data limitation at a global and regional scale. However, its application to regional or local scale hydrogeologic settings has been limited, especially for the use of the publically available Level 3 data. We conducted a study to estimate the change of groundwater using remotely sensed GRACE and ground truth data for the Upper Mississippi Basin in the US. The modeling conditions that affect the model accuracy are soil moisture models, groundwater fluctuations in the monitoring wells, and the hydrogeologic conditions of the aquifer. We adopted three different land surface models for soil moisture: CLM (Common Land Model), Noah, and Mosaic. The ground truth data from monitoring wells were obtained from the USGS National Water Information System. The results showed that the best-fit soil moisture model is CLM. The correlation coefficient is 86.1%, which signifies strong correlation between remote sensed and ground truth data. As for the effect of aquifer, the best selection of well observations is when the groundwater data is collected from the sand and gravel aquifer. Correlation with well observations in sand and gravel aquifers were 73.4%. The best-fit condition is therefore when the CLM was adopted for soil moisture in the GRACE calculation as well as 11 well observations from the sand and gravel aquifer used for the ground-truth calculation. Under the best-fit conditions, the correlation coefficient between the GRACE and the ground truth is 91.8%.",

            "abstract": "What determines the depth extent of slip in large earthquakes? Faults feature depth-dependent frictional, hydraulic, and structural properties. Observationally, faults are separated into seismogenic layers (SL) and deeper creeping extensions based on either microseismicity or inferred locking depth. Slip in large earthquakes is often assumed to be limited to the SL. Physically, this separation can be explained by transition, at slow slip rates, from rate-weakening (RW) to rate-strengthening (RS) behavior. However, as revealed in experimental and theoretical studies, enhanced weakening during rapid earthquake slip – e.g., due to thermal pressurization (TP) of pore fluids - may be critical to rupture propagation. The extent of such weakening need not coincide with the traditionally defined SL.\nUsing 3D rate-and-state fault models with temperature and pore pressure evolution, we study the effect of depth-dependent permeability and shear-zone width on long-term fault slip. Competition between the two properties determines the depth dependence of co-seismic weakening due to TP, since permeability decreases with depth (due to higher compression), promoting TP, while the shear-zone width likely increases below certain depth (due to increasingly inelastic bulk properties), lowering the co-seismic temperature increase and suppressing TP.\nWe find that, indeed, large ruptures can penetrate below the traditionally defined SL, into the “stable” fault regions, due to TP. When they do, microseismicity patterns at the bottom of the SL change, potentially allowing for identification of such penetration in recent events. The behavior of large ruptures, including their depth extent, varies along strike, even though the fault properties are uniform along strike. This is because co-seismic weakening is strongly dependent on the local rupture properties (slip rate and slip), setting up a strong feedback loop between the weakening and rupture response. The non-uniform slip during one event leads to spatio-temporal complexity in subsequent events, including large variations of depth extent with time. Our current efforts are directed towards quantifying these effects, including the relation between rupture slip, depth, and length as well as their variability.",

If liquid water is indeed available in these subsurface environments, then the availability of chemical energy becomes the greatest limitation on whether icy worlds could harbor life. Of these moons, the largest (Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan) are expected to harbor oceans deep within, and high-pressure H2O ice phases are expected farther beneath those deep oceans. In contrast, the oceans of smaller icy worlds—Europa, Enceladus, and Triton—are plausibly in direct contact with rock below. Given that serpentinization or other water-rock geochemical activity could supply reductants directly to their oceans, these icy worlds have the greatest chance to support present-day microbial life. Each of these three icy worlds displays spectacular resurfaced terrains that are very young (crater retention ages ~10s Myr and younger), with their internal activity linked to extremes in tidal heating today and/or in the geologically recent past. However, the degree of their tidal heating may have changed greatly over time. Europa is believed to experience cyclical tidal heating and activity; Enceladus may have experienced cyclical activity or a geologically recent pulse of activity; Triton may have experienced extreme tidal heating upon its capture and orbital circularization. Such dynamic pasts would pose challenges for any life within. We consider the possible effects of severe swings in the activity level of icy worlds, specifically the implications for delivery of chemical energy to their subsurface oceans.",

            "abstract": "With the accumulated satellite datasets for decades, it is possible that satellite-based data could contribute to sustained climate applications. Level-3 products from microwave sensors for climate applications can be obtained from several algorithms. For examples, the Microwave Emission brightness Temperature Histogram (METH) algorithm produces level-3 rainfalls directly, whereas the Goddard profiling (GPROF) algorithm first generates instantaneous rainfalls and then temporal and spatial averaging process leads to level-3 products. The rainfall algorithm developed in this study follows a similar approach to averaging instantaneous rainfalls. However, the algorithm is designed to produce instantaneous rainfalls at an optimal resolution showing reduced non-linearity in brightness temperature (TB)-rain rate(R) relations. It is found that the resolution tends to effectively utilize emission channels whose footprints are relatively larger than those of scattering channels.\nThis algorithm is mainly composed of a-priori databases (DBs) and a Bayesian inversion module. The DB contains massive pairs of simulated microwave TBs and rain rates, obtained by WRF (version 3.4) and RTTOV (version 11.1) simulations. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of retrieval process, data mining technique is additionally considered. The entire DB is classified into eight types based on Köppen climate classification criteria using reanalysis data. Among these sub-DBs, only one sub-DB which presents the most similar physical characteristics is selected by considering the thermodynamics of input data. When the Bayesian inversion is applied to the selected DB, instantaneous rain rate with 6 hours interval is retrieved. The retrieved monthly mean rainfalls are statistically compared with CMAP and GPCP, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather events can alter ecosystem structure and function and have caused mass mortality events in animals. With climate change, high temperature extremes are increasing in frequency and magnitude. To better understand the consequences of climate change, scientists have frequently employed correlative models based on species occurrence records. However, these approaches may be of limited utility in the context of extremes, as these are often outside historical ranges and may involve strong non-linear responses. Here we describe work linking physiological response informed by experimental data to geospatial climate datasets in order to mechanistically model the dynamics of dehydration risk to dessert passerine birds. Specifically, we modeled and mapped the occurrence of current (1980-2013) high temperature extremes and evaporative water loss rates for eight species of passerine birds ranging in size from 6.5-75g in the US Southwest portion of their range. We then explored the implications of a 4° C warming scenario. Evaporative water loss (EWL) across a range of high temperatures was measured in heat-acclimated birds captured in the field. We used the North American Land Data Assimilation System 2 dataset to obtain hourly estimates of EWL with a 14-km spatial grain. Assuming lethal dehydration occurs when water loss reaches 15% of body weight, we then produced maps of total daily EWL and time to lethal dehydration based on both current data and future scenarios.\nWe found that milder events capable of producing dehydration in passerine birds over four or more hours were not uncommon over the Southwest, but rapid dehydration conditions (<3 hours) were rare. Under the warming scenario, the frequency and extent of dehydration events expanded greatly, often affecting areas several times larger than in present-day climate. Dehydration risk was especially high among smaller bodied passerines due to their higher mass-specific rates of water loss. Even after accounting for the moderating effects of microsite and topoclimatic refugia, the increase in occurrence of lethal dehydration risk is cause for concern. In particular, our results suggest that smaller bodied passerines may have difficulty in avoiding extirpation over portions of their current range in the desert southwest.",

            "abstract": "Integrating field and model observations of marine carbonate strata, we investigate how distinct sedimentary basins respond to the same eustatic sea level history, specifically in terms of the preserved record of lithofacies and meter-scale depositional cycles. First, we compare two coeval Devonian sedimentary records characterized by different subsidence regimes (North American ‘stable’ cratonic interior vs. ‘passive’ continental margin) and rock accumulation rates (measured over m.y. time scales). Despite the greater potential for subaerial exposure due to minimal accommodation space, stratigraphic and petrographic analyses revealed the apparently significant role of suppressed subtidal sedimentation rates, along with submarine erosion and non-deposition, in limiting both the thickness and number of facies and cycles preserved in the cratonic record compared to the continental margin.\nTo explore insights gained from the field, we use a previously-developed, one-dimensional forward model to generate stratigraphic columns. Knowing the true history underlying each model run, we can test the sensitivity of the resultant stratigraphy to variation in subsidence and sedimentation rates, while maintaining the same eustatic sea level curve. For the model conditions explored, 1) thicker component depositional units reflect higher sedimentation rates; 2) total stratigraphic thickness, numbers of units, and stratigraphic completeness reflect combinations of low enough sedimentation rates and high enough subsidence rates to maintain sufficient accommodation space; and 3) the preserved stratal patterns rarely faithfully record sea level history. The model results lead to new questions that can direct future field studies. Overall, this approach can inform similar investigations in other carbonate, siliciclastic and non-marine records, especially over stratigraphic scales finer than the temporal resolution typically afforded by numerical ages and correlation techniques.",

These model results are used to determine the relationship between the magnitude, width, spacing, and duration of transient rip currents to a variety of idealized beach and wave conditions. We also quantify the efficiency of cross-shelf exchange by a surfzone flushing time and compare two wave-driven mechanisms; the Eulerian return flow balancing the onshore Stokes’ drift and transient rip currents.

Quantitative topographic analysis has provided a means to estimate volumes of runoff, sediment transport rates, and peak flow discharges, first using orbital imagery alone and then using laser altimetery coverage and higher resolution HiRISE (1 m/px), CTX (20 m/px) and HRSC (50 m/px) topography.\nOur detailed topographic analysis of the Peace Vallis fan near the Curiosity rover landing site in Gale Crater (Mars) suggested that the fan entered into a pre-existing enclosed basin that would likely contain lake sediments; sedimentary, mineralogical, and chemical analysis of this region, now named Yellowknife Bay, later found this to be the case, though debate remains on the exact origin and history of the deposit. The rover is currently heading to a 5 km high sedimentary mound (Aeolis Mons) with mineral signatures hypothesized to be the result of planet-wide changes in climate. Topographic features on the mound, which correspond in elevation with other large depositional features around the crater, suggest that a succession of lakes developed post-Noachian. Within Gale, we are in a unique position to determine the extent at which topography can tell us the evolutionary history of a place on another planet, since our hypotheses can actually be tested as the Curiosity rover makes its ascent up Aeolis Mons. Along the rover’s traverse, we propose based on the geomorphic record that the sediments being examined were water soaked, perhaps several times under deep lakes, and that the rover will cross shorelines that may not be well-preserved, but are worth searching for. A quantitative topographic analysis of the fan and delta features and their source areas on the crater wall and Aeolis Mons suggest that mass is conserved, hence these features have experienced little modification since emplacement, but this also presents challenges for explaining the origin of the coarse sedimentary deposits Curiosity has recently encountered.",

            "abstract": "In interior Alaska, frozen river systems are important transportation corridors, due to the very limited road network. Long-time Alaskan residents report that winter travel conditions on Interior rivers have become more dangerous in recent memory. Field experience suggested that visual clues may provide experienced river travelers with clues of ice conditions. We explored the utility of airborne or satellite imagery as useful tools to map dangerous ice conditions on rivers in interior Alaska. Unsupervised classification of high-resolution satellite imagery was used to identify and map open water and degraded ice conditions on the Tanana River. An accuracy assessment indicated that snow, degraded ice, and open water were mapped with an overall accuracy of 73%, producer’s accuracies between (82 and 100%), and user’s accuracy ranging from (62 to 86%). Over 95% of the errors were caused by shadowing of trees or topographic features in the snow. The classification system performed well for a variety of satellite images and across different satellite platforms. With further development, these types of satellite remote sensing tools could prove to be very useful across a range of disciplines and industry in northern climates.",

            "abstract": "Northern permafrost regions are estimated to cover 16% of the global soil area and account for approximately 50% of the global belowground organic carbon pool. However, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the fate of this soil carbon pool with projected climate warming over the next century. In northern Alaska, nearly 65% of the terrestrial surface is composed of polygonal tundra, where geomorphic land cover types such as high-, flat-, and low-center polygons influence local surface hydrology, plant community composition, nutrient and biogeochemical cycling, over small spatial scales. Due to the lack of representation of these fine-scale geomorphic types and ecosystem processes, in large-scale terrestrial ecosystem models, future uncertainties are large for this tundra region. In this study, we use a new version of the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM), that couples a dynamic vegetation model (in which plant functional types compete for water, nitrogen, and light) with a dynamic soil organic model (in which temperature, moisture, and associated organic/inorganic carbon and nitrogen pools/fluxes vary together in vertically resolved layers) to simulate ecosystem carbon balance. We parameterized and calibrated this model using data specific to the local climate, vegetation, and soil associated with tundra geomorphic types. We extrapolate model results at a 1km2 resolution across the ~1800 km2 Barrow Peninsula using a tundra geomorphology map, describing ten dominant geomorphic tundra types (Lara et al. submitted), to estimate the likely change in landscape-level carbon balance between 1970 and 2100 in response to projected climate change. Preliminary model runs for this region indicated temporal variability in carbon and active layer dynamics, specific to tundra geomorphic type over time. Overall, results suggest that it is important to consider small-scale discrete polygonal tundra geomorphic types that control local structure and function in regional estimates of carbon balance in northern Alaska.",

The objective of the fourth bore was to reduce traffic congestion before the tunnel entrance in the off-peak direction of travel, but the project was a source of conflict between policy makers and environmental and community groups concerned about the air quality and traffic impacts.\nWe analyze the impact of the opening of the fourth bore on CO2 emissions associated with traffic. We made surface observations of CO2from a mobile platform along State Route 24 for several weeks in November 2013 incorporating the period prior to and after the opening of the fourth bore on November 16, 2013. We directly compare bottom-up and top-down approaches to estimate the change in traffic emissions associated with the fourth bore opening. A bottom-up emissions inventory was derived from the high-resolution Performance Measurement System (PeMs) dataset and the Multi-scale Motor Vehicle and Equipment Emissions System (MOVES). The emissions inventory was used to drive a box model as well as a high-resolution regional transport model (the Weather and Regional Forecasting Model). The box model was also used to derive emissions from observations in a basic inversion.\nWe also present an analysis of long-term traffic patterns and consider the potential for compensating changes in behavior that offset the observed emissions reductions on longer timescales. Finally, we examine how the results from the Caldecott study demonstrate the general benefit of using mobile measurements for quantifying environmental impacts of congestion mitigation projects.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is scheduled for launch in early January 2015. For pre-launch soil moisture algorithm development and validation, the SMAP project and NASA coordinated a SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) together with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in the vicinity of Winnipeg, Canada in June 7-July 19, 2012. Coincident active and passive airborne L-band data were acquired using the Passive Active L-band System (PALS) on 17 days during the experiment. Simultaneously with the PALS measurements, soil moisture ground truth data were collected manually. The vegetation and surface roughness were sampled on non-flight days. The SMAP mission will produce surface (top 5 cm) soil moisture products a) using a combination of its L-band radiometer and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) measurements, b) using the radiometer measurement only, and c) using the SAR measurements only. The SMAPVEX12 data are being utilized for the development and testing of the algorithms applied for generating these soil moisture products. This talk will focus on presenting results of retrieving surface soil moisture using the PALS radiometer. The issues that this retrieval faces are very similar to those faced by the global algorithm using the SMAP radiometer. However, the different spatial resolution of the two observations has to be accounted for in the analysis. The PALS 3 dB footprint in the experiment was on the order of 1 km, whereas the SMAP radiometer has a footprint of about 40 km. In this talk forward modeled brightness temperature over the manually sampled fields and the retrieved soil moisture over the entire experiment domain are presented and discussed. In order to provide a retrieval product similar to that of the SMAP passive algorithm, various ancillary information had to be obtained for the SMAPVEX12 domain. In many cases there are multiple options on how to choose and reprocess these data. The derivation of these data elements and their impact on the retrieval and the spatial scales of the different observations are also discussed. In particular, land cover and soil type heterogeneity have a dramatic impact on parameterization of the algorithm when going from finer to coarser spatial resolutions.",

            "abstract": "Pyrocumulus clouds form over wildfires when hot, smoke-filled air rises, cools and condenses. These clouds have higher cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, which affect their microphysical and electrical properties. It is important to better understand pyrocumulus cloud microphysical characteristics and lightning formation, which have implications for the prediction of wildfire growth as well as the radiative and chemical characteristics of the upper troposphere. A recent observational study documented an electrified pyrocumulus over the May 2012 Hewlett Gulch fire located to the west of Fort Collins, Colorado. This cloud produced approximately 20 intracloud lightning flashes, and its electrical activity differed from surrounding convection that was not directly impacted by the fire and associated smoke. The goal of this research is to investigate aerosol-induced cloud-scale microphysical differences between clean clouds and polluted pyrocumulus to better characterize the mechanisms that cause pyrocumulus electrification.\nIn order to address this goal, idealized cloud-resolving model simulations were performed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The model environment was initialized with an average of the 12Z 16 May and 00Z 17 May 2012 observed Denver soundings to represent the conditions when the Hewlett Gulch pyrocumulus occurred. Five simulations were performed using surface aerosol concentrations from 100 to 5000 #/mg. The results demonstrate that in moderately polluted pyrocumulus, rain processes are suppressed while graupel production increases. Extremely polluted pyrocumulus, however, experience a complete shut-down of graupel production, which favors the production of large amounts of liquid water and smaller ice species such as ice crystals and snowflakes. The processes responsible for these microphysical changes, as well as inferred pyrocumulus electrification mechanisms, will be compared with those discussed in previous observational studies of this case.",

            "abstract": "Transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from plants through their stomata, is a key component of the terrestrial water balance, influencing streamflow as well as regional convective systems. From a plant physiological perspective, transpiration is both a means of avoiding destructive leaf temperatures through evaporative cooling and a consequence of water loss through stomatal uptake of carbon dioxide. Despite its hydrologic and ecological significance, transpiration remains a notoriously challenging process to measure in heterogeneous landscapes. Sap flow methods, which estimate transpiration by tracking the velocity of a heat pulse emitted into the tree sap stream, have proven effective for relating transpiration dynamics to climatic variables. To scale sap flow-based transpiration from the measured domain (often <5 cm of tree cross-sectional area) to the whole-tree level, researchers generally assume constancy of scale factors (e.g., wood thermal diffusivity (k), radial and azimuthal distributions of sap velocity, and conducting sapwood area (As)) through time, across space, and within species. For the widely used heat-ratio sap flow method (HRM), we assessed the sensitivity of transpiration estimates to uncertainty in k (a function of wood moisture content and density) and As. A sensitivity analysis informed by distributions of wood moisture content, wood density and As sampled across a gradient of water availability indicates that uncertainty in these variables can impart substantial error when scaling sap flow measurements to the whole tree. For species with variable wood properties, the application of the HRM assuming a spatially constant k or As may systematically over- or underestimate whole-tree transpiration rates, resulting in compounded error in ecosystem-scale estimates of transpiration.",

            "abstract": "Effective climate resiliency planning at the regional level requires extensive interactive dialogue among climate scientists, emergency managers, public health officials, urban planners, social scientists, and policy makers. Engaging federal, tribal, state, local governments and private sector business and infrastructure owners/operators in defining, assessing and characterizing the impacts of extreme events allows communities to understand how different events “break the system” forcing local communities to seek support and resources from state/federal governments and/or the private sector and what actions can be taken proactively to mitigate consequences and accelerate recovery. The Washoe County Regional Resiliency Study was prepared in response to potential climate variability related impacts specific to the Northern Nevada Region. The last several decades have seen dramatic growth in the region, coupled with increased resource demands that have forced local governments to consider how those impacts will affect the region and may, in turn, impact the region’s ability to provide essential services. The Western Regional Climate Center of the Desert Research Institute provided a synthesis of climate studies with predictions regarding plausible changes in the local climate of Northern California and Nevada for the next 50 years. In general, these predictions indicate that the region’s climate is undergoing a gradual shift, which will primarily affect the frequency, amount, and form of precipitation in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin. Changes in water availability and other extreme events may have serious and long lasting effects in the Northern Nevada Region, and create a variety of social, environmental and economic concerns. A range of extreme events were considered including Adverse Air Quality, Droughts, Floods, Heat Waves, High Wind, Structure Fires, Wildland Fires, and Major Winter Storms. Due to the complexity of our climate systems, and the difficulty in specifying how severe the climate effects may be or how those impacts compound existing hazards in the system, the Resiliency Study focused on identifying a variety of ‘no regrets’ policy options that can help the local communities anticipate, respond and recover faster and more efficiently to climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the importance of microbial contributions to our natural gas supply has been widely recognized, even leading to efforts to enhance the rate of methanogenesis in reservoirs whether the substrate is oil, coal or the organic matter in shale. The identification of biogenic gas was first established with gas compositional and isotopic data. More recently, molecular genomic data has been applied, giving us a glimpse into bacterial and archaeal communities in the subsurface, both in reservoirs where the microbial community was expected by the geochemical signature, but also in flowback waters from formations where there was no indication of anything other than thermogenic gas. With these microbes, it is not so much a question of “build it and they will come”, but more that the community lies in wait for conditions to improve and allow them to flourish.\nConditions for microbial methanogenesis are well constrained: temperatures up to ~80oC, low sulfate concentration, and chloride concentrations under 2M. However, these are rather expansive boundaries and within each range there lies constant turnover in population density as well specific microbial abundances. In addition, the rates at which these microbes are able convert complex organic matter into methane depend upon environmental conditions. Confounding our evaluation of these subsurface communities is the effect that production incurs. Over the past two decades, wells under production in the Antrim Shale have exhibited changes in the geochemistry of formation fluids, most notably a drop in dissolved inorganic carbon of ~10mM. Gas chemistry has also shifted, with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that have also become more enriched in 13C, while the co-produced methane has become more depleted in 13C over the 20 years that these few wells have been monitored. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, the microbial community has also shifted with the water’s chemical evolution. Most intriguing is the correlation of the deuterium in the water to the methane, where CO2-reduction seems to remain the dominant methanogenic pathway and the gas composition is responding to changes in the water source. This may signify a relatively high proportion of recently produced methane in the system.",

            "abstract": "The boom and bust history of mineral extraction in the American southwest is visible today in tens of thousands of abandoned and slowly decaying mine installations that scar the landscape. Mine tailing piles, mounds of crushed mineral ore, often contain significant quantities of heavy metal elements which may leach into surrounding soils, surface water and ground water. Chemical analysis of contaminated soils is a tedious and time-consuming process. Regional assessment of heavy metal contamination for treatment prioritization would be greatly accelerated by the development of near-surface imaging indices of heavy-metal vegetative stress in western grasslands. Further, the method would assist in measuring the ongoing effectiveness of phytoremedatian and phytostabilization efforts. To test feasibility we ground truthed nine phytoremediated and two control sites sites along the mine-impacted Kerber Creek watershed in Saguache County, Colorado. Total metal concentration was determined by XRF for both plant and soil samples. Leachable metals were extracted from soil samples following US EPA method 1312. Plants were identified, sorted into roots, shoots and leaves, and digested via microwave acid extraction. Metal concentrations were determined with high accuracy by ICP-OES analysis. Plants were found to contain significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals than surrounding soils, particularly for manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba), and lead (Pb). Plant species accumulated and distributed metals differently, yet most showed translocation of metals from roots to above ground structures. Ground analysis was followed by near surface imaging using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with visible/near and shortwave infrared (0.7 to 1.5 µm) cameras. Images were assessed for spectral shifts indicative of plant stress and attempts made to correlate results with measured soil and plant metal concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Degradation of permafrost due to increased global warming has the potential to dramatically affect soil thermal, hydrological, and vegetation regimes. To explicitly simulate the soil moisture effects of soil thermal conductivity and heat capacity and its effects on hydrological response, we included the capability to simulate the soil thermal regime, frozen soil and permafrost in the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Laboratory (GIPL) model in the physically based, distributed watershed model Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA). The GIPL model simulates soil temperature dynamics, the depth of seasonal freezing and thawing, and the permafrost location by numerically solving a one-dimensional nonlinear heat equation with phase change. The GSSHA model is a spatially explicit hydrological model that simulates two dimensional groundwater flow and one-dimensional vadose zone flow. The GIPL model is used to compute a soil temperature profile in every two-dimensional GSSHA grid. GSSHA uses this information to adjust hydraulic conductivities for both the vertical unsaturated soil flow and lateral saturated groundwater flow. The newly coupled system was applied in the Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW), a 104 km2 basin north of Fairbanks, Alaska. The watershed lies in the zone of discontinuous permafrost and is reserved for ecological, hydrological, and climatic research with no current human influence (other than scientific research). In the application we calibrate the hydrologic model to sub-watersheds and then apply the model to the larger ungaged watershed to assess the impacts of frozen soil and permafrost on the watershed response. Initial simulation result indicates that freezing temperatures reduces soil storage capacity thereby producing higher peak discharges and lower base flow.",

In the radio band, several types of radio bursts are commonly detected from the ground. A few observations of the Sun in the past have also detected a new class of fast transients which are known to have short-live electromagnetic emissions with durations less than 100 ms. The mechanisms that produce such fast transiets remain unclear. Observations of such fast transients over a wide bandwidth is necessary to uderstand the underlying physical process that produce such fast transients. Due to their very large flux densities, fast radio transients can be observed at high time resolution using small antennas in combination with digital signal processing techniques. In this work we report the progress of an spectrometer that is currently in construction at the Observatorio de la Luz of the Universidad de Guanajuato. The instrument which will have the purpose of detecting solar fast radio transients, involves the use of digital devices such as FPGA and ADC cards, in addition with a receiver with high temporal-spectral resolution centered at 1.4 GHz and a pair of 2.3 m satellite dish.",

            "abstract": "Arrival times of long-period secondary mantle reflections such as SS and PP precursors have made significant contributions to the understanding of the mantle structure and slab dynamics beneath the Pacific Northwest. Due to strong sensitivities to discontinuity depths, the timing information is often correlated with P/S velocity models from high-resolution seismic tomography while stacked reflection amplitudes provide a measure of impedance contrast. A potential pitfall in the interpretations of SS-precursor measurements is velocity-discontinuity depth ambiguity, as the timing of secondary reflections is mainly 'corrected' based on existing smoothed velocity estimates. In this study we quantitatively investigate the amplitude information of a dense SS precursor data set sampling the northwestern Pacific region. We model the full waveforms of SS precursors using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), an effective nonlinear inversion technique, and properly account for the tradeoff between shear wave velocity and discontinuity depth perturbation. The inverted shear velocities clearly show a consistent high-velocity, dipping structure along the Wadati-Benioff zone, likely in connection with the descending Japan slab. The slab appears to stagnate and horizontally deflect within the upper mantle transition zone beneath northeastern China. The integrity of the deflected slab appears to be compromised beneath the Changbai hotspot where a low velocity anomaly interrupts the flat lying high velocity structure and extends upward to, at least, mid MTZ depths. This anomaly does not appear to reach the Changbai hotspot, though its connection with observed low velocities in the lithosphere and asthenosphere may not be ruled out. Our nonlinear waveform inversion results also show a 600-km wide low velocity zone (up to -4% relative to the Preliminary ",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) are organic aerosols (OA) that can form from primary emission (primary OA) or oxidation of more volatile organic compounds (secondary OA). Most OA are semi-volatile that can evaporate from particle phase to gas phase. OA evaporation strongly impacts aerosol mass loading, aerosol oxidation state, and aerosol properties in the atmosphere. In this study, we use four semi-volatile long-chain n-alkanes (n-octadecane, n-eicosane, n-docosane, and n-tetracosane) and α-pinene-derived OA as surrogates for primary and secondary OA, respectively. The evaporation of these OA components was examined in a flow reactor. Two soft ionization mass spectrometry techniques were used to measure evaporation kinetics of individual OA constituents: on-line direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry (DART-MS) (used for secondary OA) and off-line two-dimensional gas chromatograph coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC×GC/HTOF-MS) with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (used for primary OA). The semi-volatile n-alkanes can be oxidized in both phases, following different reaction schemes and leading to multigenerational oxygenated products with different isomeric distributions. Here the evaporation kinetic of primary OA surrogates was determined based on chemical analysis and kinetic simulations. The evaporation of α-pinene-derived OA was characterized based on the DART-MS mass spectra change upon heating. Results for both systems suggest slow evaporation compared to the gas-particle partitioning theory, especially when the OA are solid. The species-wise measurements using novel techniques provide insights into the detailed evaporation kinetics for atmospheric relevant systems.",

Science cloud is an infrastructure for 4th science methodology. The NICT science cloud is designed for big data sciences of Earth, space and other sciences based on modern informatics and information technologies [1]. Data flow on the cloud is through the following three techniques; (1) data crawling and transfer, (2) data preservation and stewardship, and (3) data processing and visualization. Original tools and applications of these techniques have been designed and implemented. We mash up these tools and applications on the NICT Science Cloud to build up customized systems for each project.\nIn this paper, we discuss science data processing through these three steps. For big data science, data file deployment on a distributed storage system should be well designed in order to save storage cost and transfer time. We developed a high-bandwidth virtual remote storage system (HbVRS) and data crawling tool, NICTY/DLA and Wide-area Observation Network Monitoring (WONM) system, respectively. Data files are saved on the cloud storage system according to both data preservation policy and data processing plan. The storage system is developed via distributed file system middle-ware (Gfarm: GRID datafarm). It is effective since disaster recovery (DR) and parallel data processing are carried out simultaneously without moving these big data from storage to storage. Data files are managed on our Web application, WSDBank (World Science Data Bank). The big-data on the cloud are processed via Pwrake, which is a workflow tool with high-bandwidth of I/O. There are several visualization tools on the cloud; VirtualAurora for magnetosphere and ionosphere, VDVGE for google Earth, STICKER for urban environment data and STARStouch for multi-disciplinary data. There are 30 projects running on the NICT Science Cloud for Earth and space science.\nIn 2003 56 refereed papers were published. At the end, we introduce a couple of successful results of Earth and space sciences using these three techniques carried out on the NICT Sciences Cloud.\n[1] http://sc-web.nict.go.jp",

This approach requires the assumption of stationarity. In this paper, index flood method was used to analyze the nonstationary 24-hour rainfall maxima of 9 virtual sites in a region. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate the nonstationary data based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) model with time varying location/scale parameters. To analyze the temporal change of regional frequency estimates such as index flood, growth curve, quantile, and the heterogeneity measure, the accumulation of the data from the given time step and moving window concept were applied. Results indicated that the stationarity of the data had more effects on the index flood than the growth curve. There was little effects of the shape parameter of GEV distribution on the temporal pattern of the regional frequency estimates. Temporal change of the heterogeneity measure was not significant. These results showed that the time varying parameters of the nonstationary GEV model need to be formed considering the temporal pattern of the regional frequency estimates.",

            "abstract": "We developed a new methodology to create high-resolution precipitation data using the random forest algorithm. We have used two approaches: physical downscaling from GCM data using a regional climate model, and interpolation from ground observation data. Physical downscaling method can be applied only for a small region because it is computationally expensive and complex to deploy. On the other hand, interpolation schemes from ground observations do not consider physical processes. In this study, we utilized the random forest algorithm to integrate atmospheric reanalysis data, satellite data, topography data, and ground observation data. First we considered situations where precipitation is same across the domain, largely dominated by storm like systems. We then picked several points to train random forest algorithm. The random forest algorithm estimates out-of-bag errors spatially, and produces the relative importance of each of the input variable.\nThis methodology has the following advantages. (1) The methodology can ingest any spatial dataset to improve downscaling. Even non-precipitation datasets can be ingested such as satellite cloud cover data, radar reflectivity image, or modeled convective available potential energy. (2) The methodology is purely statistical so that physical assumptions are not required. Meanwhile, most of interpolation schemes assume empirical relationship between precipitation and elevation for orographic precipitation. (3) Low quality value in ingested data does not cause critical bias in the results because of the ensemble feature of random forest. Therefore, users do not need to pay a special attention to quality control of input data compared to other interpolation methodologies. (4) Same methodology can be applied to produce other high-resolution climate datasets, such as wind and cloud cover. Those variables are usually hard to be interpolated by conventional algorithms. In conclusion, the proposed methodology can produce reasonable high-resolution data and has the potential for improving the results using other datasets including new satellite or reanalysis data.",

            "abstract": "In March and April 2014, an unprecedented experiment released over 100x106 cubic meters (81,000 acre-feet) of water from Morelos Dam into the normally-dry lower Colorado River below Yuma, Arizona, USA. More than half of the water released from Morelos Dam infiltrated within the limitrophe reach, a 32-km stretch between the Northern U.S.-Mexico International Boundary and the Southern International Boundary, a distance of just 32 river-kilometers. To characterize the spatial and temporal extent of infiltration, scientists from the US Geological Survey, Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada, Baja California, and Universidad Autónoma de Baja California carried out several geophysical surveys. Frequency-domain electromagnetic transects throughout the limitrophe reach showed that the subsurface comprised exclusively sandy material, with little finer-grained material to impede or otherwise influence infiltration. Direct current resistivity clearly imaged the rising water table near the stream channel. Both techniques provide valuable parameterization and calibration information for a surface-water/groundwater interaction model currently in development. Time-lapse gravity data were collected at 25 stations to expand the monitoring well network and provide storage-coefficient information for the groundwater model. Despite difficult field conditions, precise measurements of large gravity changes showed that changes in groundwater storage in the upper reach of the study area, where groundwater levels were highest, were constrained to the near vicinity of the river channel. Downstream near the Southern International Boundary, however, groundwater storage increased substantially over a large area, expanding into the regional aquifer that supplies irrigation water to surrounding agriculture.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the connection between vegetation and geologic, soil and hydrologic subsurface characteristics of a natural deciduous forest in Oregon Ridge Park, located in the Piedmont physiographic province in Maryland, USA.\nA preliminary study showed the relationship between nitrogen cycling and four different species occurring on a coarse grained schist and a fine grained schist. Mineralization values for Liriodendon tulipifera were positive on the coarser grained substrate and negative on the fine grained substrate. Nitrification values were positive on both substrates. Mineralization and nitrification values were both positive for Quercus prinus on both the coarse and fine substrates. Mineralization values for Acer rubrum were negative on the coarse substrate and positive on the finer substrate, while mineralization for Quercus rubra was negative on the coarse substrate and positive on the fine schist. Nitrification was positive for Q. rubra on the coarse schist and both positive and negative on the fine schist.\nResistivity analyses were performed in collaboration with the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) along two perpendicular transects at the study site. This analysis provides indirect information on subsurface conductivity, with low resistivity being interpreted as subsurface water or clay. One transect crossed a valley with a first-order stream in the center, while the second transect was taken along the break and slope of the hillslope. All trees were identified and diameter at breast height (DBH) measured in sixty-three randomly located plots along both transects. A principle components analysis of all tree data showed four associations of species. The plots were labelled as to association. The position of the associations along the transects show a relationship between wet, dry and mesic associations with differences in transect resistivity.",

            "abstract": "Due to increasing urbanization, deforestation, and agriculture, land use change over Southeast Asia has dramatically risen during the last decades. Large areas of peat swamp forests over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent region (10°S~20°N and 90°E~135°E) have been cleared for agricultural purposes. The Center for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (CRISP) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived land cover classification data show that changes in land use are dominated by conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantation, open lowland or lowland mosaic categories. Nested grid simulations based on Weather Research Forecasting Version 3.6 modelling system (WRFV3.6) over the central region of the Sarawak coast are used to investigate the climatic impacts of land use change over Maritime Continent. Numerical simulations were conducted for August of 2009 for satellite derived land cover scenarios for years 2000 and 2010. The variations in cloud formation, precipitation, and regional radiative and non-radiative parameters on climate results from land use change have been assessed based on numerical simulation results. Modelling studies demonstrate that land use change such as extensive deforestation processes can produce a negative radiative forcing due to the surface albedo increase and evapotranspiration decrease, while also largely caused reduced rainfall and cloud formation, and enhanced shortwave radiative forcing and temperature over the study area. Land use and land cover changes, similar to the domain in this study, has also occurred over other regions in Southeast Asia including Indonesia and could also impact cloud and precipitation formation in these regions.",

            "abstract": "The geological record of wildfire, particularly across climate transitions, can help elucidate the complex relationships between climate, vegetation, and fire at long temporal scales. Across Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT), previous workers have proposed climate changes (drying and changes in seasonality) contemporaneous with the growth of the Antarctic ice sheet that would have changed the likelihood of wildfires in terrestrial ecosystems. We document short-lived changes in fire regime and plant community in Patagonia near the time of the EOT. Specifically, the concentration of magnetic oxide minerals in Eocene-Oligocene loessites from the Sarmiento Formation correlates with the fraction of burnt palm phytoliths as well as with the fraction of non-palm phytoliths. We interpret the magnetic mineral assemblage magnetite + maghemite ± hematite as pyrogenic, forming in reducing conditions at temperatures between 300 and 600°C. The disappearance of fire-related characteristics near the EOT is possible if seasonal drought was suppressed due to a northward shift in the westerlies – a process consistent with changes in modal particle sizes in the Vera Member. Although the transitory nature of the changes in fire regime remains a puzzle, these results imply a more important role for fire in structuring Eocene-Oligocene landscapes than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The Arduino open source electronics platform has been very popular within the DIY (Do It Yourself) community for several years, and it is now providing environmental science researchers with an inexpensive alternative to commercial data logging and transmission hardware. Here we present the designs for our latest series of custom Arduino-based dataloggers, which include wireless communication options like self-meshing radio networks and cellular phone modules. The main Arduino board uses a custom interface board to connect to various research-grade sensors to take readings of turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water depth and conductivity, soil moisture, solar radiation, and other parameters. Sensors with SDI-12 communications can be directly interfaced to the logger using our open Arduino-SDI-12 software library (\nhttps://github.com/StroudCenter/Arduino-SDI-12\n). Different deployment options are shown, like rugged enclosures to house the loggers and rigs for mounting the sensors in both fresh water and marine environments. After the data has been collected and transmitted by the logger, the data is received by a mySQL-PHP stack running on a web server that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Once there, the data can be visualized on web pages or served though REST requests and Water One Flow (WOF) services. Since one of the main benefits of using open source hardware is the easy collaboration between users, we are introducing a new web platform for discussion and sharing of ideas and plans for hardware and software designs used with DIY environmental sensors and data loggers.",

            "abstract": "Savannas cover 60% of the African continent and play an essential role in the global carbon (C) cycle. To better characterize the physical controls over soil respiration in these settings, half-hourly observations of volumetric soil-water content, temperature, and the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) at different soil depths were continually measured from 2005 to 2007 under trees (“sub-canopy”) and between trees (“inter-canopy”) in a savanna vegetation near Skukuza, Kruger National Park, South Africa. The measured soil climate and CO2 concentration data were assimilated into a process-based model that estimates the CO2 production and flux with coupled dynamics of dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C. Our results show that temporal and spatial variations in CO2 flux were strongly influenced by precipitation and vegetation cover, with two times greater CO2 flux in the sub-canopy plots (~2421 g CO2 m-2 yr-1) than in the inter-canopy plots (~1290 g CO2 m-2 yr-1). Precipitation influenced soil respiration by changing soil temperature and moisture; however, our modeling analysis suggests that the pulsed response of soil respiration to precipitation [known as “Birch effect (BE)”] is a key control on soil fluxes at this site. At this site, BE contributed to approximately 50% and 65% of heterotrophic respiration or 20% and 39% of soil respiration in the sub-canopy and inter-canopy plots, respectively. These results suggest that pulsed response of respiration to precipitation is an important component of the C cycle of savannas and should be considered in both measurement and modeling studies of carbon exchange in similar ecosystems.",

We outline two examples of such projects completed during the summer of 2014 within the NSF ACI sponsored REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Collaborative Data Visualization Applications at Clemson University (Award 1359223). The first project focuses on the development of immersive virtual reality field trips of geologic sites using the Oculus Rift headset. This project developed a platform which will allow users to navigate virtual terrains derived from real-world data obtained from the US Geological Survey and Google Earth. The system provides users with the ability to partake in an interactive first-person exploration of a region, such as the Grand Canyon, and thus makes an important educational contribution for students without access to these environmental assets in the real world. The second project focused on providing players visual feedback about the sustainability of their practices within the web-based, multiplayer watershed management game Naranpur Online. Identifying sustainability indicators that communicate meaningful information to players and finding an effective way to visualize these data were a primary challenge faced by the student researcher working on this project. To solve this problem the student translated findings from the literature to the context of the game to develop a hierarchical set of relative sustainability criteria to be accessed by players within a sustainability dashboard. Though the REU focused on visualization, both projects forced the students to transform their thinking to address higher-level questions regarding the utilization and communication of environmental data or concepts, thus enhancing the educational experience for themselves and future students.",

Indeed, a million-year-spanning high-resolution excess Barium record from the AZ of the South Atlantic (ODP 1094), which traces changes in export production, shows decreased export production during cold periods suggesting decreased overturning. Here, we extend this AZ export production record back to 1.6 Myr. In addition, we present new carbon and oxygen isotope records of benthic and planktic foraminifera from the same site, complemented by Mg/Ca measurements in some intervals. The interpretation of these new data in the context of other South Atlantic records contributes to a better understanding of Southern Ocean hydrography and its role in modulating glacial/interglacial cycles over the past 1.6 Myr.",

Trees are an integral part of the urban landscape. In many suburban neighbourhoods, tree cover is 10 to 30% and trees are often taller than buildings. Effects of trees on drag, mean wind and turbulence in cities are not accounted for in current weather, air pollution and dispersion models.\nOur goal is to use high-resolution Large Eddy Simulations (LES) over a realistic urban canopy to determine the effects of trees on drag, mean wind and turbulence in the urban roughness sublayer (RSL). The simulated area is part of the Sunset-Neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. In this area, long-term wind and turbulence measurements are available from instruments on a 28m-tall tower. Further, a three-dimensional point cloud was captured from high precision airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and analyzed to represent the structural characteristics of both buildings and trees at high spatial resolution. Trees are described by location-specific leaf area density (LAD) profiles.\nLES simulations are performed over a 512 x 512m characteristic subset of the city that contains the tower location and predominant source area. In the LES, buildings are accounted for with an immersed boundary method, adopting a zero level-set distance function to localize the surface, whereas drag forces from trees are parametrized as a function of the height-dependent LAD.\nSpectra of streamwise and vertical velocity components compare well between tower data and the model data, confirming the good performance of LES in simulations of flow over fully rough surfaces. We show how the presence of trees impacts mean velocity and computed momentum flux profiles; they significantly decrease dispersive terms in the bulk of the flow. The impact of trees on integral length scales in the flow is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The spread of herbicide resistant weeds has resulted in the need for clearly marked fields. In response to this need, the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service launched a program named Flag the Technology in 2011. This program uses color-coded flags as a visual alert of the herbicide trait technology within a farm field. The flag based program also serves to help avoid herbicide misapplication and prevent herbicide drift damage between fields with differing crop technologies. This program has been endorsed by Southern Weed Science Society of America and is attracting interest from across the USA, Canada, and Australia. However, flags have risk of misplacement or disappearance due to mischief or severe windstorms/thunderstorms, respectively. This presentation will discuss the design and development of a cloud-based, free application utilizing open-source technologies, called Flag the Technology Cloud (FTTCloud), for allowing agricultural stakeholders to color code their farm fields for indicating herbicide resistant technologies. The developed software utilizes modern web development practices, widely used design technologies, and basic geographic information system (GIS) based interactive interfaces for representing, color-coding, searching, and visualizing fields. This program has also been made compatible for a wider usability on different size devices- smartphones, tablets, desktops and laptops.",

The project's aim is to motivate more diverse young people (especially African Americans) to consider Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. The program offers intensive summer workshops at community youth centers, afterschool workshops at a local high school, a year-round internship for those who have taken part in one or more of our workshops, public and school outreach, and educator professional development workshops. By adding art (and multimedia) to STEM learning, we wanted to try a unique \"STEAM\" approach, highlighting how scientists and artists often collaborate, and why scientists need visualization experts. The program values the rise of the STEAM teaching concept, particularly that art and multimedia projects can help communicate science concepts more effectively. We also promote the fact that art and visualization skills can lead to jobs and broader participation in science, and we frequently work with and showcase scientific illustrators and other science visualization professionals.",

            "abstract": "Solving inverse problems requires an estimate of data uncertainties. This usually takes the form of a data covariance matrix, which determines the shape of the model posterior distribution. Those uncertainties are yet not always known precisely and it is common practice to simply set them to a fixed, reasonable value. In the case of earthquake location, the hypocentral parameters (longitude, latitude, depth and origin time) are typically inverted for using seismic phase arrival times. But quantitative data variance estimates are rarely provided. Instead, arrival time catalogs usually associate phase picks with a quality factor, which is subsequently interpreted more or less arbitrarily in terms of data uncertainty in the location procedure.\nHere, we present a hierarchical Bayesian algorithm for earthquake location in 3D heterogeneous media, in which not only the earthquake hypocentral parameters, but also the P- and S-wave arrival time uncertainties, are inverted for, hence allowing more realistic posterior model covariance estimates. Forward modeling is achieved by means of the Fast Marching Method (FMM), an eikonal solver which has the ability to take interfaces into account, so direct, reflected and refracted phases can be used in the inversion.\nWe illustrate the ability of our algorithm to retrieve earthquake hypocentral parameters as well as data uncertainties through synthetic examples and using a subset of arrival time catalogs for mainland Portugal and its Atlantic margin.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean, contains some of the ocean's deepest mixed layers and is under the constant influence of strong winds and buoyancy forcing. Phytoplankton growth is hypothesized to be co-limited by iron and light. Because deep mixed layers can transport phytoplankton below the depth of the euphotic zone, light levels depend on mixed-layer depth. We use satellite winds from multiple wind sensors, combined with Argo data, to show that deep mixed layers are generally correlated with strong winds over the Southern Ocean. These deep mixed layers correspond to cold sea surface temperatures. This might also be expected to lead to nutrient upwelling and high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as measured by satellite ocean color sensors. However, Chl-a is less strongly correlated with wind speed than SST is, particularly at the mesoscale, and in summer Chl-a is not well correlated with mixed-layer depth. Using new in situ observations of subsurface Chl-a from sensors on southern elephant seals, EM-APEX floats, and bio-optical Argo floats, we find that Chl-a typically has a subsurface maximum in spring, summer, and fall. As a result satellite-sensed Chl-a is an inadequate measure of total biomass within the mixed layer. Satellite Chl-a and integrated Chl-a over the euphotic zone are negatively correlated with MLD from fall through spring, and uncorrelated during the summer. However, integrated Chl-a within the mixed layer shows significant positive correlations with MLD in all seasons. The fact that the deep Chl-a maximum sits at the base of the MLD, closer to the nutrient (or iron) maximum than the light maximum, suggests nutrient limitation plays a greater role than light limitation in governing productivity, and that wind and buoyancy forcing likely govern the mixing processes at the base of the mixed layer that control phytoplankton growth.",

            "abstract": "Soil, river bank, and sediment samples were collected from Panoache Creek’s mine tailings and its drainages in the Mendota Pool area of California’s Central Valley. The samples were collected in order to understand the transport mechanisms of mercury and other heavy metals from the abandoned New Idria Mercury Mine (NIMM) in San Banito County, CA. It is generally thought that materials weathered from the NIMM site flow down gradient into the San Carlos Creek, which then joins Silver Creek and Panoche Creek, before finally ending up in the Valley’s Mendota pool and San Joaquin River (SJR). While we know that factors like geology, anthropogenic activities, and weathering can accelerate heavy metal accumulation at downgradient reaches (Chakravarty and Patgiri, 2009), it is unclear how this part of the SJR has responded to the mine’s abandonment since the 1970s.\nTo investigate how mercury and other heavy metals are weathering and being transported through this portion of the SJR drainage, gains and losses using “enrichment factors” (EF) were calculated and compared along a gradient downstream. Overall, EF of fine and bank sediments show Hg is being enriched and stored within bank sediments. For example, Hg in banks sediments are up to 5% enriched compared to the bed sediments. There is also an enrichment gain trending downstream, as sediments settling in the Mendota pool have comparatively higher EF for Hg (0.94 ppm to 6.91 ppm) relative to background concentrations. Along with other geochemical indices, which can be used to more highly resolve exactly how mine contaminants like Hg are chemically and physically being weathered, (i.e., Igeo, PLI, and CIA) the overall enrichment trend is interpreted to be the physical transport of erosion material during runoff events from the stream banks of SJR tributaries. This interpretation is also supported by depleted Sr and enriched Rb/Sr ratios, which further support physical transport as a dominating factor in contaminant enrichment along the banks of the catchment area. Combined with general trends of increasing Igeo, PLI values, and generally low CIA indices, results support Hg weathering predominantly being controlled by a combination of physical weathering, anthropogenic activities, and bank erosion, that lead to Hg mobilization and transport to downstream areas.",

Algal biomass was determined using MODIS and Landsat remote sensing images. Nutrient loading from rivers into coastal zones was estimated with watershed land use, soils, geology, size and precipitation records. Our models of chlorophyll a based on remote sensing images (RS inferred chl a) and nutrient loading in coastal zones were validated with measured chlorophyll concentrations in the Great Lakes and nutrients in rivers. RS-inferred chl a was related to nutrient loading from rivers, which was dependent upon recent storm events and land use in watersheds. RS-inferred chl a was more related to nutrient loads during the week preceeding measurement of chl a than other periods before or during chl measurement. This lag time is presumably related to algal growth following nutrient loading, and was non-linearly related to nutrient loading. Our results indicate that these tools will improve understanding of land use effects on algal blooms in coastal zones of the Great Lakes and will help identify priority watersheds for restoration.",

We isolated hundreds of nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) from groundwater wells across these geochemical gradients to better understand the diversity, physiology and regulation of nitrate reduction. Isolated NRB were representatives from Pseudomonas, Castellaniella, Rhodanobacter, Intrasporangium, Aquaspirillum, Variovorax, Duganella, Delftia, Chromobacter, Cupriavidus, Dechloromonas and Polaromonas genera among others. Within the Pseudomonas genus, more than a dozen different species were isolated. While some of Pseudomonas strains grew robustly in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate (300mM), others did not. Analysis of their genomes revealed that each strain contains circa 1000 genes distinct from each other- some of them being in denitrification-related genes. Molybdenum is an important metal cofactor of denitrification, and we hypothesize that nitrate-reduction by these strains is regulated by Mo at the genomic and protein level. Furthermore, several of these strains could oxidize humics coupled to denitrification. We present results from our ongoing genotypic, phenotypic characterization of nitrate-reducing isolates from FRC.",

            "abstract": "The southeastern United States has experienced repeated cycles of terrane accretion, continental suturing, and extensive rifting over the past 1 Ga. Recent data collected from the EarthScope Transportable Array and the EarthScope FlexArray deployment SESAME (South Eastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment) allow us to image in detail the upper mantle structures associated with these tectonic events using both Rayleigh waves and teleseismic body waves.\nOf particular interest is the mantle expression of the Suwannee suture. Located across southern Georgia and Alabama, the Suwannee suture represents the boundary between the Gondwanan Suwannee terrane and the Laurentian margin. Previous authors have speculated that this accretion occurred due to southward dipping subduction of the Laurentian lithosphere, though more recent work suggests a possible dextral transpressional plate boundary. We find that the mantle lithosphere across the suture may dip slightly to the south, but the dip angle is much shallower than that of crustal structures seen in scattered wave and active source images. Ongoing work will help to constrain the precise dip angle and will also investigate the nature of lower velocities located between the mantle lithosphere and the overriding crust.\nIntriguingly, we do image a distinct dipping high velocity feature further to the west. This slab-like structure dips to the east, and has a surface projection located near the 1 Ga Grenville front. While the provenance of this high velocity anomaly is still unclear, a few intriguing observations can be made. Given the location of this anomaly in a tectonically stable area, it is unlikely to be due to an ongoing lithospheric process. This then raises the question of how such a dipping structure can persist over time despite over-riding plate motions and mantle flow patterns. The increase in shear velocities is unlikely due to any remnant thermal effects. Our ability to image this structure at all therefore suggests that this feature is compositionally distinct from the surrounding upper mantle material.",

            "abstract": "Tritium (3H) and stable isotopes (2H and 18O) are effective natural tracers of water molecules through the hydrologic system. The strong topographic gradient in California results in distinct isotopic signatures that are particularly effective in watershed studies. Past studies of meteoric tritium distribution within the United States have focused on large-scale trends, at low spatial resolution. Globally, tritium in precipitation is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency contributing to the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) database. The two tritium monitoring stations in California contributing to the GNIP database were discontinued in 1976 (Santa Maria) and 1993 (Menlo Park). Surface water studies have focused on time series in major rivers nationwide or localized studies.\nOur study focuses on high spatial resolution water isotope data collection in California. Over 140 tritium and stable water isotope samples were collected from surface water and direct precipitation during the 2013 Summer/Fall and 2014 Winter/Spring flow regimes and analyzed by helium accumulation and noble gas mass spectrometry. Surface water samples are collected as a proxy for precipitation and to investigate trends related to water residence times.\nTritium concentrations in precipitation show strong spatial trends, with higher concentrations at inland high elevation locations. Surface water tritium trends with spatial location (latitude and longitude) and elevation (reflecting the precipitation signal) and distance downstream (reflecting water residence times). A local meteoric water line (MWL) for California is developed from stable isotope data and analyzed in comparison to the global MWL. Results have implications for tritium tracer and water provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations and isotope ratios of 15N to 14N of N2O in the vadose zone mainly depend on atmospheric deposition, symbiotic or non-symbiotic N2 fixation, and nitrification/denitrification processes in underlying groundwater. In an effort to quantify N2O seasonal variations, cycling and N budgets in an alluvial aquifer in western Colorado (Rifle, CO), the concentrations and nitrogen stable isotopes of N2O within the pore space of partially saturated sediments have been monitored over the 2013-2014 years. Vertically resolved profiles spanning from 0m to 3m depth were sampled at 0.5m increments at a periodicity of one month. At each of the profile locations, N2O concentrations decreased from 3m depth to the surface. The maximum concentrations were observed at the interface between the unsaturated zone and groundwater, with minimum values observed in the near surface samples. The d15N values tend to increase from the unsaturated zone/groundwater interface to the surface. Both variation of N2O concentrations and d15N values suggest that denitrification is the main contribution to N2O production and both parameters exhibited a strong seasonal variation. The maximum concentrations (~10ppmv) were observed at the beginning of summer, during the annual maximum in water table elevation. The minimum N2O concentrations were observed in the period from January to May and coincided with low water table elevations. Additionally, nitrogen concentrations and d15N values of the shallowest sediments within the vertical profiles do not show variation, suggesting that the main source of N2O is associated with groundwater denitrification, with the shallower, partially saturated sediments acting as a sink for N2O.",

            "abstract": "Integrated analysis of ground-based vegetation data and remote sensing supports vegetation mapping, landscape-change detection, wildlife habitat assessment, and tracking of phenological events such as green-up and senescence. The life-cycles of tundra plants occur within a highly compressed seasonal window, making the quantitative assessment of vegetation and landscape attributes from ≤30m resolution remotely-sensed imagery, such as above-ground biomass, % shrub cover, and % surface water, a difficult task when applied across large study domains. To support mapping of vegetation and landscape attributes across ~100,000 km2 of Alaska’s North Slope, we obtained ground data for tundra vegetation using a point-intercept sampling approach across a network of 107 field plots spanning gradients of bioclimate, landscape position (upland, lowland, riverine), and geomorphic setting (foothills, coastal plain). At each plot, vegetation data were collected along three 50-m linear transects, compatible with 30-m Landsat imagery. We summarized live vegetation, litter, and non-vegetated surfaces using three terms: top cover (uppermost “hit”), percent cover (total areal cover along transect), and hit density (all “hits” at a point). We then evaluated a suite of data models (e.g., General Additive Models, classification tree, clustering) and data-mining approaches (e.g., neural networks, random forest) using midsummer Landsat TM/ETM+ acquisitions since 1985, and OLI acquisitions for 2013–2014. The large size, frequent cloudiness, and interannual variability of the study area necessitated the compositing of a multitude of Landsat scenes. A median NDVI compositing technique was used to select Landsat observations from cloud- and shadow-free pixels that met day-of-year and year constraints. This technique produced seamless, phenologically consistent composites that are largely free of artifacts and suitable for regional-scale analysis. Ground-based training data and an archive of very-high-resolution (< 2-m pixel) commercial imagery provide means to evaluate statistical and data-mining approaches.",

            "abstract": "Impact melt breccias (IMBs) are complex mixtures of melt products and relict clasts of target rocks. Some show petrographic evidence for multiple phases of melt injection. A thin section of one such specimen from the Apollo 17 sample suite contains three distinctive melt domains. Laser microprobe 40Ar/39Ar dating reveals that each has a distinctive age, and the range of apparent melt-injection events spans 100’s of millions of years. Why did the younger melts not completely or partially reset the K-Ar systematics of older melt products? The answer appears to be that the thermal effects of injections of thin veinlets of melt are too transient to produce measurable Ar loss from the host rock. We have coupled a thermal model of the instantaneous injection of a planar melt vein into an infinite rocky medium [1] with a diffusive loss model for spherical grains present in the host material near a vein contact [2]. We used experimentally determined diffusion parameters for Ar in plagioclase [3] in our modeling since it is the least retentive phase in lunar IMBs for which such parameters have been published. At a given distance into the host from the vein contact, the peak temperature and, thus, the peak diffusivity, is controlled by the thickness of the melt vein (i.e., by the thermal mass deposited in the host). Our goal was to constrain the minimum thickness of a melt vein that would cause enough heating for a nearby grain to lose radiogenic 40Ar* to shift its age by 1% (a common 2σ analytical precision for 40Ar/39Ar dates of lunar samples). For a 3800 Ma old grain, ca. 2.4% of 40Ar* must be lost to cause a 38 Ma (1%) reduction in the apparent age. Assuming an ambient temperature of -33 ˚C, a > 24 mm-thick vein of 1500 ˚C melt would be required to cause this level of 40Ar* loss from a 20 µm-diameter plagioclase located 100 µm away from the contact. In the sample we studied, typical vein thicknesses are much smaller (< 4 mm). For a grain of the same size and distance from the melt, the dike would need to be at least 2.1 meters thick to completely reset the K-Ar system. The results of our modeling underscore the utility of laser microprobe 40Ar/39Ar dating for robust reconstructions of the history of polygenetic IMBs. [1] J.

            "abstract": "Temperature and pressure changes associated with the cyclic steam simulation (CSS) used in heavy oil production from sands are accompanied by significant deformation. Inversion of geomechanical data may provide a potentially powerful reservoir monitoring tool where geomechanical effects are significant. Induced pore pressure changes can be inverted from measurable surface deformations by solving an inverse problem of poroelasticity. In this work, we apply this approach to estimating pore pressure changes from surface tilt measurements at a heavy oil reservoir undergoing cyclic steam simulation. Steam was injected from November 2007 through January 2008. Surface tilt measurements were collected from 25 surface tilt stations during this period. The injection ran in two overlapping phases: Phase 1 ran from the beginning of the injection though mid-December, and Phase 2 overlapped with Phase 1 and ran through the beginning of January. During Phase 1 steam was injected in the western part of the reservoir, followed by injection in the eastern part in Phase 2.\nThe pore pressure evolution was inverted from daily tilt measurements using regularized constrained least squares fitting, the results are shown on the plot. Estimated induced pore pressure change (color scale), observed daily incremental tilts (green arrows) and modeled daily incremental tilts (red arrows) are shown in three panels corresponding to two and five weeks of injection, and the end of injection period. DGPS measurements available for a single location were used as an additional inversion constraint.\nThe results indicate that the pore pressure increase in the reservoir follows the same pattern as the steam injection, from west to east. This qualitative behaviour is independent of the amount of regularization, indirectly validating our inversion approach. Patches of lower pressure appear to be stable with regard to regularization and may provide valuable insight into the efficiency of steam injection. Inversion of pore pressure (and surface deformation) from tilts in this case is non-unique, and the DGPS measurement provided an important additional constraint. The method can be applied to inverting pore pressure changes from InSAR observations, and the latter can be expected to reduce limitations due to noise in tilt measurements.",

            "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid rangelands where vegetation is typically sparse, a synergistic relationship is assumed to exist between spatial distribution of plants and hydrologic and erosion processes. It is believed that areas underneath plant canopy have been conditioned to act as sediment, nutrients and water sinks whereas interspaces evolve into flow concentration pathways acting as source areas. This vegetation – hydrology feedback mechanism is part of a broader Vegetation Driven Spatial Heterogeneity (VDSH) concept that has been traditionally studied from a theoretical stand point but with little support from experimental data. In shrub-dominated rangeland communities, this VDSH concept implies that spatial distribution of vegetation can be used to model: (1) the level of hillslope dissection into concentrated flow and sheet flow areas and (2) the magnitude of sediment entrapment (deposition) expected from a given vegetation spatial arrangement. In this study, we developed a methodology to test these two hypotheses and derive practical equations for modeling purposes. From a series of rainfall / runoff experiments on naturally vegetated shrubland erosion plots, flow concentration and erosion / deposition processes were quantified using a combination of sediment yield data and high resolution microtopographic changes detected with advance 3D reconstruction technologies (lidar and photogrammetry). This study is expected to produce for the first time (1) predictive equations for spatial frequency of flow concentration pathways in shrub-dominated rangeland communities and (2) equations for sediment delivery ratio, a measure of the portion of eroded sediment that reaches the hillslope outlet as a function of vegetation spatial arrangement.",

            "abstract": "Surface water is a vital resource affected by changes in climate and anthropogenic factors. Knowledge of surface water dynamics provides critical information for flood and drought management. Here we focused on the on the entire Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia, a large semi-arid region with scarce water resources, high hydroclimatic variability and competing water demands, impacted by climate change, altered flow regimes and land use changes. The MDB is also an area where substantial investment in environmental water allocation of large volumes of environmental flow was made. We used Landsat TM and ETM+ time series to synoptically map the dynamic of surface water extent with an internally consistent algorithm (Tulbure and Broich, 2013) over decades (1986-2011). We used a subset of Landsat path/rows for image training in both wet and dry years. Results show high interannual variability in number and size of flooded areas, with flooded areas during the Millennium Drought (until 2009) being substantially smaller than during the excessive 2010-2011 La Nina flooding. Flooding frequency in 2006, a very dry year was lower than in 2010, the La Nina year when extensive floods occurred. More developed areas of the basin showed different inter-annual patterns from natural areas of the basin. At Barmah-Millewa, the largest river red gum forest in the world, we also mapped flooded forest and tracked changes in NDVI. Higher NDVI values were found in areas more frequently flooded. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of flooding and the response of riparian vegetation communities to flooding is important for management of floodplain wetlands and vegetation communities and for investigating effectiveness of environmental flows and flow regimes in the MDB. Existing maps of inundated areas are linked with river flow to quantify the relationship between river flow and inundated area in the MDB. Historic flood inundation extent mapped via remote sensing can be used to quantify spatially explicit changes in surface water dynamics and vegetation communities as outcomes of management scenarios in response to water management decisions. This methodology is globally applicable and relevant to areas prone to flooding with competing water demands and can be used for mapping water availability in data scarce regions.",

            "abstract": "Urban development has altered the physical and biological properties of native ecosystems worldwide. Research on the environmental outcomes of development continues to increase in scope. Climate phenomena, such as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Park Cool Island (PCI), are frequently used to illustrate how cities and managed landscapes differ from rural lands. The UHI describes the disparity between urban and rural temperatures, and results from heat retention within the built environment. These effects may be locally mitigated by vegetation (PCI). While the UHI is a useful tool for examining cities on a large scale, the methods are often too coarse to describe what individuals experience. We wondered: What large-scale climate trends are detectable at microclimate levels? Are microclimate patterns within residential landscapes typical, or are they geographically variable? To investigate, we installed sensors to monitor the air temperature within yards (residential landscapes) and native landscapes of 6 US cities from unique climate zones; Los Angeles, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Miami, and Boston. We hypothesized that microclimate trends would be similar among cities, and that microclimate patterns would predominate over large-scale climate trends within residential landscapes, especially when atmospheric mixing is low.\nAir temperature data collected between Aug. 2012 and July 2014 reveal that residential landscapes experience significantly different temperatures than native landscapes (pre-sunrise). The differences drive cities toward similarity, despite the variability of climate zones. The 6 cities also experience similar patterns of diurnal temperature fluctuations. Daily temperature ranges in yards are significantly greater than in their corresponding native landscapes during cooler months (p < 0.05; Oct – Mar, except Boston; no difference), and greater (p < 0.05; Baltimore and Miami) or not significantly different from May - September. Our results suggest that microclimates in residential landscapes can create local heat sinks within the built environment that may alleviate UHI effects in some cities. Additionally, microclimates found in yards follow similar trends among cities, which can contribute to homogenization of urban environments across the US.",

            "abstract": "The Cenozoic Pamir orogen formed in response to the India-Asia collision. Existing datasets shows that the range grew since ca. 25 Ma, however the early Cenozoic history remains unconstrained. In that period, global climate changed from greenhouse to icehouse, the proto-Paratethys sea retreated out of Asia and continental aridification as well as monsoons established over Asia. These environmental changes are held responsible for major floral and faunal crises. However, the causal relationships between these events remains to be established because of the lack of accurate age constraints on their geological records. Here, we provide well-dated stratigraphic records using magneto- and bio-stratigraphy from the basins surrounding the Pamir. Southeast of the Pamir, along the Kunlun Shan into the southwestern Tarim Basin, Eocene marine deposits are continuously overlain by 41 to 15 Ma continental redbeds themselves overlain by conglomerates in a classic foreland sequence with upward increasing grain-size, accumulation rates and provenance proximity. However, North of the Pamir along the southwestern Tian Shan and West of the Pamir into the Afghan-Tadjik Basin, the entire Oligocene period appears to be missing from the record between the last marine and the first continental sediments dated to the Early Miocene. This supports a simple model in response to initial Eocene Pamir indentation with foreland basin activation in the Southeast related to the Kunlun Shan northward thrusting, followed much later by early Miocene activation of the northern foreland basin related to the southwestern Tian Shan overthrusting. The coeval activation of a lithospheric right-lateral strike-slip system along the Pamir/Tarim boundary may have enabled to transfer deformation from the India-Asia collision to the Tian Shan and possibly the Talas Fergana fault. This simple model suggests the following two-stage paleoenvironmental evolution: (1) Late Eocene sea retreat linked to the onset of Pamir indentation in conjunction with global sea-level drop, decreasing CO2 levels and ice-cap formation and (2) Early Miocene Tarim Basin closure by northward indentation of the Pamir plateau. This two-stage evolution is consistent with the Eocene occurrence of continental aridity and Asian Monsoons and their Early Miocene intensification.",

            "abstract": "Magnetostratigraphic investigations carried out in Siberia have shown that the middle Cambrian was marked by an extremely high geomagnetic field reversal frequency of about 7 to 10 rev./Myr. The results available for the Lower Cambrian are more uncertain but they may indicate an even higher reversal frequency, which could thus reveal a very unstable nature of the geomagnetic field at this time. Recent magnetostratigraphic results also suggest that the geomagnetic reversal frequency has been extraordinarily high at the end of the Precambrian, thus in agreement with the Lower Cambrian data. We will present a review of these data, and will further describe new results we have obtained from Late Ediacaran-Nemakit-Daldynian sections of the south-western Siberian platform (Enisey range, Teya and Chapa rivers valleys). All these data provide consistent evidences for an ultra-high geomagnetic field reversal frequency, and thus for the exceptional nature of the geomagnetic field, around the Precambrian-Cambrian transition. We will also discuss a number of hypotheses which could explain a temporary destabilization of the geomagnetic field.",

            "abstract": "An effective parameterization of clouds and aerosols in retrieval algorithms is essential for reducing measurement errors and biases in estimates of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) from space-based measurements of near-infrared reflected sunlight. The NASA Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) XCO2 retrieval algorithm has evolved significantly over the past several years in an effort to more accurately represent the impact of clouds and aerosols on XCO2. Recent ACOS algorithm versions up to build 3.4 used a water cloud type, ice cloud type, and two generic aerosol types for each sounding. ACOS build 3.5 uses the same cloud parameterization, but was modified to replace the “one-size-fits-all” aerosol scheme. Build 3.5 uses a monthly aerosol climatology based on the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis to choose the two most likely aerosol types for a given measurement location, along with typical optical depths. The five MERRA types available for selection are sulfate, dust, sea salt, organic carbon, and black carbon. The algorithm then uses a pre-assigned Gaussian width and height and fits for the aerosol amount and peak height based on information from the 760 nm O2 A-band and the CO2 bands centered near 1610 and 2060 nm.\nHere we compare ACOS builds 3.4 and build 3.5 to quantify the impact of the aerosol scheme update. Two types of tests were performed. Simulated Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) retrievals and their associated aerosol and cloud profiles were compared to the “true” aerosol and cloud profiles used to create the simulated environment for a given measurement. The retrieval algorithms were also run on Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) observations and compared to AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol optical depth measurements in order to quantify the ability of the algorithms to retrieve information about aerosol optical depths. XCO2 errors and biases were evaluated for both builds to test the hypothesis that a more realistic aerosol parameterization leads to a reduction in XCO2 errors.",

This beam also can produce the appearance of Langmuir Harmonics. These ionospheric plasma waves (Langmuir, Langmuir harmonics and ion acoustic) can be detected with Incoherent Scatter Radars (ISRs). In particular, enhanced ion acoustic waves are frequently observed at high latitude during Auroral events, which can be associated to electron precipitation. The enhanced ion acoustic waves might also have other possible drivers in addition to the penetrating electron beam. However, an electron beam is the only driver that might destabilize Langmuir and ion acoustic waves together with generating Langmuir harmonics. In this work we evaluate the feasibility of detecting generated Langmuir harmonic waves, in particular the first harmonic, with current ISRs. We also evaluate the impact that detecting those signatures (e.g. first Langmur harmonic wave) in the ISR's spectrum would have in the plasma and beam parameter estimation procedure. We propose some observational experiments with Sondrestrom and EISCAT, and report the obtained preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Soil dust aerosols in Earth system models are typically assumed to have globally uniform properties. However, important climate processes related to dust depend on the aerosol mineral and chemical composition, which varies regionally. Such processes include aerosol radiative forcing, transport of bioavailable iron that catalyzes marine photosynthesis, heterogeneous chemistry, ice nucleation, and cloud condensation.\nWe have implemented a new version of the soil dust aerosol scheme in the NASA GISS Earth System ModelE that takes into account the mineral composition of the dust particles. Dust aerosols are represented as an external mixture of minerals such as illite, kaolinite, smectite, carbonates, quartz, feldspar and gypsum, as well as iron oxides and accretions of iron oxides with each of the these minerals.\nWe present a new publically available compilation of measurements of mineral fractions derived from ca. 50 references from the literature. This compilation is used to evaluate our new model of mineral and elemental composition within ModelE. We discuss the challenges of comparing simulated mineral fractions to measurements, which often come from field campaigns and ship cruises of limited duration. Despite uncertainties of the measurements, we show the importance of estimating the undisturbed size distribution of the parent soil prior to wet sieving, along with the modification of this size distribution during emission. \nIn particular, our new model reproduces measurements showing greater amount of aerosols at silt sizes (whose diameters exceed 2 μm) including significant amounts of clay mineral aerosols (like illite) at silt sizes. Our model also reduces the systematic overestimation of quartz, while allowing iron to be transported farther from its source as impurities than in its pure, crystalline form.",

Understanding\nthese transitions requires improved time constraints and high-resolution proxy records. Here we\npresent new δ13C (organic carbon & carbonate) chemostratigraphic record of a lacustrine\nsequence in a locality named “Lake Carpenter”, near Moab, Utah. Lake Carpenter (LC)\ncomprises interbedded limestone and mudstone units of the Ruby Ranch Member of the CMF.\nResults of the chemostratigraphy are constrained by detrital zircons from the section allowing\ncorrelation of the chemostratigraphy to the carbon isotope segments C9 to C11 (Bralower et al.,\n1999) spanning the Late Aptian to Early Albian, and supported by previous litho- and\nchemostratigraphic work in the CMF. δ13Corg values show a pronounced negative stepped\nexcursion, of -6‰ with values reaching -32.3 ‰ occurring in conjunction with an increase in\nTOC. This negative excursion is followed by a positive recovery, with values of ~-25‰ and\nrelatively low TOC. δ13Ccarb records positive values, up to +8‰, in the lowermost part of the\nsection (< ~7m) followed by a decrease to ~-7 ‰. δ18Ocarb over this interval records values\nbetween -2 and -4‰ followed by a decrease to ~-7‰. The lowermost portion of the LC section\nis indicative of relatively deep lacustrine environment in which organic carbon burial influenced\nthe δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake. This lower δ13C of DIC may be due to\nincreased upwelling and/or turnover and recycling of organic carbon in the lake. Variability of\nδ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb values may reflect changes in water supply to the lake, or climatic variability\nresulting in the lake drying out. δ13Corg values may be affected by local lake dynamics, including\nvariations in organic carbon storage and changes in algal productivity, perhaps also indicative of\nchanges in nutrient availability due to increased run off and/or fluctuations in atmospheric\ncarbon particularly light δ13Corg. Both climatic and hydrological variation in the section may be\ndue to the rise of the Sevier Mountains resulting in an orographic impact on the lake either as a\nresult of increase in high altitude run off, or changes in the amount of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) mission is instrumental in providing highly accurate radiance measurements that are critical for monitoring the Earth’s radiation budget. Two identical CERES instruments are deployed aboard NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites Terra and Aqua. Each CERES instrument consists of scanning thermistor bolometer sensors that measure broadband radiances in the shortwave (0.3 to 5 micron), total (0.3 to < 100 micron) and water vapor window (8 to 12 micron) regions. CERES instruments have the capability of scanning in either the cross-track or rotating azimuth plane (RAP) scan mode. Cross-track scanning, the primary mode of CERES operation, allows for the geographical mapping of the radiation fields while RAP scanning enables the acquisition of data over a more extensive combination of viewing configurations, needed for developing vastly improved angular distribution models used in radiance to flux conversion.\nTo evaluate, achieve and maintain radiometric stability, a rigorous and comprehensive radiometric calibration and validation protocol is implemented. Calibrations and validation studies have indicated spectral changes in the reflected solar spectral regions of the shortwave and total sensors. Spectral darkening is detected in the shortwave channel optics, which is more prominent while the instrument operates in RAP mode. In the absence of a climatological explanation for this darkening, this likely occurs during part of the RAP scan cycle when the scan plane is aligned with the direction of motion, making the optics more susceptible to increased UV exposure and molecular contamination. Additionally, systematic daytime-nighttime longwave top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux inconsistency was also detected during validation, which highlights the changes in the shortwave region of the total sensor.\nThis paper briefly describes the strategy to correct for the sensor response changes and presents the improvements in CERES Edition 4 data products, which incorporates these sensor response changes in the computation of radiances.",

            "abstract": "Recent storm surge events due to Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have motivated the efforts to accurately forecast water levels. Toward this goal, a parallel architecture has been implemented based on a high resolution storm surge model, ADCIRC. However the accuracy of the model notably depends on the quality and the recentness of the input data (mainly winds and bathymetry), model parameters (e.g. wind and bottom drag coefficients), and the resolution of the model grid. Given all these uncertainties in the system, the challenge is to build an efficient prediction system capable of providing accurate forecasts enough ahead of time for the authorities to evacuate the areas at risk.\nWe have developed an ensemble-based data assimilation system to frequently assimilate available data into the ADCIRC model in order to improve the accuracy of the model. In this contribution we study and analyze the performances of different ensemble Kalman filter methodologies for efficient short-range storm surge forecasting, the aim being to produce the most accurate forecasts at the lowest possible computing time. Using Hurricane Ike meteorological data to force the ADCIRC model over a domain including the Gulf of Mexico coastline, we implement and compare the forecasts of the standard EnKF, the hybrid EnKF and an adaptive EnKF. The last two schemes have been introduced as efficient tools for enhancing the behavior of the EnKF when implemented with small ensembles by exploiting information from a static background covariance matrix. Covariance inflation and localization are implemented in all these filters. Our results suggest that both the hybrid and the adaptive approach provide significantly better forecasts than those resulting from the standard EnKF, even when implemented with much smaller ensembles.",

Modeling the heat and salt flux at Europa’s ice/ocean interface is necessary to understand the dynamics of Europa’s ocean and its interaction with the upper ice shell as well as the history of active turbulence at this area. To achieve this goal, we used McPhee et al., 2008 parameterizations on Earth’s ice/ocean interface that was developed to meet Europa’s ocean dynamics. We varied one parameter at a time to test its influence on both; “h” the basal ice growth rate and on “R” the double diffusion tendency strength. The double diffusion tendency “R” was calculated as the ratio between the interface heat exchange coefficient αh to the interface salt exchange coefficient αs. Our preliminary results showed a strong double diffusion tendency R ~200 at Europa’s ice-ocean interface for plausible changes in the heat flux due to onset or elimination of a hydrothermal activity, suggesting supercooling and a strong tendency for forming frazil ice.",

            "abstract": "At the five diverse forested and/or alpine headwater sites of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) program, we measure stream concentrations of all forms of carbon – DOC, PC (assumed to be POC), CO2, CH4, and bicarbonate alkalinity. One goal of this work is to estimate DIC, DOC, and POC fluxes from headwater landscapes. For DOC, POC, and CO2, we utilize high-frequency measurements with in situ sensors. We also take discrete samples over a range of hydrologic conditions for independent flux calculations, and to verify the sensor measurements and test proxy relations. In situ fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM) serves as a proxy for DOC. Turbidity is needed to adjust FDOM, and also serves as a proxy for POC. DIC flux is computed from the discrete alkalinity analyses.\nSensor measurements at the five sites – in Colorado, Wisconsin, Vermont, Georgia, and Puerto Rico -- began either in 2011 or 2012. The sensors generally functioned well, but occasional down time required gap filling, typically using strong relations with stream discharge. We computed at least one full year of carbon flux at each site. In this paper we compare sensor-based and sampling-based carbon flux estimates. We interpret the differences among sites in total carbon flux and its relative apportionment among DIC, DOC, and POC, with respect to climate and ecosystem type. Finally, we evaluate the significance of stream carbon flux as a component of the ecosystem carbon balance.",

            "abstract": "The scientific literature is full of studies analyzing future climate change impacts on hydrology with focus on individual catchments. However, we recently found that hydrologic behavior and specific discharge vary considerably even in neighboring and rather similar catchments under current climate conditions and that these variations are related to landscape characteristics. Therefore we hypothesize that these landscape characteristics also play a fundamental role for the sensitivity of a catchment to changing climate conditions. We analyzed the hydrological response of 14 neighboring catchments in Northern Sweden with slightly different topography, land cover, size and geology. Current (1981-2010) and future (2061-2090) streamflow was simulated with the HBV light model. Climate projections were based on 14 regional climate models (ENSEMBLES EU project) and bias-corrected with a distribution-mapping approach. Our simulations revealed that future spring flood peaks will occur much earlier and decrease by 13 to 32 %, whereas winter base flows will increase slightly. These changes are somewhat expected and mainly triggered by a projected increase in winter temperature, which leads to less snow accumulation on the ground. However, these values also highlight that there is a large variability amongst the catchments in their hydrological response to the same future climate conditions. For example, spring flood peaks in catchments without wetlands decrease by only 13 to 15 %, whereas catchments with wetlands show a spring flood peak reduction of 20 to 32 %. In addition to wetlands, we also identified lakes, peat soils and higher elevations as factors that seem to cause a stronger hydrological response to the climate change signal, whereas catchments dominated by forests, steeper slopes and till soils seem to be less strongly affected by a changing climate. Therefore, our results suggest that the sensitivity of catchments to future climate conditions is strongly linked to landscape characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Plasticity and the subsequent development of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) in mantle minerals is important for understanding dynamic processes in the mantle, e.g. the interpretation of seismic anisotropy as a result of CPO developed by mantle convection. Furthermore, plastic behavior of multi-phase polycrystals is still not well understood. A polycrystal plasticity code (VPFFT) with an n-site approach is used to model the development of CPO in a hard magnesium silicate perovskite and a soft periclase aggregate under an applied strain, given certain combinations of active slip systems. Special attention is put to the influence of microstructure and phase hardness contrast on CPO. Preliminary results show that in the case where periclase is surrounding the hard perovskite phase, the deformation concentrates on the soft periclase but the perovskite still develops an appreciable and amount of CPO, in agreement with experimental data. These polycrystal plasticity models are compared to diamond anvil cell experiments in the radial geometry (rDAC) where CPO is recorded as azimuthal variations of intensity along Debye rings in a diffraction pattern. Two different starting materials, enstatite+periclase and olivine, are used for the nucleation of the perovskite and periclase aggregate, microstructures are expected to differ between the two starting materials due to nucleation differences. Preliminary results show that perovskite develops a (001) texture and periclase a stronger (001) maxima. The comparison of VPFFT results with rDAC experiments gives and idea of the relative activities of the various slip systems in this aggregate and help to constrain seismic and geophysical modeling of the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Rutile U-Pb thermochronology is applied successfully by both TIMS and beam methods to date cooling events in mafic and metapelitic rocks, as well as in detrital studies. The Zr-in-rutile thermometer is very robust to thermal diffusion, and generally requires complete recrystallization to change recorded crystallization temperatures. Evidence for diffusion of HFSE elements in rutile is sparse; whereas U-Pb chronology generally records diffusion controlled cooling from the last event.\nThis study follows conventional thermobarometry and U-Pb TIMS results on monazite, sphene and rutile of Möller et al. (1995) establishing a 2 Ga eclogite facies event from MORB-like metabasic, and metapelitic rocks in the Usagaran Orogen of Tanzania, interpreted to be the oldest outcrops of subduction-related eclogites. Rutile from both rock types were discordant near a ca. 500 Ma lower intercept, confirming a thermal overprint postulated on the basis of K-Ar and Rb-Sr mica ages by e.g. Wendt et al. (1972). The age of the eclogite-facies event was confirmed by U-Pb zircon dating of a 1991±2 Ma crosscutting pegmatite (Collins et al., 1999).\nWe present in situ LA-ICP-MS rutile petrochronology on five metabasic and metapelitic eclogite facies samples with variable retrograde amphibolite-facies recrystallization. Thermometry confirms conventional Fe-Mg results, including higher peak temperatures in metabasites. Traverses on rutile inclusions in large garnet prophyroblasts in metapelites show increasing temperatures from cores outwards and a slight decrease towards outermost rims, with peak T coinciding with highest Mg# and highest grossular content, hence consistent with preservation of prograde zoning in the garnets and a brief eclogite facies event. Large rutiles (800µm) in recrystallized samples record temperature zoning profiles. U-Pb results show inheritance of near concordant 2 Ga domains, but dominantly confirm the ca. 490 Ma amphibolite facies overprint.\nThe study is an excellent example of the potential of in-situ rutile petrochronology in complex, polymetamorphic rocks when meticulous attention is given to textural context.\nMöller et al., 1995, Geology, v. 23, p. 1067-1070.\nCollins et al., 2004, Earth Planet.

Recently, there were unusual several serial offshore earthquakes occurred around the southern Korean Peninsula. In addition, on 5 February 2013, a small-sized earthquake (ML 3.5) occurred in the central south of the southern Korean Peninsula and it had unusual number of aftershocks. The multi-channel cross-correlation method was applied to the 4 weeks of continuous seismograms from the nearest seismic station that includes the 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the main event, which revealed that this event was accompanied by more than 54 micro aftershocks. The 12 events, including the main event, with magnitude greater than 1.0 were selected for further analysis to investigate the characteristics of the main event: focal mechanism and its source parameters. The focal mechanism of the events was determined from the first P motion polarities. The Joint Hypocenter Determination method for the 12 events indicated that a left-lateral vertical strike-slip fault would be the possible fault plane. The source parameters of the main event were obtained by the empirical Green’s function method. The fault radius and the stress drop were estimated to 0.3~0.5±0.1 km and 30~50±20 bar, respectively, while the stress drop was about 49 bar from S wave displacement spectra by which the moment magnitude and the corner frequency were estimated to 3.83 and 3.21 Hz, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and sediment storage or removal in intermontane basins have the potential to modulate plateau growth. Previous studies suggest that the lithostatic load of thick sedimentary basin fills promotes the propagation of deformation into the foreland, whereas the removal of large volumes of sediment results in thrusting stepping back into the hinterland. To investigate these feedbacks, we reconstruct the Neogene-Quaternary deformational and sedimentary history of the northern Humahuaca basin, an intermontane basin on margin of the Puna Plateau. The timing of faulting, folding, sediment accumulation, and unconformities is constrained by U-Pb zircon dating of volcanic ashes interbedded with the sedimentary fill. As in the southern Humahuaca basin, the transition from westerly-derived sandstone and conglomeratic foreland basin deposits (Maimará Fm.) to predominately conglomeratic intermontane basin fills with variable provenance occurred at 4.3 Ma and is interpreted to result from uplift of the eastern basin-bounding ranges. In the northern Humahuaca basin, however, this transition is punctuated by two unconformities between 5 - 3.8 Ma. Between 4.3 - 2.5 Ma, the basin fill was dominated by rounded pebble-cobble conglomerates. Around 2.5 Ma, these conglomerates gave way to the fine-grained deposits of the Uquía Fm. and sediment-accumulation rates increased from 200-400 m/Myr to >500 m/Myr. This interval of fine-grained deposition and high sediment-accumulation rates may reflect a period of basin isolation and severed fluvial connectivity with the foreland related to increased aridity as a result of uplift of the eastern ranges. The transition back to conglomerates occurs at 2.2 Ma in the southern part of the northern Humahuaca basin and sometime between 2.1 and 1.3 Ma in the north. An unconformity exists between 2 Ma and 1 Ma strata. Thrust faults on the west side of the basin were active from >4.3 Ma to <3 Ma. Thrusts in the center of the basin were active sometime after 2 Ma and the easternmost thrust in the basin was likely active after 1.3 Ma. This timing suggests that rapid sediment accumulation between 2.5 - 2 Ma may have suppressed faulting in the center of the basin, whereas the removal of some of this sediment (i.e., the unconformity between 2 - 1 Ma) promoted intrabasin faulting.",

            "abstract": "Simulation of volcanic emissions in climate models requires information that describes the eruption of the emissions into the atmosphere. While the total amount of gases and aerosols released from a volcanic eruption can be readily estimated from satellite observations, information about the source parameters, like injection altitude, eruption time and duration, is often not directly known. The AeroCOM volcanic emissions inventory provides estimates of eruption source parameters and has been used to initialize volcanic emissions in reanalysis projects, like MERRA. The AeroCOM volcanic emission inventory provides an eruption’s daily SO2 flux and plume top altitude, yet an eruption can be very short lived, lasting only a few hours, and emit clouds at multiple altitudes. Case studies comparing the satellite observed dispersal of volcanic SO2 clouds to simulations in MERRA have shown mixed results. Some cases show good agreement with observations Okmok (2008), while for other eruptions the observed initial SO2 mass is half of that in the simulations, Sierra Negra (2005). In other cases, the initial SO2 amount agrees with the observations but shows very different dispersal rates, Soufriere Hills (2006). \n In the aviation hazards community, deriving accurate source terms is crucial for monitoring and short-term forecasting (24-h) of volcanic clouds. Back trajectory methods have been developed which use satellite observations and transport models to estimate the injection altitude, eruption time, and eruption duration of observed volcanic clouds. These methods can provide eruption timing estimates on a 2-hour temporal resolution and estimate the altitude and depth of a volcanic cloud. \nTo better understand the differences between MERRA simulations and volcanic SO2 observations, back trajectory methods are used to estimate the source term parameters for a few volcanic eruptions and compared to their corresponding entry in the AeroCOM volcanic emission inventory. The nature of these mixed results is discussed with respect to the source term estimates.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been consistently linked to cardiovascular and respiratory health effects. Although PM is currently monitored by a network of surface stations, these are too sparsely distributed to provide the level of spatial detail needed to link different aerosol species to given health effects, and expansion to denser coverage is impractical and cost prohibitive. We present a methodology for combining Chemical Transport Model (CTM) aerosol type information and multiangular spectropolarimetric data to establish the signature of specific aerosol types in top-of-atmosphere measurements, and relate it to speciated surface PM2.5 loadings. In particular, we employ the WRF-Chem model run at the University of Nebraska, and remote sensing data from the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) to explore the feasibility of this approach. We demonstrate that the CTM does well in predicting the types of aerosols present at a given location and time, however large uncertainties currently exist in CTM estimates of the concentration of the various aerosol species (e.g., black carbon, sulfate, dust, etc.) leading to large uncertainties to model-derived speciated PM 2.5. In order to constrain CTM aerosol surface concentrations we use AirMSPI UV-VIS-NIR observations of intensity, and blue, red, and NIR observations of the Q and U Stokes parameters. We select specific scenes observed by AirMSPI and use WRF-Chem to generate an initial distribution of aerosol composition. The relevant optical properties for each aerosol species are used to calculate aerosol light scattering information. This is then used in a vector (polarized) 1-D radiative transfer model to determine at-instrument Stokes parameters for the specific AirMSPI viewing geometries. As a first step, a match is sought between the CTM-predicted radiances and the AirMSPI observations. Then, the total aerosol optical depth and fractions of various aerosol species are modified via optimization to produce a better match to the observations, and converted to PM2.5 speciated loadings using CTM aerosol vertical profiles. Finally, the results are compared to available ground-based and in situ data to validate this approach.",

In the present study we use waveform recordings from near-fault stations along the broader Karadere-Düzce area operating during the Izmit and Duzce aftershock periods. We analyze the data using automatic detection of direct P and fault zone head waves along with the manual inspections and particle motion analysis. Preliminary results indicate abundant early arrivals before the direct P at many stations that appear to be head waves, but show no moveout with different source-receiver distances. These phases may reflect local bimaterial interfaces near the stations that may be associated with fault-zone-related basin structures. We also observe at some stations head wave type signals before the direct P waves that show systematic move-out with increasing propagation distance along the fault and may indicate a deep velocity contrast across the NAFZ in the area.

The age distribution of zircon reference material varies slightly from sample fraction to sample fraction, and the published results for GJ-1 are slightly discordant. As a result, using the published data for the distributed standard splits can lead to small systematic variations when comparing datasets from different labs, and more high precision data are needed to evaluate potential inhomogeneity of sample splits used in different laboratories.\nHere we characterize these reference materials with cathodoluminescence, LA-ICP-MS traverses across grains, and high precision CA-TIMS to better constrain the ages and assess zoning of these standards, and present the data for comparison with other laboratories. Reducing systematic error by dating our own reference material lends confidence to our analyses and allows for inter-laboratory age reproducibility of unknowns. Additionally, the reduction in propagated uncertainties (especially in GJ-1, for which both the red and yellow variety will be analyzed) will be used to improve long-term reproducibility, comparisons between samples of similar age, detrital populations and composite pluton zircons.\nJackson, S.E., et al., 2004, Chemical Geology, v. 211, p. 47-69.\nPaces, J.B. & Miller, J.D., 1993, Journal of Geophysical Research, v. 80, p. 13997-14013.\nSlama, J., et al., 2008, Chemical Geology, v. 249. p. 1-35.",

Here, we examine the topology and evolution of extreme rainfall across the Indian subcontinent by constructing a complex network of extreme rainfall events in the region for three periods - pre-monsoon (March - May), ISM (June - September), and post-monsoon (October - December). Networks are constructed using a synchronization measure between grid cells for a satellite-derived data set (TRMM) and a rain-gauge interpolated data set (APHRODITE). Through the analysis of various complex network metrics, such as degree, betweenness, and average link length, we describe typical repetitive patterns in North Pakistan, the Eastern Ghats, and the Tibetan Plateau. These patterns appear during the pre-monsoon season, evolve during the ISM, and disappear during the post-monsoon season. Our findings suggest that these are important meteorological features that deserve further attention and may be useful for the prediction of the strength and timing of the ISM.",

Despite their importance in landscape evolution and their ubiquity, tidal meanders have received less attention when compared to their fluvial counterparts. Quite a few studies, in fact, have focused on the morphodynamic evolution of tidal meanders, together with their planimetric shape and morphometric characteristics. To improve current understanding of tidal meander migration and its possible stratigraphic implications, we have analyzed a sequence of aerial photographs (from 1938 to present day) for a 20 m in diameter, abandoned tidal meander in the Venice Lagoon, and have carried out high-resolution sedimentological and chronostratigraphical analyses of channel deposits. Aerial photographs before and after the cutoff event have been used to infer a minimum velocity of migration. Well-cores have also been collected along a transect crossing through the neck zone in order to evaluate changes in grain size, sedimentation rates across the cutoff event, and gain further insight into the velocity of migration of meander bends. Spatial distribution of sedimentary facies (pointbar sand, oxbowlake and saltmarsh mud), grain size analyses, and 210 Pb and 137Cs chronometers highlighted that meander cutoff occurred progressively around 60 years ago with a velocity of migration of about 0.5m/year. The effectiveness of the methods and the high spatial and temporal resolution of the data call for further investigations and analyses of the type proposed herein, furthermore highlighting the potentiality of the study area as modern analogue for ancient tidal deposits.",

            "abstract": "The fate of soil organic matter with expanding human land use is of increasing concern for planetary health and ecological sustainability. In North American grasslands, cultivation has commonly resulted in loss of stored soil organic carbon to dissolved phases in groundwater and surface water, as well as to atmospheric CO2 via decomposition. In addition, cultivation has released nutrients stored in organic matter and facilitated water movement through soils to benefit crops, increasing groundwater recharge rates. This has altered groundwater chemistry both by changing biogeochemistry of the terrestrial-aquatic interface and by increasing addition of nutrients, herbicides, and pesticides to these systems. In this presentation, we consider the effects of food production practices on terrestrial-aquatic carbon linkages in former grassland ecosystems of western North America. Our data from an agricultural area in central Montana begin to reveal how elevated nitrate and pesticide levels in groundwater on an isolated landform reflect transformation over the last century of a temperate grassland ecosystem for wheat and cattle production. Rates and pathways of carbon and nitrogen loss are inferred from the concentration and isotopic character of both water and carbon and nitrogen over three years in soils, shallow groundwater, emergent springs and surface waters. In this semi-arid, non-irrigated context, the fate of soil organic matter is linked with redistribution of pedogenic carbonate as well as other soil and rock derived solutes. We consider implications for future trends in dissolved carbon and nitrogen in surface waters in the region.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of volatiles in the Earth’s mantle influences properties such as melting temperature, conductivity, and viscosity. To constrain upper mantle water content, secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to measure H2O in olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in xenolith, orogenic, and abyssal peridotites. The comparison of fresh and altered peridotites demonstrates that low to moderate levels of alteration do not affect H2O concentrations, in agreement with mineral diffusion data. In all samples, olivine diffusively lost water during emplacement, as indicated by disequilibrium between olivine and co-existing pyroxenes. In contrast, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene preserve their high temperature water contents, based on partitioning that agrees with published values from experiments and xenoliths. However, preservation of water in pyroxenes suggests that existing experimental diffusion data overestimates the diffusion coefficient for water in pyroxene.\nAmong samples in this study, clinopyroxenes have 60-670 ppm H2O and orthopyroxenes have 10-300 ppm. Using the experimentally determined value of 0.11 for the olivine/orthopyroxene partition coefficient, olivine is calculated to have contained 8-34 ppm H2O. The highest olivine water concentration translates to an effective viscosity of 6×1019 Pa s at 1250°C and ~15 km depth, compared to a dry effective viscosity of 2.5×1021 Pa s. Bulk rock water concentrations, calculated using mineral modes, are 20-220 ppm and correlate with peridotite indices of melt depletion. However, trace element melt modeling indicates that peridotites have too much water relative to their rare earth element concentrations, which may be explained by late-stage melt addition, during which only hydrogen diffuses fast enough for re-equilibration.",

In addition, ensemble retrospective optimal interpolation (EnROI) is derived using the Monte Carlo method form ROI, developed by Song et al. (2011). In this study, both of reduced-rank ROI and EnROI are applied to Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) for validating the algorithm and investigating the capability of data assimilation in the framework of 3-dimensional model.

The perhumid temperate rainforests of southeast Alaska (PCTR) are valuable sites for testing theories and applying models for ecosystem development. The landscape of the PCTR is chronologically young, but by contrast, has experienced rapid change during the Holocene due to a humid climate that promotes intense soil weathering and rapid accumulation of soil organic carbon. We investigated the magnitude of present rock-water interaction in several catchments and watersheds arrayed across a spectrum of this landscape evolution. All of the catchments had evidence of weathering as indicated by cation export relative to sea-salt aerosol input. The magnitude of the weathering signature was inversely related to the accumulation of organic carbon in the catchment. We conclude that biological processes inhibit the weathering of lithologic materials due to organic matter accumulation. However, there is clear evidence that the landscape is still actively weathering. The extent of the consumption of CO2 by rock weathering will be critical in determining long-term carbon budgets in the region and determining the sink strength of the terrestrial ecosystem. This study provides a template for examining landscape evolution in the context of critical zone science in a relatively pristine landscape.",

Our research is focused in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta where we have installed a regional network of flux towers to assess the impacts of land-use change and ecological restoration on CH4 and CO2 fluxes. The Delta was drained for agriculture over a century ago and has since has experienced high rates of subsidence. It is recognized that agriculture on drained peat soils in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding increases CH4 emissions. We conducted multiple years of simultaneous EC measurements at drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture, a corn field and an alfalfa field) and flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and 3 restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Since these sites are all within 20 km of each other, they share the same basic meteorology, enabling a direct comparison of differences in the C and GHG budgets between sites. Using a multi-tower approach we found that converting drained agricultural peatlands to flooded land-use types can help reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions from the Delta. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in wetland restoration in California to generate C credits for both the voluntary C market and the state’s cap-and-trade program. However, information on GHG fluxes from restored wetlands is lacking. Using multi-year measurements of GHG fluxes from restored wetlands of varying ages, our research also aims to understand how CO2 and CH4 fluxes from restored wetlands vary during ecosystem development, determine the daily and seasonal forcings controlling these fluxes, and assess management strategies that can help minimize CH4 fluxes and maximize C uptake in restored wetlands. Our multi-year multi-site research program is beginning to answer these questions and bridge understanding between biometeorology, biogeochemistry and climate policy.",

We are developing methods to monitor the microseismically active zone so that we can identify faults at risk of slipping.\nWe are using the Virtual Seismometer Method (VSM), which is an interferometric technique that is very sensitive to the source parameters (location, mechanism and magnitude) and to the earth structure in the source region. Given an ideal geometry, that is, when two quakes are roughly in line with a recording station, the correlation of their waveforms provide a precise estimate of the Green's function between them, modified by their source mechanisms. When measuring microseismicity, this geometry is rarely ideal and we need to account for variations in the geometry as well. In addition, we also investigate the adjoint method to calculate sensitivity kernels, which define the sensitivity of an observable to model parameters. Classically, adjoint tomography relies on the interaction between a forward waveform, from the source to the recording station, and a backpropagated waveform, from the recorded station to the source. By combining the two approaches we can focus on properties directly between induced micro events, and doing so, monitor the evolution of the seismicity and precisely image potential fault zones.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

Previous studies ranked hydropower sector as the highest priority sector considering the urgency and severity of impacts in countries such as Nepal where hydropower shares 96 percentage of electricity production. In India, 45 per cent of hydroelectricity is generated from glacier fed rivers and hydropower shares 17 per cent of power generation. This study developed a framework to estimate the change in river flow attributed to global climate change and quantify its impact on hydropower generation in South Asian Mountains. The framework is applied on one of the major rivers Koshi River in Nepal with existing and proposed hydropower plants. The integrated assessment approach involved estimation of the change in flow in the river in the first part. Model was developed to estimate the change in flow that uses time series data on precipitation, temperature, remote sensing imagery on snow accumulation and ablation, and slope and surface hydrology. In the second part, another model was developed to investigate the impact of change in flow on hydropower production in various types of hydropower production plants. Data on flow, characteristics of hydropower plants and hydropower produced monthly from power plants in and outside of the river basin were used to model the flow and power generation from various categories of power plants. We will further discuss the results of the integrated assessments of potential changes in hydropower generation in various categories of hydropower plants based on Koshi River under various expected changes in flow and the implications for hydropower generation from other river systems in Nepal and India.",

            "abstract": "This study examined the relative contribution of total mercury (THg) and mono-methylmercury (MMHg) from upstream historical mercury-mining districts to Lake Berryessa, a reservoir with impaired water quality because of mercury. The third and fourth largest historical mercury-producing mining districts in California are within Lake Berryessa’s three largest tributary watersheds: Pope, (Upper) Putah, and Knoxville-Eticuera Creeks. Downstream of the reservoir, Putah Creek drains into the Yolo Bypass, a major source of THg and MMHg to the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Water samples were collected from October 2012 to May 2014 during 37 non-storm and 8 storm events along Pope, (Upper) Putah, and Knoxville-Eticuera Creeks and analyzed for field parameters (temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity). Additionally, water samples collected during five of the non-storm and storm events were analyzed for unfiltered THg and MMHg and total suspended solids (TSS). Discharge was measured during sampling to calculate instantaneous loads. More than 120 streambed sediment samples were collected to determine the spatial variation of THg and organic carbon content (loss on ignition). Across the watersheds, unfiltered THg (in water) samples ranged from 2.3 to 125 ng/L and unfiltered MMHg (in water) samples from 0.12 to 1.0 ng/L. Concentrations of THg ranged from less than 0.0001 to 122 mg/kg in streambed sediment. Tributary reaches with elevated mercury concentrations (“hot spots”) are near or downstream of historical mercury mines and have: (1) strong positive correlations between THg (in water) or MMHg (in water) and TSS (R2> 0.88, n=5); (2) higher instantaneous loads of suspended sediment, THg and MMHg than reaches with low THg and MMHg concentrations; and (3) elevated sediment organic carbon content. Tributary reaches with weaker correlations among THg, MMHg, and TSS in unfiltered water may reflect non-mining sources of dissolved THg and MMHg, such as geothermal springs and groundwater influx from shallow aquifers. The importance of suspended particulate matter relative to THg and MMHg transport in the most contaminated stream reaches indicates that erosion control is likely to be a critical factor in successful remediation efforts in the Upper Putah Creek watershed.",

This work included the continuous measurement of liquid water discharge from the geyser and some nearby not springs, and concurrent meteorological measurements. The discharge of the geyser and the hot springs was measured in channels that carry the water to the Firehole River. We found that average measured discharge varies from day to night, likely due to melting of geyser-generated and meteoric snow during warmer daylight hours and freezing of erupted liquid and vapor during the night. The nearby hot springs contribute a nearly constant flow of about 3 l/s to the Firehole River, while during eruptions the total discharge increases to a maximum of about 25 l/s. Two small geysers within 5 meters of the Lone Star Geyser cone were observed to erupt during a time when Lone Star Geyser was not erupting. The water discharged from these small geysers is a very small fraction of that from Lone Star Geyser.",

            "abstract": "A sensitivity analysis was conducted on an existing parsimonious model aiming to reproduce flow in engineered urban catchments and sewer networks. The model is characterized by his parsimonious feature and is limited to seven calibration parameters. The objective of this study is to demonstrate how different levels of sensitivity analysis can have an influence on the interpretation of input parameter relevance in urban hydrology, even for light structure models. In this perspective, we applied a one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis (SA) as well as a variance-based global and model independent method; the calculation of Sobol indexes. Sobol’s first and total effect indexes were estimated using a Monte-Carlo approach. We present evidences of the irrelevance of calculating Sobol’s second order indexes when uncertainty on index estimation is too high. Sobol’s method results showed that two parameters drive model performance: the subsurface discharge rate and the root zone drainage coefficient (Clapp exponent). Interestingly, the surface discharge rate responsible flow in impervious area has no significant relevance, contrarily to what was expected considering only the one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis. This last statement is clearly not straightforward. It highlights the utility of carrying variance-based sensitivity analysis in the domain of urban hydrology, even when using a parsimonious model, in order to prevent misunderstandings in the system dynamics and consequent management mistakes.",

            "abstract": "Initially thought to be relatively ‘simple’ ecosystems for study, microbial mats have long been considered ideal for any number of research questions. Microbial mats can be found in any number of environments, both natural and manmade, and are typically dependent upon the physiochemical environment for their structure, maintenance and longevity. Ultimately, these and other parameters govern community whereby a microbial mat provides overall ecosystem services to their environment. On the edge of a hotspring in Yellowstone National Park we have found an active microbial mat community that can form a laminated, lithified, accretionary structure that is likely the best example of a living and growing stromatolite. In the outfall channel of the sulfidic Stinking Spring, Utah, we have found examples of both naturally occurring laminated and floating mats where the carbon flux is controlled by abiotic degassing of CO2 rather than metabolism. δ13C-bicarbonate uptake experiments reveal an autotrophic growth rate of 0 – 0.16%/day while δ13C-acetate reveals a higher heterotrophic growth rate of 0.03 – 0.65%/day, which highlights the role of heterotrophs in these mats. Similar growth experiments on Little Hot Creek, California laminated microbial mats reveal a trend for top-down microbial growth with similar microbial taxonomy and diversity to other mat-types. Of a curious note is that incubation experiments with Little Hot Creek mats reveals the importance of particular metals in mat structure and function. Statistically, alpha- and beta-diversity metrics are often used to characterize microbial communities in such systems, but from an analysis of a wastewater treatment system, Hill diversities can better interpret the effective number of species to produce an ecologically intuitive quantity to better understand a microbial mat ecosystem.",

Model results show that ICARB measurements were fairly well representative of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon season. The model reproduced well the magnitude, temporal and spatial variability of BC concentrations observed during the ICARB ship-cruise. Average and standard deviation (representing the spatial and temporal variability) in observed and modeled BC mass concentrations along the ship-track are estimated as 755±734 ng m-3 and 732±913 ng m-3 respectively, where the standard deviation represents the spatial and temporal variability in the region. Average modeled values at most of the inland stations were also found to fall within the range of observed values. Results show that anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions, respectively, accounted for 70% and 28% of the BC mass concentration in South Asia. BC emissions from residential (49%) and industrial (37%) sectors appear to be the major anthropogenic sources, except in the Himalayas where vehicular emissions dominate. We find that, while all parts of continental India contributed to anthropogenic BC over Bay of Bengal, contribution over the Arabian Sea came mostly from southern Peninsula. We also show that long-range transport of anthropogenic emissions contribute up to 30% of BC concentrations in western and eastern India, suggesting that it is important to consider non-local sources along with the local emissions while designing strategies for mitigating BC emissions.",

            "abstract": "On June 1, 2014 (UTC) a magnitude 3.2 earthquake occurred east of the town of Greeley, Colorado. The earthquake was widely felt, with reports from Boulder and Golden, over 60 miles away from the epicenter. The location of the earthquake in a region long considered aseismic but now the locus of active oil and gas production prompted the question of whether this was a natural or induced earthquake. Several classic induced seismicity cases hail from Colorado, including the Rocky Mountain Arsenal earthquakes in the 1960s and the Paradox Valley earthquakes in western Colorado. In both cases the earthquakes were linked to wastewater injection. The Greeley earthquake epicenter was close to a Class II well that had been injecting waste fluid into the deepest sedimentary formation of the Denver Basin at rates as high as 350,000 barrels/month for less than a year. The closest seismometers to the June 1 event were more than 100 km away, necessitating deployment of a local seismic network for detailed study. IRIS provided six seismometers to the University of Colorado which were deployed starting within 3 days of the mainshock. Telemetry at one site allowed for real time monitoring of the ongoing seismic sequence. Local media interest was extremely high with speculation that the earthquake was linked to the oil and gas industry. The timetable of media demand for information provided some challenges given the time needed for data collection and analysis. We adopted a policy of open data and open communication with all interested parties, and made proactive attempts to provide information to industry and regulators. After 3 weeks of data collection and analysis, the proximity and timing of the mainshock and aftershocks to the C4A injection well, along with a sharp increase in seismicity culminating in an M 2.6 aftershock, led to a decision by the Colorado Oil and Gas Corporation Commission (COGCC) to recommend a temporary halt to injection at the C4A injection well. This was the first time that such action had been taken by the COGCC. This presentation provides an overview of the interactions among academic researchers, industry, media, and regulators during the period of rapid response to this earthquake sequence, and the role of seismology in informing those responses.",

A novel example of a cyberinfrastructure platform for flood preparedness and response is the Iowa Flood Center’s Iowa Flood Information System (IFIS). IFIS is a one-stop web-platform to access community-based flood conditions, forecasts, visualizations, inundation maps and flood-related data, information, and applications. An enormous volume of real-time observational data from a variety of sensors and remote sensing resources (radars, rain gauges, stream sensors, etc.) and complex flood inundation models are staged on a user-friendly maps environment that is accessible to the general public. IFIS has developed into a very successful tool used by agencies, decision-makers, and the general public throughout Iowa to better understand their local watershed and their personal and community flood risk, and to monitor local stream and river levels. IFIS helps communities make better-informed decisions on the occurrence of floods, and alerts communities in advance to help minimize flood damages. IFIS is widely used by general public in Iowa and the Midwest region with over 120,000 unique users, and became main source of information for many newspapers and TV stations in Iowa. IFIS has features for general public to improve emergency preparedness, and for decision makers to support emergency response and recovery efforts. IFIS is also a great platform for educators and local authorities to educate students and public on flooding with games, easy to use interactive environment, and data rich system.",

            "abstract": "Lagunitas Creek drains 282 km2 in coastal Marin County, California. The watershed contains water supply reservoirs, urban areas, parks and habitat for threatened species (e.g. coho salmon). Water quality is impaired by excess fine sediment, and a plan to improve water quality (i.e. TMDL) was adopted by State authorities in 2014. The TMDL asserts changes in sediment delivery, transport, and storage contributed to the decline of coho. A sediment source analysis found a 2x increase in sediment supply. Concentrations of sand and fine gravel in the channel are elevated and, during high flows, more mobile. The Federal Coho Salmon Recovery Plan (2012) describes sediment conditions affecting coho habitat as “fair”. Reservoir managers were directed by the State in 1995 to reduce sedimentation and improve riparian vegetation and woody debris to improve fish habitat. Prior sediment monitoring found variability related primarily to intense winter runoff without identifying clear trends. A new sediment monitoring program was implemented in 2012 for ongoing quantification of sediment conditions.\nThe goal of monitoring is to determine with specified statistical certainty changes in sediment conditions over time and variation among reaches throughout the watershed. Conditions were compared in 3 reaches of Lagunitas Cr. and 2 tributaries. In each of the 5 channel reaches, 4 shorter reaches were sampled in a systematic grid comprised of 30 cross-channel transects spaced at intervals of 1/2 bankfull width and 10 sample points per transect; n=1200 in 5 channel reaches. Sediment diameter class (one clast), sediment facies (a patch descriptor), and habitat type were observed at each point. Fine sediment depth was measured by probing the thickness of the deposit, providing a means to estimate total volume of fine sediment and a measure of rearing habitat occupied by fine sediment (e.g. V*). Sub-surface sediment samples were collected and analyzed for size distribution at two scales: a larger sample of a spawning site in each sample reach and 20 smaller sub-samples of fine sediment facies. These data provide a robust description of streambed sediment conditions (e.g. % < 1 mm) expected to vary systematically across the watershed (e.g. fining downstream) and over time in response to management of watershed resources.",

            "abstract": "In porous materials, the NMR decay rate includes contributions from three different relaxation mechanisms: bulk fluid relaxation, surface relaxation, and decay due to diffusion in the internal magnetic field (DDIF). The contribution to the total decay rate from DDIF will depend on the experimental parameters, the length scale of the pores, and the magnitude of internal field gradients. Commonly, interpretation of NMR data assumes that the contribution of DDIF is negligible. To test this assumption, we used existing theory to model decay due to diffusion over a range of parameter values and to generate synthetic NMR data. We considered the three asymptotic diffusion regimes: free diffusion, motional averaging, and localized dephasing; as well as intermediate behavior where diffusion occurs in multiple regimes. Inversion of the synthetic data was performed, and the impact of DDIF on the 1D relaxation time distribution and 2D relaxation time – diffusion distributions was assessed. This work shows that, under certain conditions, DDIF will significantly impact the calculated distributions of NMR relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. This impact can be reduced by selecting appropriate measurement parameters or by accounting for DDIF in the inversion using an appropriate estimate of the internal gradient magnitude. The example artifacts observed in the results from the synthetic data can be used to recognize artifacts from DDIF in data and aid in interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Multidecadal global climate since 1850 consists of the expected greenhouse warming and two cycles of a fluctuation commonly associated with the AMO that so far has not been satisfactorily explained.\nIn GC53C-06 at AGUFM13 we compared land and sea temperatures during the global warmings of 1860-1880 and 1910-1940 and inferred that heat flowed sea to land, ruling out aerosol-based external forcings and indicating an internal source such as an instability in the AMOC.\nLength of day during the past century has varied by ~4 ms inversely with the AMO. Noting that the ocean floor is some five times thinner than the continental crust, we propose here that Earth’s rotation regulates heat flux through the ocean floor. One mechanism for this is centrifugal force pulling plates apart, particularly along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and around the Ring of Fire, increasing flux by an amount that would easily pass unnoticed in the 1930s. Another mechanism, perhaps less strong, is stress from rotational acceleration increasing the thermal conductivity of the young rocks comprising the ocean floor.\nA difficulty is that the ocean would absorb the fluctuations before reaching the surface. We overcome this difficulty via Ekman transport. This mechanism acts on a 50 m deep layer at the surface to drive it polewards from the ITCZ at 3 cm/sec or 1000 km/yr, orders of magnitude faster than the MOC which therefore cannot interfere. This creates a suction at the ITCZ and a downwards pumping action at 30°. In order to close this cycle there must be a flow equal in volume rate towards the ITCZ at depth. We propose that the heat entering the ocean bottom between 30° S and 30° N enters these two \"Ekman cells\", which carry it to the surface via the ITCZ.\nTo evaluate feasibility, take the area of the participating 50m surface layer to be 1014 m2, making the volume of the top and bottom layers 1016 m3. Only 1022 J of heat is needed to warm or cool this by 1/3.85 = 0.26 °C. Over the 30 years 1910-1940 or 109seconds, this represents 10 TW of warming, raising Earth's total geothermal release from a cold 40 TW to 50 TW (80 to 100 mW/m2), subsequently declining to today's 45-47 TW, an entirely feasible amount. An additional 10 TW to warm the whole OML is still plausible.\nIf this mechanism is correct, varying LOD would forecast varying AMO several years in advance.",

            "abstract": "Intrusive carbonatites often occur in intimate association with SiO2-undersaturated rocks such as melilitites, nephelinites, syenites and phonolites. The occurrence of carbonatites on five of the 10 main islands of the Cape Verde hotspot argues for a CO2-enriched mantle source. Whether alkali-poor carbonatites on the Cape Verdes directly represent small mantle melt fractions or form by extreme fractionation and/or liquid immiscibility from a CO2-rich silicate magma remains a matter of debate. This study focuses on the pyroxenites, nephelinites, ijolites, syenites, phonolites and carbonatites of the intrusive unit of Brava Island. This relative complete series allows for the deduction of a CO2-dependent fractionation pathway from the most primitive basanitic dikes towards phonolitic compositions through an ijolitic series. Major and trace element whole rock and mineral composition trends can be reproduced by fractionating a sequence of olivine, augite, perovskite, biotite, apatite, sodalite and FeTi-oxides, present as phenocrysts in the rocks corresponding to their fractionation interval. To reproduce the observed chemistry of the alkaline silicate rocks a total fractionation of ~87% is required. The melts evolve towards the carbonatite-silicate miscibility gap, an initial CO2 of 0.5 wt% would be sufficient to maintain CO2-saturation in the more evolved compositions. The modelled carbonatite compositions, conjugate to nepheline-syenites to phonolites, correspond well to the observed ones except for an alkali-enrichment with respect to the natural samples. The alkali-depleted nature of the small carbonatite intrusions and dikes on Brava is likely a consequence of fluid-release to the surrounding wall-rocks during crystallization, where fenitization can be observed. The trace element chemistry of primary carbonates and also cpx within both, the carbonatites and the associated silicate rocks, substantiates our fractionation model. Furthermore, carbonatite and silicate domains on a hand-specimen scale may be interpreted to document the beginning of unmixing. Altogether, there is ample evidence that carbonatites on Brava Island represent conjugate liquids, generated during multiple late stage liquid immiscibility events from highly fractionated alkaline SiO2-undersaturated magmas.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic evolution of South America during the Jurassic is related to the subduction of the Farallon plate and the formation of a series of continental arcs. In the northern Andes such arcs have been considered as controlled by extensional dominated tectonics. Paleomagnetic constraints have also suggested that between the Early and Late Jurassic several crustal domains were translate along the continental margin in association with strain partitioning in the convergent margin.\nA review of the character of the Salado terrane in the Cordillera Real of Ecuador indicates that it includes extensively deformed and metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rocks that have achieved a greenschist to amphibolite facies event with chloritoid and garnet. This rocks are tightly associated with a ca. 143 Ma syn-tectonic granodiorite to monzogranite batholith that is also extensively milonitized.\nA similar Late Jurassic crustal thickening event that apparently affected volcano-sedimentary rocks have been also recently suspected in the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes in association with Jurassic plutonic rocks (Blanco-Quintero et al., 2013)\nIt is therefore suggested that during the Late Jurassic the Northern Andes experienced significant contractional tectonics. Such crustal thickening may be related to either the active subduction setting were the crustal slivers formed in relation to oblique convergence are transfered and re-accreted to the margin and triggered the deformational event or to a collisional event associated to the arrival of an allocthonous terrane.\nNew geochronological constraints on the metamorphic evolution and precise understanding on the relations between magmatism and deformation are going to be obtain in the Salado Terrane to appropriately test this hypothesis and contribute to the understanding of the extensional to compressional tectonic switching in continental arcs.\nBlanco-Quintero, I.

            "abstract": "Seismic wavefield simulations can provide accurate solutions to the wave equation, even for three-dimensional seismic velocity models with topography, basin structures, anisotropy, attenuation, and other complexities. But how accurate are these numerical solutions? In many cases the effect of numerical dispersion on the synthetic seismograms looks quite similar to the effects of structural complexities. Therefore it is important to know the numerical resolution of the synthetic seismograms, that is, the minimum period that provides a quantifiably numerically accurate solution to the wave equation. Numerical resolution can be discussed in terms of a combined mesh and velocity model, or in terms of an individual source-station path within the same mesh and velocity model. Here we discuss two approaches for quantifying the numerical resolution. In the first approach we estimate the minimum resolvable period of each element within the finite element mesh. This calculation, performed within SPECFEM3D, requires no wavefield simulations and is based only on the size of each element and the minimum velocity within each element. The calculation produces a volumetric field that shows the estimated minimum resolvable period within each element of the (generally unstructured) mesh. In the second approach we choose a set of earthquakes to be used within a tomographic inversion. For each earthquake we compute one simulation using a fine discretization of gridpoints on the finite-element mesh and another simulation using a coarse discretization. We filter both sets of seismograms over a range of periods and then quantify the waveform differences. The minimum resolvable period (or numerical resolution) is identified by the minimum period for which the synthetic seismogram from the coarse-mesh and fine-mesh simulations is quantifiably the same. This calculation provides a path-specific minimum resolvable period that can be used to guide the choice of measurement filtering for a tomographic inversion. The seismogram-based assessment of numerical resolution requires a significant computational cost, but it provides a comprehensive view of the numerical resolution for the parts of the mesh that are directly relevant for the seismological investigation.",

            "abstract": "The short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) are gases and particles in the air and that its increase may contribute significantly to climate change. Among SLCF are black carbon, tropospheric ozone and methane. These compounds remain in the atmosphere a relatively short time, so they are known as climate forcers short life. Recent scientific evidence shows that the control SLCF through rapid implementation of emission reduction measures would have immediate and multiple benefits for human welfare.\nIn Mexico there is large uncertainty about the amount of emissions that can be generated by SLCF combustion processes. A quarter of the population lives in rural areas and using wood as an energy source. As a result of incomplete combustion of wood particulate emissions (PM2.5, EC and OC) and gases such as CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, VOCs are generated, so it is essential to have better emission factors for calculating these emissions.\nSampling and monitoring of emissions from combustion of wood (white oak) in three different stoves was conducted: Patsari, Onil, Ecoestufa and an three stones. A dilution system was used to sample particles for analysis and diluted to the real time measurement of gases, some properties and flow particle concentrations. Dilute concentrations are measured using a mobile laboratory instrumentation. For each stove a sampling protocol (water boiling test, WBT) consists of three tests that followed: Cold start, hot start, and low heat. The tests are performed consecutively, with the aim of reaching a temperature of 90 ° C of 1 L water contained in a container placed in the pan from the cook stove.\nFrom the analysis of the data recorded emission, time series and emission factors of gases and particles emitted in each wood stove were obtained. Emission factors were obtained per kilogram of dry wood to CO2 (1035.79 g / kg - 1182.65 g / kg), CH4 (1.84 g / kg - 3.37 g / kg) and EC (0.06 g / kg - 0.74 g / kg), and other contaminants. The results obtained are close to other values reported in other studies, and factors can vary by the type of wood used.",

            "abstract": "The structure of a gravel bed has been shown to alter the entrainment threshold. Structures such as clusters, reticulate stone cells and other discrete structures lock grains together, making it more difficult for them to be mobilized. These structures also generate form drag, reducing the shear stress available for mobilization. Form drag over gravel beds is often assumed to be negligible, but this assumption is not well supported. Here, we explore how cluster density and arrangement affect flow resistance and the flow structure over a fixed gravel bed in a flume experiment. Cluster density was varied from 6 to 68.3 clusters per square meter which corresponds to areal bed coverages of 2 to 17%. We used regular, irregular and random arrangements of the clusters. Our results show that flow resistance over a planar gravel bed initially declines, then increases with flow depth. The addition of clusters increases flow resistance, but the effect is dependent on cluster density, flow depth and arrangement. At the highest density, clusters can increase flow resistance as by as much as 8 times when compared to flat planar bed with no grain-related form drag. Spatially resolved observations of flow over the clusters indicate that a well-defined wake forms in the lee of each cluster. At low cluster density, the wakes are isolated and weak. As cluster density increases, the wakes become stronger. At the highest density, the wakes interact and the within cluster flow field detaches from the overlying flow. This generates a distinct shear layer at the height of the clusters. In spite of this change in the flow field at high density, our results suggest that flow resistance simply increases with cluster density. Our results suggest that the form drag associated with a gravel bed can be substantial and that it depends on the arrangement of the grains on the bed.",

            "abstract": "Observations of actual ground ruptures from moderate and large earthquakes show a wide range of behaviors, including fault-to-fault jumps, branching topologies, and rupture traces with multi-kilometer gaps between them. Seismic hazard assessments have responded to these observations by including increasingly sophisticated scenarios of possible ruptures in their earthquake rate forecasts. The largest of these to date has been the Uniform California Earthquake Forecast 3 (UCERF3), which explicitly included ruptures with fault-to-fault jumps in its rupture rate estimates. High-level site-specific seismic source characterizations such as for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant have also begun including complicated rupture geometries. Systematic collection of observations from ground rupturing earthquakes provide one way to evaluate these seismic source models. We have expanded an initial collection by Wesnousky (2008) with events post-dating that collection and events for which new information is available. New events increase the strike-slip and normal event set by 50% and reverse events by 35%. New data allow us to revise previous estimates for strike-slip rupture of the probability that a step of 1 km or more in width will arrest rupture. Observationally, 65% of strike-slip ruptures include at least one step of 1 km or greater. The number of steps through which ruptures are observed to rupture through can be modeled by a geometric distribution in which steps are crossed about 59% of the time. Steps are slightly more effective at arresting rupture in normal and reverse faulting cases, being crossed 56% and 50%, respectively. New events were also systematically examined for gaps in the mapped rupture trace. We find gaps of 1 km or more in about half of the ruptures of the new event set. These empirical data will compliment new research into rupture propagation across gaps, exemplified by the 2010 El Mayor Cucapah earthquake, which included a gap measured variously at 7 or 15 km in length.",

            "abstract": "An increased frequency and intensity of winter and spring storms have recently manifested over a broad area of North America especially along the east and west coast of the U.S., although global mean storm tracks are suggested to shift northward. To understand these changes, we have conducted modeling experiments using NCAR Community Atmosphere Model 3.1_p2 to examine the response of North American storm activity to the elevated tropical Pacific sea surface temperature associated with El Niño. The model experiments were conducted for a period of December to May and configured at a resolution of T85. A storm identification and tracking algorithm was employed to analyze the 6 hourly model output. The results indicate that, when tropical Pacific SST increases, there are more numerous intense storms over southwestern, southeastern, and northwestern North America, but fewer weaker storms over the northeast. Transient eddy analysis of the general circulation demonstrates consistent changes, suggesting systematic changes from large-scale general circulation to synoptic-scale storms. These changes can be attributed to enhanced lower tropospheric baroclinicity, to which the southward shift and an intensification of extratropical jet streams make a major contribution.",

This talk presents results from the second Demonstration Mission that occurred during the intense California drought of spring 2014.\nWith the acquisition of the new cutting edge lidar system, ASO was able to fly higher and as such acquire complete basin coverage for the Tuolumne, Merced, Lakes, and South Fork of Kings River Basins in the California Sierra Nevada. Despite the intensity of the California drought, several snowfalls occurred during the Demonstration Mission and we were able to uniquely map snowfall distribution, providing unprecedented capability to test our understanding of orographics and redistribution of snowfall.\nA new snow density model and analysis were integrated into the ASO data system. Despite a > 4-fold increase in data volume from the new lidar, the landing-to-data delivery remained at < 24 hrs. ASO SWE and albedo data are assimilated into models of varying complexity and results presented here. We use the ASO data in the Sierra Nevada to evaluate SWE simulations from the NWS SNODAS and SWE reconstruction models.

            "abstract": "This research is to simulate the process of channel meandering using a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic model. The multiple interactions between unsteady flow, turbulence, secondary flow, nonequilibrium sediment transport and bank erosion are considered by the model. The governing equations are the 2D depth-averaged Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (2D-RANS) equations and the Exner equation for bed elevation evolution. The Reynolds stresses are calculated by the k-ε turbulence model. The secondary flow, is modeled by the dispersion terms in momentum equations. The spatial lag between the instantaneous flow properties and the rate of sediment transport is simulated by the nonequilibrium sediment transport model. During the process of adaptation, the sediment transport rate gradually develops into the transport capacity of a given flow condition. The evolution of channel bed and bank is modeled by the general Exner equation that accounts for both vertical deformation of bed elevation as well as lateral migration of bank. The system of governing equations is solved by a semi-implicit finite volume method over the Cartesian mesh. The advective fluxes across each cell interface are simultaneously calculated by the extended HLL Riemann solver. At each time step, the diffusion terms in the governing equations are solved by the implicit Euler scheme. The source terms are discretized in a well-balanced way to retain the C-property of the proposed model. Application of the model to different test cases indicates that the model can correctly simulate different phases of meandering channel evolution which include streamwise migration, transverse migration and rotation of channel bends.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges of hydrological modelling in semiarid areas is the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and subsequent associated hydrological processes, coupled with an inherent non-linearity of response between rainfall and runoff. The problem often gets worse due to a lack of instrumentation of good spatial coverage, which increases input errors and uncertainties when spatial rainfall estimates are made from limited observations for use as input to rainfall-runoff models. This particular problem is well documented for many catchments in the world, including the semiarid southern Africa and has largely promoted the use of lumped models over distributed models in data scarce areas which often fail to adequately represent hydrological processes, and, thus, in addressing key water resources management issues at sub basin levels. One of the major issues these models are unable to address, is the effect of upstream land use changes on flow regimes in the downstream watershed. The Gaborone dam catchment located within a 20 km radius from Gaborone city in Botswana has been experiencing challenges of reduced inflows into the dam, despite some recorded heavy storms in the head streams and within the catchment. Recent studies indicate that there are more than 200 farm dams spread across the 400 km2 catchment which may have led to reduced inflows into the dam, representing a main source of water supply to the greater Gaborone area. However, due to insufficient rainfall recording instruments and flow gauging stations in the catchment, no studies had been able to adequately address runoff generation processes and associated inflow dynamics in this important catchment. Through the present study, an experimental hydrological site has been established, consisting of five automated weather stations and two gauging stations to capture spatial rainfall and flow variability within the catchment. This study has taken an integrated approach by considering (i) a multi-site rainfall modeling approach based on generalized linear models, as well as (ii) land use and remote sensing products as input to (iii) a process-based distributed hydrological model known as JAMS/J2000. As shown by improved calibration results, preliminary results are encouraging that dominant processes are better represented.",

            "abstract": "Both coda of earthquakes and microtremors are assumed to be diffuse fields resulting from multiple scattering. From the diffuse field theory, the average of the autocorrelation of displacement components at a given receiver measures the directional energy densities that are proportional to the imaginary parts of the Green’s function for source and receiver at the same point.\nThe directional energies have been recently related to the calculation of microtremor H/V spectral ratio (MHVSR). These ratios are widely used in the assessment of the dominant frequency of soil sites and their measurements are relatively simple as only one station is required. The H/V spectral ratios have also been interpreted as representing either directly the S wave amplification or the Rayleigh wave ellipticity.\nMoreover, the H/V ratios can be also used for a finer characterization of the site assuming horizontally layered media without lateral heterogeneities. In that case and for an appropriate noise normalization the experimental spectral ratios H2/V2 should correspond to their theoretical counterpart: the ratio 2 ImG11 / ImG33, where ImG11 and ImG33 are the imaginary parts of Green functions at the load point for horizontal and vertical components, respectively and for horizontally layered media. In order to guarantee a viable inversion, the imaginary part of the theoretical Green’s functions must be efficiently computed using both an integral in the complex k plane (in terms of homogeneous plane waves) and the pole contributions due to Rayleigh and Love normal modes, which result from the (application of the) Cauchy residue theorem.\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

            "abstract": "Establishing a credible record of the carbon isotopic composition of high latitude surface ocean DIC over ice ages has been an enormous challenge, because the possible archives of this important variable in deep sea sediments all incorporate complex effects of the biomineralization process. For example, culture experiments (by Spero and colleagues) demonstrate a strong temperature and carbonate ion effect on the carbon isotopic composition of G. bulloides--the taxon of planktonic foraminifera that is most abundant in the majority of subpolar sediment sequences. Here we capitalize on the fortuitous observation of exceptionally strong covariation between the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of G. bulloides in multiple sediment sequences from the Benguela upwelling region. The covariation is most clear during Marine Isotopic Stage 3 (an interval when the isotopic composition of the seawater was least variable) and undoubtedly results from the precipitation of tests under variable conditions of temperature and carbonate ion. The unusually clear isotopic relationship in planktonic foraminifera observed off Namibia constitutes a field calibration of the biomineralization effects observed in culture, and we apply it to previously published high latitude carbon isotopic records throughout the Southern Ocean. We find that many of the excursions toward lower planktonic foraminiferal δ13C that have been interpreted previously as the upwelling of nutrient rich water during deglaciations are better explained as increases in upper ocean temperature and carbonate ion. Conversely, the excursions toward high δ13C during ice age intervals that have been interpreted previously as increased export production (purportedly stimulated by dust) are also better explained by temperature and carbonate ion variability. After removal of the inferred temperature and carbonate ion signal from the planktonic foraminiferal time series, the residual is essentially (but not exactly) the same as the deep ocean carbon isotopic variability recorded in co-occurring benthic foraminifera. These reinterpretations bear not only on the assumed venting of carbon through the high latitude surface ocean, but also on the \"preformed\" carbon isotopic variability throughout the interior of the Pleistocene oceans.",

            "abstract": "The stable water isotopic composition changes due to fractionation during phase changes. This information is useful for understanding the water cycle, such as the water vapor source, transport and cloud microphysical processes. In conventional atmospheric models, the isotope exchange between liquid and gas phase is usually assumed to be in an equilibrium state, which is not sufficient to describe the highly kinetic phase transformation processes in clouds. In this study, a two-moment microphysical scheme incorporated into the NCAR Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is modified to simulate the isotope fractionations. Experimentally determined stable water isotope thermal equilibrium data are converted into isotope saturation vapor pressure, which is then put into the two-stream Maxwellian kinetic equation to calculate the fractionation during vapor condensation/evaporation or deposition/sublimation. Isotope mass transfer between liquid- and ice-phase hydrometeors during freezing/melting are also considered explicitly. The simulation results were compared with rainwater isotope measurements and showed fairly good agreement. Sensitivity tests were also conducted to quantify the contribution of rainwater isotopic due to water vapor source and transport, condensation environment conditions, and cloud microphysical processes. The results show that isotopic water vapor source dominates the stable isotope concentration in rainwater but the cloud microphysical processes including the ice-phase processes are also quite important. The results also showed that the two-stream Maxwellian kinetic method would cause significantly more deuterium to be transported into higher altitudes during convection than the thermal equilibrium method.",

            "abstract": "Geological CO2 sequestration is one of the most important technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere by isolating great volumes of CO2 in deep geological formations. This novel storage option for CO2 involves injecting supercritical CO2 into porous formations saturated with pore fluid such as brine and initiate CO2 flooding with immiscible displacement. Despite of significant effects on macroscopic migration and distribution of injected CO2, however, only a limited information is available on wettability in microscopic scCO2-brine-mineral systems. In this study, a micromodel had been developed to improve our understanding of how CO2 flooding and residual characteristics of pore water are affected by the wettability in scCO2-water-glass bead systems. The micromodel (a transparent pore structure made of 0.5 mm diameter glass beads between two glass plates) in a high-pressure cell provided the opportunity to visualize spread of supercritical CO2 and displacement of pore water in high pressure and high temperature conditions. CO2 flooding followed by fingering migration and dewatering followed by formation of residual water were observed through a imaging system with a microscope. Measurement of contact angles of droplets of residual water on and between glass beads in a micromodel were conducted to estimate differential pressure between wetting and nonwetting fluids in a scCO2-water-glass bead system. The experimental observation results could provide important fundamental informations on capillary characteristics of reservoirs and caprocks for geological CO2 sequestration.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we determined seismic source parameters from 557 events with ML≥1.6 that occurred in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula from 2001 to 2013. A total of 7,267 S-wave trains on three-component seismograms recorded at broadband seismic stations were used for measuring the corner frequency, Brune stress drop and moment magnitude by using the iterative method of Jo and Baag (2001) based on the methods of Snoke (1987) and Andrews (1986). The SNR were calculated for each seismogram to exclude the possible contamination of the records by noise and/or instrumental malfunctioning. For the stable correction of attenuation, we tested several Q factors from the previous studies on those for the Korean Peninsula and found Kim (2007) gave the best result. In this study, as shown by Shi et al. (1998), the stress drop tended to decrease with decreasing seismic moment from the magnitude 3.5. Although there was large scatter in stress drop, however, the stress drops seemed to be constant for the larger events and the average stress drop was estimated to around 45.5 bar. It is interesting that there was a variation in stress drops depending on earthquake location: stress drops of the earthquakes occurred in the East Sea (Japan Sea) and the southwestern part of North Korea were relatively lower than those for the events occurred at other region in the southern Korean Peninsula.",

If there are surface sources of water, then localized plumes of atmospheric water may be observable from orbit. The Viking MAWD column water vapor data are uniquely valuable for this purpose because they cover the full range of Martian local times, and include data sampled at high spatial resolution [2]. They also are accompanied by simultaneously acquired surface and atmospheric temperatures acquired by the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) instruments. We searched the raster-averaged Viking Orbiter 1 and 2 MAWD column water vapor dataset for regions of localized elevated column water vapor abundances and found mid-latitude regions with transient water observations [3]. The raster averaged Viking Orbiter 1 and 2 MAWD column water vapor data available in the Planetary Data System (PDS), were calculated from radiance measurements using seasonally and topographically varying surface pressures which, at the time, had high uncertainties [4]. Due to recent interest in transient hydrological activity on Mars [2], we decoded the non-raster averaged Viking MAWD dataset, which are sampled at 15 times higher spatial resolution than the data that are currently available from PDS. This new dataset is being used to recalculate column water vapor abundances using current topographical data, as well as dust and pressure measurements from the Mars Global Circulation Model.\n",

            "abstract": "At Utah State University (USU), in the Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences (CASS), we are developing a lidar capable of making observations that would span the middle atmosphere from the lower stratosphere well into the lower thermosphere, 15 – 120 km. This would provide a new capability for observing this extended region with just one ground-based instrument. To do this, we are building upon extensive experience at CASS’s Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO) with Rayleigh-scatter lidar. This new system uses two Nd:YAG lasers, operating at 532 nm and 30 Hz, with a combined power of 42 W, and four co-aligned, 1.25 m diameter, parabolic mirrors with a combined collecting area of almost 5 m2. The resultant figure of merit, the power-aperture product (PAP), is 205 Wm2, 65 times that of the original lidar. This increase is significant for both Rayleigh scatter at the highest altitudes and Raman scatter at the lowest altitudes. The light from the fibers from the four mirrors are combined and, at the moment, directed to the high-altitude Rayleigh detector channel. Observations have been obtained with this channel in the vicinity of summer solstice. The profiles, extending from 70 km to almost 120 km, show considerable structure, which changes from night to night and differs from the NRL-MSISe00 reference atmosphere. Improvements are under way to extend the maximum altitude. The next steps are to add a medium-altitude, Rayleigh detector channel and then a low-altitude, Rayleigh and Mie detector channel. They will be followed by a low-altitude, 607 nm, Raman detector channel. With what we learn from this extensive effort, we are planning a simpler system with more advanced technology that would be easier (and less expensive) to build and operate. The idea being that it could be fielded in many places in the world to contribute to an extensive ground-based network to observe the middle atmosphere. Much of this region represents a significant and challenging observational gap between aircraft and balloon-borne radiometers at the lower altitudes and combinations of ionosondes, meteor wind radars, resonance lidars, airglow imagers, Fabry-Perots, and incoherent-scatter radars at the higher altitudes.",

Nevertheless, increased cropping intensity has associated local, regional, and global environmental outcomes such as degradation of water quality and soil fertility. Quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of cropping intensity can serve as a first step towards understanding these environmental problems and developing effective and sustainable cropping strategies. In this study, an adaptive threshold method was developed to measure the cropping intensity in the Phoenix AMA from 1995 to 2010 at five-year intervals. The method has several advantages in terms of (1) minimization of errors arising from missing data and noise; (2) ability to distinguish growing cycles from multiple small false peaks in a vegetation index time series; (3) flexibility when dealing with temporal profiles with diffing numbers of observations. The adaptive threshold approach measures the cropping intensity effectively with overall accuracies higher than 97%. Results indicate a dramatic decline in the area of total croplands, single crops, and double crops. A small land conversion was witnessed from single crops into double crops from 1995 to 2000, whereas a reverse trend was observed from 2005 to 2010. Changes in cropping intensity can affect local water consumption. Therefore, joint investigation of cropping patterns and agricultural water use can provide implications for future water demand, which is an increasingly critical issue in this rapidly expanding desert city.",

            "abstract": "The primary goal of this study is to estimate well constrained crust and upper mantle seismic velocity structure in the Kachchh region of Gujarat, India - an area of active interest for earthquake monitoring purposes. Several models based on ‘stand-alone’ surface wave dispersion and receiver function modeling exist in this area. Here we jointly model the receiver function, surface wave dispersion and, S and shear-coupled PL wavetrains using broadband seismograms of deep (150–700 km), moderate to-large magnitude (5.5–6.8) earthquakes recorded teleseismically at semi-permanent seismograph stations in the Kachchh region, Gujarat, India. While surface wave dispersion and receiver function modeling is computationally fast, full waveform modeling makes use of reflectivity synthetic seismograms. An objective function that measures misfit between all three data is minimized using a very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) approach. Surface wave and receiver function data help reduce the model search space which is explored extensively for detailed waveform fitting. Our estimated crustal and lithospheric thicknesses in this region vary from 32 to 41 km and 70 to 80 km, respectively, while crustal P and S velocities from surface to Moho discontinuity vary from 4.7 to 7.0 km/s and 2.7 to 4.1 km/s, respectively. Our modeling clearly reveals a zone of crustal as well as an asthenospheric upwarping underlying the Kachchh rift zone relative to the surrounding unrifted area. We believe that this feature plays a key role in the seismogenesis of lower crustal earthquakes occurring in the region through the emanation of volatile CO2 into the hypocentral zones liberating from the crystallization of carbonatite melts in the asthenosphere. Such a crust-mantle structure might be related to the plume–lithosphere interaction during the Deccan/Reunion plume episode (~65 Ma).",

On board is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument suite. ROSINA consists of two mass spectrometers, the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) and the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF), as well as the COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS).\nThe first signal with ROSINA/RTOF of the gaseous environment of the comet was a significant increase in water density observed on DOY 218.1 of 2014 (at 3.5 AU) by RTOF above the gaseous envelope of the Rosetta spacecraft. A similar density increase is observed by COPS at the same time. A preliminary analysis shows that the water density is nH2O ≈ 1012 m–3 at 100 km distance from the comet (located at 3.5 AU from the Sun). This gives a density at the surface of nH2O ≈ 6.4·1015 m–3 and a vertical column density of water of NCH2O ≈ 6.5·1018 m–2. Assuming an active area of 4% we arrive at a production rate of QH2O ≈ 5.8·1024 mole s–1. These values are preliminary and will be refined by forthcoming observations. Other than water, no signal related to cometary activity could be observed above the molecular background from the spacecraft at present, e.g. cometary CO and CO2 are not observed in the RTOF data so far. This hints at a possible deficiency of carbon bearing compounds in the comet.",

            "abstract": "The newly commissioned Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has revealed the presence of a numerous weak and short lived low frequency radio solar bursts. These emission features have duration of order a second, have relatively narrow spectral widths and are surprisingly numerous even during quiet solar conditions. Their appearance in the time-frequency plane is unlike that of the any of the known classes of radio bursts, and they at least an order of magnitude weaker than the weakest type III bursts routinely monitored and reported (e.g. by Automated Radio Burst Identification System operational at the Learmonth Radioheliograph in Australia). For the few bursts which have been studied in detail, we have not found a counterpart at X-Ray or EUV bands. There is an exciting possibility that these bursts are associated with the widely hypothesized \"nanoflares\" thought to play a role in coronal heating through magnetic reconnection on small scales in coronal loops. A systematic and detailed characterization of the statistical properties of these bursts over large temporal and spectral spans is necessary for investigating the role these bursts might play in coronal heating. To enable this, we have developed a novel system using region-growing, wavelet decompositions, and thresholding techniques for event recognition and parameter extraction in an automated manner for the voluminous MWA interferometric data. We will present and describe the statistical properties of these weak radio bursts based on a large number of events detected and parameterized by these automated methods.",

            "abstract": "Variations in radiogenic isotope ratios and magmatic volatile abundances (e.g., CO2 or H2O) in Hawaiian lavas reveal key processes within a deep-seated mantle plume (e.g., mantle heterogeneity, source lithology, partial melting, and magma degassing). Shield-stage Hawaiian lavas likely originate from a mixed plume source containing peridotite and recycled oceanic crust (pyroxenite) based on variations of radiogenic isotopes (e.g., 206Pb/204Pb). The mantle source region may also be heterogeneous with respect to volatile contents, yet the link between pre-eruptive volatile budgets and mantle source lithology in the Hawaiian plume is poorly constrained due to shallow magmatic degassing and mixing. Here, we use a novel approach to investigate this link using Os isotopic ratios, and major, trace, and volatile elements in olivines and mineral-hosted melt inclusions (MIs) from 34 samples from Koolau, Mauna Loa, Hualalai, Kilauea, and Loihi. These samples reveal a strong correlation between volatile contents in olivine-hosted MIs and Os isotopes of the same olivines, in which lavas that originated from greater proportions of recycled oceanic crust/pyroxenite (i.e. ‘Loa’ chain volcanoes: Koolau, Mauna Loa, Loihi) have MIs with the lower H2O, F, and Cl contents than ‘Kea’ chain volcanoes (i.e. Kilauea) that contain greater amounts of peridotite in the source region. No correlation is observed with CO2 or S. The depletion of fluid-mobile elements (H2O, F, and Cl) in ‘Loa’ chain volcanoes indicates ancient dehydrated oceanic crust is a plume component that controls much of the compositional variation of Hawaiian Volcanoes. The presence of dehydrated recycled mafic material in the plume source suggests that subduction effectively devolatilizes the mafic part of the oceanic crust. These results are similar to the observed shifts in H2O/Ce ratios near the Easter and Samoan hotspots [1,2]. Thus, it appears that multiple hotspots may record relative H2O depletions and possibly other volatiles. [1] Dixon et al. 2002, Nature 420:385-89 [2] Workman et al. 2006, EPSL 241:932-51",

These alluvial aquifers host important “hot spots” and “hot moments” for microbiological activity controlling organic carbon processing and fluxes in the subsurface that are both significant on their own, but also influence contaminant behavior. Mineral phases likely active in the sequestration of metal contaminants are chlorite, smectite-vermiculite, illite, and smectite. These minerals are also important biogeofacies markers. The Colorado alluvial sediments include lenses of silt and clay that are commonly more reduced than coarser grained materials. The clay minerals that make up the alluvial aquifer sediments include these mineral phases important for metal sequestration (chlorite, smectite, illite), as well as kaolinite and quartz. More specifically, the clay mineralogy of soils derived from these sediments at Rifle are composed of the same suite of minerals found in the alluvial sediments plus a vermiculite-smectite intergrade. The vermiculite-smectite intergrade is a weathering product of illite. The presence of illite and chlorite in both the sediments and the soils at Rifle reflect a mineralogically immature character of the source rocks. These assemblages are consistent with sediments and soils that formed in a moderately low rainfall climate, indicative of mixed provence of immature (chlorite, smectite, illite) and mature (kaolinite) minerals relative to their source areas.",

            "abstract": "The response of water level to Earth tides provides a unique probe to determine the in-situ aquifer transmissivity. The water level in an open well tapping an aquifer responds to the Earth tidal forcing with a phase lag. The phase lag between the water level oscillation and imposed tidal forcing is due to the finite time is needed for pore pressure to readjust and drive water to flow into and out of the well. The phase lag is a direct observation, and it is a key parameter to determine the transmissivity of the aquifer. Usually, people convert the phase lag information to an effective transmissivity using Hsieh et at. analytical solution (1987) by assuming the aquifer is confined, isotropic, homogeneous, infinite in lateral extent and of uniform thickness. However, the estimated transmissivity heavily relies on the assumption of an isotropic aquifer which is not true in reality. Anisotropic transmissivity would bias the interpretation of the phase lag information. Our study explores the phase response of water level to the semidiurnal Earth tide for different ratio of transmissivity in x and y directions by using the finite element method software Comsol. We find the estimated effective transmissivity is the lower bound of the transmissivity in fast direction for the same phase lag. We also find that the numerically determined phase lag can be predicted as a function of an effect transmissivity, and the effect transmissivity T can be expressed as T=(Ty*Tx1.4)0.4, where Ty is the transmissivity is slow direction, and Tx is the transmissivity in fast direction. Effective transmissivity is a combination weight between transmissivity in low and fast directions, and the transmissivity in fast direction would be the dominate parameter controlling the phase response. This empirical function may provide a way to estimate the range of transmissivity and anisotropic effects for the observed phase lag.",

            "abstract": "Climate forcing factors have been documented to directly (e.g. CO2 fertilization) or indirectly (e.g. temperature and vapor pressure deficit) affect net primary productivity (NPP) of forests. Climate variations can also affect the vulnerability of forests to pests and pathogens, causing diffuse or widespread mortality. The introduction of novel pests is causing rapid mortality of targeted species with undetermined effects on forest productivity: NPP could decrease or increase depending on the severity (proportion of basal area impacted) and species diversity. We attempted to document the impact of diffuse mortality caused by insect outbreaks on North American temperate forests through synthesis of literature. Despite the large number of studies (>500) only a few (12) documented NPP in a systematic manner. The magnitude of insect and pathogen disturbance was larger in western than eastern forests due to the redundancy and functional diversity of temperate deciduous and mixed deciduous forests. Recovery from disturbance was more rapid from diffuse short duration defoliation events relative to the long lasting impacts of wood boring insects. Forest resilience may decrease as insect disturbance increases, particularly with generalist invasive pests that target a variety of species. We conclude that these biotic interactions, particularly when caused by invasive pests, impose biological forcing to forest NPP at similar magnitude and time scales than climate forcing.",

Regional climate change in the past half-century is some of the most dramatic in the world -- +2 degrees average warming in many districts and -300mm rainfall. Crop yields have improved weakly or remained stagnant, in stark contrast with the rest of Brazil. As a result many smallholder farmers have increasingly turned to milk production, but they remain dependent on rainfall for forage growth. During droughts they thus face a choice between overgrazing and letting their cattle die. As a result, deforestation of the native Caatinga biome has been rampant, with estimates of 85% loss. We present the results of controlled tests, conducted with over one hundred farmers, of several on-farm interventions meant to boost on-farm productivity, reduce vulnerability to rainfall shocks, and lessen the incentives for deforestation. These interventions -- water cisterns, smallholder irrigation systems, balancing of animal feed ratios, and cultivation and use of palma forrageira as cattle feed -- are described and presented with results of their impact on productivity and vulnerability/resilience metrics. Estimates of larger-scale social benefits and future land-use change impacts are also discussed.",

Radar images have revealed a surface that is much younger than those of the Moon, Mercury and Mars as well as a variety of enigmatic volcanic and tectonic features quite unlike those generated by plate tectonics on Earth. To understand how Venus works as a planet it is necessary to probe the interior of Venus. To accomplish this seismology must play a key role. Conventional seismology employs sensors in contact with the planetary surface but for Venus theses sensors must tolerate the Venus environment (460oC and 90 bars) for up to a year.\nThe dense atmosphere of Venus, which efficiently couples seismic energy into the atmosphere as infrasonic waves, enables an alternative: detection of infrasonic waves in the upper atmosphere using either high altitude balloons or orbiting spacecraft. In June 2014, the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) at the California Institute of Technology sponsored a one week workshop with 30 specialists in the key techniques and technologies that can bring these technique to readiness.

Energy and momentum transfer in collisions between the atmospheric gas and fast atoms and molecules have been considered using our recently obtained angular and energy dependent cross sections[1]. We have showed that accurate angular dependent collision cross sections are critical for the description of the energy relaxation of precipitating keV energetic ions/ENAs and for computations of altitude profiles of the fast atom and molecule production rates in recoil collisions. Upward and escape fluxes of the secondary energetic He and O atoms and H2, N2, CO and CO2 molecules, induced by precipitating ENAs, have been determined and their non-thermal energy distribution functions have been computed at different altitudes for different solar conditions. Precipitation and energy deposition of the energetic H2O molecules and products of their dissociations into the Mars atmosphere in the Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) - Mars interaction have been modeled using accurate cross sections. Reflection of precipitating ENAs by the Mars atmosphere has been analyzed in detail.\n[1] N. Lewkow and V.

            "abstract": "Marine shale successions are probably the best archives of earth history. The degree of completeness of a marine shale succession is a critical factor in the interpretation of the geologic record of climatic, oceanic, and biogeochemical processes, in the prediction of timescales of those processes, in the determination of the duration of events, and in the establishment of correlations between successions. The sedimentation rates of marine shale successions are often calculated by dividing the thickness of a succession by the duration of the stratigraphic interval it occupies. Sedimentation rates calculated this way are always much lower than rates measured directly in equivalent modern environments. When we apply modern rates to the deposits left behind by their ancient equivalents, and correct for compaction due to overburden and time, we find that the entire succession can be deposited in a relatively short time. Since we know that the stratigraphic interval occupied by such ancient deposits is much longer, we must conclude that the succession is very incomplete. In this presentation, I will use a few different methods to show that 65 to >80% of the duration of the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in Yorkshire, U.K., is represented by gaps rather than shale. This means that the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is not as short as proposed by authors who studied the cyclostratigraphy of the Yorkshire succession, and that it probably represents a much longer-term history of environmental change driven by processes acting on longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Compressional deformation has been reported on many passive margins, mostly attributed to thin-skinned tectonics in response to gravity gliding or spreading from viscous layers (overpressured shales, salt décollement). However some of the reported structures are obviously related to regional stress and also affect the basement, not only the upper sedimentary cover. Such deformation has been documented and discussed in the last decade mainly from the northern Atlantic margins (Doré et al., 2008 ; Pereira et al., 2011, & ref. herein). The compressional structures on passive margins have been notably considered as linked to tectonomagmatic and active asthenospheric upwelling, post-breakup compression and compactional stresses.\nThe western margin of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean) is a passive margin formed during the late Miocene opening of a back-arc basin in relation with the roll-back and retreat of the Ionian subducting lithosphere (African Plate). From our new data, we can show evidence for compressional features that developed in the Pliocene, shortly after the main rifting period on the western Tyrrhenian Sea (Middle to Late Miocene) and beginning of oceanic spreading (Earliest Pliocene). We could describe such structures across the inner margin onshore, from field analysis, as well as offshore, from newly acquired seismic data (METYSS 1 & 3; Gaullier et al. 2014).\nThe characters and distribution of such compressional deformation, occurring very shortly after the onset of oceanic spreading in the deep basin (earliest Pliocene), allow us to discuss the possible interactions between breakup processes and inversion episodes on passive margins.\nDoré A.G., Lundin E.R., Kusznir N.J., & Pascal C., 2008.

            "abstract": "Global climate during Quaternary and Late Pliocene (present–3.1 Ma) is characterized by alternating glacial and interglacial conditions. Several proposed theories associate these cycles with variations in the Earth’s orbital configuration. There is geological evidence of obliquity forcing of the glacial-interglacial cycles during the Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene (41 kyr world), which stands in sharp contrast to the primary cyclicity of insolation at precessional periods (23 kyr). Here we compare proposed theories of two separate studies that attempt to explain this anomaly (Huybers 2006 & Raymo et al. 2006). Huybers proposed that glacial cycles are driven by the total integrated summer insolation, which varies at the obliquity period and is thus consistent with the glacial records. Raymo proposed that glacial cycles are driven by summer insolation at precessional periods, but hemispheric responses are out-of-phase, thus global proxies do not record the precession signal.\nUsing a metric for the total integrated insolation, we study how obliquity and precession affects Northern and Southern hemisphere glaciation-deglaciation. We carried out a series of GCM simulations using a range of obliquity and precessional forcings. By repeating the experiment at different eccentricities, the obliquity and precessional response of both hemispheres was studied. Model results show obliquity response between hemispheres is in-phase at all eccentricities and precessional response is out-of-phase at high eccentricities. At low eccentricities (<0.015), the precessional response on the summer metric is negligible. We suggest that at eccentricities less that 0.015, glaciation-deglaciation processes occur concurrently in both hemispheres and are primarily forced by obliquity. This has important implications for the forcing of super interglacials (MIS 9, 11, 31 etc.). Indeed, it has been observed statistically that most super interglacials are forced by extreme low eccentricities, albeit with a lag of ~53ka. We explore how these low eccentricity conditions may have preconditioned the polar regions to produce a large response during some interglacials.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater from glacier is one of the main water resources in the capital area of Bolivia. However, Andean tropical glaciers are rapidly shrinking during past some decades. We projected the response of glacier melt water, runoff and water temperature in reservoir to climate change. Objective area is Tuni reservoir catchment (90km2) with Condoriri, Tuni and HuaynaPotosi West glacier. This reservoir supplies approximately 30% of water consumption to urban area.\nA glacier mass balance model was applied to Condoriri, Tuni and Huayna Potosi West glacier. Simulation period is 30 years from July, 2011. We produced four types of meteorological dataset for model input with observation data and output of general circulation model: one dataset assumes that current climate persists during 30 years and the others assume that temperature increase at the ratio of 0.02 to 0.04oC/year. Furthermore, distributed runoff model and water quality model were also applied to understand the role of glacier meltwater in the Tuni reservoir catchment.\nProjection shows that three glaciers decrease and reach equilibrium states of mass balance by the next three decades under current climate condition. Glacial area and meltwater are projected to be 40 to 60% and 60 to 80% of present by the end of 2030’s. HuaynaPotosi West glacier has higher uncertainty about the response of temperature rise than Tuni and Condoriri glacier. This is because the peak in altitudinal distribution of glacial area is higher than equilibrium line altitude for current climate condition.\n Projection of river discharge shows that meltwater from glacier dominates river discharge in early wet season, but meltwater from snow and rainfall dominates in mid wet season. Annual total inflow to reservoir decreases to about 40% of present condition without meltwater from glacier. Water temperature in reservoir is projected to be about 2oC higher than present.",

            "abstract": "Drilling into active faults is an effective way to get data and materials at depth that help to understand the material properties, physical mechanisms and healing processes of the faults. The Wenchuan earthquake fault scientific drilling project (WFSD) was conducted immediately after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9). The first borehole of the project (WFSD-1) penetrates the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault with a final depth of 1201.15 m and meet the principal slip zone (PSZ) of Wenchuan earthquake at depth of 589.2 m. About 183.3 m-thick fault rocks are recognized in the WFSD-1 drilling core from 575.7 to 759 m-depth, which was confirmed as the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault zone with a real thickness of about 100 m due to the borehole inclination of 11°.\nIn this research we got samples from WFSD-1 drilling core at the depth of 732.4-732.8 m, in which black gouge, gray gouge, fine-grained fault breccia and coarse-grained fault breccia layers can be distinguished clearly. Slickensides were developed in the surface of the black gouge layer. The protolith of this segment is sandstone. Based on detailed microstructural analysis using electron optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). An about 1 mm-thick amorphous material layer containing small quartz grains was observed. Circles with different densities were observed in the amorphous material indicate a melt-origin. Cracks are developed in the amorphous material, which are suggested to be caused by general volume reduction as a result of rapid cooling contraction. TEM-EDX analysis of the amorphous material indicates mainly feldspar composition, implying the melting temperature was >1230℃, while quartz grains did not melt indicating a temperature <1700℃. Nano-scale quartz grains were observed in a very small layer showing a different structure at the edge of the amorphous layer, indicating that nano quartz grains were formed by the comminution during earthquake, which is very important in earthquake energy budgets calculation.\nThese microstructural analysis results reveal that the amorphous layer may formed by rapid cooling of the frictional melt material caused by high-velocity slip during a large earthquake, and fluid flow may played an important role in the rapid cooling process.",

            "abstract": "Drought information systems consist of two key elements: nowcasts; essentially maps that identify the locations of areas currently in drought and the severity thereof as related to an historical record; and drought forecasts, which predict the best understanding of the evolution of drought, along with the uncertainty of those predictions. Because drought nowcasts are only meaningful if current conditions are related to an historical period, stable quality controlled historical space-time records of key drought variables are essential. Generally, these include surface meteorological conditions, such as surface air temperature and precipitation, and other land surface variables, such as downward shortwave and longwave radiation, which typically are derived from more commonly measured variables, such as the daily temperature and temperature range. I discuss our experience in constructing such records, both across the continental U.S. where we have the luxury of relatively lengthy and high quality meteorological and climate records, and globally, where attaining statistical stability of constructed historical records is more challenging. In the case of agricultural (soil moisture) and hydrological (runoff) droughts, the key drought variables usually must be derived from land surface models (LSMs) forced by precipitation, surface air temperature, humidity, surface wind, and downward shortwave and longwave radiation. Clearly, the statistical stability of derived soil moisture and runoff depend on stability of the LSM forcings, and I discuss some experiences and issues in our development of a prototype global drought information system GDIS. With respect to drought forecasts, skill derives either from a) persistence in the land surface initial states, primarily soil moisture and snow; and b) skill in prediction of the LSM forcings (most importantly, precipitation). I review recent work that shows the relative influence of these two sources of drought forecast skill, as well as evidence of practical skill or lack thereof in seasonal precipitation forecasts, and their implications for drought forecast skill.",

The ice target consists of a LN2 cryogenic system connected to both a water-ice deposition system as well as a movable freezer/holder for a pre-mixed liquid cartridge. Planned experiments include the bombardment of a variety of frozen targets and simulated ice/regolith mixtures, and the assessment of all impact products (solid ejecta, gas, plasma) as well as spectroscopy of both the impact-produced light flashes and the reflected spectra (UV, visible, IR). Such measurements are highly relevant to both physical and chemical surface modification of airless bodies due to micrometeoroid impacts. The gas target consists of a differentially pumped chamber kept at moderate background pressures, such that high-velocity (~10 km/s) micrometeoroids are completely ablated within 10's of cm (i.e. within the measurement chamber). The chamber is configured with segmented electrodes to perform a spatially-resolved measurement of charge production during ablation, and localized light-collection optics enable an assessment of the light production (luminous efficiency). Such studies are critical to the understanding of past and future ground-based measurements of meteor ablation in Earth's atmosphere, which in turn can potentially provide the best estimates of the interplanetary dust particle flux.",

The United States in particular has expanded its natural gas industry, becoming one of the world's top gas producing countries. The Barnett Shale of northern Texas is one of the most developed and productive natural gas shale plays in the United States. However, emissions from the many oil and gas system components in the region have not been fully characterized. An extensive list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was measured from 120 whole air canisters collected throughout the Barnett shale in October 2013. Known methane sources were targeted and included oil and natural gas well pads, compressor stations, distribution pipelines and city gates, cattle feedlots and landfills. C1-C5 alkanes were elevated throughout the region and were similar to or greater than concentrations in major U.S. cities. The VOC source signature for oil and gas operations was distinguished from biogenic sources. Average ethane content relative to methane was calculated for each of the source types, and ranged from 0.7 to 12.8%. For the whole region, the ethane content was 7.2±6.1%, illustrating the high variability and effect of the various hydrocarbon sources on the local air.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation data in semi-arid and mountainous regions is often spatially and temporally sparse, yet it is a key variable needed to drive hydrological models. Gridded precipitation datasets provide a spatially and temporally coherent alternative to the use of point-based station data, but in the case of Mongolia, may not be constructed from all data available from government data sources, or may only be available at coarse resolutions. To examine the uncertainty associated with the use of gridded and/or point precipitation data, monthly water balance models of three river basins across forest steppe (the Khoid Tamir River at Ikhtamir), steppe (the Baidrag River at Bayanburd), and desert steppe (the Tuin River at Bogd) ecozones in the Khangai Mountain Region of Mongolia were compared. The models were forced over a 10-year period from 2001-2010, with gridded temperature and precipitation data at a 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution. These results were compared to modeling using an interpolated hybrid of the gridded data and additional point data recently gathered from government sources; and with point data from the nearest meteorological station to the streamflow gage of choice. Goodness-of-fit measures including the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency statistic, the percent bias, and the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio were used to assess model performance. The results were mixed with smaller differences between the two gridded products as compared to the differences between gridded products and station data. The largest differences in precipitation inputs and modeled runoff amounts occurred between the two gridded datasets and station data in the desert steppe (Tuin), and the smallest differences occurred in the forest steppe (Khoid Tamir) and steppe (Baidrag). Mean differences between water balance model results are generally smaller than mean differences in the initial input data over the period of record. Seasonally, larger differences in gridded versus station-based precipitation products and modeled outputs occur in summer in the desert-steppe, and in spring in the forest steppe. Choice of precipitation data source in terms of gridded or point-based data directly affects model outcomes with greater uncertainty noted on a seasonal basis across ecozones of the Khangai.",

            "abstract": "Seismic waves have been observed to increase the permeability in fractured aquifers. A detailed, predictive understanding of the process has been hampered by a lack of constraint on the primary physical controls. What aspect of the oscillatory forcing is most important in determining the magnitude of the permeability enhancement? Here we present laboratory results showing that flow rate is the primary control on permeability increases in the laboratory. We fractured Berea sandstone samples under triaxial stresses of tens of megapascals, and applied dynamic fluid-stresses via pore pressure oscillations. In each experiment, we varied either the amplitude or the frequency of the pressure changes. Amplitude and frequency each separately correlated with the resultant permeability increase. More importantly, the permeability changes correlate with the flow rate in each configuration, regardless of whether flow rate variations were driven by varying amplitude or frequency. We also track the permeability evolution during a single set of oscillations by measuring the phase lags (time delays) of successive oscillations. Interpreting the responses with a poroelastic model shows that 80% of the permeability enhancement is reached during the first oscillation and the final permeability enhancement scales exponentially with the imposed change in flow rate integrated over the rock volume. The establishment of flow rate as the primary control on permeability enhancement from seismic waves opens the door to quantitative studies of earthquake-hydrogeological coupling. The result also suggests that reservoir permeability could be engineered by imposing dynamic stresses and changes in flow rate.",

            "abstract": "Inconsistent usage of open boundary condition (OBC) in the limited-area ocean modeling studies, in which the circulation is concurrently forced by both tidal and sub-tidal flows in the open boundary, has been frequently witnessed. Orlanski-type radiation OBCs have been proved to be reasonably efficient in handling the sub-tidally forced flow, while Flather-type OBC has been commonly adapted for the tidally forced flow. However, neither of them performed well when the flows were forced simultaneously by both tidal and sub-tidal flow in the boundary. In this study, we developed a novel OBC that accommodates consistently for the respective tidal and sub-tidal forcing in the open boundary of the limited-area model. Our OBC applied the active OBCs of Gan and Allen (2005) in the sub-tidal forcing component and Flather-type OBC in the tidal forcing component concurrently. Using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), we applied this OBC to the shallow East China Sea (ECS) shelf, where the circulation is jointly governed by strong tidal and sub-tidal forcing over the complex shelf topography. The OBC well reproduced the observed tidal and sub-tidal circulation in the ECS, and the spurious disturbances induced by the OBC were constrained within 2% as compared with the result obtained from a vastly expanded model domain. The disturbances generated inside the domain were able to travel outward across the open boundaries with nominal spurious reflection and the mass conservation was also fulfilled by the OBC. Our numerical experiments and analyses suggested that the newly developed OBC considerably suppressed the reflective spurious disturbances near the open boundary and performed better than either Orlanski-type or Flather-type in reproducing realistic tidally and sub-tidally forced shelf circulation in the ECS.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between surface melting and ice motion will affect how the Greenland Ice Sheet responds to climate and the structure of the subglacial drainage system may be crucial in controlling how changing melt-rates impact ice motion. Several lines of evidence indicate that hydraulically efficient subglacial channels extend tens of km inland from land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the melt-season. However, it remains unclear the extent to which water pressure variations in these drainage axes perturb ice-motion in areas both proximal and distal to the channels where the drainage system is likely hydraulically inefficient. Here, we present ice velocities observed with field based GPS and remotely sensed TerraSAR-X data across a land-terminating region of the south-west Greenland ice sheet during the melt-year 2012–2013, to examine the impact of varying drainage system structure on the spatial pattern of seasonal and annual ice motion. We find that whilst spatial variability in the configuration of the subglacial drainage system controls ice motion at short timescales, this configuration has negligible impact on the spatial pattern of the proportion of annual motion which occurs during summer. Whilst absolute annual velocities vary substantially, the proportional contribution of summer motion to annual motion does not. Subglacial hydrology does not therefore have a significant impact on the overall extent to which summer motion contributes to annual motion. These findings imply that the representation of hydrology in ice sheet models may be simplified.",

            "abstract": "The flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is known to be concentrated in a number of jets associated with fronts that are characterized by large horizontal gradients of temperature, salinity, sea surface height, and other variables. The processes of water mass transformation as well as the meridional energy and tracer transports in the Southern Ocean are most intense near the fronts and, therefore, it is important to establish their position and spatial extent. Based on historic hydrographic data, three major ACC fronts from north to south have been identified: the Subantarctic Front (SAF), the Polar Front (PF), and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF). Later, space-borne observations of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) as well as ocean model simulations have revealed a more complex frontal structure. As part of the validation of the Aquarius data and a demonstration of its capabilities and utility for oceanographic studies, we use along-track Aquarius data for the determination of the ACC sea surface salinity (SSS) fronts between Africa and Antarctica. The position of the fronts is determined from along-track salinity gradients and validated with concurrent SST- and SSH- derived frontal positions, as well as with the positions of temperature and salinity fronts obtained from several realizations of AX25 XBT and Good Hope CTD transects in 2011-2013. We find that some of the frontal positions that we have determined, although being representative only for one particular day, are close to the time mean positions obtained from hydrography. Thus, Aquarius data demonstrate its utility for studies of the variability of the ACC frontal positions. The SSS fronts are not necessarily collocated with SST and/or SSH fronts. The integral effects of temperature and salinity may compensate each other in the Southern Ocean, so that temperature and salinity fronts are not always associated with SSH fronts. Aquarius measurements thus complement SST and SSH records and can potentially advance our knowledge about the complex structure of the ACC fronts.",

            "abstract": "While overlake evaporation is a major component of the Great Lakes’ water balance, our scientific understanding of the climatic drivers of evaporation and its effects on water levels is significantly impeded by limited data. Existing measurement methods, such as eddy covariance, are not easily implemented in offshore applications. As such, there are only a handful of sites making direct, overlake measurements of evaporation on the entire Great Lakes, where the lake surface area comprises nearly one third of the entire basin. Long-term forecasts of water levels are thus very uncertain, particularly relating to climatic forcing, which is known to be a major driver of evaporation. We present a novel sensor architecture which is deployed on buoys, both tethered and drifting, to provide real-time measurements of overlake evaporation across the Great Lakes. Our system is comprised of a hierarchy of low-power, cost-effective sensor nodes, which carry out on-board computations to estimate evaporation in real-time. An ultra-low power microcontroller samples a suite of sensors to compute evaporation based on the Bowen ratio energy budget approach. The readings are then transmitted via satellite modules to a cloud-based server infrastructure for real-time updated scientific analysis and forecasting. Initial assessment of our new satellite drifter platform indicates robust field performance, validating its use in ongoing efforts to deploy a large-scale evaporation observation network across the Great Lakes basin.",

            "abstract": "     California’s Central Valley water quality and soils are essential to the survival of the valley’s communities and agriculture. Therefore, detection of possible contaminants within the valley streams and soils are paramount to the protection of this land and the people that depend upon it. Here we explore the impact of the contaminated stream beds near the New Idria Mercury Mine site, San Benito County, California. Previous work by Ganguli et al. (2000) has been done in this area to determine the mercury levels associated with the water that flows near the ghost town of New Idria. We performed geochemical analyses on the finer bed sediments from channels draining the area, as well as the coarser sediments taken from along the channel banks, to determine mercury transport downriver from the source. Using a novel application of tau, a mass transfer coefficient typically used in critical zone studies or  soil production and weathering rates, we determine downstream weathering, accumulation, and transport of mercury. Our initial geochemical data showed higher tau values upstream as well as within the banks of the contaminated streambed and a greater accumulation of mercury near the pollution source (i.e.,  mine tailings, (τ ~ 103)). Tau results also show elevated mercurial levels existing downstream, with accumulations in mid- (τ ~ 102) and down-stream (τ ~ 10) reaches. Combining tau results with more traditional indices of chemical weathering (CIA) support  consistent overall Hg-weathering processes with low levels of chemical weathering and higher dominance of coupled physical-anthropogenic weathering.\n   ",

            "abstract": "Soil Moisture and precipitation are coupled and the strength of coupling varies from region to region. Using ground based and satellite based observational estimates of soil moisture, we notice that SM and precipitation are more strongly coupled for drought years over northern India. Power spectrum analysis for drought year showed prominent peaks in 15-20 days window for both variables. This coupling was absent during a year with higher than normal precipitation. The stronger coupling between SM and precipitation in below normal monsoon years can affect the intra seasonal variability of monsoon.\nModel experiments were performed to understand the sensitivity of precipitation to SM conditions using a global general circulation model forced with observed sea surface temperature. Three runs were performed. One with variable hydrology (control), and two with non-varying soil moisture conditions (a dry condition and a wet condition). It was observed that the experiment with soil moisture close to dry simulated higher precipitation over northern India as compared to the the simulation with wet soil moisture. This was on account of higher advection of moisture toward this region that surpassed increased evaporation in the wet simulation. A bi-stable nature of the control simulation was noticed that was closer to the dry simulation in the early part of the monsoon season and closer to the wet simulation during the later part of the season, which was unlike in the observations.",

            "abstract": "We are using coordinated IR spectroscopy and Rb-Sr geochronology measurements to map the mineralogy and assess the history of Martian meteorites. By integrating these techniques, we can identify primary and biased isochrons, and place them in mineralogical context, which is especially valuable for complex brecciated meteorites like NWA 7034. Our measurements are composed of hundreds of IR and Rb-Sr measurements made across a sample. The IR reflectance measurements are made with a Thermo Scientific iN10 Fourier transform infrared microscope (μFTIR) to map the dominant mineral signatures, with spot sizes that can range from 10 - 300 µm and making maps that can have spatial resolutions from 10 - 300 µm. Rb and Sr isotopes are measured with a prototype laser ablation resonance ionization mass spectrometer using 70 μm spots and 250 μm spacing. Using these techniques for well-behaved samples like Zagami, we have been able to determine an age of 280±100 Ma (vs 166 Ma via traditional methods). For some samples that have experienced multiple alteration events, we are able to identify multiple isochrons, each associated with a specific mineralogy. NWA 7034 is known to host multiple ages and lithologies, and hence is ideally suited to high-resolution Rb-Sr and mineralogy mapping analysis. We have completed the IR measurements of NWA 7034, and will report on these results synthesized with Rb-Sr isotope measurements. In addition to aiding the geochronology measurements, the IR spectra also provide new, phase-isolated data for interpreting orbital and landed datasets. These spectra are particularly useful for representing phases such as pigeonite that are difficult to isolate physically and vary compositionally from their terrestrial counterparts.",

In addition, the segmentation and degree of interplate coupling at the Lesser Antilles subduction is key to our understanding of the earthquake potential of a subduction whose length is similar to the rupture area of the Mw9.0, 2011, Tohoku earthquake in Japan.\nWe used the block modeling approach described in Meade and Loveless (2009) to test the optimal block geometry for the northern, eastern and southern boundaries of the Caribbean plate. We solved for angular velocities for each block/plate and strain accumulation rates for all major faults in the region. Then we calculated the variations in interplate coupling along the subduction plate boundaries using the accumulated strain rates.\nWe tested 11 different block geometries; they are all based on geological evidences unless they are suggested by discrepancies within the GPS and seismological data or by previously published results. We confirm the existence of the micro Gonave plate. The boundary between the Micro-Gonave plate and the Hispaniola crustal block is better suited along the Haitian-Thrust-Belt instead of the Neiba-Matheux fault. The interseismic GPS velocities do not show evidence for a distinct North Lesser Antilles block. We found a totally uncoupled section of the subduction starting from the Puerto-Rico trench to the end of the Lesser Antilles section. All the relative motion of the Caribbean block is lost aseismically along the boundary of that portion of the subduction. While we found strong coupling along the northern Hispaniola section, most of the deformation on this region is being accumulated along intrablock faults with very low strain (~2mm/yr) along the intraplate subduction interface. We also performed several tests resolutions to assess the ability of the existing GPS data and the associated uncertainties to adequately resolved different aspects of the strain accumulation along the subduction. We found reasonable lateral resolution and very poor vertical resolution.",

            "abstract": "In 1989, Joe Kirschvink applied a nascent planetary climate theory—the self-reversing ice-albedo instability—to Neoproterozoic geology, citing paleomagnetic evidence that ancient Australian glaciers reached tidewater near the paleo-equator. He attributed the “snowball Earth” to a unique preponderance of low-latitude continents, and inferred that complex life including metazoa were spawned in the nutrient-rich glacial aftermath. There have been major advances in models and data since 1989, and gratifying convergences between them. In models, frozen oceans coexist with dynamic ice sheets, as demanded by geological data. Geochronological data show that snowball glaciations were prolonged and their terminations globally synchronous, as required by geochemical models for snowball deglaciation. In models, zonal average sources and sinks of water vapor are reversed in snowball atmospheres relative to climate states with ice lines (at low or high-latitude). Ice-covered oceans are well mixed, by true thermohaline meridional overturning and related jets, with implications for data linking iconic snowball iron-formations with silled basins. Triple oxygen isotope data from sulfate robustly supports model predictions of atmospheric CO2 required for snowball deglaciation, while promising results have been obtained from a variety of pH, weathering, productivity and redox sensitive proxies. The known first appearances of sponge biomarkers and metazoan embryos bracket the terminal Cryogenian snowball glaciation. Existing model-data conflicts are good targets for future research. Boron isotopes in syndeglacial cap dolomites consistently imply catastrophic ocean acidification upon deglaciation, while models suggest that the existence of cap dolomites implies that seawater acidified gradually and was buffered by the dissolution of carbonate, delivered by glaciers. Above all, the newly emerging Cryogenian chronology (highlighted in this session) presents new puzzles. Two low-latitude glaciations of grossly unequal longevity occurred in rapid succession. The Sturtian was 55-60 Myr long, followed a 109-yr glacial hiatus, and was distinguished by Fe2O3-rich sedimentary deposits; the Marinoan was 5-20 Myr long, followed a 107-yr glacial hiatus, and was distinguished by BaSO4-rich cap dolomite.",

            "abstract": "Fires play a major role in the carbon-cycle and the development of global vegetation, especially on the continent of Australia, where vegetation is prone to frequent fire occurences and where regional composition and stand-age distribution is regulated by fire. Furthermore, the probable changes of fire behaviour under a changing climate are still poorly understood and require further investigation.\nIn this presentation we introduce a novel approach to simulate fire-frequencies, fire-intensities and the responses in vegetation. Fire frequencies are prescribed using SIMFIRE (Knorr et al., 2014) or GFED3 (e.g. Giglio et al., 2013). Fire-Line-Intensity (FLI) is computed from meteorological information and fuel loads which are state variables within the C-cycle component of CABLE. This FLI is used as an input to the tree-demography model POP (Population-Order-Physiology; Haverd et al., 2014). Within POP the fire-mortality depends on FLI and tree height distribution.Intensity-dependent combustion factors (CF) are then generated for and applied to live and litter carbon pools as well as the transfers from live pools to litter caused by fire.\nThus, both fire and stand characteristics are taken into account which has a legacy effect on future events.\nGross C-CO2 emissions from Australian wild fires are larger than Australian territorial fossil fuel emissions. However, the net effect of fire on the Australian terrestrial carbon budget is unknown. We address this by applying the newly-developed fire module, integrated within the CABLE land surface model, and optimised for the Australian region, to a reassessment of the Australian Terrestrial Carbon Budget.",

Concrete strength is determined with uniaxial compressive test as destructive in laboratory and with Seismic Ultrasonic P- (Compressional) and S-wave (Shear) measurements as non-destructive in-situ or laboratory. In this study, strength of saturated concrete is investigated by using seismic P and S-wave velocities. For this, concrete samples were formed with using the cube samples in size 15x15x15cm. Different strength designs were made for obtain different strengths in these samples. The aim is to create concrete strengths of between the lowest 5MPa and the highest 100 MPa. After the end of the curing time of created the cube concrete samples Seismic P and S waves measurements were made in the laboratory by Ultrasonic test equipment. Hence, P and S wave velocities of the sample were calculated. After these, for determine the strength of the samples uniaxial compression strength test was performed. As a result, P and S wave velocities and concrete strength values of concrete samples were obtained. By correlating these values over %90 exponential relationships were determined. By using this relationship, concrete strength can be determined sensitively from P and S wave velocities. In addition, by using P and S wave velocities elastic parameters values and Poisson's ratio of concrete specimens can be calculated.\nKeywords: Concrete, Strength, Compressional and Shear-wave velocities, Empirical Relationship",

The cruises were devoted to finding and studying hydrocarbon seeps (e.g. pockmarks, crater-like structures), evaluating neo‐tectonic activity and focusing on some problems in the field of modern geological and geochemical processes in the Arctic region. This topic is focused on identification of the gas anomalies related to the possible cold seep structures, study of the molecular and isotopic composition and origin of the hydrocarbon gases from the bottom sediments.\nDuring this research the interpretation of geochemical survey data was carried out within the different structures of the Barents region: 1) The area of distribution of craters, 2) Storfjordrenna and Storfiordbanken, 3) Nordkap and Tiddly basins, Fedynskii high, North-Kildinsk field.\n1) In the Central Barents Sea in the area of distribution of craters residual discharge of gas from the Triassic sandstones has occurred and manifested through the activity of gas flares and elevated concentrations of methane. Values of gas coefficients indicate the possible existence of thermogenic gas in the sample. The active unloading of gas and formation of craters associated with the disintegration of gas hydrates.\n2) Discovered gas flares, pockmarks and abnormal high concentrations of methane are the first statement about the presence of active gas discharge in the NW Barents Sea. HC gases are formed as a result of microbial processing of thermogenic gas. In the area there is an increased microbial activity resulting in authigenic carbonate formation. Unloading of gas is observed in the edges parts of the large glacial moraine along the base of which the lateral migration of gas occurs. Reservoirs can be Lower-Middle and Lower-Middle Triassic sandstones.\n3) In the Southern Barents Sea no gas anomalies were detected: low gas concentrations, the gas is of biogenic origin.

Uncertainties in CLM 4.5 hydrological outputs are however not well evaluated, which in turn impacts the interpretability of the data. Here, we employ time series of time-variable gravity from the NASA/DLR GRACE mission to calculate total water storage in Eurasia during 2003-2014. We compare TWS from GRACE with CLM 4.5 outputs at the regional and basin scale. At the basin scale we find a good agreement in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal variability, with smaller amplitude in CLM 4.5 derived TWS in the Lena basin. In terms of trends at the basin scale, we find a reasonable agreement for the Ob and Yenisei basins and more significant differences for the Lena basin. When examining the spatial pattern in TWS across Eurasia, the areas of significant decrease or increase in TWS are captured correctly but the amplitude and the spatial extent of the trends do not always agree. To interpret these differences, we compare the CLM 4.5 products to independent observations of precipitation from GPCP, ERA-Interim, MERRA and NCEP CFSR, evapotranspiration from MODIS, and surface hydrology components including snow water equivalent and soil moisture from AMSR-E and SSMI/S satellite products. We evaluate the agreement between these components in terms of seasonal and long-term variability and also determine the dominant control on TWS in each basin.",

            "abstract": "The Afar Depression is an extraordinary submerged laboratory where the crustal mechanisms involved in the active rifting process can be studied. But the crustal movements at the regional scale are complicated by being the locus of the meeting of three divergent plate boundaries: the oceanic spreading ridges of the Red Sea and the Aden Ridge and the intra-continental East-African Rift (EAR). We present here the first GPS measurements conducted in a new network in Central Afar, complementing existing networks in Eritrea, around the Manda-Harraro 2005-2010 active segment, in the Northern part of the EAR and in Djibouti. Even if InSAR data were appropriate for mapping the deformation field, the results are difficult to interpret for analyzing the regional kinematics because of the atmospheric conditions, the lack of complete data catalogue, the acquisition configuration and the small velocity variations. Therefore, our measurements in the new sites are crucial to obtain an accurate velocity field over the whole depression, and focus specifically on the spatial organization of the deformation to characterize the tripe junction. These first results show that a small part of the motion of the Somalia plate with respect to the Nubia plate or the Arabia plate (2-3 mm/yr) occurs south of the Tadjura Gulf and East of the Adda-do segment in Southern Afar. The complex kinematic pattern involves a clockwise rotation of this Southeastern part of the Afar rift and can be related to the significant seismic activity regularly recorded in the region of Jigjiga (northern Somalia-Ethiopia border). The western continuation of the Aden Ridge into Afar extends West of the Asal rift segment and does not reach the young active segment of Manda-Inakir (MI). A slow gradient of velocity is observed across the Dobi Graben and across the large systems of faults between Lake Abhe and the MI rift segment. A striking change of the velocity direction occurs in the region of Assaïta, west of Lake Abhe, suggesting that this area represents the most probable location for the triple junction.",

            "abstract": "Over the past years more and more geospatial data have been made readily accessible for different user communities as part of government efforts to set-up Spatial Data Infrastructures. As a result users from different sectors can search, find and bind spatial information and combine it with their own data resources and applications. However, too often, spatial data applications and services remain organised as separate silos, not well integrated in the business processes they are supposed to support.\nThe European Union Location Framework (EULF), as part of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme of the EU (EC-DG DIGIT), aims to improve the integration of location information in e-Government processes through a better policy and strategy alignment, and through the improved legal, organisational, semantic and technical interoperability of data and systems. The EULF seeks to enhance interactions between Governments, Businesses and Citizens with location information and location enabled services and to make them part of the more generic ICT infrastructures of public administrations.\nOne of the challenges that arise in this context is to describe, estimate or measure the benefits and added value of this integration of location information in e-Government. In the context of the EULF several existing approaches to assess the benefits of spatially enabled services and applications in e-Government have been studied. Two examples will be presented, one from Denmark, the other from Abu Dhabi. Both served as input to the approach developed for the EULF. A concrete case to estimate benefits at service and process level will be given with the aim to respond questions such as “which indicators can be used and how to measure them”, “how can process owners collect the necessary information”, “how to solve the benefits attribute question” and “how to extrapolate findings from one level of analysis to another”?",

            "abstract": "Properly evaluating temporal changes in the occurrence of extreme high or low temperatures is of key importance for assessing the potential local impacts of ongoing climatic changes and estimating possible future trends. Notably, the applicability of traditional extreme value statistics to non-stationary climate data is often restricted by the available amount of data. As a possible alternative, quantile regression techniques allow estimating temporal trends in arbitrary quantiles of the distribution of observed temperatures. Here, we report corresponding results on the long-term evolution of daily mean, maximum and minimum temperatures from three different sources: a homogeneous set of German station data, the E-OBS gridded data set of European temperatures since 1950, and various global reanalysis data sets.\nAt the scale of individual meteorological stations across Germany, the obtained trends in very high and low quantiles reveal an extraordinary increase of high temperature extremes since the 1950s, which significantly exceeds the mean warming. In order to further assess the robustness of these results, we compare the trend values for linear and nonlinear (spline-based) quantile trends with those obtained from (linearly) time-dependent extreme value analysis and find reasonable mutual agreement in the observed mean trends. The obtained spatial patterns of trend values reveal seasonally different regionalized effects related to changes in the predominance of coastal vs. continental climatology, local geographical factors and the distribution of potential urban heat islands.\nFor the gridded data sets, linear quantile regression provides a full picture of (seasonal) trends in daily surface air temperature extremes across the globe. The obtained results are largely consistent among different data sets in regions with good coverage by meteorological stations, but display marked differences in poorly covered regions, expecially around the poles and within large deserts. Notably, the observed differences originate mainly from time periods without available remote sensing data, whereas the estimated trend values converge when taking only the last about 35 years into account, providing additional confidence in the robustness of the observed trends.",

In the past, large earthquakes that originated significant tsunamis occurred nearly once per century (Maramai et al., 2014, Annals of Geophysics).\nThe Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) received a mandate from the international community to coordinate the establishment of the ICG/NEAMTWS (http://neamtic.ioc-unesco.org) through Resolution IOC-XXIII-14. Since then, several countries (France, Turkey, Greece) have started operating as candidate Tsunami Watch Provider (cTWP) in the Mediterranean.\nItaly started operating as cTWP on October 1st, 2014. The Italian cTWP is formed by INGV (“Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia)”, DPC (“Dipartimento di Protezione Civile”) and ISPRA (“Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale”). INGV is in charge of issuing the alert for potentially tsunamigenic earthquakes, ISPRA provides the sea level recordings and DPC is in charge of disseminating the alert. \nINGV established the tsunami alert center (CAT, “Centro di Allerta Tsunami”) at the end of 2013. CAT is co-located with the INGV national seismic surveillance center operated since many years. In this work, we show the technical and personnel organization of CAT, its response to recent earthquakes, and the new procedures under development for implementation.\n(*) INGV-CAT WG: Amato A., Basili R., Bernardi F., Bono A., Danecek P., De Martini P.M., Govoni A., Graziani L., Lauciani V., Lomax, A., Lorito S., Maramai A., Mele F., Melini D., Molinari I., Nostro C., Piatanesi A., Pintore S., Quintiliani M., Romano F., Selva J., Selvaggi G., Sorrentino D., Tonini R.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphologists have historically tracked river dynamics using a combination of maps, aerial photographs, and the stratigraphic record. Although stratigraphic records can extend into deep time, maps and aerial photographs often confine our record of change to sparse measurements over the last ~80 years and in some cases much less time. For the first time Google’s Earth Engine (GEE) cloud based platform allows researchers the means to analyze quantitatively the pattern and pace of river channel change over the last 30 years with high temporal resolution across the entire planet. The GEE provides an application programing interface (API) that enables quantitative analysis of various data sets including the entire Landsat L1T archive. This allows change detection for channels wider than about 150 m over 30 years of successive, georeferenced imagery. Qualitatively, it becomes immediately evident that the pace of channel morphodynamics for similar planforms varies by orders of magnitude across the planet and downstream along individual rivers. To quantify these rates of change and to explore their controls we have developed methods for differentiating channels from floodplain along large alluvial rivers. We introduce a new metric of morphodynamics: the ratio of eroded area to channel area per unit time, referred to as “M”. We also keep track of depositional areas resulting from channel shifting. To date our quantitative analysis has focused on rivers in the Andean foreland. Our analysis shows channel bank erosion rates, M, varies by orders of magnitude for these rivers, from 0 to ~0.25 yr-1, yet these rivers have essentially identical curvature and sinuosity and are visually indistinguishable. By tracking both bank paths in time, we find that, for some meandering rivers, a significant fraction of new floodplain is produced through outer-bank accretion rather than point bar deposition. This process is perhaps more important in generating floodplain stratigraphy than previously recognized. These initial findings indicate a new set of quantitative observations will emerge to further test and advance morphodynamic theory. The Google Earth Engine offers the opportunity to explore river morphodynamics on an unprecedented scale and provides a powerful tool for addressing fundamental questions in river morphodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Constraining past ice mass changes, identifying their cause(s) and determining rigorous error estimates, is important for closing the sea level budget and as an input for and test of numerical models. For the Antarctic ice sheet, considerable uncertainty remains between different methods and groups. Estimates obtained from laser and radar altimetry can yield conflicting results, while the, commonly adopted, use of different forward models to isolate and remove the effects of glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) and surface mass balance (SMB) processes introduces another source of uncertainty which is hard to quantify. To address both these issues, we present a statistical modelling approach to the problem. We combine the observational data, including satellite altimetry, GRACE, GPS and InSAR, and use the different degrees of spatial and temporal smoothness to constrain the underlying geophysical processes. This is achieved via a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model, employing dimensionality reduction methods to allow the solution to remain tractable in the presence of the large number (> 10^7) of observations involved. The resulting trend estimates are only dependent on length and smoothness properties obtained from numerical models, but are otherwise entirely data-driven. As a consequence, the solutions provide a valuable independent test of the forward models.\nHere, we present the annually-resolved spatial fields for i) dynamic ice loss, ii) SMB anomaly, iii) firn compaction and iv) (the time invariant) GIA, using a combination of GRACE, ICESat, ENVISat, CryoSat 2 and GPS vertical uplift rates, for 2003-2013. The elastic flexure of the crust is also determined simultaneously. We focus here primarily on the mass trends rather than solid earth effects. We present the spatial pattern of evolving dynamic ice loss in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula and contrast that with a significant positive SMB anomaly in East Antarctica since 2009 and other parts of the ice sheet. We also compare our SMB anomalies with those from the regional climate model, RACMO-2.3 to test its ability to capture the spatio-temporal structure of inter-annual variability in snowfall.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic sudden commencements (SCs) are known as one of the distinct magnetospheric disturbance phenomena triggered by solar wind disturbances. Many previous studies have focused on the generation mechanism of SCs by using in-situ observations and simulations. However, the global evolution of ionospheric electric fields has primarily been estimated from the ionospheric current. Although a few studies utilized electric field data from radar observations, the coverage is limited in time, and limited component of the electric field is obtained. In this study, we investigated the response and local time dependence of the ionospheric electric field at mid-low latitudes associated with 203 SCs occurred from 1999 to 2004 by the in-situ observation of the ROCSAT-1 spacecraft. We found that the ionospheric electric field associated with SCs instantaneously responds to geomagnetic fields regardless of spacecraft local time. Our statistical analysis also showed the instantaneous response of the electric field, which indicates the global instant transmission of the electric field from polar region. In contrast, peak times in the preliminary impulse (PI) and main impulse (MI) phases were different between the ionospheric electric field and equatorial geomagnetic field (20 sec in the PI phase). Based on a comparison to the ground-ionosphere waveguide model by Kikuchi [2014], this time lag is suggested to be due to the latitudinal difference of the ionospheric conductivity. After constructing the local time distribution of the SC amplitude, we found that the dayside feature was seen at 18-22 h even the ionospheric conductivity is lower than that at dayside. We performed a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation for an ideal SC. The result of the simulation showed that the electric potential distribution is asymmetric with respect to the noon-midnight meridian, which is similar to our observational result. It appears to result from the divergence of the Hall current under the non-uniform ionospheric conductivity near the terminator as well as the auroral region.",

            "abstract": "The recently developed NOAA Water instrument is a two-channel, closed-path, tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer designed for the measurement of water vapor and enhanced total water (vapor + inertially enhanced condensed-phase) from the NASA Global Hawk unmanned aircraft system (UAS) or other high-altitude research aircraft. Combining the measurements from the two channels allows the determination of cloud ice water content (IWC), an important metric for evaluating the radiative properties of cirrus clouds.\nThe instrument utilizes wavelength-modulated spectroscopy with second harmonic detection near 2694 nm to achieve high precision with a 79 cm double-pass optical path. The detection cells are operated under constant temperature, pressure and flow conditions to maintain a constant sensitivity to H2O independent of the ambient sampling environment. An on-board calibration system is used to perform periodic in situ calibrations to verify the stability of the instrument sensitivity during flight. For the water vapor channel, ambient air is sampled perpendicular to the flow past the aircraft in order to reject cloud particles, while the total water channel uses a heated, forward-facing inlet to sample both water vapor and cloud particles. The total water inlet operates subisokinetically, thereby inertially enhancing cloud particle number in the sample flow and affording increased cirrus IWC sensitivity.\nThe NOAA Water instrument was flown for the first time during the second deployment of the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) in February-March 2013 on board the Global Hawk UAS. The instrument demonstrated a typical in-flight precision (1 s, 1 σ) of better than 0.17 parts per million (ppm, 10-6 mol/mol), with an overall H2O vapor measurement uncertainty of 5% ± 0.23 ppm. The inertial enhancement for cirrus cloud particle sampling under ATTREX flight conditions ranged from 33-48 for ice particles larger than 8 µm in diameter, depending primarily on aircraft altitude. The resulting IWC detection limit (2 σ) was 0.023-0.013 ppm, corresponding to approximately 2 µg m-3, with an estimated overall uncertainty of 20%.",

            "abstract": "The issue of subsurface microbial community responses to the injection of CO2 has great importance not only from a risk assessment point of view but also from the perspective of CO2 recycling to CH4. In this sense, the objective of this study is to develop mathematical models to make a quantitative description of the responses of subsurface indigenous microbial communities to the injection of CO2. For this end, TOUGHREACTV1.2 reactive transport simulator with its module ECO2N is used as the modeling framework. The targeted microbial community is composed of fermentative bacteria (Organic matter → Acetate & H2), acetotrophic methanogens (Acetate → Methane & CO2), acetotrophic Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) (Acetate → H2S & CO2), hydrogenotrophic methanogens (H2 & CO2 → CH4), and hydrogenotrophic SRB (H2 → H2S). Due to the multiple hydrogeological, geochemical and microbiological factors intervening in both the response of subsurface microbial communities to the injection of CO2 and the chemical and physical fate of CO2 itself, at this stage simulations have been performed in batch mode. That means numerical simulations aimed to track changes in CO2 saturation levels, pH, and concentrations of mineral and aqueous phase species over time at selected initial conditions. Numerical simulation results indicate that the activity of microbes associated with methanogenic processes in geological storage sites of CO2 is governed by the level of CO2 saturation in the pore space as well as by the presence of pH buffering minerals such as calcite. With calcite in the mineral phase attenuating drops in pH below inhibitory levels, for instance it is shown that acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic SRB outcompete acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens for acetate and H2, respectively. During the initial stages of the reaction when the pH level is lowest, the higher tolerance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to acidic pH levels is reflected by a preferential formation of CH4 via the reduction pathway of CO2 with H2 serving as the electron source. However, the increase of pH levels due to both geochemical and microbial reactions in combination with the formation of acetate from the metabolization of organic matter, eventually leads to a preferential formation of CH4 via acetoclastic methanogenesis.",

The suite of analyzed rocks display a calc-alkaline affinity, ranging in composition from basaltic-andesite to dacite. Trace element patterns indicate a typical behavior of subduction-related magmas and also the clear contribution of an OIB-like signature at source. A group of andesites displays also adakite-like geochemical features, as evidenced by their constant depletion in HFSE elements. Sr isotope (0.703593 - 0.703678) and Nd isotope ratios (0.512960 - 0.512968) suggest that Turrialba magmas belong to one of the less contaminated mantle source of Central America. The 3He/4He ratio of fluid inclusions from the most mafic eruptive products (basaltic-andesites) varies from 7.86 to 8.07 Ra, while that from andesite lavas varies from 7.03 to 7.18 Ra. In order to understand the mantle source feeding Turrialba volcano, we performed a geochemical investigation on fumarolic gases of summit craters. The He isotope composition of dry gases of Turrialba volcano is characterized by extremely high R/Ra values (7.08-7.96 Ra). The highest 3He/4He ratios were measured at both West and Central Craters (7.93–7.96 Ra and 7.78–7.88 Ra, respectively), and are the highest values of the entire Central America. Despite the observed variability, the 3He/4He ratio of fumarolic gases and FIs from Turrialba volcano is well in the range of arc related volcanism (~7–8 Ra; Hilton et al., 2002), and represents the signature of a mantle wedge in which the contamination by crustal fluids is small to negligible. In addition the occurrence of recent adakite-like magmatism suggests the presence of an abnormal heating of the subducting lithosphere under Turrialba volcano, allowing even old or cold oceanic crust to melt.",

            "abstract": "Hong Kong is situated in the Pearl River delta of Southern China. This region has experienced phenomenal economic growth in the past 30 years. Emissions of large amount of pollutants from urban areas and various industries coupled with subtropical climate have led to frequent occurrences of severe photochemical air pollution. Despite the long-term control efforts of the Hong Kong government, the atmospheric levels of ozone have been increasing in the past decade. To obtain an updated and more complete understanding of photochemical smog, an integrative study has been conducted during 2010-2014. Several intensive measurement campaigns were carried out at urban, suburban and rural sites in addition to the routine observations at fourteen air quality monitoring stations in Hong Kong. Meteorological, photochemical, and chemical-transport modeling studies were conducted to investigate the causes/processes of elevated photochemical pollution . The main activities of this study were to (1) examine the situation and trends of photochemical air pollution in Hong Kong, (2) understand some underlying chemical processes in particular the poorly-understood heterogeneous processes of reactive nitrogen oxides, (3) quantify the local, regional, and super-regional contributions to the ozone pollution in Hong Kong, and (4) review the control policy and make further recommendations based on the science. This paper will give an overview of this study and present some key results on the trends and chemistry of the photochemical pollution in this polluted subtropical region.",

            "abstract": "The interior of the Giant Planets Uranus and Neptune contains large amounts of water, ammonia and methane (referred to as planetary ices). Many observable properties of these planets, such as luminosity, gravitational moments and magnetic fields, are thought to be determined by the physical and chemical properties of matter within this ice layer. Hence, the phase diagrams, equations of state and structural properties of these materials and their respective mixtures are of great interest.\nEspecially the phase diagrams of water and ammonia gained much attention since Cavazzoni et al. [1] proposed superionic phases for these materials, which are characterized by highly mobile hydrogen ions in a lattice of oxygen and nitrogen ions, respectively. For water, the influence of such a phase on the properties of the Giant Planets as well as on exoplanets has been discussed widely. [2,3] Nevertheless, it is an open question how the properties of such a water layer change when another compound, e.g., ammonia is introduced. Considering a 1:1 mixture, we have performed ab initio simulations based on density functional theory using the VASP code [4] heating up structures which we had found from evolutionary random structure search calculations with XtalOpt [5]. We propose possible superionic water-ammonia structures present up to several Mbar. Moreover, we investigate the equation of state and transport properties of this mixture such as diffusion coefficients in order to compare with the pure compounds. These results are essential to construct new interior models for Neptune-like planets.\n[1] C. Cavazzoni et al., Science 283, 44 (1999).\n[2] R. Redmer et al., Icarus 211, 798 (2011).\n[3] L.

Development of an interagency standard for tracking discovery level metadata for projects has been achieved through collaboration with the Alaska Data Integration work group. The US National Science Foundation plus 17 other agencies and organizations have adopted the standard with several entities successfully implementing XML based REST webservices. With ARMAP’s web mapping applications and data services (\nhttp://armap.org\n), users can search for research projects by location, year, funding program, keyword, investigator, and discipline, among other variables. Key information about each project is displayed within the application with links to web pages that provide additional information. The ARMAP 2D mapping application has been significantly enhanced to include support for multiple projections, improved base maps, additional reference data layers, and optimization for better performance. In 2014, ship tracks for US National Science Foundation supported vessel based surveys have been expanded. These enhancements have been made to increase awareness of projects funded by numerous entities in the Arctic, enhance coordination for logistics support, help identify geographic gaps in research efforts and potentially foster more collaboration amongst researchers working in the region. Additionally, ARMAP can be used to demonstrate past, present, and future research efforts supported by the U.S. Government.",

            "abstract": "International aid is increasingly focused on adaptation to climate change. At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world respond to the impacts of climate change. Here, we examine the decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate change adaptation projects given the large uncertainty in future climate predictions, using the example of efforts to implement coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation project supported by the World Bank.\nDrawing on interview and document research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term (~20 years) planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust suboptimal investments.",

            "abstract": "ALSEP science stations were deployed by Apollo astronauts at 5 Apollo lunar landing sites and were comprised of 13 active science experiments which were flown 4 to 8 at a time. All ALSEPs were turned-off on 9-30-1977, after they had generated a data set of 31 system data years and an experiment data set of over 100 data years. The 3 passive laser retroreflector experiments are still providing useable return signals. The plan was for NASA to archive the raw data, while PI Teams archived their processed data in GSFC-NSSDC. In 1975 funding for science experiments was drastically reduced. Archiving of experiments data was incomplete and in other cases experiment years of data were never analyzed. JSC's ALSEP operations manager at-end-mission stressed that the 10s of 1,000s of pages of ALSEP operational and background materals be archived in Lunar and Planetary Library for future use. In 2004 there was a renewed interest in old ALSEP science data. However, current investigators found ALSEP data very difficult to use because of its archaic formats, rerecording artifacts, and lack of suitable playback tape transports. In 2007 a group of original ALSEP personnel, current lunar investigators, and personnel from NSSDC began an effort to help solve ALSEP data availability problems. NSSDC PDS established a Lunar Node whose role was to restore the existing ALSEP data into forms which could be used by current lunar investigators. Excellent progress was achieved in several areas*. In 2010 NLSI made the Recovery of Missing ALSEP Data, a NLSI Focus Group. The group estimated 50 percent of ALSEP processed data and 80 percent of ALSEP experiments raw data were never archived with NSSDC. We suspect archival raw data tapes for the first 44 ALSEP mission months (AMM) were degaussed and reused, those for AMM 45 to 79 were lost, misplaced or destroyed in a complex system of NASA, government, industrial storage facilities (except for ~450 tapes located by S. Nagihara). The last 19 AMMs of archival raw data were retained by the University of Texas-Austin and made available in a useful form to NSSDC and science community. This leaves direct contacts with the original PI Teams as the best method for recapturing the missing ALSEP raw and processed data. There is time urgency due to advanced age of most Team Members.\n*LASER Programs reported session/posters",

            "abstract": "This study presents the geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of a modern carbonate source-to-sink system located north of Madagascar (SW Indian Ocean). The sedimentary system is composed of an isolated carbonate platform sited on top of a seamount rising steeply from the seabed located at 3000 m water depth. The slope of the seamount is incised by canyons, and meandering channels occur above lobbed sedimentary bodies at the foot of the slope. The dataset consists of dredges, sediment piston cores, swath bathymetry and seismic (sparker and 2D high-resolution) lines collected from inner platform (less than 5 m deep) to the adjacent deep sedimentary basin. Particle size analysis and composition of carbonate grains are used to characterize the distribution and heterogeneity of sands accumulated on the archipelago. Main results show that composition of carbonate sediments is dominated by segments of Halimeda, large benthic foraminifera, coral debris, molluscs, echinoderms, bryozoans and sponges. According to the shape and the position of sandwaves and intertidal sandbars developed in the back-barrier reef, the present organization of these well-sorted fine-sand accumulations appears to be strongly influenced by flood tidal currents. Seismic lines acquired from semi-enclosed to open lagoon demonstrate that most of the sediment is exported and accumulated along the leeward margin of the platform, which is connected to a canyon network incising the outer slope. Following the concept of highstand shedding of carbonate platforms (Schlager et al., 1994), excess sediment is exported by plumes and gravity flows to the adjacent deep sea where it feeds a carbonate deep-sea fan. Combined observations from platform to basin allow to explain how the Glorieuses carbonate source to sink system has evolved under the influence of climate and of relative sea-level changes since the last interglacial.",

            "abstract": "We have studied using analogue experiments the ascent of magma through a volcanic edifice. The edifice is simulated using a cone of gelatine and the magma is an aqueous solution. The latter is injected at the base of the cone and propagates through the edifice in hydraulic fractures that represent dykes. The buoyancy of the magma with respect to the edifice is varied by adjusting salt concentration in the aqueous solution and/or sugar concentration in the gelatine. The system is axisymmetric. After the gelatin is released from its mold, it is partially submerged in a layer of water that represents the surrounding ocean. Because the gelatin is denser than water, its weight generates an axisymmetric stress field in the edifice whose amplitude depends, for a given edifice density, on the depth of the water which represents ''sea-level''. We derive the geometry and amplitude of this stress field by using birefringence in the gelatin that results from its photoelasticity. We document the geometry of the dykes as they propagate and the elevation of eruptive fissures on the edifice as a function of the dimensionless parameters governing the system. Positive buoyancy of the magma tends to favour summit eruptions and increasing weight of the edifice (lower sea-level with respect to edifice height) tends to favour flank eruptions. We compare the experimental results with a dataset from Piton de la Fournaise, Reunion Island and draw some general conclusions about expected changes in eruptive behaviour as a volcanic island grows to greater and greater altitude above sea-level.",

Recent investments in a 1.2 PFlop Supercomputer (Raijin), ~ 20 PB data storage using Lustre filesystems and a 3000 core high performance cloud have created a hybrid platform for higher performance computing and data-intensive science to enable large scale earth and climate systems modelling and analysis. There are > 3000 users actively logging in and > 600 projects on the NCI system.\nEfficiently scaling and adapting data and software systems to petascale infrastructures requires the collaborative development of an architecture that is designed, programmed and operated to enable users to interactively invoke different forms of in-situ computation over complex and large scale data collections.\nNCI makes available major and long tail data collections from both the government and research sectors based on six themes: 1) weather, climate and earth system science model simulations, 2) marine and earth observations, 3) geosciences, 4) terrestrial ecosystems, 5) water and hydrology and 6) astronomy, bio and social. Collectively they span the lithosphere, crust, biosphere, hydrosphere, troposphere, and stratosphere.\nCollections are the operational form for data management and access. Similar data types from individual custodians are managed cohesively. Use of international standards for discovery and interoperability allow complex interactions within and between the collections. This design facilitates a transdisciplinary approach to research and enables a shift from small scale, ‘stove-piped’ science efforts to large scale, collaborative systems science.\nThis new and complex infrastructure requires a move to shared, globally trusted software frameworks that can be maintained and updated. Workflow engines become essential and need to integrate provenance, versioning, traceability, repeatability and publication. There are also human resource challenges as highly skilled HPC/HPD specialists, specialist programmers, and data scientists are required whose skills can support scaling to the new paradigm of effective and efficient data-intensive earth science analytics on petascale, and soon to be exascale systems.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands cover less than 5% of Earth’s ice-free land surface but exert major impacts on global biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biological diversity. Despite the importance of these environments in the global cycling of carbon and water, there is a scarcity of suitable regional-to-global remote-sensing data for characterizing their distribution and dynamics. We have been assembling a global-scale Earth System Data Record (ESDR) of natural Inundated Wetlands to facilitate investigations on their role in climate, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biodiversity. The ESDR comprises (1) Fine-resolution (100 meter) maps, delineating wetland extent, vegetation type, and seasonal inundation dynamics for regional to continental-scale areas covering crucial wetland regions, and (2) global coarse-resolution (~25 km), multi-temporal mappings of inundated area fraction (Fw) across multiple years. The fine-scale ESDR component is constructed from L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The global maps of inundated area fraction are obtained by combining coarse-resolution (~25 km) remote sensing observations from passive and active microwave instruments.\nSurface water and inundated vegetation is classified at 100m resolution using ALOS PALSAR imagery. We combine multiple passive/active microwave data sets to quantify Fwat 25 km resolution producing a daily product with ~weekly temporal composites from 1992-2013. We compare information content and accuracy of the coarse resolution data sets relative to the SAR-based data sets. This ESDR will provide the first high-resolution, accurate, consistent and comprehensive global-scale data set of wetland inundation and vegetation. We present details of assembly of this ESDR, discussing aspects of remote sensing data collections, data processing and staging, algorithm application and adaptation to contemporary data streams, cross-product harmonization, and considerations for distribution with the user community.\nThis work was carried out in part within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative. PALSAR data were provided by JAXA/EORC and the Alaska Satellite Facility.

            "abstract": "An important requirement of the safety assessment for a geological disposal facility (GDF) for radioactive waste is to be able to demonstrate the long-term chemical stability of the groundwater system at repository depth over the long period of time during which the waste will be a hazard, typically up to one million years. Of particular concern in the UK is the potential for oxidising groundwater to penetrate to repository depth during periods of glaciation, thereby increasing the mobility of some transuranic radionuclides.\nBetween 1990 and 1998, United Kingdom Nirex Limited carried out  geological investigations into the suitability of a potential site in the Sellafield area of NW England, for a GDF for L/ILW. As part of these investigations, detailed petrological analysis of fracture mineralisation in 23 deep boreholes identified a complex sequence of mineralisation events referred to as ME1-ME9. The distribution of the ME9 calcite mineralisation correlates closely with present-day groundwater flows.\nThe ME9 calcite has been studied in more detail to understand the evolution of the deep groundwater system. The morphology and growth zoning characteristics of the calcites reflects the groundwater chemistry. Freshwater calcites display c-axis flattened to equant crystals, and are non-ferroan and strongly zoned with Mn-rich and Mn-free bands. Deeper saline-zone calcites display c-axis elongated crystals, with high Mn:Fe and low Mn:Fe growth zones. Calcite in the transition zone between the saline and fresh groundwater display saline-type cores overgrown by freshwater-type calcite, indicating a small depression of the position of the transition zone during the growth of the calcites. Sr isotope ratios and fluid inclusion chemistry confirm a link between ME9 calcite and the present regional groundwater system. Modelling of the oxygen isotope data indicates that some growth zones in the ME9 calcite precipitated from groundwater potentially containing a significant proportion of glacially-recharged water, and that this may have reached depths of up to 1000 m. However, the chemical (REE,Fe and Mn) compositions of the ME9 calcite show that despite the potential contribution of glacially-recharged water to the deep groundwater system, conditions at repository depth (< 500 m) have continually remained reducing.",

            "abstract": "Direct-action avalanches occur during large storm cycles in mountainous regions, when stresses on the snowpack increase rapidly due to the load of new snow and outpace snow strengthening due to compaction. If temperatures rise above freezing during the storm and snowfall turns to rain, the near-surface snow undergoes rapid densification caused by the introduction of liquid water. This shock to the snowpack, if stability is near critical, can cause widespread immediate avalanching due to the large induced strain rates in the slab, followed by secondary delayed avalanches due to both the increased load as well as water percolation to the depth of a weak layer. We use the semi-empirical SNOow Slope Stability model (SNOSS) to estimate the evolution of stability prior to large avalanches during rain-on-snow events on Highway 21 north of Boise, Idaho. We have continuously monitored avalanche activity using arrays of infrasound sensors in the avalanche-prone section of HW21 near Stanley, in collaboration with the Idaho Transportation Department’s avalanche forecasting program. The autonomous infrasound avalanche monitoring system provides accurate timing of avalanche events, in addition to capturing avalanche dynamics during some major releases adjacent to the array. Due to the remote location and low winter traffic volume, the highway is typically closed for multiple days during major avalanche cycles. Many major avalanches typically release naturally and reach the road, but due the complex terrain and poor visibility, manual observations are often not possible until several days later. Since most avalanche programs typically use explosives on a regular basis to control slope stability, the infrasound record of avalanche activity we have recorded on HW21 provides a unique opportunity to study large naturally triggered avalanches. We use a first-order physically based stability model to estimate the importance of precipitation phase, amount, and rate during major rain-on-snow avalanche cycles.",

            "abstract": "Studying intensity and linear polarization of the solar light scattered by interplanetary dust is of interest for various reasons. This so-called zodiacal light constitutes a faint polarized glow that constitutes a changing foreground for observations of faint extended astronomical sources. Besides, analysis of its polarization provides information on properties of the dust particles, such as spatial density, morphology and complex refractive index. Previous observations, mostly from the Earth and with a resolution in the 10° range, have been used to infer that the local polarization at 90° phase angle increases with increasing solar distance. Numerical simulations suggest that, in the inner solar system, interplanetary dust particles consist of a mixture of absorbing and less absorbing materials, and that radial changes originate in a decrease of organic materials with decreasing solar distance under alteration or evaporation processes.\nTo improve the quality of data on zodiacal light polarimetry, Eye-Sat nanosat is being developed in the context of the JANUS CNES cubesats program for students. The project is now in phase C-D, for a piggy-back launch in 2016. Eye-Sat triple cubesat is anticipated to demonstrate the feasibility of a series of new on-board technologies. Moreover, during its one-year mission, zodiacal light intensity and polarization are to be measured, for the first time with a spatial resolution of about 1° over a wide portion of the sky and in four different wavelengths (visible to near-IR), leading to a better assessment of interplanetary dust properties.\nFinally, a significant fraction of the interplanetary dust is estimated to come from comets, the most pristine objects to be found in the inner solar system. While similarities have indeed been noticed between polarimetric properties of interplanetary and cometary dust particles, the latter being currently extensively documented by the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, further studies of interplanetary dust should provide a better insight on possible delivery of carbonaceous particles on telluric planets through dust impacts at an epoch of heavy bombardment, and thus to the early solar system evolution.\nSupport from CNES is warmly acknowledged.",

Users of these datasets are similarly varied, ranging from research scientists through industrial users to government decision- and policy-makers. It is very important for these users to understand the applicability of any dataset to their particular problem so that they can select the most appropriate data sources for their needs. Although data providers often provide rich supporting information in the form of metadata, typically this information does not include community usage information that can help other users judge fitness-for-purpose.\nThe CHARMe project (http://www.charme.org.uk) is filling this gap by developing a system for sharing \"commentary metadata\". These are annotations that are generated and shared by the user community and include:\nLinks between publications and datasets. The CHARMe system can record information about why a particular dataset was used (e.g. the paper may describe the dataset, it may use the dataset as a source, or it may be publishing results of a dataset assessment). These publications may appear in the peer-reviewed literature, or may be technical reports, websites or blog posts.\nFree-text comments supplied by the user.\nProvenance information, including links between datasets and descriptions of processing algorithms and sensors.\nExternal events that may affect data quality (e.g. large volcanic eruptions or El Niño events); we call these \"significant events\".\nData quality information, e.g. system maturity indices.\nCommentary information can be linked to anything that can be uniquely identified (e.g. a dataset with a DOI or a persistent web address). It is also possible to associate commentary with particular subsets of datasets, for example to highlight an issue that is confined to a particular geographic region. We will demonstrate tools that show these capabilities in action, showing how users can apply commentary information during data discovery, visualization and analysis.\nThe CHARMe project has implemented a set of open-source tools to create, store and explore commentary information, using open Web standards. In this presentation we will describe the application of the CHARMe system to the particular case of the climate data community; however the techniques and technologies are generic and can be applied in many fields.",

            "abstract": "Airborne fungal spores cause disease in plants and animals and may trigger respiratory illnesses in humans. In terrestrial systems, fungal sporulation, germination, and persistence are strongly regulated by local meteorological conditions. However, few studies investigate how microclimate affects the spatio-temporal dynamics of airborne spores. We measured fungal aerospora abundance and microclimate at varying spatial and time scales in coastal California in three habitat-types: coast redwood forest, mixed-evergreen forest, and maritime chaparral. We asked: 1) is there a difference in total airborne spore concentration between habitats, 2) when do we see peak spore counts, and 3) do spore densities correlate with microclimate conditions? Fungal spores were caught from the air with a volumetric vacuum air spore trap during the wet season (January – March) in 2013 and 2014, as well as monthly in 2014. Initial results suggest that mixed-evergreen forests exhibit the highest amounts of spore abundance in both years compared to the other habitats. This may be due to either a higher diversity of host plants in mixed-evergreen forests or a rich leaf litter layer that may harbor a greater abundance of saprotrophic fungi. Based on pilot data, we predict that temperature and to a lesser degree, relative humidity, will be important microclimate predictors for high spore densities. These data are important for understanding when and under what weather conditions we can expect to see high levels of fungal spores in the air; this can be useful information for managers who are interested in treating diseased plants with fungicides.",

            "abstract": "The presence of large quantities of precious metals, such as gold and copper, near the Earth’s surface (upper crust) is commonly attributed to transport in aqueous solution and precipitation upon variations in temperature and pressure. As a consequence, gold exploration is closely linked to solution chemistry, i.e. hydrothermal processes involving aqueous fluids with densities of around unity. However, as crustal fluids buoyantly ascend, boiling produces a coexisting low-density aqueous liquid with fundamentally different physical and chemical properties, and a, most importantly, a high affinity for coinage metals (Heinrich et al., Econ Geol., 1992, 87, 1566).\nFrom recent experimental studies of Au (Hurtig and Williams-Jones, 2014, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,, 127, 304), we know that metal speciation in this low-density phase differs fundamentally from that observed in bulk solution, clearly, with important implications for Au, and metal speciation in general, transport and ore concentrations processes (these processes would also be operable in industrial geothermal plants given the quite special solvent properties of steam). In brief, this study focuses on the speciation of select metal halides in bulk solution as well as in water vapor, and is driven by our need to understand the solvent properties of around 2.0x109 cubic kilometers of free water (or 2,500 times as much water as stored in all lakes and rivers) present in the Earth’s crust. The scope of this study has particular applications in the geothermal and oil industries, as both deal with high temperature low-density aqueous fluids. Understanding how metal halide species behave upon boiling can also provide insight into how metals, such as copper and silver, coat turbine equipment and steam piping in geothermal plants, ultimately rendering these components inoperable. This study will also provide preliminary results from mass spectrometric experiments of transition metal halides, and will be augmented with results from molecular simulations of metal halides that are aimed at characterizing the nature (i.e. relativistic structures and energies) of metal clusters in water vapor.",

            "abstract": "Uturuncu volcano is located in the central Andes at 22.27° S, 67.18° W. Despite 270,000 years of volcanic dormancy, a satellite geodetic InSAR survey by Pritchard and Simons (2002) shows an inflation rate of 1.5-2 cm/yr over an area with a width of 70 km (Pritchard and Simons, 2002). The source was modeled, using a Mogi source, to 15-17 km deep located ~3 km to the southwest of Uturuncu’s summit. Current studies have found a source area of decreased density with respect to the crust and with a Vp/Vs ratio of > 1.9, with a depth matching that derived from the deformation signature [Potro et al., 2013; M.E. West, H. McFarlin, D. Christensen written comm.]\nDetermining the size, geographic location, source depth, and source shape of deformation at Uturuncu volcano is important because this can indicate either (or a combination of) injection of magma from depth into the system, melting of crustal rock from a previous injection, or the build-up of pressure in a hydrothermal system (Pritchard and Simons, 2002). We are using phases arriving between the P and S phases to constrain some of the deformation source parameters. These result from the interaction of seismic waves with the attenuating source, believed to be local thickening of the regional shallow crustal magma body. Analysis of 200 local events spanning the period of PLUTONS seismic network operation (April 2010 to October 2012) reveals that 55 of these events show at least one station with a phase arrival between the P and S phases. If this trend holds as expected during analysis of the other 377 shallow local events, then 25.7% of the local events will generate an anomalous phase. No observable differences in the frequency of phase occurrence have been noted with time; however, the locations of earthquakes generating this phase strongly cluster (39 of 55) within a 10 km radius of the volcano, skewed to the south and west. There is the possibility of a NE-SW trend between the earthquake epicenter and the locations of the stations showing phases, suggesting anisotropy of the phase source body.",

A spectral analysis method is used to compute the linear response of MBL cloud amount to SST. We found that the amplitude of this linear response at seasonal time scale is strongly correlated with the model's warming sensitivity.

            "abstract": "Many of the empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) also known as attenuation relations have been developed for absolute acceleration or pseudo relative velocity response spectra. For a small damping, pseudo and absolute acceleration response spectra are nearly identical and hence interchangeable. It is generally known that the relative and pseudo relative velocity response spectra differ considerably at very short or very long periods, and the two are often considered similar at intermediate periods. However, observations show that the period range at which the two spectra become comparable is different from site to site. Also, the relationship of the above two types of velocity response spectra with absolute velocity response spectra are not discussed well in literature. The absolute velocity response spectra are the peak values of time histories obtained by adding the ground velocities to relative velocity response time histories at individual natural periods.\nThere exists many tall buildings on huge and deep sedimentary basins such as the Kanto basin, and the number of such buildings is growing. Recently, Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has proposed four classes of long-period ground motion intensity (http://www.data.jma.go.jp/svd/eew/data/ltpgm/) based on absolute velocity response spectra, which correlate to the difficulty of movement of people in tall buildings. As the researchers are using various types of response spectra for long-period ground motions, it is important to understand the relationships between them to take appropriate measures for disaster prevention applications. In this paper, we, therefore, obtain and discuss the empirical attenuation relationships using the same functional forms for the three types of velocity response spectra computed from observed strong motion records from moderate to large earthquakes in relation to JMA magnitude, hypocentral distance, sediment depths, and AVS30 as predictor variables at periods between 1 and 10 s for 1 and 5% damping ratios. Our preliminary analyses show that the pseudo and absolute velocity response spectra scale almost identically to the predictor variables while the relative velocity response spectra scale differently. It is manifested that the difference at a site is dependent on magnitude, distance, and periods.",

            "abstract": "The analyses of the annually laminated lacustrine sediments are particularly important in the studies of global climate change. They provide information about the ecosystem response to environmental and climate changes. The condition for the laminated sedimentation with the annual resolution is a calm sedimentation environment where there is no mixing and thus there are anaerobic conditions in the benthic zone. Below a certain depth there is no wave induced mixing and temperature is constant, which causes water stagnation. In shallower areas such conditions are favoured by the morphology of the lake basin and the long presence of ice cover (bradymictic). The combination of these environmental features predispose to the deposition of laminated sediments. Lake Czechowskie is located within the limit of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Last Glaciation in the Central European Lowland (northern Poland – 53°52”N 18°14”E) in a deep kettle-hole type. Taking into account the thickness of the lacustrine sediments, the maximum depth of the basin exceeds 70 m. Detailed surveying as well as geological drilling using the GIS techniques made it possible to reconstruct the morphology of the basin of Lake Czechowskie and its adjacent areas before the biogenic sedimentation started in Allerød. At that time water level was 2 m higher than in the modern times. Following climate changes initiated the natural processes of the lake basin transformation. The analysis of the morphology of the lake basin is the basis for modelling the sedimentation conditions considering, inter alia, the wind direction and wind velocity, fluctuations of the water levels and the degree of filling the basin with the deposits in different periods of the Late Glacial and Holocene. It allows specifying the variability and sedimentation rate within the basin. The analysis shows the spatial variation of the erosion and accumulation zones, and enables to determine the zones of calm sedimentation revealing places particularly predisposed to accumulate annually laminated lacustrine sediments.

            "abstract": "The presence of long-range memory (LRM) in climatic records is well documented in the geophysics literature. The power spectral density (PSD) of LRM time series follows a power law; limf→0 S(f) ∝ f−β, where 0 < β < 3. An uncorrelated white noise has β=0, while a typical model for an LRM stochastic process is the persistent fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). This is a stationary process with 0 < β < 1. The cumulative integral (or sum) of such a process has the PSD of the form S(f) ∼ f−β, but with β→β+2. Such a process with 1<β<3 is a non-stationary LRM process called a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The power-law behavour of the PSD indicates the absence of a characteristic scale in the time record; the record is scale-invariant or just scaling. For this reason, β is often referred to as the scaling exponent.\nTime series from the Holocene and from the last glacial period are extracted from ice cores from Greenland and from Antarctica. The scaling exponent β is then estimated for each time period separately by using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. For the Holocene period, we find (β ≈ 0 for time scales < 103 years for both the GRIP and EPICA ice core, and β ≈ 0.8 for longer time scales. We suggest that the scale break at 103 years marks a transition between fluctuations dominated by local/regional variability to fluctuations on time scales dominated by global variability. For the last glacial period, the results are different for the individual cores and also different from the Holocene climate. For GRIP we find β ≈ 1.5 for time scales longer than 102 years, while the Dansgaard-Oeschger events most likely affect the power spectrum on shorter time scales. For EPICA we find β ≈ 0.6 for time scales 102 < τ < 103 years, and β ≈ 1.8 in the range 103 < τ < 104 years. From this study, we suggest that the scaling properties of glacial and interglacial climate are different, so that long, paleoclimate time series combining the two climate conditions should be divided into sequences before studying the scaling and drawing conclusions about a specific period such as the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The weathering of mantle peridotite tectonically exposed to the atmosphere leads commonly to natural carbonation processes. Extensive cryptocrystalline magnesite veins and stock-work are widespread in the serpentinite sole of the New Caledonia ophiolite. Silica is systematically associated with magnesite. It is commonly admitted that Mg and Si are released during the laterization of overlying peridotites. Thus, the occurrence of these veins is generally attributed to a per descensum mechanism that involves the infiltration of meteoric waters enriched in dissolved atmospheric CO2. In this study, we investigate serpentinite carbonation processes, and related silicification, based on a detailed petrographic and crystal chemical study of serpentinites. The relationships between serpentine and alteration products are described using an original method for the analysis of micro-X-ray fluorescence images performed at the centimeter scale. Our investigations highlight a carbonation mechanism, together with precipitation of amorphous silica and sepiolite, based on a dissolution–precipitation process. In contrast with the per descensum Mg/Si-enrichment model that is mainly concentrated in rock fractures, dissolution–precipitation process is much more pervasive. Thus, although the texture of rocks remains relatively preserved, this process extends more widely into the rock and may represent a major part of total carbonation of the ophiolite.",

            "abstract": "Geophysics is a wonderfully diverse field of study, encompassing a variety of disciplines greatly different from one other. Even within the same discipline, various branches of study can have drastically different vocabulary and methodologies. The difficulty of breaking this \"jargon\" barrier is also an important reminder for scientists of how critical it is to clearly and concisely convey information. This presentation will focus on strategies that students can focus on to ease a transition between fields in geophysics. I believe that a student changing disciplines should proceed in the following steps: [1] Do a cursory literature review to find a review paper of the desired topic and work backwards through the details until a level of understanding or recognition is reached, [2] Obtain a clear physical understanding of the data and methods of the proposed study, and [3] Establish a support network through the research group or elsewhere which will recognize the areas in which the student is behind and offer remedies in a supportive and productive manner. These strategies are based on my own personal experience changing from music to geophysics in my undergrad and working on projects spanning various subdisciplines of geophysics during my Masters and PhD. It is worthwhile for research groups to spend the time to mentor students switching from other disciplines because those students will in time be able to observe the research in a different way than their peers, and easily adapt to changes of direction within the research.",

            "abstract": "The simulation of subsurface mass and energy transfers often relies on specific codes that were mainly developed using compiled languages which usually ensure computational efficiency at the expense of relatively long development times and relatively rigid software. Even if a very detailed, possibly graphical, user-interface is developed the core numerical aspects are rarely accessible and the smallest modification will always need a compilation step. Thus, user-defined physical laws or alternative numerical schemes may be relatively difficult to use.\nOver the last decade, Python has emerged as a popular and widely used language in the scientific community. There already exist several libraries for the pre and post-treatment of input and output files for reservoir simulators (e.g. pytough). Development times in Python are considerably reduced compared to compiled languages, and programs can be easily interfaced with libraries written in compiled languages with several comprehensive numerical libraries that provide sequential and parallel solvers (e.g. PETSc, Trilinos…).\n The core objective of the Emerge project is to explore the possibility to develop a modeling environment in full Python. Consequently, we are developing an open python package with the classes/objects necessary to express, discretize and solve the physical problems encountered in the modeling of subsurface transfers. We heavily relied on Python to have a convenient and concise way of manipulating potentially complex concepts with a few lines of code and a high level of abstraction. Our result aims to be a friendly numerical environment targeting both numerical engineers and physicist or geoscientists with the possibility to quickly specify and handle geometries, arbitrary meshes, spatially or temporally varying properties, PDE formulations, boundary conditions…",

            "abstract": "Surface remobilization of mineral resources in cratons and shields may essentially be investigated through the study of regolith production and mobility at various scales in the landscape. This provides tools for exploration but also constrains the sediment routing system at the source of many passive margins. Here we develop a regolith mapping protocol at the scale of Southwestern Burkina Faso, which exposes mineralized Paleoproterozoic granite-greenstone terrains and their Neoproterozoic sandstone cover. Mapping is based on a combination of field survey and the interpretation of radiometric data, satellite images and digital topography. The best preserved lateritic regolith unit with clear-cut and unambiguous characteristics are ferricrete capping plateau relicts of a pediment surface called the High glacis, which developed throughout West Africa between ca. 24 and 11 my ago. Topographic reconstruction at 11 Ma based on the distribution of High glacis relicts was used to quantify landscape evolution. Results show that the modern drainage was mostly established at 11 Ma. The initial geometry and dissection of the High glacis slopes were then influenced by their position with respect to watersheds and lithology, impacting the different scales of redistribution in the area. By subtracting the current DEM to the High glacis topography, post-11 Ma denudation is calibrated between 0 and 8 m/my with a very low average (2 m/my). Such regime corresponds to a cratonic background ‘noise’ that is weathering-limited. Results also suggest a minimum timescale in the order of 20 my for resurfacing the landscape, providing new constraints for modelling both the sediment routing system and the surface remobilization of mineralizations. Finally, using our findings, we identify two type-configurations where exploration strategies might be refined: one where High glacis relicts potentially mask mineralized units and one where surface index may originate from lateral remobilization.",

            "abstract": "Global environmental monitoring requires measurements from a variety of disparate sources (in situ probes, remote sensing and models) to be appropriately combined to generate complete gridded fields with quality commensurate with or better than that of each of the individual sources. To achieve this, unbiased characterisation of systematic errors (i.e., biases) and random errors (noise) are needed. Triple collocation analysis (TCA) enables unbiased estimation of their additive and multiplicative biases, and additive noise variance, conditional on the validity of an affine model that relates three coincident estimates. However this linearity assumption has yet been properly examined. Since the dynamics of a geophysical variable and its representations at variable supports are generally influenced by different physical processes operating at characteristic spatiotemporal scales, it may be conceivable to decompose its time series into multiple temporal scales for individual analyses. Here we propose a new analysis framework of combining TCA with wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis (MRA) to develop a time-scale dependent linear bias model, where the conventional TCA is its special case. We illustrate the applications of the new analysis on soil moisture observational and modelled data sets, without the loss of generality, in three areas: (1) characterization scale-dependent biases and noise; (2) investigation of the influence of conventional bias correction schemes on these biases and noise; and (3) implementation of a new scheme for multi-scale bias correction and nonlinear de-noising.",

            "abstract": "The shallow Torres del Paine Intrusive Complex (TPIC) belongs to a trench-parallel belt of igneous bodies in Southern Chile and Argentina. It is located in a transitional position between the Patagonia Batholith in the West, and the alkaline Cenozoic plateau lavas in the East. Volumetrically small amounts of magmatism started around 28 my ago in the Torres del Paine area. A second period occurred between 17-16 Ma, and igneous activity peaked with the TPIC 12.59-12.43 Ma ago. Finally, very minor magmatism occurred less than a million year ago. Intrusion depth, estimated based on contact metamorphic assemblages, decreased from ca. 10-12km at 17 Ma to ca. 3km at 12.5 Ma, the latter depth corresponding well with hornblende thermobarometry in mafic rocks and the water saturated granite solidus compositions observed.\nThe TPIC is composed of a granitic laccolith emplaced over 90ka (1) in 3 several 100m thick sheets, forming an overall thickness of nearly 2 km. The granitic laccolith is under-plated by a ca. 400m thick mafic laccolith, built up over 50ka (2), constructed bottom up. Each sheet is itself composed of a multitude (>10) of metric to decametric pulses with mostly ductile contacts, resulting in outcrop patterns resembling braided stream sediments.\nThermal modeling of the contact metamorphism, including heat of crystallization and the enthalpy of metamorphic reactions constrains the granite intrusion temperature to ca. 1000°C. Peak metamorphic temperatures suggest that intrusion of magma had to occur in a rapid succession of pulses, preferentially along the granite-host rock contact. Enthalpy released due to hydration of the biotite and feldspar of the immature sediments in the outer aureole contributed significantly to the far-field temperatures in the host-rock.\nNumerical crystal growth models matching the crystal size distribution indicate significant overstepping during onset of the contact metamorphic reactions. Nevertheless, sharp isogrades are predicted by the models at peak temperatures close to T-estimates obtained from phase equilibrium.\n(1) Michel, J et al.

Most of the currently employed procedures on BCSD primarily consider a univariate approach by developing a statistical relationship between large-scale precipitation/temperature with the local-scale precipitation/temperature ignoring the interdependency between the two variables. In this study, an asynchronous Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) approach is proposed for downscaling multiple climatic variables by preserving the temporal correlations among them. The method was first applied on historical runs of climate model inter-comparison project-5 (CMIP5) for the period 1951-1999 and compared with bias corrected dataset using univariate approach from Bureau of Reclamation. Further, the method was applied on decadal runs of CMIP5 models and compared with univariate asynchronous regression results. A metric, fraction bias was defined, and distribution of fraction bias from ensemble was considered for comparing with univariate approach. CCA relatively performs better in preserving the cross-correlation at grids where observed cross correlations are significant, while reducing fraction biases in mean and standard deviation.",

In coastal areas, an emerging problem is ocean acidicification due to eutrophication resulting from human activities. The coastal water of Bolinao, Pangasinan, Philippines has become eutrophic due to increased nutrient loading from unconsumed fish feeds in fish cages. Mariculture is a big industry in Bolinao. In over a decade, the area has experienced decreased oxygen levels leading to hypoxia, fish kills, and algal blooms. The decomposition of organic matter from unconsumed fish feeds results not only to high nutrient buildup but also increased CO2 and acidity in the area. Nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate), total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), aragonite saturation state (Ωarg) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) were measured to determine the combined effect of acidification and eutrophication in Bolinao. Monitoring results have shown an increase in nutrients by 30% to 70% in over a decade. Stratified water during rainy season have resulted in low DO (<5.5) and acidic water (<7.5) with high pCO2 level (>900 µatm). Shallow stations with poor water circulation have shown undersaturated aragonite state (< 2.0) and high pCO2 levels of 800 matm. The eutrophic and acidified coastal waters of Bolinao are already affecting the seagrass and coral reef ecosystems in the area.",

The chemistry, especially Cr/(Cr+Al) ratio and Mg/(Me+Fe2+) ratio, is well known index of degree of melting of the mantle source. The chromitite composed of high density of spinel is explained as a reaction product between different degrees of fractionation of basaltic melts (Arai and Yurimoto, 1994). Therefore, tracing spinel chemistry helps to reveal complex processes of the petrogenesis.\nContrary to its common occurrence in ophiolites, there are few chromitite samples reported from the ocean floor, although spinel are very common mineral in the mafic and ultramafic samples. A chromitite “minipod” included in a troctolite with a hybrid origin of melt-impregnated dunite was reported from Hess Deep at the junction of East Pacific Rise and Galapagos Rift (Site 895, ODP Leg 147; Arai and Matsukage, 1996). A Spinel-rich seam (2-3 cm thick) in dunite at Atlantis Bank, Southwestern Indian Ridge was sampled during a dive investigation using by the manned submersible Shinkai 6500 (Morishita et al., 2007) and some dredged samples (Payot et al., 2014). A few samples are reported from Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Site 1271 during ODP Leg 209 (Abe, 2011). Some of them show high temperature metamorphism up to the mid-amphibolite facies. Here shows the comparison of chromitites and spinel in the different ocean and will be assumed the petrogenesis.",

El Niño conditions are thought to lead to anomalously warm global average surface temperature, absent other forcings. Recent research has identified distinct possible types or flavours of El Niño events, based on the location of peak sea surface temperature anomalies and other variables. Here we analyze the relationship between the type of El Niño event and the global surface average temperature anomaly, using three historical temperature data sets. Separating El Niño events into types or flavours reveals that the global average surface temperatures are anomalously warm during and after canonical eastern Pacific El Niño events or \"super\" El Ninos. However, the global average surface temperatures during and after central Pacific or \"mixed\" events, like the 2002-3 event, are not statistically distinct from that of neutral or other years. Historical analysis indicated that slowdowns in the rate of global surface warming since the late 1800s may be related to decadal variability in the frequency of different types of El Niño events.",

            "abstract": "Folded structures in the tropopause, so-called tropopause folds, are intimately linked to upper-level frontogenesis and jet-stream dynamics. They play an important role for stratosphere-troposphere exchange, the dynamical coupling of upper- and lower troposphere, and can be important for generating severe weather events. Together with the filamentation and roll-up of streamers and the formation of cut-off lows, tropopause folds are a prime example for the complex dynamical structure of the UTLS on time scales from hours to days. For case studies, in-situ data or detailed manual analysis of model output often allow for an unambiguous identification of the tropopause. Obtaining a global, long-term perspective of this phenomenon, however, requires an automated and objective identification method. We present an elaborated three-dimensional labelling algorithm, based on an isosurface of potential vorticity (PV), that allows to objectively separate stratospheric and tropospheric air in complex situations in polar regions and in situations with diabatically and/or frictionally generated PV anomalies typically found near extratropical cyclones. We apply this algorithm to the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set from 1979 to 2012 to compile a robust global climatology of tropopause folds. We present geographical and seasonal distributions of fold frequencies for three classes of folds as defined by their vertical extent (shallow, medium and deep). Typical synoptic situations associated with deep tropopause folds like cyclonically curved jets are discussed and we investigate their potential impact on extreme weather events. For example, the frequency of wind speed extremes at 700 hPa is in many areas significantly higher if a tropopause fold is present.",

            "abstract": "Lack of observations for the full range of required variables is a critical reason why many cryosphere-dominated hydrological modelling studies adopt a temperature index (degree day) approach to meltwater simulation rather than resolving the full surface energy balance. Thus spatial observations of \"degree days\" would be extremely useful in constraining model parameterisations. Even for models implementing a full energy balance, \"degree day\" observations provide a characterisation of the spatial distribution of climate inputs to the cryosphere-hydrological system.\nThis study derives \"degree days\" for the Upper Indus Basin by merging remote sensing data products: snow cover duration (SCD), from MOD10A1 and land surface temperature (LST), from MOD11A1 and MYD11A1. Pixel-wise “degree days” are calculated, at imagery-dependent spatial resolution, by multiplying SCD by (above-freezing) daily LST. This is coherent with the snowpack-energy-to-runoff conversion used in temperature index algorithms. This allows assessment of the spatial variability of mass inputs (accumulated snowpack) because in nival regime areas – where complete ablation is regularly achieved – mass is the limiting constraint. The GLIMS Randolph Glacier Inventory is used to compare annual totals and seasonal timings of “degree days” over glaciated and nival zones. Terrain-classified statistics (by elevation and aspect) for the MODIS “degree-day” hybrid product are calculated to characterise of spatial precipitation distribution.\nWhile MODIS data products provide detailed spatial resolution relative to tributary catchment areas, the limited instrument record length is inadequate for assessing climatic trends and greatly limits use for hydrological model calibration and validation. While multi-decadal MODIS equivalent data products may be developed in the coming years, at present alternative methods are required for “degree day” trend analysis. This study thus investigates the use of the hybrid MODIS “degree day” product to downscale an ensemble of modern global meteorological reanalyses including ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, NASA MERRA and JRA-55 which overlap MODIS instrument record. This downscaling feasibility assessment is a prerequisite to applying the method to regional climate projections.",

Studies suggest that topography plays an important role in steering these jets and setting the location of enhanced eddy activity, which has important implications for the meridional transport of tracers such as heat and nutrients across the jets. We have yet to identify the dominant processes and factors that set the intensity and distribution of eddy activity and the horizontal eddy mixing in the vicinity of topography. Understanding the physical processes governing these eddy effects will reveal the dependence of eddy mixing on key parameters, allowing prediction of future changes and development of physically-based eddy parameterizations.\nWe report on a theoretical study that investigates the effects of jet-topography interactions on jet-eddy dynamics and the mixing of tracers. We use a quasigeostrophic model of a zonally-evolving unstable jet impinging on topography in a configuration relevant to an Antarctic Circumpolar Current frontal jet. We examine the spatial patterns of surface eddy kinetic energy and irreversible mixing of tracers relative to the topography and the zonally-evolving jet structure. We explore their dependence on system parameters such as topography height, stratification and inflowing jet stability.\nThis study highlights the changes in eddy effects caused by the introduction of topography, with a particular focus on the along-stream variations. It also suggests the influence of topography is not necessarily limited to the downstream region. This study will help improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying jet-eddy-topography interactions and their representation in ocean models.",

            "abstract": "The chronology of the first Dome Fuji deep ice core (80,000-340,000 yr BP) was established by orbital tuning of measured O2/N2 ratios in trapped air to the past local summer insolation at the drill site (Kawamura et al., 2007). The O2/N2 ratios found in ice cores are generally lower than atmospheric ratio because of size-dependent molecular fractionation during bubble close-off. The magnitude of this gas fractionation appears to be influenced by snow metamorphism when the layer was originally at the surface, which in turn is controlled by local summer insolation (Fujita et al., 2009). The O2/N2 record has little 100,000-yr periodicity (strongest in climatic records), suggesting insignificant climatic influence in the orbital tuning. Agreement of the O2/N2 chronology with U-Th radiometric chronology of speleothems (within ~2000 yr) suggests that O2/N2 and summer insolation are indeed in phase. However, it may not be common to all ice cores that O2/N2 signal only records local summer insolation. For example, the GISP2 ice core (Greenland) has clear imprint of abrupt climate changes in the O2/N2 record, indicating climatic (non-insolation) signal in the record and the possibility of phase variability of O2/N2 relative to the past insolation (Suwa and Bender, 2008).\nHere we present new O2/N2 record from the second Dome Fuji ice core with significant improvements in ice core storage practice and mass spectrometry. In particular, the ice core had been stored at about -50 ˚C until the air extraction except during transportations, which prevent fractionation due to gas loss during the core storage. The precision of the new O2/N2 data set is improved by a factor of 3 over the previous data, and we do not observe outliers (there were 15% outliers in the previous data). Clear imprint of local insolation is recognizable in the new O2/N2, which would enable us to generate a chronology with accuracy of ~2000 yr towards older periods. Samples from the first core after long storage (>10 yr) at -25 ˚C and -50 ˚C were measured as well, and the data show clear dependence of O2/N2 depletion on the storage temperature. We also plan to measure the NEEM ice core (Greenland) for the Eemian and the last glacial period in order to investigate the feasibility of O2/N2 tuning for the Greenland ice cores.",

For the purposes of this project it is important to correctly simulate the physical conditions under which super-critical CO2 will be present after injection into the host rock. This means that the LB model should be able to handle the pressures, densities, temperatures in deep geological media. A logical way of dealing with is is to combine a single-component LB model with and Equation of State (EOS) that describes the physical interrelations among pressure, temperature and density. Previously, we showed that the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS provides an excellent fit to super-critical conditions for the pure CO2 system. However, it is necessary to consider multi-component systems as the super-critical CO2 will be present with brines of varying salinity. A natural extension to the work under is to also treat the brine with an EOS. The brine will of be in a sub-critical state and it is therefore important to find an EOS that can faithfully match the physical conditions of brine between temperatures of 300 and 400K and pressures between 7 and 30 MPa. This study will present a number of EOS alternatives that attempt to correctly capture the density of the liquid branch of the water system for relevant temperatures and pressures. We will also propose modifications that allow us to deal with different brine concentrations and compare LB modeled interfacial tension and viscosity with published data. As a secondary objective we investigate whether it is possible to match water-vapor systems under ambient surface conditions relevant for vadose zone transport. Support: DOE DE-FG02-11ER16278",

As it is projected that the OMZ expand in future due to global warming there is an urgent need to understand the controlling mechanisms of nitrogen loss within these regions. However, most Earth system models (ESM) rather have a poor representation of nitrogen related processes, primarily focusing only on nitrate. This simplification of the nitrogen cycle could contribute to the common model bias of too large and too intense OMZ in most ESM.\nWe set up a more comprehensive marine N-cycle including interactions between nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and organic material in the water column and the sediments in the framework of the global biogeochemical ocean model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. We present a global marine nitrogen budget and discuss changes in the subsurface oxygen distributions.

Key to tackling this challenge is understanding how and why some cities transition to more sustainable water management; acknowledging that urban water resources decisions are both responding to and precipitating hydrologic change, this question is best tackled through a sociohydrology approach. While coupling of natural and societal systems is in it’s infancy in the field of hydrology, there is a strong tradition of studying coupled systems in the field of Socio-Ecological Systems. We build on Ostrom’s Socio-Ecological Systems framework to develop a system dynamics model of water management for the Las Vegas metropolitan area using Vensim. A key objective our proposed modeling framework is to illuminate the dynamic interactions of the sociohydrologic system components and enable testing of various assumptions and strategies.\nThe model of Las Vegas water management consists of five sub-modules: water supply, water demand, finances, public perception and policy making process. The development of the first three modules were based on clearly defined system structure. The public perception sub-module tracks the level public risk perception of a water supply shortage and represents the hypothesis that public risk perception is updated periodically when shortage events are experienced. The policy making process module uses an algorithm capturing the hypothesized decision making process to select policy actions (or in-action) from a set of feasible actions in response to the system states tracked by the model and observable to decision makers.\nThe model was tested and parameterized using mix of quantitative data on water demands, supplies and costs and qualitative data from document analysis and interview data covering 1990 to 2010 period. Given that not only the parameters but also the structure of the public perception and the policy making process sub-systems is contested, a different approach must be taken to assess the robustness of these modules. Presented here is the development of the model, results of model testing against the historic reference modes using Las Vegas as an example, and future work planned to improve the robustness of the model.",

            "abstract": "The behaviour of volatiles within a volcanic system can tell us about melt storage depths, melt evolution, and degassing processes. It is therefore important to be able to quantify the amount of each volatile species entering the system. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions can provide compositions of the primitive mantle melt entering volcanic systems. In some cases they have been unaffected by processes such as melt mixing, fractional crystallisation and degassing; so chemical variations are source signatures. With the knowledge that volatiles behave as very incompatible elements, and with measured volatile/trace-element ratios, we can estimate volatile concentrations within the Icelandic mantle source.\nAbundances of CO2, H2O, Cl, F, S and trace elements have been measured by SIMS for over 100 olivine-hosted (Fo87.8-88.6) melt inclusions from Kistufell, a monogenic subglacial eruption known to have elevated 3He/4He (15.5 R/Ra)[1] and situated above the inferred locus of the Icelandic mantle plume. H2O concentrations in the melt inclusions are near uniform and similar to that of the carrier glass (0.10-0.15 wt%), likely due to diffusive equilibration through the olivine host at low pressure. CO2 shows more variation, ranging from 1200 to 0ppm, probably from a combination of melt heterogeneity and degassing. The majority of melt inclusions are incompatible trace element-depleted (La/Yb = 1.3), indicating that they were probably generated by high fraction melting of a depleted source in the shallow mantle. The CO2/Nb ratio of this source mantle is ~308, very similar to that of Borgarhraun, ~314[2], which has a lower 3He/4He ratio (12.2 R/Ra)[3]. This CO2/Nb ratio, along with H2O/Ce ~200 and F/Nd ~18, are consistent with other measured melt inclusion suites from Iceland, suggesting limited volatile/trace-element ratio variation within the Icelandic depleted melt source. By analysing more eruptions across Iceland, we hope to identify any spatial variations in volatile/trace-element ratios within the Icelandic mantle.\n[1] K. Breddam (2002) J.

            "abstract": "After the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, intelligent visualization of seismic information is becoming important to understand the earthquake phenomena. On the other hand, to date, the quantity of seismic data becomes enormous as a progress of high accuracy observation network; we need to treat many parameters (e.g., positional information, origin time, magnitude, etc.) to efficiently display the seismic information. Therefore, high-speed processing of data and image information is necessary to handle enormous amounts of seismic data.\nRecently, GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) is used as an acceleration tool for data processing and calculation in various study fields. This movement is called GPGPU (General Purpose computing on GPUs). In the last few years the performance of GPU keeps on improving rapidly. GPU computing gives us the high-performance computing environment at a lower cost than before.\nMoreover, use of GPU has an advantage of visualization of processed data, because GPU is originally architecture for graphics processing. In the GPU computing, the processed data is always stored in the video memory. Therefore, we can directly write drawing information to the VRAM on the video card by combining CUDA and the graphics API.\nIn this study, we employ CUDA and OpenGL and/or DirectX to realize full-GPU implementation. This method makes it possible to write drawing information to the VRAM on the video card without PCIe bus data transfer: It enables the high-speed processing of seismic data. The present study examines the GPU computing-based high-speed visualization and the feasibility for high-speed visualization system of hypocenter data.",

            "abstract": "Stationary or low-frequency Rossby waves are the primary drivers of midlatitude weather on monthly and longer timescales. They take the form of blocking highs which can lead to droughts downstream or persistent extratropical lows which guide storms into the coastal midlatitudes. We investigate the stationary Rossby wave response to topography and ocean heating in an idealized GCM, simulating a wide range of climates by varying the longwave optical depth. The stationary Rossby wave response to warming depends on the latitude and type of forcing. We find that the primary mechanism of change is in the downstream propagation of energy which is well described by linear wave theory and thus depends primarily on the structure of the zonal mean jet. For example, as the tropopause height increases allowing the jet to get stronger with warming, the stationary wavenumber decreases, leading to, among other things, an expansion of dry zones associated with stationary wave subsidence. Additionally, as the easterlies expand, the influence of extratropical stationary wave sources is no longer as prominent in the subtropics. Deviations from these linear responses are examined in terms of the vorticity budget. Nonlinear effects remain secondary to linear theory throughout the range of climates. We compare these results with the stationary wave response in the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario.",

However, recent simulation results indicate that wind turbines increase evaporation rates from the nearby land. In this research the effect of wind energy on irrigated agriculture is determined using a Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (SEBAL) on Landsat data spanning a 30 year interval. The analysis allows the characterization of evapotranspiration (ET) before and after wind turbine installations. The time history of ET from Landsat data will be presented for several major wind farms across the US. These data will be used to determine the impact on water demand due to presence of wind turbines.",

            "abstract": "While it is well known that the ocean is one of the most important components of the climate system, with a heat capacity 1100 times greater than the atmosphere, the ocean is also the primary reservoir for freshwater transport to the atmosphere and largest component of the global water cycle. Two new satellite sensors, the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the NASA Aquarius SAC-D missions are now providing the first space borne measurements of the sea surface salinity (SSS). In this talk, we will present examples demonstrating how SMOS-derived SSS data are being used to better characterize key land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interaction processes that occur within the marine hydrological cycle. In particular, we shall illustrate how SMOS and its ocean mapping capability provides observations across the world’s largest tropical ocean fresh pool regions and we will discuss intra-seasonal to interannual precipitation impacts as well as large-scale river runoff from the Amazon-Orinoco and Congo rivers and its offshore advection. Synergistic multi-satellite analyses of these new surface salinity data sets combined with sea surface temperature, dynamical height and currents from altimetry, surface wind, ocean color, rainfall estimates, and in situ observations will be shown to yield new freshwater budget and ocean circulation insight. Examples of SMOS capabilities of monitoring salt exchanges across the Gulf Stream through meso-scale eddies will be provided. SSS observations from the SMOS and Aquarius/SAC-D sensors are combined to examine the response of the upper ocean to tropical cyclone passage including the potential role that a freshwater-induced upper ocean barrier layer may play in modulating surface cooling and enthalpy flux in tropical cyclone track regions.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that recent studies focus on the impact of soil moisture on climate and especially land-energy feedbacks, groundwater dynamics are often neglected or conceptual groundwater flow models are used. In particular, in the context of climate change and the occurrence of droughts and floods, a better understanding and an improved simulation of the physical processes involving groundwater on continental scales is necessary. This requires the implementation of a physically consistent terrestrial modeling system, which explicitly incorporates groundwater dynamics and the connection with shallow soil moisture. Such a physics-based system enables simulations and monitoring of groundwater storage and enhanced representations of the terrestrial energy and hydrologic cycles over long time periods. On shorter timescales, the prediction of groundwater-related extremes, such as floods and droughts, are expected to improve, because of the improved simulation of components of the hydrological cycle.\nIn this study, we present a fully coupled aquifer-to-atmosphere modeling system over the European CORDEX domain. The integrated Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform, TerrSysMP, consisting of the three-dimensional subsurface model ParFlow, the Community Land Model CLM3.5 and the numerical weather prediction model COSMO of the German Weather Service, is used. The system is set up with a spatial resolution of 0.11° (12.5km) and closes the terrestrial water and energy cycles from aquifers into the atmosphere. Here, simulations of the fully coupled system are performed over events, such as the 2013 flood in Central Europe and the 2003 European heat wave, and over extended time periods on the order of 10 years. State and flux variables of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycle are analyzed and compared to both in situ (e.g. stream and water level gauge networks, FLUXNET) and remotely sensed observations (e.g. GRACE, ESA ICC ECV soil moisture and SMOS). Additionally, the presented modeling system may be useful in the assessment of groundwater-related uncertainties in virtual reality and scenario simulations.",

COTM was selected for study owing to similarities with volcanic features observed on the Moon, Mars and Vesta. The COTM basaltic lava fields emanate from an 80 km long rift zone where at least eight eruptive episodes, occurring 15,000 to 2,000 BP, have created an expansive volcanic field covering an area of approximately 1,650 km2. This polygenetic volcanic field hosts a diverse collection of basaltic volcanic edifices such as phreatic explosion craters, eruptive fissures, cinder cones, spatter cones, shield volcanoes and expansive lava flows.\nEngineering challenges and high cost limit the number of robotic and human field investigations of planetary bodies and, due to these constraints, exhaustive remote sensing investigations of planetary surface properties are undertaken prior to field deployment. This creates an unavoidable dependence upon remote sensing, a critical difference between field investigations of planetary bodies and most terrestrial field investigations. Studies of this nature have utility in terrestrial investigations as they can help link spatially encompassing datasets and conserve field resources.\nWe present preliminary results utilizing Earth orbital datasets to determine the efficacy of products derived from remotely sensed data when compared to geologic field observations. Multispectral imaging data (ASTER, AVIRIS, TIMS) collected at a range of spatial and spectral resolutions are paired with high resolution imagery from both orbit and unmanned aircraft systems. This enables the creation of derived products detailing morphology, compositional variation, mineralogy, relative age and vegetation. The surface morphology of flows within COTM differs from flow to flow and observations of these properties can aid in determining the driving mechanisms. The entirety of the COTM volcanic field is the target of this investigation although areas of interest have been selected for more focused investigation to support planned and ongoing field investigations at Highway A’a flow, North Crater cinder cone and King’s Bowl phreatic explosion crater and flow.",

            "abstract": "To quantify different dispersion phenomena affecting solute transport in a watershed may be difficult because the governing mechanisms responsible for the concentration fluctuations span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Heterogeneities along and between transport pathways together with the fact that dispersive processes often occur on different spatial and temporal scales generally require complex explanatory models. Here we propose a novel methodology that includes a spectral decomposition of the watershed solute response using a distributed solute transport model with spatially variable parameters applied to the network of transport pathways in surface and sub-surface water. Closed-form solutions of the transport problem in both the Laplace and Fourier domains are used to derive formal expressions of: I) the central temporal moments of a solute pulse response, and II) the power spectral response of a solute concentration time series. The latter attributes the watershed’s solute response in specific intervals of frequencies to governing processes and spatial regions within the watershed. From a set of high-frequency long-term hydrochemical data collected in Upper Hafren, Wales, we observed a systematic damping of the solute concentration in the output signal compared with the input signal. Further, we linked the watershed dispersion mechanisms to the damping of the concentration fluctuations in selected frequency intervals reflecting various environments responsible for the damping. Thus, the estimates of the same model parameters differ between the pathways contributing to different concentration fluctuations, and the specific findings include a 100 times greater typical transit time of chloride and a 3 times greater retardation of sodium for the lowest frequency fluctuations of the concentration time series compared with the highest frequency fluctuations. The frequency-dependent parameters indicate that different environments dominate the response at different temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "Both Beryllium-7 (Be-7) and Tritium (H-3) are produced by cosmic ray interactions in upper atmosphere by spallation reactions. We investigated these nuclides in rainwater along with sodium concentration in the region of Deajeon, Korea (36.32°N, 127.41°E) for 7 months during 2007 and 2008. The results of our study demonstrate that Be-7 in rainwater is inversely propotional to the amount of sodium, proportional to the amount of rainwater and air mixing of the stratosphere in sping. Both isotopes show their peaks during fall and spring seasons. The trend of H-3 variation is shifted about a month compared to that of Be-7. This could be due to the different residence time between H-3 and Be-7 in the atmosphere. The detection efficiency of uncorrected Be-7 concentrations in this area ranged from 0.06 to 14.13 Bq/L which is lower than the reference values of New Zealand (0.5 ~ 4.3 x 107 (atoms/kg rain)) and Japan. The H-3 concentrations of this study ranged from 4.8±0.10 and 18.6±0.3 (TU). This range is well compared to the H-3 concentration of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, sodium variation of the rainwater is found to be inversely proportaional to Be-7 concentrations. This could be associated with air mixing phenomenon involved in the movement of salt in land of Korea. This presentation demonstrates details in both chemistry and data analysis along with other previously published data. This study will provide reference values of Be-7 for the Korean region and will guide a prospective geolgical application associated with atmospheric cosmogenic nuclide production.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is the most abundant sulfur gas in the troposphere with a global averaging mixing ratio of about 500 part per trillion (ppt). The ocean is the primary source of OCS, emitting OCS directly or its precursors, carbon disulfide and dimethyl sulfide. The most important atmospheric sink of OCS is uptake by terrestrial plants via photosynthesis. Although the global budget of atmospheric OCS has been studied, the global integrated OCS fluxes have large uncertainties, e.g. the uncertainties of the ocean fluxes are as large as 100% or more and a large missing ocean sources required to balance the global budgets.\nA first tropical ocean map of the free tropospheric OCS has been developed using retrieval data from radiance measurements from the AURA Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES). The monthly mean ocean data has been evaluated to estimate the biases and uncertainties in the TES OCS against aircraft profiles from the HIPPO campaign and ground data from the NOAA Mauna Loa site. We found the TES OCS data to be consistent (within the calculated uncertainties) with NOAA ground observations and HIPPO aircraft measurements and it captured the seasonal and latitudinal variations observed by these in situ data within the estimated uncertainties.\nIn this study, we first update bottom-up estimate of global source and sinks of atmospheric OCS. The global forward simulations of atmospheric OCS using updated bottom-up fluxes with GEOS-Chem show improvement of the seasonal variation over multiple NOAA ground stations in both north and south hemispheres. Inverse analysis of surface fluxes from TES OCS data will provide further constraints to estimate the missing ocean source and understand the enhanced OCS over eastern Asia and west Pacific, which could be driven by wind, Asian outflow, a mystery process, or a combination of all of the above.\nThe investigation will provide the fundamental measurements and analysis needed to estimate the missing source in the sulfur cycle and provide the framework for extending the TES algorithm to land retrievals, which can be used directly in studies of carbon-climate feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "A very important component to achieve sustainable development in the energy sector is the improvement of energy efficiency of widely applied thermodynamic processes. Evaluation and optimization methods of energy processes play a crucial role in fulfilling this goal. A suitable method for the evaluation and optimization of energy conversion systems has been proven to be the exergetic analysis.\nIn this work, two parabolic trough solar thermal power plants are simulated in detail using commercial software, and they are further analysed and compared using an exergetic analysis. The first plant uses a thermal fluid to produce the steam required in a steam generator, while the second one produces the steam directly in the solar field. The analysis involves the evaluation of the individual components of the power plants, as well as the performance evaluation of the overall structures. The main goal is to detect thermodynamic inefficiencies of the two different configurations and propose measures to minimize those.\nWe find that the two examined plants have similar main sources of exergy destruction: the solar field (parabolic trough solar collectors), followed by the steam generator. This reveals the importance of an optimal design of these particular components, which could reduce inefficiencies present in the system. The differences in the exergy destruction and exergetic efficiencies of individual components of the two plants are analyzed in detail based on comparable operational conditions.",

            "abstract": "To monitoring of active volcanoes the systematic acquisition of medium/high resolution thermal data and the subsequent analysis of time series may improve the capability to detect small surface temperature variation related to changes in volcanic activity level and contribute to the early warning systems. Examples on the processing of long time series based EO data of Mt Etna activity and Phlegraean Fields observation by using remote sensing techniques and at different spatial resolution data (ASTER - 90mt, AVHRR -1km, MODIS-1km, MSG SEVIRI-3km) are showed.\nThe use of TIR sensors with high spatial resolution offers the possibility to obtain detailed information on the areas where there are significant changes, detecting variation in fumaroles fields and summit craters before eruptions. Thanks to ASTER thermal infrared (TIR, 5 bands) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum we have obtained the surface temperature map on the volcano area. For this study we have considered the ASTER’s night observations that show well defined episodes of increasing thermal emission of crater thanks to a more uniform background temperature.\nTwo different procedures are shown, both using the TIR high spatial resolution data: for Phlegraean Fields (active but quiescent volcano) the analysis of time series of surface temperature which may improve the capability to detect small surface temperature variation related to changes in volcanic activity level; for Mt. Etna (active volcano) a semi-automatic procedure which extract the summit area radiance values with the goal of detecting variation related to eruptive events.\nThe advantage of direct download of EO data by means INGV antennas even though low spatial resolution offers the possibility of a systematic data processing having a daily updating of information for prompt response and hazard mitigation. At the same time the comparison of surface temperature retrievals at different scale is an important issue for future satellite sensors.",

            "abstract": "Low frequency radioastronomy observatories for the heliosphere have been using similar instrumentation for decades. The Cassini, STEREO, and the future Solar Orbiter mission are embarking goniopolarmetric radio receiver connected to 3 electric wire antennas. Such instrument provides the spectral matrix (or part of it) from which the wave parameters can be derived. They require a point source assumption (plane wave) to derive the direction of arrival of the wave, the polarization and the flux density. In case of a spatially extended source (disk shaped, with a given radial profile), the source centroid direction and the apparent source size can also be derived. This type of instrumentation cannot provide much more parameters, as there is a maximum of to 9 independent measurements for each time-frequency step (i.e. an instantaneous set of measurements). Radio maps can be produced a posteriori combining consecutive data at the cost of averaging out small scale temporal variations. Furthermore, these inversion do not allow solving for several sources, or for complex source geometry.\nWe present a concept of radioastronomy instrumentation using a swarm of small satellites (possibly cubesats) with sensitive radio receivers measuring the wave front and phase of the radio waves on each spacecraft. This instrument will also provide 3-dimensional interferometric measurement from which real imaging capabilities will arise, as it is now occurring on ground at frequencies above 15 MHz, with the LOFAR interferometer in Europe, or the LWA in teh USA. The proposed concept will be very complementary to these instruments, as they will be orepating from a few kHz to a few 10 Mhz from space, and thus not affected by the ionospheric cutoff at 10 MHz.\nSuch resolved imaging capabilities of the inner heliosphere would be a real step forward to better understand the radio emissions mechanisms and the energetic at the orgin of the radio sources, as well as the propagation processes. We will present the various existing projects and the roadmap to reach this goal.",

In this study, the newly developed Chukchi-Beaufort High-resolution Atmospheric Reanalysis (CBHAR) is used to analyze the relations between surface wind, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea ice coverage in the Chukchi-Beaufort Seas. Our analysis focuses on September and October when both open water and sea ice are present with comparable percentages of the coverage. The results indicate a significant negative correlation occurring for open water or open water dominated areas and a positive correlation over consolidated sea ice covered areas among the relations between surface wind and SST.

Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) transport large amounts of water vapor and can lead to major flooding evens when they make land fall. Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is defined as the amount of liquid water that would be produced if all of the water vapor in an atmospheric column were condensed and is a useful parameter to determine atmospheric stability and the probability of convection and severe weather. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the NASA Aqua satellite was the first of a new generation of satellite sensors that provided the capability to retrieve water vapor profiles at high vertical resolution and good absolute accuracy over both ocean and land areas using the same algorithm. The operational follow-on to the AIRS is the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) successfully launched on the Suomi NPP satellite on 28 October 2011. The CrIS, along with ATMS, will provide the U.S. component of the joint U.S./European operational weather satellite system. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) was launched on METOP-A in October 2006 and is currently operated by EUMETSAT. This paper investigates the ability of PWV from IR sounders to capture ARs. Results are presented that highlight the extreme moisture transport from ARs during case-study flooding events. Differences and agreements between satellite retrievals and NWP reanalysis will identified.",

            "abstract": "Mt. Somma-Vesuvius Plinian eruptions were first described by Pliny the younger in 79 AD during the infamous eruption that destroyed Pompeii. Today, such eruptions are still a concern to the nearly 3 million people living in the Naples metropolitan area. Understanding the source for Mt. Somma-Vesuvius magma and the coexisting volatile phase is vital to better constrain the long-term eruptive behavior of this volcano.\nIn the present study, ~ 50 olivine phenocrysts were selected from lavas and pumices produced during mild effusive events referred to as inter-Plinian eruptions, and from highly explosive Plinian eruptions that occurred at Mt. Somma-Vesuvius between 33000 ka and 1631 AD. Selected olivine phenocrysts containing MI were examined petrographically and analyzed for Fo content. Fo varies from 69 to 73 mole% for inter-Plinian olivine crystals and from 84 to 90 mole% with one zoned olivine containing 76-81 mole% Fo, for Plinian olivine crystals. Investigated MI vary from slightly crystallized to highly crystallized.\nSelected crystallized MI were reheated using the Vernadsky stage, and quenched to a homogeneous glass (Group 1) or glass plus a vapor bubble (Group 2). On one hand, MI of Group 1 are hosted in olivine ranging from Fo72 to Fo76 and were all erupted from the Pompeii eruption (white pumice deposit). On the other hand, MI of Group 2 are trapped in olivine ranging from Fo69 to Fo81 and from Fo84 to Fo90, and the hosts are representative of both Plinian and inter-Plinian events. The only eruption where Group-1 and Group-2 MI coexist is the Pompeii eruption.\nGroup 2 MIs were further analyzed by Raman to test for the presence of volatiles (CO2 or H2O) in the vapor bubbles. CO2 was detected in all MI analyzed. CO2 density was determined using the distance between the two Fermi-diad peaks, and ranges between 0.14 and 0.55 g/cm3. Six MI also showed evidence for H2O in the vapor bubble. In addition, carbonates were detected at the glass-vapor interface of five MI.\nThis study shows that the CO2-rich fluid phase, which might exsolve from Plinian melts contain a significant amount of H2O. In addition, the first melting temperature of the fluids in the vapor bubble (~ -58ºC) suggests that volatile components, other than CO2, are included in the vapor bubbles.",

            "abstract": "Shallow off-megathrust subduction earthquakes are important in terms of hazard assessment and coseismic energy budget. A recent global study shows that between 1976 and 2007 about 55% of the seismic moment released within subduction zones was actually not released at the megathrust interface. Their role and spatiotemporal occurrence, however, remain poorly understood. We for the first time simulate their spontaneous activation and propagation using a newly developed 2D, physically consistent, continuum, visco-elasto-plastic seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) modeling approach. The characteristics of simulated normal events within the outerrise and splay and normal antithetic events within the wedge resemble seismic and seismological observations in terms of location, geometry, and timing. Their occurrence agrees reasonably well with both long-term analytical predictions based on dynamic Coulomb wedge theory and short-term quasi-static stress changes resulting from the typically triggering megathrust event. The impact of off-megathrust faulting on the megathrust cycle is distinct, as more both shallower and slower megathrust events arise due to occasional off-megathrust triggering and increased updip locking. This also enhances tsunami hazards, which are amplified due to the steeply dipping fault planes of especially outerrise events.",

            "abstract": "Spatial distribution of important geotechnical parameter named compression modulus Es contributes considerably to the understanding of the underlying geological processes and the adequate assessment of the Es mechanics effects for differential settlement of large continuous structure foundation. These analyses should be derived using an assimilating approach that combines in-situ static cone penetration test (CPT) with borehole experiments. To achieve such a task, the Es distribution of stratum of silty clay in region A of China Expo Center (Shanghai) is studied using the Bayesian-maximum entropy method. This method integrates rigorously and efficiently multi-precision of different geotechnical investigations and sources of uncertainty. Single CPT samplings were modeled as a rational probability density curve by maximum entropy theory. Spatial prior multivariate probability density function (PDF) and likelihood PDF of the CPT positions were built by borehole experiments and the potential value of the prediction point, then, preceding numerical integration on the CPT probability density curves, the posterior probability density curve of the prediction point would be calculated by the Bayesian reverse interpolation framework. The results were compared between Gaussian Sequential Stochastic Simulation and Bayesian methods. The differences were also discussed between single CPT samplings of normal distribution and simulated probability density curve based on maximum entropy theory. It is shown that the study of Es spatial distributions can be improved by properly incorporating CPT sampling variation into interpolation process, whereas more informative estimations are generated by considering CPT Uncertainty for the estimation points. Calculation illustrates the significance of stochastic Es characterization in a stratum, and identifies limitations associated with inadequate geostatistical interpolation techniques. This characterization results will provide a multi-precision information assimilation method of other geotechnical parameters.",

            "abstract": "Losses and damages associated with extreme weather events have been receiving attention lately within the context of anthropogenic climate change, whether in discussions in the public, international negotiations, or legal arenas. Investigations of the role of anthropogenic emissions in this loss and damage have so far taken two forms. On the one hand, so-called \"event attribution\" studies have examined the role of anthropogenic emissions in the occurrence of the extreme weather event, usually in terms of the chance of the event. On the other hand, a different line of research has been primarily concerned with how losses related to extreme weather events have varied over time, by examining trends in disaster databases. According to these latter studies, the increase in asset values and in exposure are the main drivers of the strong increase of economic losses over the past several decades in many areas.\nHere we propose a better integration of these existing lines of research in detection and attribution of extreme weather events and disasters by applying a risk framework, where risk is considered a function of the probability of occurrence of an extreme weather event as well as the associated consequences of that event. Attribution of risk thus requires consideration of intensity of the physical event, exposure and value of assets, and vulnerability. Through analysis of trends in these contributors for select case study events, as well as comparative analysis of repeated events, we examine the feasibility of considering the role of anthropogenic emissions against other factors in contributing to long-term trends in risk.",

However, most of these methods have been tested in lab scales where boundary conditions and material properties are known and under control. The focus of this study is to compare two different approaches for simulating preferential flows in a weighing lysimeter where the scale of simulation is closer to field scales than simulations done in labs. To do so, we applied dual permeability and spatially distributed heterogeneity as two competitive approaches for simulating slow and rapid flow out of a lysimeter. While the dual permeability approach assumes that there is a structure among soil aggregates and that can be captured as a fraction of the porosity, the other method attributes the existence of preferential flows to heterogeneity distributed within the domain. The two aforementioned approaches were used in order to simulate daily recharge values of a lysimeter. The analysis included a calibration phase, which started from March 2012 until March 2013, and a validation phase which lasted a year following the calibration period. The simulations were performed based on the numerical and 3-D physically based model HydroGeoSphere. The nonlinear uncertainty analysis of the results indicate that they are comparable.",

            "abstract": "Despite increasing recognition of the importance of biological Si cycling in controlling dissolved Si (DSi) in soil and stream water, effects of human cultivation on the Si cycle remain poorly understood. Sensitive tracer techniques to identify and quantify Si in the soil-plant-water system could be highly relevant in addressing these uncertainties. Stable Si isotopes are promising tools to define Si sources and sinks along the ecosystem flow path, as intense fractionation occurs during chemical weathering and uptake of dissolved Si in plants. Yet they remain underexploited in the end product of the soil-plant system: the soil water. Here, stable Si isotope ratios (δ30Si) of dissolved Si in soil water were measured along a land use gradient (continuous forest, continuous pasture, young cropland and continuous cropland) with similar parent material (loess) and homogenous bulk mineralogical and climatological properties (Belgium). Soil water δ30Si signatures are clearly separated along the gradient, with highest average signatures in continuous cropland (+1.61‰), intermediate in pasture (+1.05‰) and young cropland (+0.89 ‰) and lowest in forest soil water (+0.62‰). Our data do not allow distinguishing biological from pedogenic/lithogenic processes, but point to a strong interaction of both. We expect that increasing export of light isotopes in disturbed land uses (i.e. through agricultural harvest), and higher recycling of 28Si and elevated weathering intensity (including clay dissolution) in forest systems will largely determine soil water δ30Si signatures of our systems. Our results imply that soil water δ30Si signature is biased through land management before it reaches rivers and coastal zones, where other fractionation processes take over (e.g. diatom uptake and reverse weathering in floodplains). In particular, a direct role of agriculture systems in lowering export Si fluxes towards rivers and coastal systems has been shown. Stable Si isotopes have a large potential to track human disturbance on the Si cycle, including subtle changes in clay evolution and biogenic sink/source functions as induced by land use conversions.",

These analyses coupled with the comparison of elemental analysis of 210Pb – dated sediment cores, main stem water quality surveys, and a review of recent EPA National Coastal Condition Assessment sediment data from Chesapeake Bay provide added information about the roles of local and region scale processes on ecosystem condition. The high amount of suspended sediment in the Chester River (5-20 mg L-1) is an important factor controlling water quality conditions of the Chester River and a prime focus for environmental management of this system. Sources of suspended matter include local runoff, atmospheric deposition, local resuspension, and exchange with the Chesapeake Bay. In principle, each of these sources could be distinguished on the basis of chemical composition of surface sediment. Preliminary results from multivariate analytic models indicate that many of the elements investigated display significant covariance with Al (and other predominantly crustal signatures) which may indicate limited exogenic sources of contamination for sediments of this watershed. For example total Pb concentrations are mostly below the NOAA’s low toxic effects level and lower than the median value of NCCA data for the upper Chesapeake suggesting that sediments have significant sources from within the watershed. Further, significant higher concentrations of Sn and Cu coincide with sediment collected in or near marinas and point to localized anthropogenic sources for these elements. Elemental enrichment values relative to Al of Chester River sediments are significantly lower than observations in sediments from Chesapeake Bay overall and may indicate that local watershed management strategies may be effective for improving water and habitat quality of the Chester River.",

            "abstract": "Peroxy defects, first described in the 1980’s, can provide explanations for enigmas and paradoxes that limit our understanding of the Earth. Peroxy defects consist of pairs of oxygen anions that changed their valence from 2– to 1– through a redox conversion (RC) of hydroxyl pairs, Si-OH HO-Si = Si-OO-Si + H2. RC takes place during cooling when temperatures drop below the range in which thermodynamic equilibrium can be maintained. H2 molecules are diffusively mobile and hard to detect. Peroxy defects are inconspicuous and even harder to detect. When peroxy defects break, they release highly mobile electronic charge carriers, chemically O– in a matrix of O2–, defect electrons in the O2– sublattice. Known as positive holes (p-holes for short) these charge carriers reside in the O 2sp-type energy levels at the upper edge of the valence band. They have the amazing ability to flow out of the rock volumes, in which they are generated. The p-holes propagate fast (~100 m/sec) and far (m’s in the lab, km’s in the field). The p-hole outflow represents an electric current. When p-holes flow into bodies of water, they oxidize H2O to H2O2. When they arrive at Earth’s surface, they cause high electric (E) fields. Air molecules, probably O2+, become field-ionized, rising through the atmospheric column, leading to moisture condensation in the troposphere, mesospheric lightning, ionospheric perturbations. Break-up of peroxy defects is achieved by stressing rocks and by heating. Intrusion of magmas into crustal rocks activates p-holes, which flow down temperature gradients, causing electrochemical potentials between the magma bodies and the country rocks. This leads to electrochemically driven diffusion processes that cause highly diffusive ions such as H+ and Na+ to be added to the magma. Hence, p-holes are important for petrogenesis. Lastly, knowledge about “water” in Earth’s upper mantle is based on analyses of hydroxyls in nominally anhydrous minerals, either by IR or SIMS or similar techniques. If the majority of the solute Si-OH in minerals like olivine has undergone RC during cooling from upper mantle to Earth surface temperatures, most Si-OH will have converted to peroxy plus H2. Hence, looking for hydroxyls, even looking for H, is the wrong way to find out how much “water” is in the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "The core mantle boundary (CMB) separates the liquid iron core from the slowly-convecting solid mantle. The ~300 km thick barrier above the boundary has proven to be far more than a simple dividing layer; rather it is a complex region with a range of proposed phenomena such as thermal and compositional heterogeneity, partial melting and anisotropy. Characterizing the heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle through seismic tomography will prove crucial to accurately understanding key geodynamical processes within our planet, not just in the mantle above, but also a possible “mapping” onto the inner core boundary (ICB) through a thermochemical convection in the outer core, which in turn might control the growth of the inner core (e.g. Aubert et al., 2008; Gubbins et al., 2011). Here we obtain high-resolution compressional wave (P-wave) velocity images and uncertainty estimates for the lowermost mantle using travel time data collected by waveform cross-correlation. Strikingly, independent datasets of seismic phases that “see” the lowermost mantle in a different way yield similar P-wave velocity distributions at lower harmonic degrees. We also consider the effect of CMB topography. The images obtained are void of explicit model parameterization and regularization (through transdimensional Bayesian tomography) and contain features on multiple spatial scales. Subsequent spectral analyses reveal a power of heterogeneity three times larger than previous estimates. The P-wave tomograms of the lowermost mantle contain the harmonic degree 2-structure, similar to tomographic images derived from S-wave data (e.g. Ritsema et al. 2011), but with additional higher harmonic degrees (notably, 3-7). In other words, the heterogeneity size is uniformly distributed between about 500 and 6000 km. Inter alia, the resulting heterogeneity spectrum provides a bridge between the long-wavelength features of most global models and the very short-scale dimensions of scatterers mapped in independent studies. We argue that the new images of P-wave velocity in the lowermost mantle, void of explicit parameterization and damping, improve the imaging resolution and provide realistic boundary conditions at the CMB (due to a high sensitivity to heat flux) with important consequences for Earth dynamics.",

Foremost among these are the subsurface thermochemical structure, the causes and timing of the uplift of the Colorado Plateau (CP), and the relative contributions of the various deep (e.g. large scale dynamic topography) and shallow (e.g. small-scale convection or lithospheric heating) processes proposed to explain it. Here we present a thermochemical model of the Central-Western US based on a new 3D multi-observable inversion method based on a probabilistic (Bayesian) formalism (Afonso et al., 2013a,b) using high-quality geophysical, geochemical and geological datasets. Working within this internally and thermodynamically consistent framework allows us to move beyond traditional methods and jointly invert P-wave and S-wave teleseismic arrival times, Rayleigh wave phase dispersion data, Bouguer anomalies, long-wavelength gravity gradients, geoid height, absolute elevation (local and dynamic), and surface heat flow data. In this presentation, we will discuss a number of robust features from our models that carry important implications for supporting or disapproving current evolutionary models for this region.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of the quantities of organic carbon stored in permafrost-region soils have improved immensely within the last few decades. However, uncertainties in these estimates remain high and affect our ability to reliably predict the vulnerability of the region’s vast carbon stocks to remobilization caused by permafrost thaw and other perturbations related to climatic changes. Two major sources of uncertainty are (1) the uneven distributions and limited numbers of observational data, due to constraints on accessibility for much of this remote region; and (2) the high spatial heterogeneity of cryoturbated soils found in patterned ground — where freeze/thaw, frost heaving, and other cryogenic processes cause soil deformation, breaking/mixing of soil horizons, and deep burial of relatively labile organic matter. Ice wedge polygons are ubiquitous throughout Arctic coastal plains and drainage basins. These patterned ground features are large enough (~5-30 m across) that a better three-dimensional understanding of their carbon stocks might improve geospatial upscaling of observational data. We investigated the horizontal and vertical (up to 300 cm deep) distributions of soil organic matter across three polygon types on the North Slope of Alaska: low-center (LCP), flat-center (FCP), and high-center (HCP) polygons, with each type replicated three times. We found variations in the thickness and quality of surface organic horizons for different polygon types. Below the active layer, organic-rich cryoturbated horizons were located in the transition zone and fingered down into the upper permafrost. The HCPs exhibited more prominent deformation than LCPs and FCPs. The cross-sectional distribution and heterogeneity of organic carbon density differed among polygon types, which led to type variations in overall polygon carbon stocks as well. Our findings suggest that an approach based on accounting for polygon-scale (wedge to center) and/or landscape-scale (polygon type) variations, in tandem with remote sensing and geospatial tools, could help constrain the uncertainties associated with upscaling of carbon stocks for areas of patterned ground dominated by ice wedge polygons.",

            "abstract": "As a result of warming, methane is being released into the marine environment in areas that have not historically experienced methane input. While methane is a potent greenhouse gas, microbial oxidation of methane within the sediment greatly limits the role of marine methane sources on atmospheric forcing. However, in these areas of new methane release, consumption of methane prior to its release into the atmosphere is a result of the response of the microbial community to this new input of methane. Further, rare earth elements (REEs) are not currently thought to be involved with microbial activity, but this assumption has not been rigorously tested. Here we test that: (1) microbial communities will rapidly respond to the onset of methane emission, and (2) the microbial response to this methane input will impact the distribution of REEs within the sediment. Undisturbed cores sampled from a tidal flat at Yaquina Bay, OR, were brought back to a lab and injected with anoxic seawater (as a control) or anoxic sea water saturated with methane gas for a total of 2 weeks. Aerobic methanotrophs proliferated over this short time period, becoming an abundant member of the microbial community as identified using fatty acid biomarkers. Excitingly, the experimental injection of methane also shifted the distribution of REEs within the sediment, a trend that appeared to follow the microbial response and that was different from the control cores. Further, the lightest REEs appeared to be used more than the heavier ones, supporting that the REEs are being actively used by the microbes. While we focused on identifying the response of those microbes responsible in methane-cycling, we also identified how the entire microbial community shifts as a result of methane input, and correlating with shifts in REE distribution. Here we have empirically demonstrated the rapid response of methanotrophs to the onset of methane emission and that REE distribution within the sediment is likely impacted by microbial activity, including that involved with methane cycling. This has broad implications to identifying the role of novel methane seeps in global carbon cycles and our understanding of REE distributions within marine sediments.",

            "abstract": "Over the last-decade, global scale datasets of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues have become available from different remote-sensing instruments. Due to the observational geometry and the spectral ranges that are used, only few satellites sample water isotopologues in the lower troposphere, where the bulk of hydrological processes within the atmosphere take place. Here we use TES and SCIAMACHY observations to evaluate the model performance especially the model humidity bias at higher altitudes, which is commonly found in most GCM models. Two methods to handle the humidity bias from the model and complexity of cross dependence of retrieved δD on atmospheric humidity (a posteriori processing) are used. The result shows that the spatial pattern of δD is in good agreement between model and observations. However, ECHAM model convoluted with Averaging Kernel (ECHAMAK) produces unrealistically high δD values over the Tibetan plateau. This unrealistic pattern is due to a high bias in the model humidity over the Himalaya region. The problem disappears when we take into account the humidity bias correction and a posteriori analysis. We also find that ECHAM and ECHAMAK results produce considerably higher δD values than TES and SCIAMACHY in the northern hemisphere during summer. Other features of the water isotopologue cycle such as the seasonally varying signal in the tropics due to the movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ICTZ) are captured in the model and satellites. This ICTZ pattern is seen from TES and SCIAMACHY datasets at lower altitudes where many processes contributing to the amount effect occur. In contrast, ECHAM and ECHAMAK show the seesaw pattern throughout the entire atmospheric column, both at the lower and high layers. It was speculated that GCMs in general show strong coherence between processes at lower altitudes (such as Sea Surface Temperature variations) and associated features at high altitudes (such as high cloud formation and the height of convective cloud). In this case the common humidity bias due to strong convection in the model or of the large-scale circulation or to excessive diffusion during the transport of water vapor might be a further consequence of these known model problems.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds play a significant role in the Earth’s climate system. Therefore it is important to have highly accurate, quantitative data records of cloud properties that span several years and geographic regions. In the first stage of an upcoming global study, we take a dataset spanning more than eight years (2006-2014) and comprised of over 60,000 hours of continuous lidar data to derive a cirrus cloud climatology for a mid-latitude site in the Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET). Using the recently developed version 3 cloud algorithm, macrophysical properties of cirrus clouds, including diurnal, monthly, seasonal, and annual cycles are described for the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) site located in Greenbelt, MD (38.99oN, 76.84oW). The new algorithm uses a combination of two methods and a multi-resolution temporal averaging scheme to detect cloud boundaries. The first method uses gradients in the lidar profile to identify low-level clouds. The second method uses uncertainites in the lidar profile to identify elevated cloud layers (i.e. cirrus). Results are discussed in the context of the region’s synoptic meteorology.\nAdditionally, the Goddard Earth Observing System-version 5 (GEOS-5) reanalysis is used to to describe the temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction at the cirrus cloud boundaries. Estimates of the cloud extinction and optical depth are also given. Finally, results of this study are compared to previous mid-latitude cirrus climatologies at other geographical regions.",

            "abstract": "Snow plays an important role in controlling ground thermal regime and thus influencing permafrost distribution in the lower areas of the South Shetlands archipelago, where late lying snowpatches protect the soil from summer warming. However, summer snow distribution is complex in the mountainous environments of the Maritime Antarctica and it is very difficult to obtain accurate mapping products of snow cover extent and also to monitor snowmelt. Field observations of snow cover in the region are currently based on: i) thickness data from a very scarce network of meteorological stations, ii) temperature poles allowing to estimate snow thickness, iii) and time-lapse cameras allowing for assessing snow distribution over relatively small areas. The high cloudiness of the Maritime Antarctic environment limits good mapping results from the analysis of optical remote sensing imagery such as Landsat, QuickBird or GeoEye. Therefore, microwave sensors provide the best imagery, since they are not influenced by cloudiness and are sensitive to wet-snow, typical of the melting season.\nWe have acquired TerraSAR-X scenes for Deception and Livingston Islands for January-March 2014 in spotlight (HH, VV and HH/VV) and stripmap modes (HH) and analyse the radar backscattering for determining the differences between wet-snow, dry-snow and bare soil aiming at developing snow melt pattern maps. For ground truthing, snowpits were dug in order to characterize snow stratigraphy, grain size, grain type and snow density and to evaluate its effects on radar backscattering. Time-lapse cameras allow to identify snow patch boundaries in the field and ground surface temperatures obtained with minloggers, together with air temperatures, allow to identify the presence of snow cover in the ground. The current research is conducted in the framework of the project PERMANTAR-3 (Permafrost monitoring and modelling in Antarctic Peninsula – PTDC/AAG-GLO/3908/2012 of the FCT and PROPOLAR).",

            "abstract": "Slip surface roughness is understood to control the dynamics of earthquake propagation. Quantifying the micro- and nano-scale roughness of slip surfaces can give insight into the grain-scale processes controlling the strength of faults during earthquake propagation.\nFriction experiments were performed on fine-grained calcite gouges, at speed 1 ms-1, normal stress 18 MPa, displacements 0.009–1.46 m, and room temperature and humidity. Results show a two stage-evolution (S1-2) of the fault strength, with an initial increase up to peak value 0.82 (S1), followed by a sudden decrease to a low, steady-state value 0.18 (S2). Samples retrieved at the end of S1 show the development of a cohesive slip zone (SZ), made of micron-scale, angular clasts formed by brittle fracturing and cataclasis. The SZ of samples deformed up to S2, is composed of nanograin aggregates which exhibit polygonal grain boundaries indicating high temperature grain boundary sliding creep deformation. In both cases, the SZ is bounded by a sharply defined slip surface.\nThe 3-D geometry of seven experimental slip surfaces (40μm×40μm) has been reconstructed by digital processing of sets of 1800 images of SZ cross sections acquired at 20 nm intervals perpendicular to the slip direction, using a slicing (Focussed Ion Beam) and viewing (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) technique. Spectrum power density analyses show that nano- and micron-scale slip surface roughness is anisotropic for both S1 and S2 slip surfaces. At the nano- and micron-scale, root mean square values decrease with length for S1 slip surfaces, but only slightly for S2 surfaces, and are anisotropic in the slip-normal and slip-parallel directions. The anisotropy is reduced at the nano-scale, although S2 slip surfaces are still smoother parallel to slip than normal to slip. Hurst exponents vary through scales, and are anisotropic in the directions parallel and normal to slip.\nVariable Hurst exponents indicate that slip surface roughness is scale-dependent with anisotropic, not self-affine behaviour at the micro/nano-scale, in contrast to the self-affine behaviour inferred at the mm to km scales. Dynamic weakening and creep deformation, observed during S2, coincide with an evolution towards less anisotropic and scale-dependent slip surface roughness at the nanoscale.",

            "abstract": "In hydraulic fracturing completion programs fluids are injected under pressure into fractured rock formations to open escape pathways for trapped hydrocarbons along pre-existing and newly generated fractures. To characterize the failure process, we estimate static and dynamic source and rupture parameters, such as dynamic and static stress drop, radiated energy, seismic efficiency, failure modes, failure plane orientations and dimensions, and rupture velocity to investigate the rupture dynamics and scaling relations of micro-earthquakes induced during a hydraulic fracturing shale completion program in NE British Columbia, Canada. The relationships between the different parameters combined with the in-situ stress field and rock properties provide valuable information on the rupture process giving insights into the generation and development of the fracture network. Approximately 30,000 micro-earthquakes were recorded using three multi-sensor arrays of high frequency geophones temporarily placed close to the treatment area at reservoir depth (~2km). On average the events have low radiated energy, low dynamic stress and low seismic efficiency, consistent with the obtained slow rupture velocities. Events fail in overshoot mode (slip weakening failure model), with fluids lubricating faults and decreasing friction resistance. Events occurring in deeper formations tend to have faster rupture velocities and are more efficient in radiating energy. Variations in rupture velocity tend to correlate with variation in depth, fault azimuth and elapsed time, reflecting a dominance of the local stress field over other factors. Several regions with different characteristic failure modes are identifiable based on coherent stress drop, seismic efficiency, rupture velocities and fracture orientations. Variations of source parameters with rock rheology and hydro-fracture fluids are also observed. Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of events with similar characteristic rupture behaviors can be used to determine reservoir geophysical properties, constrain reservoir geo-mechanical models, classify dynamic rupture processes for fracture models and improve fracture treatment designs.",

            "abstract": "Water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves dictate soil moisture dynamics, whose accurate description in both the liquid and vapor phases is crucial to properly estimate soil water evaporation. When classical water retention curves that approach infinitely negative matric potentials at nonzero residual water content (e.g. Van Genuchten or Brooks Corey) are employed to model soil moisture dynamics, evaporation from arid soil is not satisfactorily described because no soil drying below residual water content is allowed. Ciocca et al., GRL, [2014] showed how, for the isothermal case, more physically sound dynamics are predicted by employing modified retention models allowing the drying below the residual water content by vapor diffusion. The impact of these modified water retention models on the description of the moisture dynamics is numerically investigated in a more complex and realistic framework, in which a diurnal atmospheric forcing is applied at the soil surface and the soil heat dynamics (coupled to the moisture dynamics) are considered. For different soils, results are compared both with predictions from the classical retention curves and with a steady (i.e. not diurnally oscillating) atmospheric forcing. The impact of the significantly larger vapor fluxes predicted by the modified retention models on the soil temperature and consequently on the latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes is presented. A detailed analysis of the hourly liquid, vapor and temperature dynamics with depth is provided in order to assess whether the modified retention curves may help to reconcile the theory with some still debated field experimental results (e.g. soil moisture content rises at midday) without invoking for any empirical liquid gain and/or vapor enhancement factor.",

A common set of pattern and a pattern language is used to describe atmospheric parameters that are distributed along time, space and parameter dimensions with multiple scales along each dimension. The temporal patterns are at diurnal, weekly, seasonal and secular scales. The weekly and secular-scale pattern is driven mainly by human influences while the diurnal and seasonal pattern are more influenced by nature. The horizontal spatial variation and pattern include plumes, urban domes and regional ‘blobs’ as they occur at micro, meso, synoptic and hemispherical scales. The vertical pattern includes well-mixed layer and ‘bliny’ (pancakes). All atmospheric phenomena are characterized by their respective spatial and temporal pattern.\nA pattern catalog along with a consistent pattern description language (1) aids the identification of major drivers of variation; (2) facilitates comprehensive comparison and reconciliation of data and models along multiple dimensions and scales; (3) allows estimation of unusual deviation from standard pattern. Such anomalous pattern along with statistical analyses and chemical transport model results for specific ozone events can be used as evidence and documentation of Exceptional Air Quality Events.",

            "abstract": "Dramatic increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of stream water have been reported for aquatic ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere and have been attributed variously to global warming, recovery from acid rain, or to altered hydrologic connections between watersheds and receiving streams. Here, we analyzed one of the longest continuous records of stream water DOC available in the Southeastern US. The record comes from a forested headwater stream at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the Southern Appalachians (NC, USA). In contrast to the increasing DOC trends reported for northern temperate watersheds, we observed steep declines in both the volume-weighted concentrations of stream DOC (43% decline) and DOC fluxes (55% decline) between 1988 and 2005. Annual mean runoff declined by 38%, which we attributed mainly to a 47% decline in baseflow during the study period. Increased soil [SO42-] and ionic strength of soil water indicate that soils within the watershed are becoming more acidic through time. Together, these results suggest that the dramatic decline in DOC concentrations can be attributed to: 1) a decline in runoff, which affected the mobilization of DOC from uplands to the stream, and 2) gradual soil acidification, which probably restricted the formation of DOC within the watershed. Declining DOC in headwater streams has implications not only for carbon and other nutrient cycles but also for the health of aquatic habitats throughout this region. More broadly, these results emphasize that long-term trends in DOC may differ for streams across the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term datasets have the potential to reveal the range of these trends and the underlying processes that drive them.",

Indeed, they have a significant role on deformation during basin evolution, particularly on fault reactivation. The Lodève Permian Basin (Hérault, France) is an exhumed half graben with exceptional outcrop conditions providing access to barite-sulfides mineralized systems and hydrocarbon trapped into rollover faults of the basin.\nArchitectural studies shows a cyclic infilling of fault zone and associated S0-parallel veins according to three main fluid events during dextral/normal faulting. Contrasting fluid entrapment conditions are deduced from textural analysis, fluid inclusion microthermometry and sulfide isotope geothermometer: (i) the first stage is characterized by an implosion breccia cemented by silicifications and barite during abrupt pressure drop within fault zone; (ii) the second stage consists in succession of barite ribbons precipitated under overpressure fluctuations, derived from fault-valve action, with reactivation planes formed by sulphide-rich micro-shearing structures showing normal movement; and (iii) the third stage is associated to the formation of dextral strike-slip pull-apart infilling by large barite crystals and contemporary hydrocarbons under suprahydrostatic pressure values.\nMicrothermometry, sulfide and strontium isotopic compositions of the barite-sulfides veins indicate that all stages were formed by mixing between deep basinal fluids at 230°C, derived from cinerite dewatering, and formation water from overlying sedimentary cover channelized trough fault planes.\nWe conclude to a polyphase history of fluid trapping during Permian synrift formation of the basin: (i) a first event, associated with the dextral strike-slip motion on faults, leads to a first sealing of the fault zone; (ii) periodic reactivations of fault planes and bedding-controlled shearing form the main mineralized ore bodies by the single action of fluid overpressure fluctuations, undergoing changes in local stress distribution and (iii) a final tectonic activation of fault linked to last basinal fluid and hydrocarbon migration during which shear stress restoration on fault plane is faster than fluid pressure build-up.",

Introduction and Background\nThis paper introduces a new NASA airborne instrument, the Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP), which is specially tailored to simulate SMAP.\n2. Description of SLAP\nSLAP has both passive (radiometer) and active (radar) microwave L-band imaging capabilities. The radiometer observes at 1.4 GHz using duplicate front end hardware from the SMAP satellite radiometer. It also includes a duplicate of the digital backend development unit for SMAP, thus the novel Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection and mitigation features and algorithms for SMAP are duplicated with very high fidelity in SLAP. The digital backend provides 4-Stokes polarization capability. The real-aperture radar operates in the 1215-1300 MHz band with quad-pol capability. Radar and radiometer share one antenna via diplexers that are spare units from the Aquarius satellite instrument.\n 3. Flight Results\nSLAP’s initial flights were conducted in Dec 2013 over the eastern shore of Maryland and successfully demonstrated radiometer imaging over 2 full SMAP 36x36 km grid cells at 1km resolution within 3 hrs, easily meeting the SMAP post-launch cal/val airborne mapping requirements. A second flight on the same day also demonstrated SLAP’s quick-turn abilities and high-resolution/wide-swath capabilities with 200m resolution across a 1500m swath from 2000 ft AGL. Additional flights were conducted as part of the GPM iPHEX campaign in May, 2014.\n 4. Conclusion\nThis paper presents flight data and imagery, as well as details of the radiometer and radar performance and calibration. The paper will also describe the mission performance achievable on the King Air and other platforms.",

We combined MODIS land and atmosphere data and produced global daily evapotranspiration (ET) estimates at 5 kilometer using four algorithms that follow different approaches. The algorithms included a Priestly-Taylor type formulation (PT-JPL), a Penmen-Monteith-based approach (MOD16), ET estimated as a residual (Surface Energy Budget System; SEBS), and a formulation that derives surface and canopy resistances analytically (PMBL). We compared remote sensing-based ET estimates with measurements from more than 100 FLUXNET sites and quantified uncertainty and error in ET estimates from each of the four algorithms. We then used these validated remote sensing-based ET estimates as reference data and evaluated the accuracy and reliability of ET and its three components (soil evaporation, canopy interception evaporation, and transpiration) from the historical and decadal simulations of 20 different Earth System models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We quantified the predictive skill of each model. Finally, we weighted each model based on its predictive skill and analyzed spatiotemporal variations in projected ET and its components for the next 50 years.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing drought in California has substantially reduced surface water supplies for millions of acres of irrigated farmland in California's Central Valley. Rapid assessment of drought impacts on agricultural production can aid water managers in assessing mitigation options, and guide decision making with respect to requests for local water transfers, county drought disaster designations, and allocation of emergency funds to mitigate drought impacts. Satellite remote sensing offers an efficient way to provide quantitative assessments of drought impacts on agricultural production and increases in idle acreage associated with reductions in water supply. A key advantage of satellite-based assessments is that they can provide a measure of land fallowing that is consistent across both space and time. We describe an approach for monthly and seasonal mapping of uncultivated agricultural acreage developed as part of a joint effort by USGS, USDA, NASA, and the California Department of Water Resources to provide timely assessments of land fallowing during drought events. This effort has used the Central Valley of California as a pilot region for development and testing of an operational approach. \nTo provide quantitative measures of uncultivated agricultural acreage from satellite data early in the season, we developed a decision tree algorithm and applied it to timeseries of data from Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI, and MODIS. Our effort has been focused on development of indicators of drought impacts in the March - August timeframe based on measures of crop development patterns relative to a reference period with average or above average rainfall. To assess the accuracy of the algorithms, monthly ground validation surveys were conducted across 640 fields from March - September, 2014. We present the algorithm along with updated results from the accuracy assessment, and discuss potential applications to other regions.",

            "abstract": "The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the Tibetan Plateau to the west, and the Michang Shan and Daba Shan mountains to the north and northwest. Foreland basins have been developed along the western and northern margins of the Sichuan basin since Triassic, receiving sediments with significant along-strike variations. These sediment records provide useful insights into the history of mountain building around the Sichuan Basin. We have collected exploration well data from western Sichuan Basin. Using backstripping, we reconstructed the basement deformation history, which reflect sedimentary and tectonic loadings related to mountain building. We used a 3-D numerical modeling technique with multi-grid technique to simulate flexural deformation of the Sichuan Basin lithosphere, and to infer tectonic loading and mountain building along western and northern margins of the Sichuan Basin from the late Triassic to the Cenozoic. Our results suggest that the shortening of the Daba Shan and Michuan Shan orogens mainly occurred during the late Jurassic-Cretaceous. During Cenozoic, the tectonic loading mainly occurred along the southwestern margins of the Sichuan Basin, corresponding to the development of the Longmen Shan mountain belt. The tectonic loading of the northern Longmen Shan on the Sichuan Basin has been markedly reduced since the Cenozoic, evidenced by the lack of Cenozoic foreland basin development. This indicates mechanical decoupling between uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin, consistent with the deep down-cutting of the Longmen Shan fault and predominantly strike-slip motion on the fault. The limited Cenozoic foreland basin development in the southwestern margin of the Sichuan Basin is consistent with localized high-angle thrusting of the southern Longmen Shan mountains.

            "abstract": "Spatial pattern of vegetation may exhibit different degree of organization that can be interpreted as an indicator for the state of an ecosystem. In particular, it is possible to observe transitions from over-dispersed individuals (e.g. an ordered lattice) to under-dispersed individuals (e.g. clumped points) in semiarid environments. These configurations may correspond to different strategy of adaptation or optimization, whose understanding may help to predict some of the consequences of environmental change for both ecosystem services and water resources. For this reason, we have developed theoretical framework to explore the general principles behind the self-organization of vegetation in semiarid environment. The model is derived assuming a spatial distribution of individuals interpreted by the generalized double Poisson distribution and the soil water balance is solved considering the role of tree canopies and root overlaps. In this way the role of spacing between individuals is taken into account considering both the shading effect (light interception) of the canopies and the partitioning of water use due to the presence of multiple individual root systems in one point. This mathematical framework allows identifying the climatic boundaries where the clumped structure is more beneficial in terms of water use and water stress. A controlling factor for such limits is represented by the total rainfall amount, but different configurations of rainfall frequency and mean rainfall depth may modify the range of climatological conditions where over-disperse patterns are more competitive. Moreover, we also observe that plants with larger root systems are less likely to benefit from a clumped structure. These results explain observed patterns of vegetation at the continental scale.",

            "abstract": "Comets are believed to contain the most pristine material of our Solar System materials and therefore to be a key to understand the origin of the Solar System, and the origin of life. Remote sensing observations have led to the detection of more than twenty simple organic molecules (Bockelée-Morvan et al., 2004; Mumma and Charnley, 2011). Experiments on-board in-situ exploration missions Giotto and Vega and the recent Stardust sample return missions have shown that a significant fraction of the cometary grains consists of organic matter. Spectra showed that both the gaseous (Mitchell et al., 1992) and the solid phase (grains) (Kissel and Krueger, 1987) contained organic molecules with higher masses than those of the molecules detected by remote sensing techniques in the gaseous phase. Some of the grains analyzed in the atmosphere of comet 1P/Halley seem to be essentially made of a mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (CHON grains, Fomenkova, 1999). Rosetta is an unparalleled opportunity to make a real breakthrough into the nature of cometary matter, both in the gas and in the solid phase. The dust mass spectrometer COSIMA on Rosetta will analyze organic and inorganic phases in the dust. The organic phases may be refractory, but some organics may evaporate with time from the dust and lead to an extended source in the coma. Over the last years, we have prepared the cometary rendezvous by the analysis of various samples with the reference model of COSIMA. We will report on this calibration data set and on the first results of the in-situ analysis of cometary grains as captured, imaged and analyzed by COSIMA.\n",

            "abstract": "Dehydration processes and the expulsion of the water from the subducting oceanic plate affect various subduction-zone processes, including arc volcanism and generation of earthquakes and tremor. Since the amount of chemically bound water in the oceanic plate is highest in serpentinized mantle, it is important to reveal the degree of oceanic mantle serpentinization prior to subduction.\nIn 2009 and 2013, to reveal the structural evolution of the incoming oceanic plate prior to subduction, we conducted wide-angle seismic structural surveys in the trench-outer rise region of the Japan trench. We found P-wave velocity (Vp) within the oceanic crust and mantle gradually decreases toward the trench axis, especially beneath the well-developed horst and grabens. Generally, reduction of Vp suggests two possibilities; one is a fracturing (dry mechanism) and the other is fracturing and water penetration (wet mechanism). The Vp/Vs ratio is a key to distinguish these two possibilities. \nUsing P-to-S converted phases, we successfully modeled Vs within the oceanic crust by the travel-time inversion, and we found the Vp/Vs ratio within the oceanic crust gradually increases toward the trench, suggesting the water infiltration into the oceanic crust. However, it is not straightforward to determine Vs within the oceanic mantle because signal-to-noise ratio of S-wave mantle refraction was too poor to pick arrival times. Therefore, we calculated S-wave mantle refractions by assuming wide variety of Vp/Vs ratio within the oceanic mantle and compared with the observed horizontal data. Although S-wave mantle refraction was observed at only limited number of OBSs, we found that Vp/Vs ratio within the oceanic mantle did not change even in the area where mantle Vp become lower. This implies that the mantle Vp reduction in our seismic profile is mainly governed by the \"dry mechanism\" or mantle hydration might be confined in only topmost mantle.",

Compaction adversely impacts soil ecosystem services over extended periods (years to decades) until structure and functionality are restored. An important class of soil structural restoration processes are related to biomechanical activity associated with borrowing of earthworms and root proliferation in impacted soils. This study employs a new biomechanical model to estimate stresses required for earthworm and plant root bioturbation under different conditions and the mechanical energy required. We consider steady state plastic cavity expansion to determine burrowing pressures of earthworms and plant roots as linked with models for cone penetration required for initial burrowing into soil volumes. We use earthworm physical and ecological parameters (e.g., population density, burrowing rate, and burrowing behavior) to convert mechanical deformation to estimation of energy and soil organic carbon (energy source for earthworms). Results illustrate a reduction in strain energy with increasing water content and trade-offs between pressure and energy investment for various root and earthworm geometries and soil hydration. The study provides a quantitative framework for estimating energy costs of bioturbation in terms of soil organic carbon or plant assimilates and delineates mechanical and hydration conditions that promote or constrain such activities.",

            "abstract": "The deep subsurface microbial community represents the largest biome on Earth, yet accessing this deep biosphere is challenging. Fluids seep along fractures from aquifers that may support diverse microbial communities, living off hydrogen gas generated by radiolysis, serpentinization, or thermogenic reactions. A serpentinizing seep, emanating fluids as high as pH 11.27, was found to accrete meters-long carbonate terraces in the Zambales ophiolite range (Luzon, the Philippines). Samples were collected at several locations along the Poon Bato (PB) River, focusing primarily on the pools and terraces formed by carbonate rimstone (Figure 1). As serpentinizing fluids are exposed to the atmosphere, dynamic niches are established in surface sediments. We propose that the high pH, reducing, high Ca+2 fluid pool terraces reflect remnants of deep subsurface microbial communities, based on high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing data. In total, eight samples were collected for environmental DNA analysis. Post-sequence analysis revealed a total of 927126 counts, with an average of 115890.75 counts per sample. Many taxa aligned with cultured representatives of serpentinizing seep-associated taxa, including Bacteroidetes, Clostrida, Chloroflexi, Methylococcales, and Xanthomonadales.\nGeochemical data indicates an average fluid temperature of 28.9°C, and pH that varies from 9.22-11.27. Total carbon wt.% of solids was highest in a shallow pool shaped by boulders, where calcite precipitation occurred over nearly every surface. Dissolved oxygen (DO%) was highest at PB1 main pool (60%), although a calcite skin had formed along the air-water interface. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at PB1 main pool was 1.3 ppm, while at PB2 main pool, the DIC was higher (6.0 ppm). The lack of calcite skin may allow more direct access to atmospheric carbon dioxide at PB2. The isotopic value of carbon-13 was depleted at PB1 relative to PB2 (δ13C VPDB -25.4 ‰ versus δ13C VPDB ‰ -17.5, respectively). The DOC concentration at PB1 main pool was 0.3 ppm and 1.15 ppm at PB2. Given the low DIC concentrations at PB1, it is suggested that heterotrophy may dominate over autotrophy in the system. This suggests that the highly reducing, high pH fluids emanating from fluid seeps at Poon Bato influence surface communities via inundation with serpentinizing fluid.",

            "abstract": "In the past decades the impact of storms on the coastal zone has increasingly drawn the attention of policy makers and coastal planners, engineers and researchers. The mean reason for this interest is the high density of the world’s population living near the ocean, in combination with climate change. Due to sea level rise and extremer weather conditions, many of the world’s coastlines are becoming more vulnerable to the potential of flooding.\nCurrently it is common practice to predict storm impact using physics-based numerical models. The numerical model utilizes several inputs (e.g. bathymetry, waves, surge) to calculate the impact on the coastline. Traditionally, the numerical modeller takes the following three steps: schematization/model setup, running and post-processing. This process generally has a total feedback time in the order of hours to days, and is suitable for so-called confirmatory modelling.However, often models are applied as an exploratory tool, in which the effect of e.g. different hydraulic conditions, or measures is investigated. The above described traditional work flow is not the most efficient method for exploratory modelling.\nInteractive modelling lets users adjust a simulation while running. For models typically used for storm impact studies (e.g. XBeach, Delft3D, D-Flow FM), the user can for instance change the storm surge level, wave conditions, or add a measure such as a nourishment or a seawall. The model will take the adjustments into account immediately, and will directly compute the effect. Using this method, tools can be developed in which stakeholders (e.g. coastal planners, policy makers) are in control and together evaluate ideas by interacting with the model. Here we will show initial results for interactive modelling with a storm impact model.",

            "abstract": "Central mounds on Mars are observed as sedimentary deposits within crater interiors, but the specific processes responsible for their formation and subsequent modification are still debated. The deposits are hypothesized to have been created by either subaerial or subaqueous processes through one of two general formation mechanisms. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that after their craters were formed, sediment filled the entire crater and was later eroded into the morphologies we observe today. Alternatively, the sediment could have been deposited as the features we observe today without any significant erosion contributing to their mound shape.\nWe conducted a survey of central mounds that occur within craters larger than 25 km in diameter located between ± 60° latitude on Mars. We use mound locations, mound offsets within their host craters, and mound heights to address various mound formation hypotheses. The results of this survey support the hypothesis that mound sediment once filled the entire host crater and was later eroded into the features we observe today. We propose that large Martian impact craters act as simplistic sedimentary basins. These basins “catch” any sediment that is being transported through the region. Any geologic process that involves transport of material (airfall dust, explosive volcanism, impact ejecta, etc.) could have contributed to the growth of this sediment fill, although the dominant process could vary based on location. During this depositional phase, several processes (ice/frost, water, etc.) could have cemented the material; then, at some point, the environment changed from depositional to erosional, leading to the formation of isolated mounds of sediment within these craters. Our study reveals that most mounds are offset from the center of their host crater in the same direction as the regional winds. For example, the mounds in Arabia Terra are offset towards the western portion of their craters. This observation is consistent with wind erosion being the dominant method of erosion of sedimentary basin fill to form crater central mounds.",

The area is located close to the boundary between South Africa and Botswana. The main objective of the study is to investigate groundwater potential using multi-data integration approach. Geologically, the area comprises of volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, carbonates, arenaceous and argillaceous sedimentary rocks of the Transvaal Supergroup. The youngest rocks are the Karoo Supergroup and the Quaternary sedimentary cover.\nMultivariate statistical modelling was carried out to produce groundwater prospectivity map of the area. In addition, groundwater quality was assessed using hydrochemical and environmental isotopes. The statistical modelling includes data-driven and knowledge-based approaches. The data-driven approach includes artificial neural networks (ANNs), weights of evidence (WoE) and logistic regression (LG), while the knowledge-based approach involves the use of fuzzy logic. The two statistical modellings were applied to five evidential themes that include geology, structures, geomorphology, land-use and soil types.\nThe data-driven approach provided nearly similar results showing lithologic units and fracture connectivity play a key role in controlling groundwater occurrence. The influence of lithology is significant in the southern part of the area, while fracture connectivity play important role in controlling groundwater occurrence within the crystalline rocks that are situated in the central and northern parts of the area. In general, the results of multivariate statistical modelling show number of groundwater potential zones varying from very good to very poo. The zone shown as very good and goodgroundwater potential covers ~17% and ~22% of the study area, respectively. These zones correspond to carbonate rocks located in the southern part of the area where percolating rainwater developed large cavities that can store and supply significant volume of water.\nThe integration of various data sets in the present study provided valuable information about the groundwater resource potential of the area. This approach can be used as a frame of reference for characterization of groundwater potential in similar hydrogeological setting.",

            "abstract": "During a 10-month field campaign, we used a total reactive atmospheric nitrogen (ΣNr) converter (TRANC) coupled to a fast-response chemiluminescence detector to measure ΣNr concentrations and fluxes between a peatland ecosystem and the atmosphere. Oxidized Nr species such as NOx, HONO, HNO2, aerosol NO3 and reduced Nr species such as NH3, aerosol NH4 were converted to NO with the total exchange flux being determined using the eddy-covariance technique. The field site was part of a natural park with a very small remaining protected zone of less than 2 km x 2 km. The park was surrounded by an area of intensive agricultural land use. Total Nr concentrations were mainly varying between 20 and 60 ppb with peak values of up to 120 ppb coinciding with the main fertilization periods on the neighboring agricultural land in early spring and fall. The trend in weekly averaged ΣNr concentrations from TRANC measurements was in good agreement with results from KAPS denuder filter systems when the latter were combined with the missing and apparently highly variable NOx contribution. Wind direction and land use in the closer vicinity clearly regulated whether total Nr concentrations were NH3 or NOx-dominated. Values of monthly averaged diurnal flux courses ranged between -40 and +20 ng N m-2 s-1 with the majority of fluxes showing net deposition of ΣNr to the land surface. The cumulative net exchange of ΣNr at the end of the observation period resulted in an uptake of the ecosystem of only ~1 kg N ha-1 with intermittent periods showing net ΣNr release. This is an indicator for an oversaturation of this N-limited ecosystem caused by agricultural practices such as livestock production and fertilization. Bog plants were temporarily not capable of taking up the surplus nitrogen from the atmosphere, which highlights the importance for a reformulation of protection guidelines for vulnerable ecosystems such as peatlands.",

            "abstract": "Scenario calculations show that the rural population is more vulnerable to earthquake disasters because of their comparatively weak building stock. For calculating damage due to strong ground shaking, the building stock is modeled separately for different countries and in each country separately in three settlement size classes. It is generally understood that cities contain more buildings that are resistant to strong shaking than villages. A corollary of this observation is that villagers are more likely to be killed by their collapsing homes than city dwellers. The quantitative excess of the vulnerability of villagers compared to city dwellers varies as a function of the following parameters: (1) Country, (2) epicentral distance, and (3) earthquake magnitude, in addition to the quality of the built environment. For estimating quantitatively the difference of mortality in villages compared to cities, we used the building stock as modeled in the earthquake loss estimating tool QLARM. For the scenario calculations, the epicenters and depths of recent large or damaging earthquakes were selected and their magnitudes were set to M7.5, in cases where the magnitude of the historic event had been smaller. The countries for which we estimated the excess rural mortality included: Algeria, China, Greece, Guatemala, India, Iran, Mexico and Turkey. In all of these countries and for all distances the mortality rate was found to be larger in the villages. Depending on the parameters (1), (2) and (3), the percentage of fatalities in villages was higher by 20% to 97% than in cities. In the case of Greece, where the QLARM data are the most detailed, a clear function of the per cent of fatalities as a function of settlement size emerged. Because indigenous peoples live typically in small settlements, these findings mean that the indigenous population is exposed to a greater earthquake risk than the average population. Although it is understandable that earthquake risk mitigation has focused on megacities, the conclusion of this study is that the rural population needs more help in earthquake risk mitigation than the urban population.",

            "abstract": "The movement of liquid water in unsaturated snow is a complex and highly heterogeneous process, due to positive feedback mechanisms that lead to distinct flow pathways. A combination of gravitational and capillary forces, combined with small scale spatial variability, causes liquid water to concentrate into sub-meter vertical channels and along stratigraphic boundaries that lead to complicated patterns of volumetric water content. Hydraulic conductivity increases significantly with liquid water content, leading to preferential flow along established pathways. We designed controlled experiments to explore the role of slope-parallel flow of liquid water in unsaturated snow, along layer boundaries, to improve understanding of potential lateral mass redistribution during rapid melt and rain-on-snow events on ice sheets, glaciers and in seasonal snow. We characterized snow structure and monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of liquid water during snowmelt and rain-on-snow events using high-resolution radars, micropenetrometry, near-infrared and time-lapse photography, in-situ dielectric probes, and stable isotopes. We used the seasonal snowpack as a natural laboratory, and collected water outflow with lysimeter arrays designed to quantify the amount of water moving laterally. A co-located full energy-balance weather station provides forcing inputs for modeling, and the degree of lateral flow is also evaluated by monitoring the evolution of soil moisture with a permenantly installed ERT array and multiple dielectric probes in the soil at the base of the snowpack. Improved understanding of liquid water dynamics in unsaturated snow and firn is required for accurate modeling of the percolation zone mass balance on ice sheets and polar glaciers, the timing of wet snow avalanches, and flooding caused by mid-winter rain on seasonal snow.",

            "abstract": "An important outcome of the 4-year Preparatory Phase of the ESFRI project European Plate Observing System (EPOS) was the development and first implementation of the EPOS Demonstrator by the project’s ICT Working Group 7. The Demonstrator implements the vertical integration of the three-layer architectural scheme for EPOS, connecting the Integrated Core Services (ICS), Thematic Core Services (TCS) and the National Research Infrastructures (NRI). The demonstrator provides a single GUI with central key discovery and query functionalities, based on already existing services by the seismic, geologic and geodetic communities.\nMore specifically the seismic services of the Demonstrator utilize webservices and APIs for data and discovery of raw seismic data (FDSN webservices by the EIDA Network), events (Geoportal by EMSC) and analytical data products (e.g., hazard maps by EFEHR via OGC WMS). For geologic services, the EPOS Demonstrator accesses OneGeology Europe which serves the community with geologic maps and point information via OGC webservices. The Demonstrator also provides access to raw geodetic data via a newly developed universal tool called GSAC.\nThe Demonstrator itself resembles the future Integrated Core Service (ICS) and provides direct access to the end user. Its core functionality lies in a metadata catalogue, which serves as the central information hub and stores information about all RIs, related persons, projects, financial background and technical access information. The database schema of the catalogue is based on CERIF, which has been slightly adapted. Currently, the portal provides basic query functions as well as cross domain search. [www.epos.cineca.it]",

            "abstract": "The use of an ecosystem service framework for natural resource management has gained increasing traction in the public sector. This is of especial interest in cities as residual ecosystems - typically located along creeks and estuaries, or remaining in scattered pockets throughout the urban area – offer some of the highest value social and economic returns per capita for the land area they occupy, yet are often impractical to manage from more traditional approaches to conservation. We posit that the well-being of humans and other species is the outcome of healthy, functioning ecosystems, and that, from a policy perspective, it is essential to consider services in this context.\nWe arrange ecosystem services into three categories: life-enabling, life-sustaining and life-fulfilling, in a modification to the categories of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and identify additional eco-services unique to urban areas. At local scale, these contribute to the well-being of city residents and positively affect quality of life, forming essential elements of urban liveability. However, dynamics of co-located built and natural environments challenge the capacity of ecosystems to function and provide their full suite of services. Using Sydney as an example, we outline a modular framework of socio-ecological systems and places to show how eco-services supporting liveability can be considered in conceptual and physical space. At a policy level, framing systems-based management objectives that protect, improve and re-discover desirable ecosystem services within the city (as opposed to further increasing the environmental footprint outside), will allow for unique, positive, socially-enabling outcomes for urban centres, in Australia, and globally.",

In particular, two work packages (geochemical experiments and modelling) hosted at the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) focus on the possible impact of hydrogen on formation fluids and on the mineralogical, geochemical and petrophysical properties of reservoirs and caprocks.\nLaboratory experiments expose core samples from several potential reservoirs to pure hydrogen or hydrogen mixtures under site-specific conditions (temperatures up to 200 °C and pressure up to 300 bar). The resulting qualitative and, whereas possible, quantitative data are expected to ameliorate the precision of predictive geochemical and reactive transport modelling, which is also performed within the project.\nThe combination of experiments and models will improve the knowledge about: (1) solubility model and mixing rule for of hydrogen and its gas mixtures in high saline formation fluids; (2) hydrogen reactivity in a broad spectrum of P-T conditions; (3) thermodynamics and kinetics of mineral dissolution or precipitation reactions and redox processes. It is known that under specific P-T conditions reactions between hydrogen and anorganic rock components such as carbonates can occur. However these conditions have never been precisely defined to date.\nA precise estimation of the hydrogen impact on reservoir behavior of different siliciclastic rock types is crucial for site selection and optimization of storage depth. Enhancing the overall understanding of such systems will benefit the operational reliability, the ecological tolerance, and the economic efficiency of future energy storing plants, crucial aspects for public acceptance and for industrial investors.",

            "abstract": "The significance of shales as unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs has opened new research frontiers in geosciences. Among many of its unique physical properties, elastic anisotropy in shales has long been investigated by both experimental and computational approaches. Shales is highly anisotropic due to texture (crystallographic preferred orientation) of their constituent clay minerals. Moreover, texturing is known to cause fracture anisotropy, which can affect both fracture toughness and fracture orientations in metals, ceramics, and polyphase materials. However, the relationship between texture and fracture anisotropy in shale has not been explored. In this study we use the multi-anvil deformation tool (D-DIA) to deform shales with a range of clay and silt contents to failure while collecting x-ray diffraction and radiography images. Diffraction images are used to extract to texture and lattice strain evolution while radiography are used to measure macrostrain and determine failure. Since clay mineral have shear moduli in the range of 6-17 GPa, our stress resolution is in the range of 30 -100 MPa respectively, within the range of unconfined compressive strengths of shales. Our results show that the orientation of clay minerals become more prominent in all samples upon deforming the sample at 100 MPa. Recovered samples are investigated with SEM to document microstructural changes. A second deformation experiment will be coupled with ultrasonic and acoustic emissions measurements to make direct comparisons of elastic anisotropy and understand the role of fracture on anisotropy. Acoustic emissions allows us to locate damage initiation and determine fracture orientations in-situ. This information will be compared with texture data to determine fracture anisotropy in our samples.",

            "abstract": "Sprites are composed of individual streamer discharges (e.g., Pasko, 2010) which split into exponentially growing streamer tips (McHarg et al., 2010). The acceleration of the electrons to a few eV results in the radiation of a small amount of electromagnetic energy. The incoherent superposition of many streamers causes the low frequency radio noise from sprites near ~40 km height (Qin et al., 2012). The presence of this theoretically predicted radiation was recently confirmed by low frequency radio noise measurements during dancing sprites with a very sensitive radio receiver (Fullekrug et al., 2013). To locate the radio noise from sprites in the sky, an interferometric network of low frequency radio receivers was developed (Mezentsev and Fullekrug, JGR, 2013). The key parameter for the interferometric signal processing is the frequency dependent wave propagation velocity of the radio waves within the Earth's atmosphere. This wave propagation velocity is determined by the wave number vector which needs to be inferred from the measurements. Here we adapt and subsequently apply array analyses which have been developed for seismic and infrasound arrays to determine the horizontal wave number vectors of ~20-24 kHz radio waves measured with an array of ten radio receivers distributed over an area of ~1 km × 1 km. It is found that the horizontal slowness of ~20-24 kHz radio waves ranges from ~2.7 ns/m to ~4.1 ns/m depending on the arrival azimuth of the radio wave. For comparison, an electromagnetic wave in vacuum has a slowness of ~3.34 ns/m. A larger slowness indicates an apparent velocity which is smaller than the speed of light and a smaller slowness indicates that the radio wave arrives at the array from an elevation angle. The observed variability of the observed slowness almost certainly results from the distance dependent superposition of the transverse electric and magnetic TEn and TMn radio wave propagation modes.",

An on-line analytical technique for measuring nitramines in industrial emissions and in ambient air is thus in high demand.\nProton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) is a state-of-the-art technique for on-line measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. Herein, we report on the use of high mass resolution proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) for on-line analysis of nitramines. We generated a mass spectral library from a series of nitramines and investigated the analytical performance of PTR-ToF-MS in terms of sensitivity, precision, accuracy and detection limit. We will discuss limitations of the innovative technique and propose measurement strategies for future emission and ambient measurements.",

            "abstract": "The necessity of study on the tsunami hazard assessment for Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) site was suggested since the event of Fukushima in 2011 had been occurred. It has being emphasized because all of the NPPs in Korean Peninsula are located in coastal region. The tsunami hazard is regarded as the annual exceedance probability for the wave heights. The methodology for analysis of tsunami hazard is based on the seismic hazard analysis. The seismic hazard analysis had been performed by using both deterministic and probabilistic method. Recently, the probabilistic method had been received more attention than the deterministic method because the uncertainties of hazard analysis could be considered by using the logic tree approach.\nIn this study, the probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis for Uljin NPP site was performed by using the information of fault sources which was published by Atomic Energy Society of Japan (AESJ). The wave parameter is the most different parameter with seismic hazard. It could be estimated from the results of tsunami propagation analysis. The TSUNAMI_ver1.0 which was developed by Japan nuclear energy safety organization (JNES), was used for the tsunami simulation. The 80 cases tsunami simulations were performed and then the wave parameters were estimated. For reducing the sensitivity which was encouraged by location of sampling point, the wave parameters were estimated from group of sampling points.\nThe probability density function on the tsunami height was computed by using the recurrence intervals and the wave parameters. And then the exceedance probability distribution was calculated from the probability density function. The tsunami hazards for the sampling groups were calculated. The fractile curves which were shown the uncertainties of input parameters were estimated from the hazards by using the round-robin algorithm. In general, tsunami hazard analysis is focused on the maximum wave heights. But the minimum wave height should be considered for the tsunami hazard analysis on the NPP site since it is connected with water intake system. The results of tsunami hazard analysis for the NPP site was suggested by the annual exceedance probability with the wave heights. This study shows that the PTHA method could be applied for the estimation of tsunami wave height in NPP sites\n ",

            "abstract": "Lake Nam Co, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at the intersection of the Westerlies and the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon, is well suited to study the monsoonal regime over different time scales. High-resolution and continuous sedimentary records from the Tibetan Plateau are still rare and only few reach back to the Last Glacial Maximum. For Nam Co, numerous multiproxy studies unravel the regional paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental history for the past 24,000 years. These promising results demonstrate the potential of Lake Nam Co as a geoarchive, but nature, thickness and geologic time of the sediment fill have not yet been determined.\nTherefore the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the Universities of Bremen and Jena jointly carried out an airgun multichannel seismic survey at Nam Co in June/July 2014. As main equipment, a micro GI Gun(2 x 0.1 L) was used in conjunction with a 64 m long seismic streamer (32 channels/2 m spacing) to achieve deep signal penetration, to confirm a thick sediment infill and to prove the suitability for deep coring of several hundred meters. Although only few lines could be shot due to technical and weather issues, several lines particularly from the deepest part of the lake provide new insight.\nPreliminary data processing and interpretation reveal a well layered sediment cover of >700 m in the center of the lake. Seismic facies appears to vary in a cyclic manner, indicating a coupling to climatically-driven changes in lake level and sediment delivery. From a comparison with the Holocene/Late Glacial sedimentary and seismic record, several similar units could be imaged. Furthermore, rapid sedimentation is confirmed from the continuous cover of growth faults and doming, and continuous sedimentation throughout glacial/interglacial cycles appears likely due to the absence of erosional unconformities. By tentatively assigning these units to marine isotope stages, different seismostratigraphies can be developed assuming average sedimentation rates of 0.4 mm a-1 to 1.7 mm a-1, resp.. This compares well with results determined on a sediment core showing sedimentation rates between 0.1 and 2.4 mm a-1. Accordingly, geologic ages of >400 or >1660 ka, respectively, may be potentially reached by drilling.",

We combine experiments in which we track parcels of dyed fluid, with carefully calibrated light attenuation experiments in which we measure the evolution of the salinity throughout the current. We thereby determine where mixing occurs and how it impacts the flow by drawing together experimental measurements of head concentration, current volume and Froude number as well as the lateral and vertical variations of salinity and depth throughout the current over time. Entrainment and dilution may be key in assessing the hazards of a dense gas release and in modelling the dynamics of particle laden flows.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic Rossby waves are the main way by which information is transmitted in the zonal direction. As a result, they set up the response time of the ocean to changes and are essential in understanding the climate system. Although surface characteristics of Rossby waves have been widely studied thanks to advances in satellite observations, their vertical structure is poorly known. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to give some insight on their vertical structure and, more broadly, on the vertical structure of large scale sea surface height anomalies.\nA linear model based on the quasi-geostrophic equations is thus constructed. The subsurface field is reconstructed from sea surface height and climatological stratification. The solution is calculated in periodic rectangular regions with a 3D discrete Fourier transform. The effect of the mean flow on Rossby waves is neglected, which we believe is a reasonable approximation for low latitudes. The method used has been tested with an idealized double gyre simulation (performed with the MICOM ocean model). The linear model is able to give reasonable predictions of subsurface currents at low latitudes (below approximately 30°) and for relatively weak mean flow. However, the predictions degrade with stronger mean flows and higher latitudes. The subsurface velocities calculated with our model using AVISO altimetric data and velocities from current meters have also been compared. Results show that the model gives reasonably accurate results away from the top and bottom boundaries, side boundaries and far from western boundary currents. We found for the regions where the model is valid, an energy partition of the traditional modes of approximately 67% in the barotropic mode and 25% in the first baroclinic mode. Only 20% of the observed kinetic energy can be attributed to free Rossby waves of long periods that propagate energy to the west. A large part of this energy lies between the curves of the free waves dispersion relationships. Therefore raising the question of the mechanism responsible of this energy distribution.",

            "abstract": "Trails in the mud-cracked surface of Racetrack Playa have been scored by hundreds of rocks up to 320 kg, but the mechanism of movement is debated. In Winter 2013-2014, we observed rocks in motion associated with a transient pool formed by winter precipitation. The pond was 7 cm deep on the southern edge of the playa, tapering to a mud flat to the north. Freezing during cold winter nights formed floating “windowpane” ice 3-5 mm thick. Rocks repeatedly moved on sunny days under light winds of 3-5 m/second, as the ice broke up near midday and was set into motion by wind stress on melt pools and the ice surface. Ice panels shoved rocks along the mud like a tugboat, sometimes forming moving imbricated ice piles upstream of the rocks and in other cases moving faster than the rocks and forming brash-filled leads downstream. GPS units mounted in experimental rocks recorded a creeping pace of 2-6 m/minute, a speed that made it difficult to observe trail formation visually.\nThe 2013-2014 pond formed on November 20-24 and persisted through early February 2014. During this time rocks were observed moving at least five times, and studies of “stiz marks” formed by rocks at the ends of trail segments show that there were likely 3-5 additional move events. Observed travel times ranged from a few seconds to 16 minutes. In one event, two experimental rocks 153 m apart began moving simultaneously and traveled 64.1 and 65.6 m respectively, ultimately moving 157-162 m in subsequent events. Rock motion depends on the creation of winter pools sufficiently deep to allow the formation of floating ice and exposed to the light winds and sun needed for ice breakup. The combination of these events is extremely rare, leading to highly episodic trail formation. Our observations differ from previous hypotheses in that the rocks were moved by thinner ice, at slower speeds, and by lighter winds than predicted.",

Based on this alarming observation, the reconstruction of natural variability of past sea-ice cover and its forcing became a major focus of international scientific research. Here, we present a high-resolution biomarker approach over the last 4 ka from the East Greenland Shelf to investigate the interrelationship between sea-ice cover, meltwater/freshwater discharge and primary productivity. The phytoplankton-derived sea-ice proxy IP25 (Belt et al., 2007) points to a late Holocene cooling trend initiated around 1.5 ka which is interrupted by a period of reduced sea-ice cover centred around 1 ka. The latter might be related to the well known Medieval Warm Period. Our new results from the East Greenland Shelf will be compared with similar records from the Fram Strait area published by Müller et al., (2012). These data give information about differences and/or similarities of sea-ice variability and changes in productivity in the area influenced by the cold East Greenland Current and the warm Westspitsbergen Current, respectively. First data suggest a time lag of the Neoglacial cooling between western (Greenland side) and eastern (Westspitsbergen-side) of Fram Strait, as also proposed by Müller et al. (2012).\n",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea Fault System changes its orientation across Lebanon and forms a restraining bend. The oblique deformation along the Lebanese restraining bend is characterized by a complex suite of tectonic structures, among which, the Yammouneh Fault (YF), is believed to be the main strand that relays deformation from the southern section to the northern section of the Dead Sea Fault System. However, uncertainties regarding slip rates and strain partitioning in Lebanon still prevail. Here, we use morphometric analysis together with analytical and numerical models to constrain rates and modes of distributed and localized deformation along the Lebanese restraining bend.\nThe rivers that drain the western flank of Mount Lebanon show a consistent counterclockwise rotation with respect to an expected orogen perpendicular orientation. Moreover, a pattern of divide disequilibrium in between these rivers emerges from an application of the χ mapping technique, which aims at estimating the degree of geometrical and topological disequilibrium in river networks. These geometrical patterns are compatible with simulation results using a landscape evolution model, which imposes a distributed velocity field along a domain that represents the western flank of Mount Lebanon.\nWe further develop an analytical model that relates the river orientation to a set of kinematic parameters that represents a combined pure and simple shear strain field, and we find the parameters that best explain the present orientation of the western Lebanon rivers. Our results indicate that distributed deformation to the west of the YF takes as much as 30% of the relative Arabia-Sinai plate velocity since the late Miocene, and that the average slip rate along the YF during the same time interval has been 3.8-4.4 mm/yr. The theoretical model can further explain the inferred rotation from Paleomagnetic measurements.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming over the 20th century has caused drastic changes in mountain glaciers globally, and of the Himalayan glaciers in particular. The stakes are high; glaciers and ice caps are the largest contributor to the increase in the mass of the world's oceans, and the Himalayas play a key role in the hydrology of the region, impacting on the economy, food safety and flood risk. Partial monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers has revealed a mixed picture; while many of the Himalayan glaciers are retreating, in some cases locally stable or advancing glaciers in this region have also been observed. But recent controversies have highlighted the need to understand the glaciers dynamic and its relationship with climate change in the region.\nEarth Observation provides a mean for global and long-term monitoring of mountain glaciers’ dynamics. In the frame of the Dragon program, a partnership between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Chinese Center for Earth Observation (NRSCC), we begun a monitoring program aimed at quantifying multidecadal changes in glaciers’ flow at the scale of the entire Himalayas and Karakoram from a 40 years’ archive of Earth Observation. Ultimately, the provision of a global and time-sensitive glaciers velocity product will help to understand the evolution of the Himalayan glaciers in lights of glaciological (e.g. presence of debris-cover, surges, proglacial lakes) and climatic conditions.\nHere we present a region-wide analysis of annual and seasonnal glacier flow velocity covering the Pamir-Karakoram-Himalaya region obtained from the analysis of the entire archive of Landsat data. Over 90% of the ice-covered regions, as defined by the Randolph Glacier Inventory, are measured, with precision on the retrieved velocity of the order of 2 m/yr. We show that the first order temporal evolution of glacier flow mirrors the pattern of glacier mass balance. We observe a general decrease of ice velocity in regions of known ice mass loss, and a more complex patterns consisting of mixed acceleration and decrease of ice velocity in regions that are known to be affected by stable mass balance and surge-like behavior.",

            "abstract": "In semi-arid areas like the Sahel, perennial water bodies and temporary-flooded lowlands are critical for a number of activities. In some cases, their existence is simply a necessary condition for human societies to establish. They also play an important role in the water and carbon cycle and have strong ecological values.\nAs a result of the strong multi-decadal drought that impacted the Sahel in the 70' to 90', a paradoxical increase of ponds and surface runoff has been observed (\"Less rain, more water in the ponds\", Gardelle 2010). In spite of this, there are excessively few data documenting the consequence of such a paradox on the water and carbon cycle. Here we present 2 years of eddy covariance data collected over the Kelma flooded Acacia forest in the Sahel (15.50 °N), in the frame of the AMMA project. The flooded forest is compared to the other major component of this Sahelian landscape: a grassland and a rocky outcrop sites. All sites are involved in the ALMIP2 data/LSM model comparison.\nThe seasonal cycle of the flooded forest strongly departs from the surroundings grassland and bare soil sites. Before the rain season, the forest displays the strongest net radiation and sensible heat flux. Air temperature within the canopy reaches extremely high values. During the flood, it turns to the lowest sensible heat flux. In fact, due to an oasis effect, this flux is negative during the late flood. Water fluxes turn from almost zero in the dry season to strong evaporation during the flood, since it uses additional energy provided by negative sensible heat flux. The eddy covariance fluxes are consistent with sap flow data, showing that the flood greatly increases the length of the growing season. CO2 fluxes over the forest were twice as large as over the grassland, and the growing season was also longer, giving a much larger annual photosynthesis.\nIn view of these data and data over surroundings grasslands and bare soil, as well as data from a long-term ecological survey, we discuss the importance of the flooded forest in terms of fluxes and productivity.",

            "abstract": "The presence of mesoscopic heterogeneities, such as fractures, in fluid-saturated porous rocks can produce measurable seismoelectric signals due to wave-induced fluid flow between regions of differing compressibility. Wave-induced fluid flow is a well-known seismic attenuation mechanism, which evidences a strong frequency-dependence that is related to petrophysical and structural properties of the host rock. Therefore, seismoelectric signals arising from this mechanism are expected to depend on the same kind of parameters. However, these remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a numerical approach for computing seismoelectric signals related to the presence of mesoscopic heterogeneities and explore its spectroscopic behavior. To obtain the explicit dependence of the seismoelectric signal on petrophysical and structural parameters, we derive an analytical solution to describe the seismoelectric response of a rock sample containing a horizontal layer at its center that is subjected to an oscillatory compressibility test. We then adapt this general solution to compute the seismoelectric signature of a particular case related to a sample that is permeated by a horizontal fracture. We find that the amplitude of the seismoelectric signal is directly proportional to the applied stress, to the Skempton coefficient contrast between the host rock and the layer, and to a weighted average of the effective excess charge of the two materials. Our results also demonstrate that the frequency at which the maximum electrical potential amplitude prevails is controlled by the permeability and thickness of the less permeable material. The results of this study thus indicate that seismoelectric measurements can potentially be used to estimate key mechanical and hydraulic rock properties, such as compressibility, permeability, and fracture normal compliance.",

Proper implementation of validation requires knowledge of the uncertainty associated with the separated GPP at different time scales so that the error bar can be calculated. We estimate the uncertainty in GPP at half-hourly to yearly time scales. This is separated from the 3 years of continuous flux tower NEE measurements at the Speulderbos forest site, The Netherlands. We use a numerically efficient flux partitioning method (FPM) for GPP separation. FPM uses non-linear regression, based on the non-rectangular hyperbola equation. It was fitted to the measured NEE data on a daily basis. Parameters of the regression model were assumed to vary within a given year. FPM includes the factors influencing GPP, in particular radiation, vapor pressure deficit, degree of curvature of the light response curve and temperature. We implemented a Monte Carlo based bootstrap approach to estimate the uncertainty in the separated GPP at a half-hourly time scale. The expected results of this approach generated the empirical distribution of GPP at each half-hour. Together with its statistical properties, this provided estimates of uncertainty. The time series of empirical distributions of half-hourly GPP also allowed the estimation of the uncertainty at daily, monthly and yearly time scales.\nOur research provided a robust integration of numerically efficient FPM and Monte Carlo approach to estimate uncertainty in GPP at different time scales. This will provide relevant and important information for the validation of process-based simulators. It will be applied at the Speulderbos forest site, The Netherlands.",

Two of several recently developed analysis techniques that allow insight into these processes at their appropriate scale are an Eulerian method of directly measuring entrainment and detrainment, and a Lagrangian method that uses particle trajectories to map convective mass flux over height and a cloud variable of interest. The authors of the Eulerian technique used it to show that the dynamics of shells of cold, humid air that surround shallow convective updrafts have important effects on the properties of air entrained and detrained from the updrafts. There is some evidence for the existence of such shells around deep convective updrafts as well, and that detrainment is more important than entrainment in determining the ultimate effect of the deep convection on the large scale environment. We present results from analyzing a simulation of deep convection through the Eulerian method as well as using Lagrangian particle trajectories to illustrate the role of the shell in the process of detrainment and mixing between deep convection and its environment.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence from numerical studies that anthropogenic land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC) can potentially induce significant variations on the regional scale climate. However, the magnitude of these variations likely depends on the local strength of the coupling between the surface and the atmosphere, the magnitude of the surface biophysical changes and how the key processes linking the surface with the atmosphere are parameterized within a particular model framework. One key hot-spot which has received considerable attention is the Sahelian region of West Africa, for which numerous studies have reported a significant increase in anthropogenic pressure on the already limited natural resources in this region, notably in terms of land use conversion and degradation. Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand the impacts of potential land degradation on the West African Monsoon (WAM) system.\nOne of the main goals of the West African Monsoon Modeling andEvaluation project phase 2 (WAMMEII) is to provide basic understandingof LULCC on the regional climate over West Africa, and to evaluate thesensitivity of the seasonal variability of the WAM to LULCC. Theprescribed LULCC is based on recent 50 year period which represents amaximum feasible degradation scenario. In the current study, the LULCCis applied to five state of the art global climate models over afive-year period. The imposed LULCC results in a model-average 5-7%increase in surface albedo: the corresponding lower surface netradiation mainly results in a significant reduction in surfaceevaporation (upwards of 1 mm per day over a large part of the Sahel)which leads to less convective heating of the atmosphere, lowermoisture convergence, increased subsidence and reduced cloud coverover the LULCC zone. The overall impact can be characterized as asubstantial drought effect resulting in a reduction in annual rainfallof 20-40% in the Sahel and a southward shift of the monsoon. In broadagreement with previous studies, the impact of degradation on theregional climate is found to be variable among the different coupledmodels, however, the signal is stronger and a more consistent betweenthe models here which is likely related to our emphasis onprioritizing a consistent impact on the biophysical properties of thesurface.",

            "abstract": "Probabilistic inverse problems and geostatistical modeling rely on trustworthy prior information. The choice of prior distribution may have a considerably impact on uncertainty quantification for such modeling problems. For these problems, prior information is expressed by a probability distribution over the parameters describing the earth system. In practice, prior information is often given as incomplete knowledge extracted from one or a few realizations (e.g., training images) from the assumed underlying stochastic process describing the subsurface. From such information, approximate marginal distributions from this unknown underlying process can be derived (by assuming the underlying process to be stationary) in form of e.g. semivariograms (i.e., 2D marginals) or multiple-point-based pattern histograms (i.e., >2D marginals). We discuss how to determine a joint probability distribution that describes this underlying process (i.e., a prior probability distribution) that is consistent with the known marginal distributions obtained from the training image(s). It turns out that the general problem of determining a joint probability distribution that is consistent with such known marginal distributions is underdetermined. Consequently, infinitely many possible joint (prior) distributions exist that that are consistent with these marginals. We investigate some sampling algorithms, which sample prior distributions based on training image statistics, and find that they do not produce samples that are consistent with training image (marginal) statistics. Finally, we show examples of using subjective chosen constraints, such as the Gaussian assumption or Markov properties, to supplement the marginals in order to build a well-defined prior distribution.",

In order to investigate the sensitivity of the MLT region to winds, waves, and tides generated in the troposphere and stratosphere, we have been developing techniques to drive UCL’s Coupled Middle Atmosphere and Thermosphere (CMAT2) GCM with a series of meteorological models and reanalyses.\nTwo such models are the UK Met Office’s Unified Model (UM), and the NRL NOGAPS-ALPHA reanalysis. In this study we couple these models with CMAT2 using Newtonian Relaxation in the overlapping lower/middle atmosphere regions. We demonstrate the variability imposed on the MLT region through a more realistic lower atmosphere representation when compared with the use of parameterised tidal and gravity wave schemes commonly used in GCMs. By running an ensemble of UM simulations, we show the sensitivity of the MLT region to different SSWs before, during, and after the onset of these events. Furthermore, we run the UM in forecast mode to investigate how migrating and non-migrating tides during both ‘quiet times’, and SSW events influence the behaviour of the MLT region.",

            "abstract": "In the current age where water authorities no longer blindly design and maintain all infrastructure just to meet a certain standardized return period, accurate estimation of potential flood damage is important in decision making with regards to flood prevention measures.\nWe identify three issues with current methods of estimating flood damages. Firstly, common practice is to assume that for a given land use type, damage is mainly dependent on inundation depth, and sometimes flow velocity. We recognize that depending on the type of land use inundation depth, velocity, flood duration, season, detour time and recovery time influences the amount of damage significantly. Secondly, setting stage-damage curves is usually left to an end user and can thus vary between different water authorities within a single country. What was needed at a national level is a common way of calculating flood damages, so different prevention measures can be fairly compared. Finally, most flood models use relatively large grid cells, usually in the order of 25 m2 or coarser. Especially in urban areas this leads to obvious errors: different land uses (shops, housing, park, are all classified as “urban” and treated equally.\nTo tackle these issues we developed a web-based model which can be accessed via www.waterschadeschatter.nl (water schade schatter is Dutch for water damage estimator). It includes all necessary data sources to calculate the damage of any potential flood in the Netherlands. It uses different damage functions for different land use types, which the user can, but need not change. It runs on 0.25m2 grid cells. Both the datasets required and the amount of calculation needed is more than a desktop computer can handle. In order to start a calculation a user needs to upload the relevant flood information to the website. The calculation is divided over several multicore servers, after which the user will receive an email with a link to the results of his calculations.\nOur presentation will include a life demonstration of our online model.",

However, grain size distributions in the fine fraction have not been studied in sufficient detail to understand different transport and sedimentation patterns. Here we present analysis of fine fraction grain size spectrums in middle and late Quaternary sediments recovered from a suite of cores collected from the Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean that span a large range of water depths (>3000 to <1000 m). The grain size data are plotted in 3D, resembling a topographic map, which greatly facilitates interpretation. Glacial periods are characterized as distinct coarsening events with larger variability, down to the marine isotope stage 6/7 boundary. Below this level, glacial and interglacial periods are marked by more distinct changes in the silt and clay fractions. Throughout the record, the coarser intervals are distinct in all studied grain sizes, i.e. when the >63 um increases, clay and silt also show coarsening, which has been described previously, but is more clearly visible in our 3D-visualization of the particle size distributions. This supports previous studies showing that this pattern is consistent with grain size distributions in modern sea-ice. The results strengthen the evidence that a large portion of the silt in the central Arctic Ocean is transported by sea ice. Similar results are found in stratigraphically aligned intervals from cores recovered from widely differing water depths, possibly providing a means to differentiate influences of sea ice rafting from current controlled sorting.",

            "abstract": "The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of landscape scale greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. Due to low temperatures and short residence times limiting in-stream production in northern headwater catchments, much of the exported carbon is likely to be allochthonous, transported via throughflow to the surface drainage system. Identifying sources and primary flow pathways is therefore essential in understanding and predicting changes in the aquatic flux magnitude. Arctic landscapes are now widely recognised as being particularly vulnerable to climate driven changes. The HYDRA project (“Permafrost catchments in transition: hydrological controls on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas budgets”) aims to understand the fundamental role that hydrological processes play in regulating landscape-scale carbon fluxes, and predict how changes in vegetation and active layer depth in permafrost environments influence the delivery and export of aquatic carbon.\nIn this study we present aquatic concentrations and fluxes of carbon and GHG species collected across two field seasons (2013, 2014) from an arctic headwater catchment in northern Canada. Measured species include dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. Measurements were made across a range of freshwater types within the tundra landscape, including lakes, ice-wedge polygons, and the ‘Siksik’ stream which drains the (c.a. 1 km2) primary study catchment. A nested sub-catchment approach was used along the ‘Siksik’ stream; ‘snapshot’ sampling of eight points along the stream length allowed specific vegetation communities to be targeted to assess individually their contribution to aquatic export. A combination of stable isotopes and major ion concentrations measured at each sampling point provide additional information to trace source areas and flow paths within the main study catchment.\nCatchment scale evasion and downstream export were calculated and an initial comparison between the relative importance of different water body types presented.",

Some climate models predict more recurrent climate anomalies in this century, which may alter the functioning of tropical forests with serious structural and demographic implications. The present study aimed to evaluate the profile of tree growth and litterfall production in an eastern Amazon forest, which has suffered recent climatic disturbances. We contrasted different functional groups based on wood density (stem with 0.55; 0.56-0.7; >0.7 g cm-3), light availability (crown illumination index; high illuminated crown - IIC1 until shaded crown – IIC5), and, size class (trees 10-22.5; 22.6-35; 35.1-55; 55,1-90; >90 cm dbh). Tree diameter increment was monthly measured from November 2011 to September 2013 by using dendrometer bands installed on 850 individuals from different families. Litterfall was collected in 64 circular traps, oven dried and weighed, separated into leaves, twigs, reproductive parts and miscellaneous. During the rainy season the sampled trees had the highest rates of tree diametric increment. When analyzing the data by functional groups, large trees had faster growth, but when grouped by wood density, trees with wood density up to 0.55 and between 0.56 and 0.7 g cm-3 had the fastest rates of growth. When grouped by crown illumination index, trees exposed to higher levels of light grew more in comparison to partially shaded trees. Maximum daily air temperature and precipitation were the most important environmental variables in determining the diametric increment profile of the trees. Litterfall production was estimated to be 7.1 Mg ha-1.year-1 and showed a strong seasonal pattern, with dry season production being higher than in the rainy season. Leaves formed the largest fraction of the litterfall, followed by twigs, reproductive parts, and finally miscellaneous. These results show that the profile of tree diametric growth and litterfall production are recorded at close intervals in the preterit analyzes in the same study area and highlights the efficiency of functional groups in determining the tree growth profile.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a technology to isolate CO2 from atmosphere, by capturing it from sources, transporting it to injection area, and injecting it into suitable geological formation, ocean, or mineral carbonation plant. Geological storage of carbon dioxide is the most effective and economical method, and until now a lot of demonstration projects were carried out successfully such as Sleipner, Weyburn, and In Salah. In Republic of Korea, small-scale CO2 injection demonstration project is now under investigation in offshore Pohang Basin with sandstone reservoir and the mudstone caprock. When CO2 is injected in target site, the rock around injection well can be deteriorated because of extreme change of temperature and pressure. In this study supercritical CO2 was injected in sandstone specimen and the initiation and propagation of fracture inside the specimens were observed using X-ray computed tomography (CT). X-ray CT method is a computer technology to observe inner density of target object in three dimensional image. Because of its non-destructivity and high resolution, it is suitable for consistent observation of the same specimen. Porosity and permeability of the specimens were measured using X-ray CT images and both of them were increased after injection. P- and S-wave velocity were also measured to assess the change of mechanical property and both of them were decreased after injection because of growth of inner fractures. The data from this research can be used as input data of CCS site.",

            "abstract": "Data collected by Cassini Spacecraft indicate that lakes on Titan are primarily found in the polar regions, preferentially in the north. It has been suggested that the hemispherical asymmetry in lake distribution is related to Saturn’s orbital precession, which changes the seasonal distribution of solar radiation on Titan, but not the annual mean (Aharonson et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2012). Saturn’s current longitude of perihelion is near northern winter solstice. Hence, the northern summer on Titan is longer and less intense than the southern summer. The longer northern summer leads to greater net precipitation in the annual mean and the methane accumulation over the northern polar region (Schneider et al. 2012). Saturn’s perihelion precesses over an approximately 45-kyr period, so the solar radiation at the top of Titan’s atmosphere varies on this time scale. Here we investigate how the orbital precession influences the polar methane accumulation with a three-dimensional atmospheric model coupled to a dynamic surface reservoir of methane (Schneider et al. 2012). We find that methane accumulation is closely tied to Saturn’s orbital precession. At the time when Saturn’s longitude of perihelion is 180 degree away from the present day value, methane is mainly accumulated in the southern polar region due to the stronger annual-mean precipitation there induced by the longer southern summer. The annual-mean evaporation is largely unchanged with orbital precession, since it scales with the annual-mean insolation, which does not change under orbital precession. When Saturn’s longitude of perihelion is close to equinox, methane is approximately evenly distributed in the northern and southern polar regions, and the lake dichotomy disappears. The timescale of methane redistribution from one pole to the other is short compared with the timescale of orbital precession, so the surface methane distribution can be viewed as being approximately in equilibrium with the solar forcing at any given historic time. These results indicate that the methane lake distribution on Titan likely varies over an approximately 45 Kyr time scale.",

Furthermore, the shallow Laptev Sea was strongly influenced by the post-glacial sea-level rise that should also be reflected in the sedimentary records.\nThe sea Ice Proxy IP25 (Highly-branched mono-isoprenoid produced by sea-ice algae; Belt et al., 2007) was measured in two sediment cores from the western Laptev Sea (PS51/154, PS51/159) that offer a high-resolution composite record over the last 18 ka. In addition, sterols are applied as indicator for marine productivity (brassicasterol, dinosterol) and input of terrigenous organic matter by river discharge into the ocean (campesterol, ß-sitosterol).\nThe sea-ice cover varies distinctly during the whole time period and shows a general increase in the Late Holocene. A maximum in IP25 concentration can be found during the Younger Dryas. This sharp increase can be observed in the whole circumarctic realm (Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, Fram Strait and Laptev Sea). Interestingly, there is no correlation between elevated numbers of ice-rafted debris (IRD) interpreted as local ice-cap expansions (Taldenkova et al. 2010), and sea ice cover distribution. The transgression and flooding of the shelf sea that occurred over the last 16 ka in this region, is reflected by decreasing terrigenous (riverine) input, reflected in the strong decrease in sterol (ß-sitosterol and campesterol) concentrations.\n",

            "abstract": "Sentinel-1A was launched on April 3rd, 2014. It is the first satellite of a European Space Agency (ESA) constellation that promises to revolutionize measurement of deformation of the Earth’s surface. The constellation is designed to acquire data globally as frequently as every 6 days on the same orbital pass, and every 3 days in alternating ascending and descending orbits over the same regions. This data acquisition plan is possible due to a much larger swath coverage than previous SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensors. In addition, all observations from Copernicus, the European Commission Earth Observation program, have a liberal data policy, which will enable full exploitation of the archived Sentinel-1 big data, both for scientific and commercial use.\nSentinel-1, and similar future constellations, shape a new landscape in the way that InSAR data have traditionally been processed. We have started to develop a completely new re-engineered and adapted InSAR time series processing approach, which efficiently processes the data from this new type of SAR constellation, with the goal to deliver ground deformation products with the highest possible precision. In summary, the proposed system approach will require the development of an automatic, almost unsupervised, system that integrates methods to obtain time-dependent surface deformation estimates and correction products for atmospheric noise and refined orbits. The ground velocity maps will ideally meet the desired precision of 1 mm/yr / 100 km to measure strain-rates (10 nanostrain/yr) at a comparable level of precision to current existing sparse regional GPS measurement networks.\nIn this communication, we describe the different steps we have adopted to partially solve: 1) coregistration of TOPS (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans) SAR images to enable interferometry, 2) how to manage the ambiguity between ground motion in azimuth and in line-of-sight for TOPS InSAR, 3) how to process efficiently newly acquired data, 4) adaptive filtering of interferograms, 5) how to select reliable temporally stable pixels for the phase unwrapping.",

The impact of three different basic hydrograph shapes (triangular, rising and falling) on the bedload rate of a gravel-bedded channel is experimentally analysed. The experiments were performed in a 16.8 m long glassed-walls tilting flume, with a 60 cm wide and 80 cm deep rectangular section, at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. A mobile 10 cm deep layer reach was made in the bed channel from x = 4.9 m to x = 14.1 m with a relatively uniform gravel of size 3 to 8 mm. A sediment trap is located immediately downstream the movable bed reach and no sediment feeding were imposed upstream. Eight 0.70 m long stripes of coloured sediments were laid over the natural gravel starting immediately upstream of the sediment trap. The thickness of the coloured gravel layer was about 3 to 4 cm (approximately 5 to 7 times D50). The total length of the reach covered with the coloured sediments was 5.6 m. After the experiments, approximately the top 2 cm of the gravel bed was sampled by strips of 0.175 m in the longitudinal direction, over the entire reach covered with sediments. These samples were then separated into gravels of different colours, and the dry weight of the sediments of each sample was measured. In addition, the gravel accumulated in the sediment trap was also separated into different colour groups, weighed separately. From the combined evaluation of the sediments trapped downstream and the sediments sampled throughout the channel, spatial patterns of entrainment and deposition rates are inferred. With this, back calculation of the depth of the active layer is performed and Wilcok’s formulations on tracer dispersion and estimation of sediment transport is tested and discussed.",

            "abstract": "A major purpose of groundwater modeling is to help decision-makers in efforts to manage the natural environment. Increasingly, it is recognized that both the predictions of interest and their associated uncertainties should be quantified to support robust decision making. In particular, decision makers want to have a full description of model prediction uncertainties so that they can consider costs and benefits of different model predictions. Limited data remains a major source of uncertainties in groundwater models and associated predictions.\nTraditionally, groundwater models have been constructed from geological and hydrological data. However, geophysical data are increasingly used to inform hydrogeologic models because they are collected at lower cost and much higher density than geological and hydrological data. Despite increased use of geophysics, it is still unclear whether the integration of geophysical data in the construction of a groundwater model increases the prediction performance. We suggest that modelers should perform a “test-bench” analysis of the likely value of geophysics data for improving groundwater model prediction performance before actually collecting geophysical data. At a minimum, an analysis should be conducted assuming settings that are favorable for the chosen geophysical method. If the analysis suggests that data collected by the geophysical method is unlikely to improve model prediction performance under these favorable settings, it is unlikely that such data will be useful under more challenging settings.\nWe have developed a synthetic “test-bench environment” to test the benefits and limitations of alternative hydrogeophysical data and inversion approaches. The environment consists of multiple high resolution realizations of synthetic, \"true\", hydrogeological and geophysical systems. The two types of \"true\" systems can be used together with corresponding forward codes to generate hydrological and geophysical datasets, respectively. These synthetic datasets can be interpreted using any hydrogeophysical inversion scheme and the resulting predictions can be compared with predictions from the ‘true’ model. By performing this analysis we expect to give the modeler insight into how the uncertainty of model-based prediction can be reduced.",

            "abstract": "Micron-resolution X-ray microtomography has allowed researchers to examine the processes controlling fluid flow behaviour at the pore scale, offering the promise of a transformation in our understanding of flow and transport in porous media. Until recently wettability has only been directly accessible in extremely simplified systems. A new method is presented for the measurement of the contact angle and capillary pressure of multiple immiscible fluids at the pore scale at reservoir conditions in the scCO2-brine-carbonate system. Contact angle is found by resampling the micro-CT data onto planes orthogonal to the contact lines, allowing for vectors to be traced along the grain surface and the scCO2 – brine interface. A distribution of contact angles ranging from 35o to 55o is observed. This distribution can be understood as the result of contact angle hysteresis and surface heterogeneity on a range of length scales. Ganglion capillary pressure for each ganglion was found by measuring the curvature of the CO2-brine interface, while the pore structure was parameterised using distance maps of the pore-space. The formation of the residual clusters by snap-off was examined by comparing the ganglion capillary pressure to local pore topography. The capillary pressure was found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the largest restriction (throat) surrounding the ganglion, which validates the imbibition mechanisms used in pore-network modelling. The potential mobilization of residual ganglia was assessed using a new formulation of both the capillary and Bond numbers, rigorously based on a balance of pore-scale forces, with the majority of ganglia remobilized at Ncmacro around 1. By the use of synchrotron tomography it is possible to create high quality 4D images of dynamic processes involving the flow of multiple fluid phases. We show how the drainage process take place as a series of discreet Haines jumps. Two different types of Haines jumps were seen, one where CO2 moves into a pore and remains connected with the rest of the CO2 and one where it immediately snaps off, forming a disconnected ganglion in the filled region. We also observe the change in capillary pressure associated with a Haines jump, showing that the capillary pressure reduction during the event can cause snap-off far away from the Haines jump.",

            "abstract": "The predictability of extreme weather events associated with high wind speed and precipitation is significant due to the impacts in human lives and the environment. As storm occurrences of various types and intensities have become more frequent in the Northeastern part of the United States, the need for improving the numerical prediction of those storms has emerged. In this work, we investigate the role of natural aerosols in the atmospheric conditions during extreme weather events, using regional atmospheric modeling systems. We explore how natural aerosols (dust, sea salt) influence the accuracy of the numerical prediction in real-time as well as in hind-cast mode by including the radiative feedback and the explicit treatment of cloud condensation nuclei. Two research activities are associated with the objectives described herein that will be presented and discussed. Real-time operational forecasts for NE U.S. are produced using two atmospheric modeling systems: WRF and RAMS/ICLAMS. The use of two modeling systems was chosen in the view of assessing the uncertainty of atmospheric variables by implementing two different and, at the same time, similarly configured modeling systems. Past storm cases that affected the region have been analyzed covering the period from 2001 to 2013 ranging from thunderstorms, snow/ice storms to typical winter storms and hurricanes. To accomplish that, we used the two models to create an ensemble that informs other research activities related to infrastructure resiliency and adaptation. In addition, we analyzed several past storm cases including the natural aerosol feedback effects and measure the responsiveness of the prediction as well as the differences in the storm intensity. The second activity that relates to the objectives of this work is the participation in the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology EXperiment (IPHEx) that supports the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. We performed daily weather forecasts for the hydrological forecasting as well as post-experiment simulations for the complex terrain of the Southern Appalachians including the natural aerosol feedback effects (Intense Observing Period (IOP): May-June 2014). Results from both activities will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "It is now admitted that the West African region faces a lot of constraints due to the comprehensiveness of the high climate variability and potential climate change. This is mainly due to the lack of a large number of datasets and long-term records as summarized in the in the IPCC reports. This paper aims to provide improved knowledge and evidence on current and future climate conditions, for better manage climate variability over seasons and from year to year and strengthen the capacity to adapt to future climate change. In this regards, we analyse the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa. Prior results show a general warming trend at individual stations throughout the region during the period from 1960 to 2010, namely negative trends in the number of cool nights, and positive trends in the number of warm days and length of warm spells. Trends in rainfall-related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures, rather they display marked multi-decadal variability, as expected. To refine analyses of temperature variations and their relation to precipitation we investigated on cluster analysis aimed at distinguishing different sub-regions, such as continental and coastal, and relevant seasons, such as wet, dry/cold and dry warm. This will contribute to significantly lower uncertainties by developing better and more tailored temperature and precipitation trends to inform the user communities on climate related risks, as well as enhance their resilience to food insecurity and other climate related disasters.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of δ13C of soil CO2 are used to partition the surface flux into autotrophic and heterotrophic components. Models predict that the δ13CO2 of the soil efflux is perturbed by non-steady state (NSS) diffusive conditions. These could be large enough to render δ13CO2 unsuitable for accurate flux partitioning. Field studies sometimes find correlations between efflux δ13CO2 and flux or temperature, or that efflux δ13CO2 is not correlated as expected with biological drivers. We tested whether NSS effects in semi-natural soil were comparable with those predicted. We compared chamber designs and their sensitivity to changes in efflux δ13CO2.\nIn a natural soil mesocosm, we controlled temperature to generate NSS conditions of CO2 production. We measured the δ13C of soil CO2 using in situ probes to sample the subsurface, and dynamic and forced-diffusion chambers to sample the surface efflux. Over eight hours we raised soil temperature by 4.5 OC to increase microbial respiration. Subsurface CO2 concentration doubled, surface efflux became 13C-depleted by 1 ‰ and subsurface CO2 became 13C-enriched by around 2 ‰. Opposite changes occurred when temperature was lowered and CO2 production was decreasing. Different chamber designs had inherent biases but all detected similar changes in efflux δ13CO2, which were comparable to those predicted. Measurements using dynamic chambers were more 13C-enriched than expected, probably due to advection of CO2 into the chamber.\nIn the mesocosm soil, δ13CO2 of both efflux and subsurface was determined by physical processes of CO2 production and diffusion. Steady state conditions are unlikely to prevail in the field, so spot measurements of δ13CO2 and assumptions based on the theoretical 4.4 ‰ diffusive fractionation will not be accurate for estimating source δ13CO2. Continuous measurements could be integrated over a period suitable to reduce the influence of transient NSS conditions. It will be difficult to disentangle biologically driven changes in soil δ13CO2 from physical controls, particularly as they occur on similar timescales and are driven by the same environmental variables, such as temperature, moisture and daylight.",

            "abstract": "Energetic cosmic rays impinging on the atmosphere create a particle avalanche called extensive air shower. In the leading plasma of this shower, electric currents are induced that generate the emission of radio waves which have been detected with LOFAR (www.lofar.org), an array of a large number of simple antennas primarily developed for radio-astronomy observations.\nEvents have been collected under fair-weather conditions as well as under atmospheric conditions where thunderstorms occur. Of the 196 radio pulses detected under fair weather conditions, the intensity as well as the polarization can be reproduced rather accurately for 192 events with the standard model [1] using a superposition of a geomagnetically-induced transverse current and charge excess contributions. This indicates that the emission process is well understood.\nHowever, for most of the events measured under thunderstorm conditions as well as for 4 fair weather events we observe large differences in intensity and polarization pattern from the fair weather model. For these events it is not possible to get a good fit of the measured intensity pattern. The dominant polarization direction differs from the expected v x B orientation. We show that this difference is a consequence of atmospheric electric fields. We also show that the effects of atmospheric electric fields are understood, and that from the cosmic-ray radio footprint the atmospheric electric field can be deduced.\n[1] P.

            "abstract": "The runoff from a snow cover during spring snowmelt or rain-on-snow events is an important factor in the hydrological cycle. Over a decade of snow lysimeter measurements at two alpine sites with a seasonal snow cover (Weissfluhjoch and Col de Porte), but with different climatological conditions, are compared to snowpack simulations with the 1 dimensional physics-based snowpack model SNOWPACK. The implementation of a solver for Richards equation (RE) in the model is presented. It provides an improvement of the simulations of snowpack runoff, especially on sub-daily time scales, compared to a simple bucket-type approach. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients for hourly runoff increase from 0.12 to 0.59 and r2 values increase from 0.47 to 0.76 for the site Weissfluhjoch. An analysis of the runoff dynamics over the snow season showed that the bucket scheme releases meltwater later in the melt season than in the measurements, whereas RE provides a better agreement. The shallower and less stratified snowpack at Col de Porte reduces the differences between both water transport schemes. It can be concluded that solving RE for the snow cover improves several aspects of modeling snow cover runoff, especially for deep, sub-freezing snow covers and in particular on the sub-daily time scales. Also indications were found that RE improves the simulation of the internal snowpack. For example, a comparison with snow temperature measurement series at different depths showed a higher agreement in most years at the timing when the snowpack gets isothermal, which is related to infiltrating and refreezing melt water. The r2 value for the depth to which the snowpack is isothermal between simulations and observations in traditional snow pits increased. RE is also able to simulate the accumulation of liquid water on strong inhomogeneities in snowpack stratification, which is considered to be a major factor in wet snow avalanche formation. This may contribute to the potential of SNOWPACK for assessing wet snow avalanche risks.",

            "abstract": "Carbon-isotope analyses on a variety of substrates (e.g., leaf waxes, teeth, carbonates) suggest a pronounced increase in C4 plant biomass during the late Miocene and early Pliocene in many regions of the world. This spread of C4-dominated grasslands is thought to have occurred at the expense of C3-dominated grasslands. However, the earlier history of C4 grasses is uncertain, primarily because of difficulty assessing the presence and abundance of C4 grasses when they are relatively rare on the landscape. We measure d13C of individual grass pollen grains using SPIRAL (Single Pollen Isotope Ratio AnaLysis) to distinguish the relative abundance of C3 and C4 grasses during the early to middle Miocene in Spain. We analyzed a total of 3251 pollen grains isolated from 7 samples from Andalucia A1 (10-13.5 Ma), 7 samples from Gor (13-15 Ma) and 24 sediment samples from (Rubielos de Mora, (16-22 Ma). Palynological data indicate that grasses were not a significant component (5-20% of total terrestrial pollen) of the regional vegetation, which was composed of herbs, shrubs, and thermophilous (e.g., Taxodiaceae, Engelhardia) and mesothermic (Quercus, Carya) trees. Based on our SPIRAL data, 21-72% of the grasses were C4, with the older northern site (Rubielos de Mora) having lower C4-grass abundance (average of 39%) than the younger and more southern sites (average of 62%). Paleoclimate reconstructions suggest that the region was mainly subtropical (warm and semi-arid/highly seasonal) at that time, and pollen spectra suggest that the regional vegetation was similar to that found today in northern Africa where C4 grasses dominate. Our pollen-isotope results imply an increase in C4-grass abundance through time, and/or a north-south climatic gradient, with wetter and less seasonal conditions that were less favorable to C4 grasses in the north. Overall, these results suggest that C4 grasses were relatively abundant in southwestern Europe during the early and middle Miocene, prior to their rise to ecological prominence throughout the world.",

            "abstract": "CO2 plays a fundamental role in the evolution of magmatic and volcanic systems, but its low solubility in silicate melts means that direct records of magmatic CO2 concentrations remain elusive. The phosphate mineral apatite is unique among igneous minerals in its capacity to accommodate all major magmatic volatiles (H2O, F, Cl, CO2 and S). Although interest in apatite as a tool for tracking magmatic volatile contents (namely H2O, F, and Cl) has increased in recent years, its potential as a record of magmatic CO2contents remains untapped.\nWe present the results of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments investigating the partitioning behaviour of CO2 between apatite and basaltic melt. Experiments were run in piston cylinder apparatus at 1 GPa and 1250 °C, with a slow initial cooling ramp employed to facilitate crystal growth. Each charge contained the starting basaltic powder doped with Ca-phosphate and variable proportions of H2O, CO2, and F. Run products are glass-rich charges containing 15–25 vol% large, euhedral apatite crystals (± cpx and minor biotite). Experimental apatites and glasses have been characterised by BSE imaging, electron microprobe, and ion microprobe.\nApatites range in composition from near-endmember fluorapatite (3.0 wt% F), to near-endmember hydroxyapatite (1.7 wt% H2O), to carbon-rich apatite containing up to 1.6 wt% CO2. Apatite compositions are stoichiometric if all anions (F–, OH–, and CO32—) lie in the channel site, suggesting an “A-type” substitution under these conditions (i.e. CO32— + [] = 2X—, where X is another channel anion and [] is a vacancy; e.g. Fleet et al. 2004). Importantly, CO2 partitions readily into apatite at all fluid compositions considered here. CO2 is also more compatible in apatite than water at our run conditions, with calculated H2O–CO2 exchange coefficients close to or greater than 1. Our results indicate that when channel ions are primarily occupied by H2O and CO2 (i.e. F- and Cl-poor magmatic systems), apatite can preserve higher absolute CO2 concentrations than the surrounding melt. In this way, apatite may prove more sensitive than other direct records of pre-eruptive volatile contents, such as phenocryst-hosted melt inclusions. We suggest that apatite has the potential to be a useful tool for tracking magmatic CO2 abundances.",

            "abstract": "Foraminifera are popular tools for paleoceanograpic reconstructions since incorporation of numerous elements and fractionation of stable isotopes into their carbonate tests depend on environmental conditions. Their test chemistry is markedly different from that of inorganically precipitated CaCO3 (Figure), reflecting that calcification is a process under tight biological control. The cellular components responsible for calcification are only partly identified in foraminifera and include the involvement of organic templates, trans-membrane ion transporters and proton removal. Recent results have suggested that transmembrane H+ and Ca2+ transport is directly coupled and that a key feature of foraminiferal calcification is the intracellular conversion of bicarbonate into carbonate ions. Amongst others, this explains how some foraminifera are able to calcify in undersaturated seawater and may explain their moderate response to ocean acidification. Minor and trace metals incorporated into test carbonate reflect the processes involved in biomineralization and can thus be used to unravel the different factors and processes involved. Still, a more detailed understanding of the processes involved in foraminiferal calcification is needed to explain observed (inter-species) differences in partition coefficients for the incorporation of minor and trace metals and isotopic fractionation.",

            "abstract": "As Kīlauea Volcano approaches its 33rd year of nearly continuous activity, simultaneous summit and rift eruptions continue to challenge island populations, agriculture, and infrastructure with elevated levels of acidic gases and particles. In 2008, the opening of a new summit vent attended a ten- to one hundred- fold increase in SO2 summit emissions which, combined with the ongoing east rift emissions, resulted in the highest combined annual SO2 release since regular measurements began in 1979. While the overall emissions have decreased in a step-wise manner since 2008, this large local source still contributes 20-60% of the SO2 emitted by all stationary fuel combustion sources in the U.S., and ~ 7-20% of the estimated time-averaged annual global volcanogenic SO2 contribution.\nResearch on the long-term health and environmental effects of chronic exposure to volcanic pollution is ongoing in Hawai‘i. Public health statistics suggest that incidences of respiratory emergency increased coincident with the onset of the summit eruption. From 2008-2011, Hawaii County received a Disaster Designation by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture due to agricultural losses from the effects of volcanic emissions.\nA multifaceted approach is being used to address the current gas and particle hazards and to mitigate the impacts to affected areas. Multi-agency websites are providing forecast and real-time data regarding acid particle and SO2 gas concentrations to help people minimize their exposures. The short-term concentration data is linked to color-coded health-advisory levels developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Hawaii State Department of Health, with input from the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Questions remain, however, on the appropriateness of the designated advisory levels for protecting chronically exposed populations, and if these tools are sufficiently useful to Hawai‘i residents and visitors. Other mitigation efforts include community-based health interventions, indoor engineering controls, and innovations and relief programs within the agricultural sector.",

In this study, downscaled Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations have been used to examine regional heat-wave extreme events in the continental U.S. over the last 55 years (i.e., 1950 – 2005) and into the future (i.e., 2005 – 2100). Model runs using various emission scenarios have been used to explore how extremes in maximum and minimum temperatures will change in California over the next few decades. Various statistical analyses have been employed to select the most appropriate models to study future heat waves in California. The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to compare different CMIP5 models’ ability to simulate the historical frequency of extreme temperature events in California and second, to investigate the impacts of future heat wave trends in California with different emission scenarios. We believe our study will help to provide useful information and guidance for both policy makers and stakeholders on potential future changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events.",

            "abstract": "Many calcareous organisms are known to record the ambient environmental conditions in which they grow, and their calcium carbonate skeletons are often valuable archives of climate records. Mytilus californianus, a widely distributed species of intertidal mussel, experiences a spatial mosaic of oceanographic conditions as it grows within the California Current System. Periodic episodes of upwelling bring high-CO2 waters to the surface, during which California coastal waters are similar to projected conditions and act as a natural analogue to future ocean acidification. To examine the link between upwelling and shell characteristics of M. californianus, we analyzed the morphology and stable isotope (δ13C, δ18O) signatures of mussel specimens collected live from seven study sites within the California Current System. Morphometric analyses utilized a combination of elliptic Fourier analysis and shell thickness measurements to determine the influence of low pH waters on the growth morphology and ecological fitness of M. californianus. These geochemical and morphological analyses were compared with concurrent high-resolution environmental (T, S, pH, TA, DIC) records from these seven study sites from 2010-2013. With appropriate calibration, new archives from modern M. californianus shells could provide a valuable tool to enable environmental reconstructions within the California Current System. These archives could in turn be used to predict the future consequences of continuing ocean acidification, as well as reconstruct past (archeological) conditions.",

            "abstract": "It all started when Francois Matthes coined the phrase “little ice age” (LIA) in 1939 to explain cirque moraines in the Sierra Nevada.  Porter and Denton in the late 60’s promoted the concept that the LIA was part of a multi-millennium regrowth of glaciers called “Neoglaciation.”\nA second set of small moraines found in a few cirques short distances downvalley of LIA moraines in the American Rockies began attracting some attention in the 1940s-50s. By the 1960s-70s there was much argument over the age(s) of these moraines. A proliferation of ages appeared in the literature in the 1970s-80s, but Thom Davis and Jerry Osborn in 1987 proposed that most or all these outer cirque moraines are actually Younger Dryas (YD) in age.\nIn Alberta in the 1970s, Brian Luckman began studying LIA deposits and Osborn began mapping outer cirque moraines (Crowfoot moraines). The two joined forces for an overview of Holocene glacial history in the Canadian Rockies in 1979.\nEric Leonard and Mel Reasoner began lake-sediment studies in the Canadian Rockies in the 1980s-90s. Reasoner and Osborn concluded using lake sediments that the type Crowfoot moraine is YD in age, and in Colorado and Wyoming, Davis, Reasoner, and Brian Menounos established YD ages of outer cirque moraines. Lateral-moraine stratigraphy, begun in the 1980s by June Ryder and Osborn in British Columbia, corroborated the evidence from lake sediments that minor advances and retreats punctuated a gradual Neoglacial expansion of glaciers that began 7 or 8 ka.\nThe era of cosmogenic dating began in the 1990s, with John Gosse’s work in the Wind River Range. Most, but not all, cosmogenic ages on outer cirque moraines, including those yielded by Shaun Marcott’s broad survey, are in support of the concept that such moraines are YD or pre-YD in age, although uncertainties resulting from production-rate questions remain. There have been various claims of early Holocene advances greater in magnitude than the LIA, but these have been dismissed in the literature and have not gained general acceptance.\nMost recently, Menounos found so-called “monster moraines” well downstream of LIA moraines in northern British Columbia and the Yukon where there are no small Crowfoot-type outer moraines. New dates suggest these monsters are a different manifestation of the YD associated with the decaying Cordilleran Ice Sheet.",

            "abstract": "In urban environments, where buildings have variable configurations and heights, the tallest structures have a disproportional impact on drag, mean flow and turbulence. Although wind-engineering studies document well the effects of individual high-rise buildings on the immediate surrounding, the impact of varying building heights on the larger horizontally averaged flow has not been quantified systematically for realistic urban configurations.\nWe use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) as a means to study the fully developed turbulent flow over and within a 512 x 512 m2 subset of the true urban geometry in the city of Basel, Switzerland. A periodic LES domain is centered on the location of a tower, where measurements of turbulence were performed in 2001/02, which allows a direct validation of the LES at a specific location in the domain. The Lagrangian scale-dependent LES model is adopted to parametrize the subgrid stresses in the bulk of the flow and buildings are taken into account adopting a discrete-forcing-approach immersed boundary method (IBM), with the geometry taken from a highly accurate digital building model. A series of high-resolution LES runs are performed for various directions of the approaching flow, and with all buildings included and then buildings above a certain height threshold progressively removed, to isolate the impact of tall structures.\nResults show how the presence of isolated tall buildings strongly modifies the roughness properties of the entire urban roughness sublayer, causing an increase in resolved pressure forces, which contributes to the overall surface induced drag. In the presence of tall buildings the local structure of the roughness sublayer is partitioned into two regimes: fine scale wake turbulence and elongated, high speed streak-like motions, locked between the position of isolated structures, with their axis aligned in the stream wise direction. For arrays with differing building heights statistics significantly differ from standard surface layer ones and are locally fixed in space. Dispersive momentum fluxes are shown to significantly increase with the presence of isolated tall buildings, mainly due to the spatial variability of the flow in the span wise direction.",

            "abstract": "CarbonSat was selected by ESA as one of two candidates for the Earth Explorer Opportunity mission (EE8). Understanding and quantifying climate feedback and forcing mechanisms involving the two most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, requires the discrimination of natural and anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 fluxes globally, with regional to local spatial scale resolution. The objective of the CarbonSat mission is therefore to quantify natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4. The unique feature of the CarbonSat mission concept is its “GHG imaging capability”, which is achieved by combining high spatial resolution (6 km2) and good spatial coverage (breakthrough: 240 km swath, contiguous ground sampling). This capability enables global imaging of localized strong emission source areas such as cities, power plants, methane seeps, landfills and volcanoes and better separation of natural and anthropogenic GHG sources and sinks. The latter will be further supported by CarbonSat’s ability to constrain the fluxes of CO2 exchanged to and from the land biosphere by simultaneously measuring CO2 and sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a process strongly associated with Gross Primary Production (GPP). Source/sink information will be derived from the retrieved atmospheric column-averaged mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 via inverse modelling. CarbonSat aims to deliver spatially-resolved time varying global estimates of dry column mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 with high precision (~1 to 2 ppm and ~12 ppb, respectively) and rel. accuracy (~0.5 ppm and 5 ppb, respectively). Benefiting from its imaging capabilities along and across track, CarbonSat will provide at least an order of magnitude larger number of cloud-free CO2 soundings than GOSAT and OCO-2. Recent results from the scientific studies and supporting campaigns documenting the expected data quality and potential application areas will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Particle tracking (PT) techniques, often considered favorable over Eulerian techniques due to artificial smoothening in breakthrough curves (BTCs), are evaluated in a risk-driven framework. Recent work has shown that given a relatively few number of particles (np), PT methods can yield well-constructed BTCs with kernel density estimators (KDEs). This work compares KDE and non-KDE BTCs simulated as a function of np (102-108) and averaged as a function of the exposure duration, ED. Results show that regardless of BTC shape complexity, un-averaged PT BTCs show a large bias over several orders of magnitude in concentration (C) when compared to the KDE results, remarkably even when np is as low as 102. With the KDE, several orders of magnitude less np are required to obtain the same global error in BTC shape as the PT technique. PT and KDE BTCs are averaged as a function of the ED with standard and new methods incorporating the optimal h (ANA). The lowest error curve is obtained through the ANA method, especially for smaller EDs. Percent error of peak of averaged-BTCs, important in a risk framework, is approximately zero for all scenarios and all methods for np ≥105, but vary between the ANA and PT methods, when np is lower. For fewer np, the ANA solution provides a lower error fit except when C oscillations are present during a short time frame. We show that obtaining a representative average exposure concentration is reliant on an accurate representation of the BTC, especially when data is scarce.",

            "abstract": "As the improvements of observing systems, model parameterizations, and advanced assimilation techniques, a few reanalyses data sets become available; however, it is necessary to understand their strengths and biases before exploiting them. In this study, we investigate five contemporary reanalyses (20CR, CFSR, Era-Interim, JRA-25, and MERRA). In detail, we first compared the cloud fraction, TOA radiation fluxes and cloud radiative forcings using CERES MODIS SYN1deg and EBAF products on the global scale. We then analyze the differences and similarities between these parameters in tropical and mid-latitudes under convective and subsidence regimes. It is important to note that CERES MODIS and EBAF results are used as reference to evaluate these simulated parameters, and these data cover the period from 03/2000 to 02/2012. The preliminary results show that most of the reanalyses under estimate cloud fraction on global average, and the SW, LW, and Net CRFs are biased by as much as 3.9 (CFSR), −8.7 (JRA-25), and −5.7 (JRA-25) Wm−2, respectively. Convective and subsidence regimes are identified as the strong ascending and descending branches of the large general circulation in the tropics and mid-latitudes. This metric helps to identify the physical characteristics in specific areas and the types of clouds that reside there. Clouds are typically over estimated in convective areas while in the subsidence region clouds are under estimated. Sensitivity studies show that these regimes exhibit different regressive behaviors when comparing cloud fraction to CRFs, especially in the LW CRF. The error analysis reveals information that can be useful for modelers so that they may develop better parameterizations for clouds and how they interact with incoming solar and outgoing infrared radiation.",

            "abstract": "A lithospheric plate passing atop a mantle plume is likely to be thermally thinned or “rejuvenated”. Geophysical data on the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) depth beneath active hotspots partly validate this prediction, but there is a large variation of the LAB upwelling estimated from different methods. Numerical simulations of plume-lithosphere interactions show that the development of small-scale convection (SSC) in the plume pancake spreading out along the base of the lithosphere is a mechanism able to rejuvenate the lithosphere, even for a fast-moving plate. The triggering of SSC has been shown to depend on the rheological behaviour of the unstable layer underlying the stagnant upper part of the thermal boundary layer (TBL), but the stability of the this layer may also be affected by partial melting.\nWe analyze, using a 2D petrological-thermo-mechanical numerical model, the influence of partial melting on the dynamics of time-dependent SSC instabilities and the resulting rejuvenation of a lithosphere passing atop a mantle plume. These models show a complex behavior, with either an acceleration, no change or a slight decceleration of the SSC onset, due to the competing effects of the latent heat of melting, which cools the plume material, and of the buoyancy increase associated with melting, among which the dominant effect is the depletion in heavy elements of the solid fraction. The viscosity reduction, though significant (up to 2 orders of magnitude) is too localized to affect the SSC dynamics. Despite the presence of partial melting, the mechanical lithosphere erosion in not enhanced significantly relatively to melt-free models.",

A magnitude 5 or greater shakes the URG every 25 years and in 1356 a magnitude greater than 6.5 struck the city of Basel. Several potentially active faults have been identified in the area and documented in the French Active Fault Database (web site in construction). These faults are located along the boundary of the Graben but also in the middle, under heavily populated areas and critical facilities and are capable of producing earthquakes with magnitude 6 and above. Regional models and preliminary geomorphological investigations provided provisional assessment of slip rates for the individual faults (0.1-0.001 mm/a). Two possible geodynamic models are still debated for the URG: one where the most active faults are along the border of the URG and a second one where they are in the middle. This uncertainty on slip rates is explored through a logic-tree, as well as the impact on the seismic hazard estimation of different input key parameters such as the fault geometry, the slip-rate of the faults, the seismicity model associated to the faults (Characteristic / Gutenberg-Richter). We also show the influence of the minimum magnitude considered for modeling the faults in PSHA. PSHA results will be discussed and comparisons between three PSHA codes (CRISIS, OpenQuake and a PSHA-code developed by IRSN) will be presented.",

We chose the Mw 6.0 aftershock as the EGF event which occurred 10 hours after the main event and had the similar focal mechanisms and locations with the mainshock. We performed the analysis for two distance ranges; regional (1°-20°) and teleseismic (30°-90°) and selected the stations which have good azimuthal coverage, high S/N levels and similar waveforms for the mainshock and the EGF event. We determined the rupture parameters such as rupture velocity and the rise time as well as slip distribution for the Van earthquake by comparing the regional and teleseismic data where the models have high variance reductions. We found the best-ﬁt range of rupture velocity between 1.5 and 2 km/s and the rise time between 1 s and 2 s. The slip distribution is primarily up-dip towards southwest and the maximum slip is about 3.5 meters. Our results show that the source models obtained from teleseismic and regional data are in agreement with each other. The rupture velocity obtained for the Van earthquake, about 50% of the shear wave velocity is a characteristic for dip slip earthquakes. The rise time of 1.5 seconds implies 2 m/s slip rate inside the largest asperity.",

            "abstract": "Salinity is one of the most important parameters in paleo-oceanography, controlling -together with temperature- changes in sea-water density and ocean currents. An integrated understanding of past ocean functioning hence critically relies on accurate past density values. A recently developed direct proxy for salinity, based on incorporation of sodium (Na) into benthic foraminiferal shells, may circumvent inaccuracies associated with indirect salinity reconstructions, when combining for instance foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope values with independent temperature reconstructions. Here we present new results of culture experiments with planktonic foraminifera (e.g. Globigerinoides ruber) and of a field calibration covering a broad salinity range. The foraminiferal Na/Ca was determined by laser ablation-ICP-MS, allowing geochemical analysis on a single chamber. The obtained planktonic Na/Ca values show a similar sensitivity, albeit with slightly higher values as previously reported for benthic foraminifera. This offset indicates that albeit values are in line with what is expected from previous inorganic precipitation experiments, biological control on calcium carbonate precipitation must play a role.",

            "abstract": "Floods are a recurring natural hazard responsible for large socioeconomic losses globally. In mid-latitude locations, such as Western North America and Europe, heavy precipitation and floods, are connected to intense water vapor transport in extra-tropical cyclones called atmospheric rivers (ARs). This AR region is narrow (on the order of 300-500 km wide) and transports the majority of the poleward moisture flux. Given the strong link between ARs and floods on the west coast of North America, it is the aim of this research to determine if ARs are responsible for hydrohazards in British Columbia and Alaska.\nUsing satellite measurements, atmospheric reanalyses, and in-situ observations we undertake a hydrometeorological analysis on two major flood events, namely the Bella Coola flood in British Columbia in September 2010 in which 10 inches (250mm) of rain fell in 36 hours, and an Alaskan event that produced over 50 inches (1250 mm) of precipitation in the month of September 2012 (mostly in two landfalling ARs), and led to record river stage heights. Furthermore, the Alaskan event resulted in one fatality and $35M in damages to buildings, homes, and infrastructure.\nPreliminary results suggest that AR conditions were present during these events, and are therefore likely to be important for hydrohazards more generally in British Columbia and Alaska. As the enhanced water vapor transport in the ARs encountered the steep terrain in these regions orographic enhancement of rainfall occurred resulting in record rainfall totals and floods. The occurrence of these events in September (earlier than noteworthy AR events in the U.S. West Coast farther south) may also relate to the earlier nascence of the winter circulation pattern in northern latitudes.",

            "abstract": "The ocean circulation around the Arabian Peninsula is mainly dominated by the monsoon, from Southwest in winter, Northeast in summer. During the intermonsoon, the mesoscale variability is driven by eddies with a strong vertical influence. We focus here on the Northern Arabian Sea, which is connected to a strong evaporation basin, the Persian Gulf, via the Sea of Oman. The warm and salty water produced in the Persian Gulf (PGW for Persian Gulf Water) is advected around the eddies with differents paths for each seasons.\nUsing monthly averaged altimetric, winds, heat fluxes and thermohaline data, we describe the onset and evolution of the mesoscale eddies and other features in the Northern Arabian Sea and their variations between each seasons and every years. Those structures have a deep reaching impact on the water masses, particularly on the PGW.\nFrom here we will focus on the spring intermonsoon, a season in which the circulation in less wind driven, as the summer or winter. We will use the results from the PhysIndien 2011 experiment directed by the SHOM. EOFs extracted from altrimetric data show that this year is representative of this season. With a higher spatial resolution we focus on the advection of the PGW by the mesoscale gyres. Three of them, one cylonic and two anticyclonics, stay stationnary through the season along the Omani coast. They advect diluted PGW far South from its known climatological extension. As well they send the PGW vein through the Iranian coast and break the current in submesoscale structures; filaments and a lens of PGW were recorded during the experiment. Using the results on the mesoscale circulation, we will present the characteristics and trajectory of such a PGW lens.",

            "abstract": "Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) are the most common features of shear wave velocity models of the lowermost mantle. In contrast, the existence of thin layers with strong decrease in P- and S-wave velocity and increase in density - known as ultra low velocity zones (ULVZs) - is still ambiguous at some locations of the core mantle boundary (CMB). Moreover, ULVZ parameters are highly non-unique because of the strong parameter correlations (i.e., trade-offs). The parameter uncertainty estimation is crucial for appropriate physical interpretation. These challenges cannot be addressed using a traditional forward waveform modeling. We thus previously developed a Bayesian inversion to address these difficulties. In a Bayesian inversion, the prior knowledge on the model parameters is combined with the data information described by the likelihood function. Ultimately, the ensemble of solutions is obtained in terms of posterior probability density (solution of the inverse problem). To investigate the unknown parameterization (i.e., the number of layers), we utilized the Bayesian Information Criterion and applied it to study the ULVZ beneath the east of the Philippines [Pachhai et al., 2014, revised]. Here we build on the previous study and develop a trans-dimensional approach in which the number of free parameters (ULVZ layers) is treated as an unknown parameter in the inversion. We confirm that the ULVZ beneath the east of the Philippines is multi-layered, with dense and melt-rich iron material sitting on the bottom. Furthermore, we analyze ScP waves recorded by the Australian arrays that sample the CMB beneath the east of Australia. We examine more than 1000 (Mw>5.0) events and identify 36 events with clear onsets of core-reflected waves (ScP), out of which 9 events also contain clear PcP waves. These data enable us to achieve an unprecedented sampling of a significant area near the edges of the LLSVP under the southwest Pacific Ocean and give insights in fine details of the CMB. We interpret our findings in the context of known ULVZ morphology and our previous findings of different types of ULVZs, and discuss the spatial relationship relative to the Pacific LLSVP.",

For this purpose we use a state of the art shallow shelf model with grounding line resolving capabilities. The model is initialized to observed pre-2002 conditions with the ice shelf in place, and transient runs are done that study the response to a weakening and removal of the ice shelf.\nResults are compared to a novel dataset of observed ice velocities, which provides the most comprehensive overview of dynamical changes after the collapse to-date. In addition, we investigate glacier response to the future collapse of Scar Inlet, a remnant of the Larsen B ice shelf which has been suggested to show signs of weakening in recent years.

COOPEUS views the GCI as an important platform promoting cross-disciplinary approaches in the studies of multifaceted environmental challenges, and the research infrastructures (RIs) in COOPEUS are currently in the process of registering resources and services within the GCI. To promote this work, COOPEUS and GEOSS held a joint workshop in July 2014, where the main scope was to get data managers of the COOPEUS RIs involved and establish the GCI as part of the COOPEUS interoperability framework. The workshop revealed that data policies of the individual RIs can often be the first impediment for their use of the GCI. As many RIs are administering data from many sources, permission to distribute the data must be in place before registration in the GCI. Through hands-on exercises registering resources from the COOPEUS RIs, the first steps were taken to implement the GCI as a platform for documenting the capabilities of the COOPEUS RIs. These exercises gave important feedback for the practical implementation of the GCI as well as the challenges lying ahead. For the COOPEUS RIs providing data the benefits includes improved discovery and access to data and information, increased visibility of available data, information and services, which will promote the structuring of the existing environmental research infrastructure landscape and improve the interoperability. However, in order to attract research infrastructures to use the GCI, the registration process must be simplified and accelerated like for instance allowing for bulk data registration; the resource registration and feedback by COOPEUS partners can play an important role in these efforts.",

            "abstract": "We investigate unsteady flow in a porous medium under time - periodic (sinusoidal) pressure gradient. DNS were performed to benchmark the analytical solution of the unsteady Darcy equation with two different expressions of the time scale : one given by a consistent volume averaging of the Navier - Stokes equation [1] with a steady state closure for the flow resistance term, another given by volume averaging of the kinetic energy equation [2] with a closure for the dissipation rate . For small and medium frequencies, the analytical solutions with the time scale obtained by the energy approach compare well with the DNS results in terms of amplitude and phase lag. For large frequencies (f > 100 [Hz]) we observe a slightly smaller damping of the amplitude. This study supports the use of the unsteady form of Darcy's equation with constant coefficients to solve time - periodic Darcy flows at low and medium frequencies. Our DNS simulations, however, indicate that the time scale predicted by the VANS approach together with a steady - state closure for the flow resistance term is too small. The one obtained by the energy approach matches the DNS results well. At large frequencies, the amplitudes deviate slightly from the analytical solution of the unsteady Darcy equation. Note that at those high frequencies, the flow amplitudes remain below 1% of those of steady state flow. This result indicates that unsteady porous media flow can approximately be described by the unsteady Darcy equation with constant coefficients for a large range of frequencies, provided, the proper time scale has been found.",

            "abstract": "The prominent aseismic ridges in the western offshore of India are the Laccadive Ridge and the Laxmi Ridge. The satellite derived Free Air Gravity(FAG) anomaly map over the western Indian offshore region depicts a high over the Laccadive ridge and a low over the Laxmi ridge in the Arabian Sea. In addition to the evolution of these ridges, it is also debated if these ridges are of continental or oceanic nature. We studied the two ridges individually.\nWe undertook analysis of ship-borne gravity-magnetic and the re-tracked satellite derived FAG data to have a relook into the crustal architecture of the Laxmi ridge and adjoining areas using different techniques. 3D models using Energy Spectral Analysis and 2D crustal modelling suggests the ridge is continental and the gravity low associated with the NW-SE segment of the Ridge is due to under-plating. Magnetic sources from EMAG2 data, various filtered maps and absence of under-plating in the EW section suggest that the EW and NW-SE segment of the Laxmi ridge are structurally and characteristically different and probably associated with different stages of evolution. The region to the north of Laxmi ridge, between Laxmi & Gop basins, is composed of volcanic / basaltic flows having Deccan affinity which may have been emplaced in an already existing crust. The calculated inclination parameters derived from the best fit 2D model suggests that the rifting in the Gop basin preceded the emplacement of the volcanics in the region between Laxmi & Gop basins. The emplacement of volcanic / basaltic flows may be associated with the passage of India over the Reunion hotspot.\nThe tectonic evolution of the Laccadive Ridge has been deduced from 2D satellite derived free air gravity data by utilizing wavelength filtering to resolve different depth structures representing different epochs. From such an analysis it has been possible to conclusively identify the extension of the older onshore NE-SW lineaments/fault into the Laccadive ridge which is later intruded by volcanic material as India moved over the Reunion hotspot.The crustal structure derived from the 2D models depicted a thick crust underneath the Laccdaive ridge suggesting continental nature of the ridge. From the combined analysis of the two Ridges an evolutionary model of Western Continental Margin of India will be presented.",

The pathways of the polar water in Davis Strait, Fram Strait and then to the south are well documented by observations and model simulations. In contrast, measurements upstream of Fram Strait are too sparse to allow us to explain what causes the outflows to exit either west or east of Greenland or to attribute the variability in the Arctic outflows to atmospheric or oceanic mechanisms. Two high-resolution global ocean general circulation models (OGCM), NEMO-ORCA025, of ~12 km resolution, and NEMO-ORCA12, of ~4 km resolution, have been used to examine the dynamics and seasonal variability of the outflow west and east of Greenland. Montgomery potential analysis is used to investigate the dynamics of the currents in the area. The model results suggest wind as a driving mechanism for the seasonal variability of the ocean circulation in the area.",

            "abstract": "The extrapolation of sea surface temperature calibrations used for proxies into deep time is inherently problematic. On geological time scales, differences in ocean chemistry, source organism evolution and non-analogue processes all affect application of calibrations based on present day proxy relationships. Here we present a multi-proxy (Mg/Ca, δ18O and TEX86) paleotemperature reconstruction for the North Atlantic American shelf using ODP Leg 174AX Site Bass River (New Jersey Shelf). This record extends from the Cenomanian to the Pliocene and provides an excellent archive for comparing proxies on long time scales, because the sediments yield well-preserved organic biomarkers as well as foraminiferal calcite, suitable for geochemical analysis. Nine sub-sets of high-resolution series were analyzed to gain insight both in the long-term evolution as well as the internal proxy consistency on shorter time scales. Trends in TEX86, δ18O and Mg/Ca show very good mutual agreement and are consistent with stacked global benthic oxygen isotope records. This implies that the New Jersey shelf record captures the long-term trends in the global oceanic temperature signal. However, TEX86 sea surface temperatures range between ~20 and 35 ⁰C, whereas bottom water temperatures inferred from Mg/Ca (corrected for modeled past changes in sea water Mg/Ca) and δ18O (corrected for ice volume changes) range between ~15 and 25 ⁰C, and 10 and 20 ⁰C, respectively. These offsets, which increase further back in time, suggest that difference in the isotopic and elemental composition of seawater, or changes in the TEX86 calibration in deep time, affect temperature proxies. Deep time re-calibration based on clumped isotope thermometry will be used to reconcile these proxies also on geological time scales.",

            "abstract": "The gravity change associated with the Fennoscandian Postglacial Rebound (PGR) has been studied for 50 years now, with both relative and absolute gravity measurements. High-precision relative gravity measurements on the specially designed Fennoscandian Land Uplift Gravity Lines began in 1966. First absolute-gravity measurements with laboratory-type instruments were made in 1976. Here we report on a new regionally dense dataset: the comparison of legacy relative measurements in the Finnish First Order Gravity Net (FOGN) with absolute-gravity measurements with the A10-020 gravimeter. The FOGN was first measured in 1962 using a Worden Master gravimeter, and re-surveyed in 1988 using two LaCoste&Romberg model G gravimeters. It was re-measured in 2009–2010 using the A10-020 free-fall gravimeter of the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography. The FOGN covers the whole country and consists of 50 outdoor stations in public buildings, typically on church steps. About 30 stations from 1962 were still intact in 2009/10, and at some additional stations there is a history of local relative ties to replacement sites now occupied with the A10-020. The vertical PGR rates at the sites are up to 1 cm/yr, and thus the total gravity change in the 47 years can amount to 80 microgals. Since the legacy measurements are relative, only the differences of gravity change are estimable, and consequently the expected maximum signal is less, about 60 microgals. We compare the observed gravity change in the FOGN with estimates of vertical motion from continuous GNSS, from repeated precise leveling and from tide gauges, and with gravity change predicted from PGR models. At seven locations the gravity change estimated from the FOGN can also be compared with time series of absolute-gravity measurements with laboratory-type instruments.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones are heterogeneities that may greatly influence groundwater flow in crystalline regions. The quantification of fluxes, the origin of water and geochemical processes associated to groundwater flow in such context remain not well understood. This study mainly concerns a large-scale multidisciplinary field experiments performed on a specific site in Brittany (Saint-Brice en Coglès, France) where a permeable fault zone was identified at depth (200 m). The main objectives here are to constrain both fluxes dynamic and water sources involved during different seasonal regimes.\nWe demonstrate that the fault zone allows the discharge of regional groundwater at the watershed outlet. Using specific hydro-geophysical measurements (Heat Pulse Flow Meter), we estimate a natural discharge rate between 150 and 200 m3/d. The fault zone presents different geochemical signatures related to changes in hydrologic regime. They are linked to transient fluxes enhancement from different reservoirs. During the low hydrologic regimes, water with high resident time flows along the fault zone, with a contribution of inter-glacial origin (recharge temperature of 7°C deduced from noble gases interpretation). Water trapped in a low-permeability domain is mobilized to the fault zone and/or large-scale circulation loops are involved. During the high hydrologic regimes, modern water predominantly ensures the recharge of the system at a local scale. Results are compared to regional observations in the Armoricain Massif in order to establish mechanisms responsible for recharge and migration of groundwater at the basement scale.",

            "abstract": "The transport of sediments by water throughout the river basins, from the steep slopes of the upstream regions to the sea level, is recognizable important to keep the natural conditions of rivers with a role on their ecology processes. Over the last decades, a reduction on the supply of sand and gravel has been observed downstream dams existing in several alpine rivers. Many studies highlight that the presence of a dam strongly modifies the river behavior in the downstream reach, in terms of morphology and hydrodynamics, with consequences on local ecology. Sediment deficit, bed armoring, river incision and bank instability are the main effects which affect negatively the aquatic habitats and the water quality. One of the proposed techniques to solve the problem of sediment deficit downstream dams, already adopted in few Japanese and German rivers although on an unsatisfactory fashion, is the artificial replenishment of these. Generally, it was verified that the erosion of the replenishments was not satisfactory and the transport rate was not enough to move the sediments to sufficient downstream distances. In order to improve and to provide an engineering answer to make this technique more applicable, a series of laboratory tests are ran as preparatory study to understand the hydrodynamics of the river flow when the replenishment technique is applied. Erodible volumes, with different lengths and submergence conditions, reproducing sediment replenishments volumes, are positioned along a channel bank. Different geometrical combinations of erodible sediment volumes are tested as well on the experimental flume. The first results of the experimental research, concerning erosion time evolution, the influence of discharge and the distance travelled by the eroded sediments, will be presented and discussed.",

Big data is inherently an application-driven problem. Developing the right technologies requires an understanding of the applications domain. Though, an intriguing aspect of this phenomenon is that the availability of the data itself enables new applications not previously conceived of! In this talk, we will discuss how the big data phenomenon creates an imperative for collaboration among domain scientists (in this case, geoscientists) and computer scientists. Domain scientists provide the application requirements as well as insights about the data involved, while computer scientists help assess whether problems can be solved with currently available technologies or require adaptaion of existing technologies and/or development of new technologies. The synergy can create vibrant collaborations potentially leading to new science insights as well as development of new data technologies and systems. The area of interface between geosciences and computer science, also referred to as geoinformatics is, we believe, a fertile area for interdisciplinary research.",

The measurements were made at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO) located at the summit of Mt. Bachelor in central Oregon (43.9794° N, 121.6885° W, 2,763 m asl) in summer 2013 during the DOE sponsored Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) field campaign. We utilized an Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) coupled with a thermodenuder. Observations during periods affected by biomass burning (BB) pollution showed elevated non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) concentration up to 140 µg/m3. NR-PM1 correlated well with PM light scattering (up to ~ 600 Mm-1 at 550 nm) and gas phase CO (up to ~0.4 ppmv). The AMS BB tracer, f60, i.e., fraction of organic signals at m/z = 60, was also enhanced with a maximum of ~ 2%. Organic aerosol (OA) dominated the PM composition in BB plumes (94.1% of the NR-PM1 mass) with an average concentration of 13.9 µg/m3. Three distinctive BBOA factors were identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF): a fresh BBOA-I factor (O/C=0.27, H/C=1.52, f60 = 2.26%) that correlates well with ammonium nitrate; an intermediately oxidized BBOA-II (O/C=0.52, H/C=1.47, f60 = 1.05%), and a highly oxidized BBOA-III (O/C=0.95, H/C=1.02) with a low f60 (< 0.01%) and enhanced tracer ions for carboxylic acids (e.g., CHO2+). During persistent BB plume events from fixed fire sources, fresh BBOA-I initially dominated the OA composition, but decreased as the more oxidized BBOA-II increased while BBOA-III remained unchanged. These events shed light on the chemical transformation of BB aerosol during atmospheric aging. We will examine the enhancement of different BBOA factors relative to CO to investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation processes in BB plumes.",

            "abstract": "The Ediacaran to Cambrian period records one of the most dramatic biological episodes in Earth’s history. The weathering influx from continents is thought to be a major influence on the change in composition of ancient seawater and on biological evolution. Its flux can be constrained from the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of ancient carbonate rocks. However, the scarcity of well-preserved outcrops of Ediacaran rocks still leaves ambiguity in decoding ambient surface environmental changes and biological evolution.\nThe Ediacaran strata in South China are almost continuously exposed, comprise mainly carbonate rocks with subordinate black shales, and contain many fossils. Therefore, they are suitable for study of a link between environmental and biological changes in the Ediacaran. We conducted on-land drilling from Liantuo, via Nantuo, Doushantuo, Dengying and Yanjiahe to Shuijingtuo formations at four sites in the Three Gorges area to obtain continuous, fresh samples. We analyzed radiogenic Sr isotope of the fresh carbonate rocks with a MC-ICP-MS at Kyoto University.\nThe 87Sr/86Sr excursion preserved in the drilled samples displays a smooth curve and three large positive shifts in the Ediacaran. The first large positive excursion occurred together with negative δ13C and positive δ18O excursions. We interpret that global regression due to global cooling enhanced the oxidative decay of exposed marine organic sediments and continental weathering.\nThe second large positive shift of 87Sr/86Sr firstly accompanied a positive δ13C excursion, and continued through the Shuram negative δ13C excursion. The higher 87Sr/86Sr values are the first compelling evidence for enhanced continental weathering in the Ediacaran, which was responsible for the large δ13C anomaly through the re-mineralization of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir by more active sulfate reduction due to a higher sulfate influx.\nThe 87Sr/86Sr ratios display a large positive anomaly just below the PC/C boundary at the lower part of Yanjiahe Formation. The data indicates that the 87Sr/86Sr excursions preceded the δ13C negative excursion, and suggests that global regression or locally high continental weathering influx caused the re-mineralization of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir at the beginning of the Cambrian.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand the biological processes taking place on an experimental hillslope with vegetation, it is important to know the amount of gasses such as oxygen and carbon dioxide being produced and consumed. When studying the gas exchange rates in a closed system like the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO), one must take into account gas that is being lost or gained from other sources. Aside from biogeochemical processes, gas concentrations in the LEO atmosphere may change due to leakage to the outside environment and diffusion into the soil. To quantify these fluxes, two constants must be determined experimentally: the gas leakage constant L and the coefficient of diffusion for the hillslope soil. To accomplish this, a tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride, was injected into the sealed east bay chamber and syringes were used to take samples periodically from the airspace and from the hillslope soil. The relative sulfur hexafluoride concentrations were then analyzed with a SRI 8610c gas chromatograph. By analyzing both the the airspace concentration decay as well as the concentration in the soil, the chamber’s leakage constant was determined to be and the soil diffusion coefficient was also determined. Once these values are experimentally quantified, they can be used in equations to quantify the rate of gas leakage and soil diffusion of more important gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen.",

It is hypothesised that this flow regime transports basal debris which emerges glacier surface at the base of the nunatak, where it resides for long periods of time. Quantifying the long- and short-term evolution and persistence of these features is central to refining estimates of, and constraining the principles drivers of long-term ice-sheet stability. High resolution digital elevation models derived from sUAV photography and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and Terrestrial Laser Scanning have been used to quantify rates and patterns of topographic change across a blue-ice moraine in the Heritage Range, West Antarctica, between the 2012/13 and 2013/14 melt seasons, and within the 2012/13 melt season. We benchmark these SfM-TLS derived change detection data against coincident dGPS ablation and movement stake data, with a view to assessing the utility of the different approaches for resolving small-scale (centimetric to sub-centimetric) surface change in ice-marginal areas over annual and sub-annual timescales.",

Mass losses have increased in recent decades and are expected to remain significant for at least another century. However, large uncertainties relating to the dynamic contribution of marine-terminating glaciers and ice caps remain, in part due to a lack of observations. Satellite sensors provide an important tool for monitoring these remote glacial systems, although the relatively restricted size of these smaller bodies of ice has, in the past, made such observation challenging, limiting the number of geodetic techniques available and the period over which such measurements have been made. Several recent missions, however, offer improved resolution and the capability for detailed observation of these areas. Here we use data acquired by a range of satellite sensors, including CryoSat-2, ICESat, Sentinel-1a, TerraSAR-X and ALOS, to study the decadal evolution of Austfonna, the largest ice cap in the Eurasian Arctic. We will focus on one marine-terminating sector which has been rapidly losing ice to the ocean, investigating the dynamic activation of this formerly slow-flowing area and the resulting development of widespread dynamical imbalance within this region.",

Degradation is the second “d” in “REDD” but in the Brazilian Amazon, the largest extent of tropical forest in any country on earth, it is still very poorly understood compared to the first “d”, deforestation. Forest degradation in the Amazon region of Brazil results primarily from logging and understory forest fires or from a combination of both processes. Current estimates based on remote sensing for the total area degraded vary by as much as a factor of four in a given year between 1999 and 2012. The total area of degraded forest and the effects of degradation on the reduction of forest aboveground biomass are probably less than for deforestation but no one knows how much less. I contrast case studies for four assessments of forest degradation area based on remote sensing data in the Brazilian Amazon and explain differences in the current assessments based on the process focus, temporal mismatches, the spatial scale of the analysis, and threshold effects.",

            "abstract": "Alpine lakes in NW Sweden are highly sensitive to variations in catchment erosion and in precipitation. Previous studies aimed at reconstructing past summer temperatures have suggested that this sensitivity may influence chironomid species composition enough to cause bias in quantitative temperature reconstructions. In this study we have analysed lake sediments covering the last 5100 years from Lake Vuoksjávrátje in NW Sweden and catchment geomorphology with the aim to separate between different erosional regimes in the lake and its catchment and to identify sediment sources and processes behind sediment deposition in the lake basin. Methods include XRF core scanning, grain size analysis, chironomid analysis, TOC and C/N analysis and detailed mapping of geomorphology.\nFrom the integrated results we identify time intervals with increased catchment erosion, inferred to result from intense precipitation. Based on the combined proxy data it was concluded that a major flood event took place at the Vindelfjällen site c. 2800 cal BP, unique for the 5100-year long record. The chironomid species composition shows stronger influence from wetland surface erosion at c. 2800 cal BP and during the last c. 1000 years. By combining multi-proxy lake sediment analysis with study of catchment geomorphology it is possible to improve the understanding of Late Holocene hydro-climatic change and how it may influence Arctic alpine lakes.",

            "abstract": "Structural geological, geochemical and geochronological data were compiled with the purpose to exercise models for the construction of upper crustal batholith. Models for pulsed intrusion of small magma batches over long timescales versus transfer of larger magma bodies on a shorter time scales are able to predict a different thermal, metamorphic, and rheological state of the crust. For this purpose we have applied the chronostratigraphic framework for magma differentiation on three granite complexes namely the St. Francois Mountain granite pluton (Precambrian), the Galway granite (Cambrian), and the Sithonia Plutonic Complex (Eocene). These plutons have similar sizes and range in composition from quartz diorites through granodiorites and granites to alkali granites, indicating multiple intrusive episodes. Thermobarometric calculations imply an upper crustal emplacement. Geochemical, isotopic and petrological data indicate a variety of pulses from each pluton allowing to be related through their liquid line of decent, which is supported by fractional crystallization of predominantly plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, hornblende and some minor accessory mineral phases, magma mingling and mixing as well as crustal contamination. To obtain the temporal relationship we carried out high-precision CA-TIMS zircon geochronology on selected samples along the liquid line of decent. The obtained data indicate a wide range of rates: such as different pulses evolved on timescales of about only 10-30ka, although, the construction time of the different complexes ranges from millions of years with prolonged tectonically inactive phases to relatively short lived time ranges of about ~300 ka. For a better understanding how these new data were used and evaluated in order to reconstruct constraints on the dynamics of the magmatic plumbing system, we integrated the short-lived, elevated heat production, due to latent heat of crystallization, into a 2D numerical model of the thermal evolution of segments of continental crust. Our model indicates that during the stage of enhanced fractional crystallization, the crustal viscosity decreases by several orders of magnitude, playing hereby a fundamental role in the thermal, magmatic, and tectonic evolution of the studied areas and most probably in similar regions too.",

Many geological field surveys and geophysical studies indicated that 1912, Sarkoy-Murefte event, occurred on the Ganos Fault Zone, was one of the largest earthquake in the western Marmara Sea and caused tsunami. The same is also valid for 04.01.1935, 14:41, M=6.4 and 16:20 M=6.3 Erdek-Marmara Island, and 18.09.1963, 16:58, M=6.3 Cinarcik earthquakes. The aim of this study is to contribute to the seismotectonics of this region by examining the source parameters of these shocks using seismic waveforms, which were previously not carried out by modern techniques. In this study, the original seismograms from various countries for 1912 Sarköy-Mürefte, 1935, Erdek Marmara Island and 1963, Cinarcik earthquakes were digitized. The magnitude Mw, seismic moment Mo, the radius of circular source zone R and stress drop values were redetermined from displacement spectra of the digitized seismic waveforms. A large number of seismic station bulletins have been consulted for the instrumental information to remove the instrument response. In addition, the epicentral locations have been calculated using available readings from original records and ISS bulletins for the 1935 and 1963 earthquakes. For the 1912 event, the magnitude Mw=7.13 and radius of the fault area R=41 km were determined. Also, 04.01.1935-14:41 and 16:20 earthquakes showed a fault radius of about 15 km with magnitudes Mw=6.0 and Mw=5.9, respectively. The epicenter determinations showed that the first event in 04.01.1935 was located at 40.72 N- 27.72 E while the second one occurred at 40.61 N-27.43 E. Another finding is of the 1963 event, which gave a fault radius of approximately 13 km with a magnitude Mw=5.9. The 1963 event was located at 40.80 N-29.18 E. Furthermore; moment tensor inversion method was applied on these earthquakes by using original seismograms collected from various observatories. The fault mechanisms for 04.01.1935-14:41 and 16:20 earthquakes were determined using moment tensor inversion from the original seismic waveforms for the first time. Likewise, fault mechanism for the 1963 Cinarcik earthquake was also obtained. The results showed that these earthquakes have normal fault mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic activity generates topography, and the variability of tectonic forcing is responsible for topographic patterns and variability of relief in fluvial landscapes. Despite this basic relation, the inverse problem, by which features of the topography are used for inferring tectonic uplift rates, has proven challenging. In the current work, we develop formal linear inversion schemes to infer a record of the rate of relative uplift as a function of space and time from the long profiles of rivers. The relative uplift rate is the difference between the rates of rock uplift and of the base level change. The inversion schemes are based on a closed-form analytic solution to the transient linear stream power model, and to increase model resolution they make use of the multiplicity of information made available by multiple rivers and their tributaries. The distribution of the fluvial response time to tectonic perturbations is a key component of the inversion scheme, as this determines which tectonic events are preserved in the topography. We develop two inversion parameterizations that differ in their assumptions about the tectonic forcing: space-invariant and time-space variability with an assumed spatial distribution.\nWe apply the inversion schemes to the Inyo Mountains, an uplifted block along the western boundary of the Basin and Range Province in California. Inversion results indicate that the range has been experiencing an acceleration of the relative uplift in the past ~2-3 Myr. We further use the inversion results to constrain the paleotopography and paleo-erosion rate along the range and to recover the throw rate history along the fault that bounds the Inyo range.",

            "abstract": "In-situ observations of fast solar wind streams at distances of 0.29 AU and beyond by Helios and recently by MESSENGER, and at ~1 AU by STEREO, ACE, and Wind spacecraft provide direct evidence for the presence of turbulent Alfvén wave spectrum and of left-hand polarized ion-cyclotron waves as well as He++ - proton drift in the solar wind plasma. The waves and the super-Alfvénic drift can produce temperature anisotropies by resonant absorption and perpendicular heating of the ions. Measurements indicate that proton velocity distributions are generally non-Maxwellian with evidence for beams, while remote sensing observations of coronal holes have shown that heavy ions are hotter than protons with a temperature anisotropy greater than one (Ti,perp> Ti,||). In addition to the anisotropy, it is expected that the solar wind will be inhomogeneous on decreasing scales approaching the Sun. Here we use a 2.5 D hybrid code and extend previous work to study the heating of solar wind ions (H+, He+) in an inhomogeneous plasma background. We explore the effects of an initial ion drift and of a turbulent wave spectrum on the perpendicular ion heating and cooling and on the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations in the inhomogeneous background solar wind. Using the 2D hybrid model we find that inhomogeneities in the plasma generate significant power of oblique waves in the solar wind plasma, in addition to enhanced heating compared to the homogenous solar wind case. We find that the cooling effect due to the solar wind expansion is only significant when sub-Alfvénic drifts are explored. On the other hand, the cooling is not significant in the presence of a super-Alfvénic drift, and it is even less significant when we include an inhomogeneous background density. We are able to reproduce the ion temperature anisotropy seen in observations and previous models and find that small-scale inhomogeneities in the inner heliosphere can have a significant impact on resonant wave ion heating.",

            "abstract": "Forest clear-cutting has been found to significantly increase concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in boreal first-order streams. Here, we address the questions of 1) how the additional inputs of DOC by upstream forest harvesting affect downstream locations within a stream network and 2) what catchment area has to be harvested to cause a significant downstream increase in DOC concentration. We combined the use of primary data from a paired-catchment experiment, clear-cut history of a nested stream network derived from satellite images with a mixing-model approach in order to quantify the importance of upstream clear-cuts on two downstream sites with different catchment sizes. Modeled [DOC] agreed well with the measured concentrations in the smaller, 8.7 km2 catchment located above a larger wetland area, but discrepancies occurred for the larger 22.9 km2 catchment located downstream of the wetland. Estimates of the critical area (Acritical) needed to be harvested to cause a significant impact on downstream DOC concentrations was quantified to be 11% for p<0.05 and 23-25% for p<0.001. Our results suggests that (i) increased DOC concentrations induced by forest harvesting affect downstream sites and (ii) additional DOC inputs by harvests have a significant impact on stream water quality, if harvests exceed Acritical. We suggest that the estimates of Acritical could be used in sensitive river networks to provide harvesting-thresholds to be included in forest planning that includes considerations of the negative impact of clear-cutting on water quality.",

            "abstract": "Until some years ago, oceanographic data in Europe were scattered across dozens of data centres and hundreds of government agencies, research institutes and university groups. As a consequence, it was impossible to get an overview of available data and very difficult to get access to the data. And even if one managed to get access, data were difficult to use because the data came in different formats and were of varying quality.\nAll these issues were successfully addressed in a series of projects culminating in the current SeaDataNet-project. The resulting and operational SeaDataNet infrastructure now connects hundreds of data sources from 35 countries in and around Europe. It was designed to provide a central overview of available data as well as direct access to a distributed system of online data sources. When data are being transferred to the user, the data are converted into a standard format, chosen by the user. Through a joint activity with the MyOcean project, all data within the SeaDataNet infrastructure have been quality controlled.\nThe SeaDataNet infrastructure now offers many possibilities in support of Europe’s ‘blue economy’.\nIt forms the backbone for the projects under the umbrella of the European Marine Observation and Data Network or EMODNet. The EMODNet projects produce a series of dataproducts on all aspects of the European marine environment. The data for these dataproducts are provided using the SeaDataNet infrastructure.\nThis presentation describes the principles of the SeaDataNet infrastructure and how it connects those hundreds of data sources in Europe. It will explain the strong link, but also the differences, with the MyOcean project and will go on to introduce the EMODNet-programme and -projects as an example of what can be done if one has achieved uniform access to a distributed system of hundreds of data sources. Finally, the presentation will also address the long-term sustainability of the chosen approach.",

Electric conductivity itself is measured in the laboratory with a wide range of instruments and techniques. These measurements seldom return a compatible result.\nThe presence of partially-interconnected random pathways of electrically conductive materials in resistive hosts has been studied for decades, and recently with increasing interest. To comprehend which conductive mechanism scales from the microstructures up to field electrical conductivity measurements, two main branch of studies have been undertaken: statistical probability of having a conductive pathways and mixing laws.\nSeveral numerical approaches have been tested to understand the effects of interconnected pathways of conductors at field scale. Usually these studies were restricted in two ways: the sources are considered constant in time (i.e., DC) and the domain is, with few exception, two-dimensional. We simulated the effects of time-varying EM sources on the conductivity measured on the surface of a three-dimensional randomly generated body embedded in an uniform host by using electromagnetic induction equations.\nWe modelled a two-phase mixture of resistive and conductive elements with the goal of comparing the conductivity measured on field scale with the one proper of the elements constituting the random rock, and to test how the internal structures influence the directionality of the responses. Moreover, we modelled data from randomly generated bodies characterized by coherent internal structures, to check the effect of the named structures on the anisotropy of the effective conductivity.\nWe compared these values with the electrical conductivity limits predicted by Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and the effective conductivity predicted by the Archie’s law, both cast in its classic form and in an updated that allow to take in account two materials. The same analysis was done for both the resistive and the conductive conductivity values for the anisotropic case.",

Earlier studies of the Kalahari Craton infer deformation of upper mantle by flow with fast direction of seismic anisotropy being parallel to present plate motion, and/or report anisotropy frozen into the lithospheric mantle. We present evidence for very strong seismic anisotropy in the crust of southern Africa, including the cratons. The crustal anisotropy is 30-40% of the total anisotropy as measured by SKS splitting. Our analysis is based on calculation of receiver functions for the data from the SASE experiment which shows strong splitting between the SV and SH components. The direction of the fast axes is uniform within tectonic units and parallel to orogenic strike in the Limpopo and Cape fold belts. It is further parallel to the strike of major dyke swarms which indicates that a large part of the observed anisotropy is controlled by lithosphere fabrics and macroscopic effects. The directions of the fast axes for the crustal anisotropy are parallel to the general directions determined from SKS splitting, although the directions from our analysis of receiver functions is more homogeneous for than for SKS splitting. This analysis indicates parallel fast axes in the crust and in the mantle, which suggests that the crust and lithospheric mantle have been coupled since cratonisation. If so, the apparent match between mantle anisotropy and the present plate motion is coincidental.",

            "abstract": "The Chenaillet ophiolite lies at the Franco-Italian border in the Alps and consists of a rather well-exposed, undeformed and complete ocean-floor sequence. This sequence was formed within the Alpine Tethys oceanic domain at about 160 Ma and was subsequently obducted during Europe-Adria convergence. Well preserved pillow lavas, gabbros and serpentinized mantle rocks can be found following a stratigraphic order. It has been recently suggested, based on stratigraphic observations, that Chenaillet could be a remnant Oceanic Core Complex (Manatschal et al., 2011). In order to have a better understanding of the nature of this ophiolite, a paleomagnetic and rock magnetic study was undertaken. Results are compared with a set of data from a recent (less than 1 Ma) serpentinized ultramafic complex at the Atlantic ridge (ODP leg 153) and from various ophiolites. Our results show that the magnetic behavior of the serpentinized section from Chenaillet is rather different than in most other ophiolites but shows strong similarities with that observed for the Atlantic set. This suggests that serpentinization at Chenaillet occurs in an environment which share similarities with slow spreading ridges. In addition preliminary paleomagnetic results show that the mantle section from the Chenaillet ophiolite may have been rotated during unroofing as observed in recent Oceanic Core Complexes.",

            "abstract": "Swedish authorities currently explore how the next generation of environmental objectives for 2050 should be formulated taking into account climate change, changes in land use and deposition of pollutants. To provide scientific support, we have modelled a suite of combined scenarios to predict the non-linear dynamics of riverine nutrients, using a national multi-basin model system for Sweden, called ‘S-HYPE’. The model is process-based and the set-up covers more than 450 000 km2 and produces daily values of nutrient concentration and water discharge in 37 000 catchments.\nNet nutrient fluxes from large catchments in modified landscapes are influenced by land use characteristics but also by landscape composition, e.g. occurrence of lakes on the main stream network or connectivity of nutrient source areas to the stream network. This is accounted for in the model concept. Forestry management changes were investigated for potential conflicts with national environmental protection goals.\nThe scenarios included three forestry management scenarios, three down-scaled climate change projections based on Hadley and Echam GCMs, and one nitrogen deposition scenario. The aim was to evaluate basin-wide impacts on TN and TP fluxes as well as feedbacks between the respective scenarios. Combined scenarios were thus modelled.\nResults indicate a low impact of changes in forestry management and atmospheric deposition for both concentrations and loads; whereas changes in water balance dynamics through changes in climate forcing can lead to regionally strong changes in nutrient concentrations and fluxes. The impact assessment through a chain of multiple scenarios and the various numerical models involved, accumulate a considerable uncertainty. While a formal assessment of overall uncertainties is difficult for the chosen approach, we discuss the modeled impacts in the light of expectable uncertainties resulting from scenario assumption choices and limitations in the model framework.",

            "abstract": "Waves of all types including synoptic waves, extratropical planetary waves, and gravity waves, combine to produce the equator-to-pole Brewer-Dobson circulation, the circulation describing chemical transport in the stratosphere. Small-scale gravity wave effects have been difficult to quantify with observations, since three-dimensional, global, high-resolution measurements are required. We describe a new method utilizing Aura observations to compute gravity wave driving of the circulation.\nHIRDLS data are unique among high-resolution datasets available for wave studies. The vertical width of the field of view projected at the limb is 1.2 km giving vertical resolution ∼1 km, and rivaling that of GPS radio occultation temperature retrievals. This resolution is crucial for wave studies in the lower stratosphere, where the vertical wavenumber spectrum of gravity wave energy peaks at a vertical wavelength near 2km. HIRDLS horizontal resolution is also unique. The field of view projected at the limb is ∼20km wide, and individual HIRDLS profiles are spaced ∼100km apart. These properties combine to give HIRDLS uniquely fine characteristics for gravity wave studies. Like most high-inclination limb-scanning satellites, HIRDLS provides no cross-track measurements: The high resolution lies along a single measurement track line. For wave studies, the lack of cross-track sampling limits the global wavenumbers that can be studied to wavenumbers ∼0-7 and limits estimates of gravity wave horizontal wavenumber to only the apparent wavenumber along the measurement track. The lack of cross-track sampling leads to large uncertainties in gravity wave momentum fluxes due to the lack of information on wave propagation direction. The resulting momentum flux uncertainties are likely a factor of 2 or more, and the lack of directional information further limits the use of HIRDLS data for inferring wave effects on the circulation.\nWe augment HIRDLS measurements with Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation temperature profiles to provide missing cross-track information. We use these data to compute correction factors for errors in gravity wave horizontal wavelengths and momentum fluxes globally, and to estimate gravity wave momentum flux direction for improved estimates of their effects on the circulation.",

They record a very rapid uplift.It is thought that it is difficult by the conventional study on paleotsunami deposits.\nIn a distinctive tectonic and morphologic in east coast of Taiwan, we consider what kind of study on paleotsunami deposits investigation is effective concretely.",

            "abstract": "Olive oil production in Greece, on the island of Crete especially, is a major industry impacting the local and national economy. The process to create olive oil produces large amounts of organic waste that is currently unregulated, such that disposal is mostly uncontrolled. The most common disposal practice involves the dumping of the olive oil mill waste in open unprotected pits (evaporation ponds), in the vicinity of the mill; considering the size of the industry in Crete (5% of world oil production), the potential for large scale environmental contamination is high. In order to develop appropriate regulation and waste management processes, subsurface monitoring of leachate from evaporation ponds is needed. Previous successful uses of geoelectrical methods to characterize and monitor hydrocarbon contaminated sites suggest that these methods may prove valuable for monitoring olive oil mills leachates.\nWe performed a time-series of geoelectrical methods, starting in September 2013 with monthly acquisition of electrical resistivity imaging over an evaporation pond of the Alikianos village in Western Crete. Time domain induced polarization (IP) and spectral induced polarization (SIP) have also been recently acquired to better characterize the plume. The organic plume is clearly imaged as a high conductivity feature entering the phreatic aquifer and discharging into the Keritis river. The electrical resistivity data have been ground-truthed from direct sampling in trenches intercepting the plume. The time lapse images capture evidence of migration of the plume from beneath the pit to the river, as well as biodegradation over time.\nThe work is funded by the European Social Fund and National Resources in the framework of the project THALIS-MIS 380207:‘‘GEODIAMETRIS–Integrated Geoinformatics Technologies for Time Lapse Monitoring of Land Pollution from the Disposal of Olive-Oil Mills Waste’’.",

            "abstract": "Very high-resolution (VHR) imagery can in principle measure surface topography with decimetric precision. The question is how well 3D mapping based on VHR stereo imagery is capable of capturing sub-metric height changes occurring in an earthquake, particularly those in remote areas? The aim of this study is to assess the capability of the Pleiades satellites to determine such height changes.\nWe acquired Pleiades stereo imagery with backward (B), near-nadir (N) and forward (F) orientations over a 40 km × 5 km area in Baja California, Mexico, part of the epicentral area of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake. Coverage was chosen to coincide with the post-seismic LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM) for the area. DEMs have been produced with four different combinations of incidence angles (B-N, N-F, B-F and B-N-F). The raw point cloud has the lowest average density of ~0.7 points/m2 for B-F, ~1.0 points/m2 for B-N and N-F, and the greatest average density of ~3 points/m2 for tri-stereo (B-N-F). Compared to the post-earthquake LiDAR DEM, the Pleiades DEMs have a mean error of 1 m to 4 m, with a standard deviation of 0.5 m to 0.7 m.\nA series of topographic profiles from the Pleiades DEMs across the earthquake rupture were used to measure vertical offsets. These profiles show that the Pleiades DEM is capable of capturing vertical offsets of ~0.5 m. The measurements of vertical offsets from tri-stereo have smaller uncertainties than bi-stereo; this suggests that the tri-stereo DEM incorporating redundant observations is more robust and reliable. By differencing the 1-m tri-stereo Pleiades DEM and the pre-earthquake, lower-resolution (5-m) LiDAR DEM, we mapped metre and sub-metre offsets along the faults obtaining results comparable to a previous study that differenced the two LiDAR DEMs (Fig. 1). By extension, we expect it to be possible in similar settings to measure sub-metre vertical offsets occurring in earthquakes using pre- and post-event Pleiades stereo imagery.",

            "abstract": "Leaf water repellency is a measure of the hydrophobicity, or wettability, of leaf surfaces. At the scale of the plant, leaf water repellency can affect gas exchange, nutrient exchange, and pathogen growth. At the scale of the ecosystem, it can affect canopy water storage, throughfall, and evaporation. To date, very few studies have measured intra- and inter- community variation in leaf water repellency of tropical forest ecosystems. In the context of a broad survey of plant functional traits, we measured leaf water repellency in nine forest plots occurring across a 4000 m elevation gradient in the eastern Andes of Peru. Observed angles of incidence (63 ± 13°) indicate high leaf wettability, with no significant difference between sun and shade leaves. In contrast with previous research along elevation gradients, we find no strong evidence for variation across sites, but rather find high variation within a given site. Finally, we find that leaf water repellency may be predicted using sunlit leaf spectra with a low RMSE (<25% of the mean), indicating that future research on leaf water repellency could be carried out using high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. As the climate of tropical ecosystems changes, the resultant changes in leaf water repellency will impact plants, communities and ecosystems. Our results inform our understanding of where and to what extent these impacts are most likely to occur.",

            "abstract": "The importance of space weather and understanding onset o geomagnetic storms is increasing day by day as the space missions increase. It is known from the ground-based and space-borne observations that a geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of earth’s magnetosphere caused by a solar wind and/or solar eruptions. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents and energetic particles high in the Earth's magnetosphere. It is known that number of phenomena occurs during the space weather events; and there are many un-solved questions like solar wind coupling with magnetosphere and ionosphere, relationship between geomagnetic storms & sub-storms etc.\nTo evaluate contribution of various interplanetary parameters that have major role in the geomagnetic storm/geomagnetic variations, the information theory approach is used. In information theory, the measure of uncertainty or randomness of a signal can be quantified by using Shannon entropy or entropy for short. And Transfer entropy is capable of quantifying the directional flow of information between two signals. Thus the Transfer entropy is capable of distinguishing effectively driving and responding signals.\nIn this study, we use Transfer entropy function on Solar wind parameters and ground magnetic data to derive the drivers and relations between them, and also study their contributed effect on ionospheric TEC. In this presentation, we will evaluate and present the results obtained, and discuss about the driving forces on the geomagnetic field disturbances.",

            "abstract": "Plant scaling models use measurements of architecture (i.e., length, width, and order of branch or xylem segments) to ultimately predict whole-plant metabolism via mass and water-use allometries. The application of plant scaling models is broad, and holds potential to simplify forest modelling efforts. However little is known regarding the influence of the environment (e.g., temperature, light, etc) on variation in branching architecture traits and how this variation affects scaling. Furthermore, scaling model assumptions of a self-similar and symmetric branching network have not been extensively tested, especially in tropical forests. As such, it is still unclear to what extent tree communities can be approximated by simple geometrical models, and where important functional divergences from theory exist. Here we analyse novel tree architecture data from diverse species along a 4000m elevational gradient spanning the Andes to the Amazon in Peru. Specifically, we calculate and compare inter- and intra-specific scaling exponents related to branch segment length and width within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Preliminary results indicate that branching architecture significantly varies among and within species especially with respect to light environments. As such, we explore the role of light in driving tree geometry by also analysing differences in light environment and crown shape. Then, we attempt to link branch architecture and crown shape. Using 6 branch-level and whole-tree traits (path length fraction, crown depth, crown width, crown volume, crown depth/width and crown width/depth) we are able to cluster 68 species of trees into 6 unique groups related to architecture and explain ~60% variability in these data. In the future, it will be important to relate these architectural groups to variation in leaf-level traits and physiology. Lastly, we discuss the implications of using these results to understand tropical forest responses to environmental change.",

This profile is assumed to be a general Gaussian distribution in this study. By substituting the general Gaussian function into ecosystem dynamical equations, the steady-state solutions for SCM characteristics (i.e. SCM layer depth, thickness, and intensity) in various scenarios are derived. These solutions indicate that: 1) The maximum in Chl a concentrations occurs at or below the depth with the maximum in growth rates of phytoplankton locating at the transition from nutrient limitation to light limitation, and the depth of SCM layer deepens logarithmically with an increase in surface light intensity; 2) The shape of SCM layer (thickness and intensity) is mainly influenced by nutrient supply, but independent of surface light intensity; 3) The intensity of SCM layer is proportional to the diffusive flux of nutrient from below, getting stronger as a result of this layer being shrank by a higher light attenuation coefficient or a larger sinking velocity of phytoplankton. 4) The depth of SCM layer is approximately linear with the nutricine depth, which is inversely proportional to light attenuation coefficient in regions with a low subsurface turbulent diffusivity. The analytical solutions can be useful to estimate environmental parameters which are difficult to observe on site.",

Coercivity analysis and central ridge on FORC diagrams confirm the predominance of magnetofossil.

            "abstract": "Measurements of spatial variability of naturally-occurring tracers in porewater from low-permeability rocks can provide insight into porewater residence time and the nature of solute transport. These system characteristics, in turn, are required to assess the long-term integrity of geologic systems for waste management. However, the measurement of porewater chemistry in low‑permeability rocks is challenging because of the small fluid volume and the difficulty of extracting representative samples. Several techniques for porewater characterization are available, but the results they provide can be affected by ion exchange and mineral dissolution, and they may require independent porosity measurements. The objectives of this work are to develop and test a method of extracting representative samples of in-situ porewater from low‑permeability rocks, and to accurately quantify solute concentrations in the extracted porewater. The method involves extraction of porewaterby absorption into hydrophilic cellulosic membranes. The masses of solutes extracted with the porewater are measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP‑MS), and the mass of extracted water is measured by near infrared (NIR) spectrometry. In-situ porewater solute concentrations are obtained by normalizing solute mass to water mass. Laboratory experiments using controlled additions of brine to cellulosic membranes confirm that the method is capable of providing porewater solute concentrations with precision and accuracy that are within the limits suggested by USEPA Method 6020A for analysis of saline water samples by ICP-MS. This presentation will provide a detailed description of the absorption method and show the results of a field trial in which concentrations of major porewater ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Cl-, Br-) in a low-permeability shale (K <10-12 m/s, porosity < 10 %) were quantified and compared to results from the crush-and-leach method obtained from paired samples. The results of the comparison demonstrate that the absorption method provides precise porewater chemistry data that are free from ion-exchange and mineral-dissolution artefacts.",

            "abstract": "Continuous acoustic emission (AE) data recorded during rock deformation tests facilitates the monitoring of fracture initiation and propagation due to applied stress changes. Changes in the frequency and energy content of AE waveforms have been previously observed associated with microcrack coalescence and the induction or mobilisation of large fractures which are naturally associated with larger amplitude AE events and lower frequency components. The shift from high to low dominant frequency components during the late stages of the deformation experiment, as the rate of AE events increases and the sample approaches failure, indicates a transition from the micro-cracking to macro-cracking regime, where large cracks generated result in material failure.\nTo analyse and characterise these changes, a detailed time-frequency analysis of the continuous waveform data is required. Fourier-based techniques (e.g. STFT) and the Wavelet Transform have several drawbacks such as fixed window size (STFT), poor time-frequency resolution and some general assumption of linearity and/or stationarity. These techniques are not suitable for the detailed analysis of AE data which are generally nonstationary and nonlinear.\nThe Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is suitable for non-stationary and non-linear time-series analysis, with the ability to identify intrinsic features in the data. EMD adaptively decomposes a time-varying signal into a finite set of functions called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), where each IMF represents an oscillatory term in the original signal in a different frequency band. The instantaneous frequency and amplitude of each IMF is derived by applying the Hilbert Transform (HT) to the IMFs which provides a high resolution time-frequency distribution of the data.\nThis paper proposes the use of the combined EMD and HT method to analyse the continuous AE data recorded during a laboratory triaxial deformation experiment on a cylindrical sample of Westerly Granite. The objectives of this study are to identify and extract the observed frequency changes which can be used to characterise the fracture process, particularly around failure where the fast occurrence of AE events does not allow the identification of individual AE events and phase arrivals.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity rover landed at Gale, an early Hesperian age crater formed within Noachian rocks. In Hummocky plain, more than half of the igneous floats rocks are highly alkaline rocks (Stolper et al. doi: 101126/science.12239463, Schmidt et al. doi: 10.1002/2013JE004481) and feldspar-bearing rocks (Sautter et al. doi: 10.1002/2013JE00447). ChemCam observations at sub-millimeter scale show that these samples contain a significant feldspar component, either associated with LCP in gabbroic texture or with augite in effusive rocks defining an alkaline K-feldspar-bearing suite: basanite, trachy-andesite with porphyritic texture and syenitic rock with apahnitic texture. This series likely resulted from differentiation of liquids produced by low degrees of partial melting of primitive mantle. These rocks are float rocks or occurred as clast in conglomerate suggesting a provenance from Gale crater rim. NWA 7533 is the first Noachian breccia sampling the southern hemisphere Martian regolith. It is a polymict breccia with leucocratic clasts including zircon with 4.4 Ga ages Humayun et al., doi :10.1038/nature). The alkali basaltic evolved clasts contain two feldspars (alkali and plagioclase) and modal recombination gives a basaltic trachy-andesite, gabbroic, trachy-andesite and mugearite clast (Agee et al. doi: 10.1126/science. 1228858). Noritic clasts contain andesine, LCP, and Cr-magnetite. The monzonitic/mugearitic-evolved clasts are composed of alkali feldspar, plagioclase, augite, Ti-Magnetite, Cl-apatite and zircon. These clasts would represent products of Martian crust emplaced at 4.5 Ga and re-melted at 4.4 Ga (Humayun et al., doi :10.1038/nature). The leucocratic clasts of the Noachian SNC breccia will be compared with evolved lithology encountered at Gale crater and products of Noachian magmatism will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We map the lithosphere in Siberia by using the available broadband seismic data for calculation of Ps- and Sp-wave receiver functions (RF). RFs show converted waves from discontinuities in the vicinity of the seismic stations. The main objective is to image the Moho and upper mantle discontinuities, including the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath the study area. We construct the RF using the LQT method (Vinnik, 1977; Kind et al. 1995) in the version by Yuan et al. (1997). Rotation of ray coordinates uses the incidence angles predicted by the AK135 velocity model. This decomposes the wave-field into P, SV and SH components. Converted phases are isolated by iterative, time-domain spiking deconvolution with prewhitening to stabilize the filtering.\nThe RF model images the crustal thickness between 35 and 55 km with a rough Moho topography. Additionally, intracrustal structures are identified by high-frequency S-RFs. Teleseismic converted Ps waves have higher frequency content (0.5–2 Hz) than Sp, which have an upper frequency of 0.1–0.2 Hz, and therefore Ps have about an order of magnitude better resolving power than Sp. The converted Sp-wave rarely resolve intracrustal structure, but can be used for determining Moho depth, and are excellent for detecting relatively broad vertical gradients in velocity, such as expected for a thermally controlled LAB. The combination of both types of RFs allows for independent discontinuity models of the same area in different frequency bands using converted waves with very different raypaths. The two models are coupled through the velocity model used for depth imaging.\nThe results of RF analysis of the crustal and mantle structure will help to build a model for tectonic and geodynamic evolution of different provinces of Siberia. We compare our results to the recent detailed model of crustal structure in the whole of Siberia (SibCrust, Cherepanova et al., 2013) and with seismic models for similar geodynamic settings worldwide.\n ",

On the other hand, the imageries captured by digital camera provide several benefits such as high spatial resolution, simple shooting method, and relatively low-priced instrument. Furthermore, digital camera has less of atmospheric effect such as path radiance than satellite imagery, and have advantage of the shooting with actual land cover. The objective of this study is the comparison of fractional vegetation cover derived from digital camera and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Mongolia. 670 imageries for the above ground including green leaves and soil surface captured by digital camera at the 134 sites in Mongolia from 2011 to 2014 were used to classify the vegetation cover fraction. Thirteen imageries captured by Mongolia and South Korea were selected to determine the best classification method. Various classification methods including the 4 supervised classifications, 2 unsupervised classifications, and histogram methods were used to separate the green vegetation in camera imageries that were converted to two color spaces such as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Hue-Intensity-Saturation (HIS). Those results were validated using the manually counted dataset from the local plant experts. The maximum likelihood classification (MLC) with HIS color space among classification methods showed a good agreement with manually counted dataset. The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error were 1.008 and 7.88%, respectively. Our preliminary result indicates that the MLC with HIS color space has a potential to classify the green vegetation in Mongolia.",

            "abstract": "Partitioning of the earthquake energy budget into heat, radiated seismic energy, and fracture energy, is still a fundamental issue in seismology. Different estimates are provided by seismological studies, but only a few attempts have been made at using structural studies of palaeoseismic faults, exhumed and exposed at the surface, to evaluate this partitioning. Here we present an independent estimate of fracture energy based on the evolution of hydraulic properties during the seismic cycle along an exhumed fault.\nThe Gole Larghe Fault Zone (GLFZ, Italian S Alps) was exhumed from c. 8 km, where it was characterized by seismic activity (pseudotachylytes) but also by hydrous fluid flow (alteration halos and precipitation of hydrothermal minerals in veins and cataclasites). The fault zone has previously been quantitatively characterized (Bistacchi 2011; Smith 2013) providing a rich dataset to generate 3D Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models and simulate fault hydraulic properties. A fundamental parameter that cannot be directly evaluated in the field is the fraction of fractures-faults that were open over a certain time period in the evolution of the fault zone. Based on field and microstructural evidence, we infer that the opening and closing of fractures resulted in a toggle-switch mechanism for fluid flow during the seismic cycle: higher permeability was obtained in the syn- to post-seismic period, when the largest number of fractures was (re)opened by off-fault deformation, then permeability dropped due to fracture cementation.\nPostseismic permeability has been evaluated in a few cases in the world thanks to seismological evidence of fluid migration along active fault systems. Therefore, we were able to develop a parametric hydraulic model of the GLFZ and calibrate it to obtain the fraction of faults-fractures that were open in the postseismic period to obtain realistic fluid flow and permeability values. This fraction is very close to the percolation threshold of the DFN, and it can be converted to fracture intensity (fracture surface per unit volume in the fault zone), which could be integrated to obtain the fracture energy due to off-fault fracturing. Since the fracture energy due to on-fault processes has already been estimated for the GLFZ (Pittarello 2008), this allows us to estimate the total fracture energy.",

In two small holder properties three overland flow experimental plots (1m2) were placed in each of the six evaluated ecosystems under similar biophysical conditions, totaling 18 plots. There was also installed three rainwater collectors and two rain gauges in a nearby area. In the rainy season were collected 234 samples of rainwater and overland flow. The evaluation of the measured variables promote the hydrogeochemical characterization of the overland flow at soil under chop-and-mulch and slash-and-burn practices in the different ecosystems found in the familiar agriculture of this watershed, in which it was identified some distinct hydrogeochemical characteristics of the overland flow. The lowest losses of NO3- (variation range = 0.07 to 2.57 µM) was found in agroecosystem - chop-and-mulch, this nutrient obtained higher values in agroecosystem - slash-and-burn (RQ). In agroecosystem (RQ) initially, there was a high value of PO43- (8.87 µM); EC (121 µS cm-1) and a subsequent sharp decline. Secondary successional forest (CP) of 20 years presented in overland flow pH 4.8 and EC 25 µS cm-1 (average 6 months), low loss of NO3- (0.2 µM) and PO43- (0.05 µM), and large range of variation of SO42- (0.7 to 21.5 µM). While Cl- and SO42- overland flow concentrations were affect by the rainfall variation, the increase of NO3- and PO43-concentrations were more related to the ecosystem management, with the first element responding to the presence of nitrogen-fixing species and the second responding to the burning practices. In summary: This study was efficient to characterize the hydrogeochemical of the overland flow and its relation to the altered ecosystems by Amazonian family farming.",

This talk presents the preliminary results. The three types of ice covers are: grease ice, pancake ice, and fragmented floes. These types of ice covers are commonly found in the marginal ice zone. The first two are present during ice formation from open water in a wave field. They are found near the ice edge or in leads and polynyas. The third one is formed as a continuous ice sheet or large ice floes fracture due to wave, wind stress, or dynamic motion of the ice cover as a whole. The change of wave speed, wavelength, and wave amplitude are determined. These results are compared to previous laboratory and field studies. The possibility of extending the laboratory results to field scale is discussed.",

This is the case for understanding observed climate, as it is the case for historical climate as reconstructed from proxy data and future climate as projected by models. The present study offers a holistic description of northern maritime climate – from the Last Glacial Maximum through to the projected global warming of the 21st century – in this context. It includes the compilation of the most complete temperature record for Norway and the Norwegian Sea to date based on the synthesis of available terrestrial and marine paleoclimate reconstructions into continuous times series, and their continuation into modern and future climate with the instrumental record and a model projection. The scientific literature on a variable northern climate is reviewed against this background, and with a particular emphasis on the role of the Norwegian Atlantic Current – the Gulf Stream’s extension towards the Arctic. This includes the introduction of an explicit and relatively simple diagnostic relation to quantify the change in ocean circulation consistent with reconstructed ocean temperatures. It is found that maritime climate and the strength of the Norwegian Atlantic Current are closely related throughout the record. The nature of the relation is however qualitatively different as one progresses from the past, through the present, and into the future.",

            "abstract": "The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has been operating for more than five-and-a-half years since January 2009. Over that period, the NIES GOSAT Project provided registered researchers and the general public with the retrieved column-averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) (SWIR Level 2 data products), which helped ascertain the global distributions of the two global warming gases and their variability with time and space. Further, with those concentration data that filled gaps in the existing surface monitoring networks, the monthly estimates of regional sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 (Level 4 data products) were obtained with smaller uncertainties. Although there are some issues still left that need to be handled, such as region- and time-dependent biases in Level 2 concentrations and low retrieval success rates over the tropics, the GOSAT Project has contributed significantly to advancing the global carbon cycle studies through providing useful space-based GHG data. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) was launched successfully in July 2014, and now and finally, there are two CO2 monitoring platforms in space, as originally planned ten years ago. GOSAT is expected to operate and continue its observation for the next several years, even after its five-year nominal operation period ended in early 2014. Evaluating and inter-comparing data from the two platforms will yield valuable findings that can further advance the space-based GHG monitoring techniques. For this to happen, all-community collaboration is needed.\nHere, we will present the characteristics of the latest GOSAT data products and some of important research outcomes brought by the GOSAT Research Announcement researchers. We will also show our views on the future of space-based carbon cycle study through close collaboration with worldwide research groups.",

Current temperature profile retrievals only reach up to ~40 km and RO refractivity is only retrieved up to ~60 km. A GCM-independent initialization of the hydrostatic integral is used to obtain temperature profiles that extend higher up, above the stratopause. We also describe a method to detect scale height changes from bending angle profiles and identify the tropopause and stratopause. These are compared with the heights where changes occur in the temperature lapse rate. After discussing the limitations, challenges, and capabilities of the approach used, the method is applied to radio occultation profiles from 2011 to study variations with space/time/season in stratosphere thickness.",

            "abstract": "Temperatures obtained from geothermobarometers depend not only on minerals reaching equilibrium, but also on preservation of those compositions through subsequent thermal history. In the case of step-function cooling histories (volcanic systems), each of several geothermometry equations (with P-dependence) can be treated as a line in P-T space for a given composition. In the absence of independent P-constraint, intersection of those lines corresponds to the simultaneous solution of the equations involved and is indicative of crystallization and storage conditions. Multiple calibrations of a given thermometer can be evaluated by their degree of match. For protracted plutonic or metamorphic cooling histories, a single intersection is not expected – instead, calculated temperatures will reflect a sequence of mineral closure based on diffusivity of the element(s) of interest in the various phases.\nWe apply this multi-thermometer approach to quartz, rutile, and titanite formed along the retrograde path in gneiss and eclogite at Bixiling, Dabie UHP terrane, China. Using the Huang and Audetat (2012) Ti-in-quartz thermometer calibration, all available Zr-in-rutile equations intersect at approximately 7-10 kbar and 560-580°C. Zr-in-rutile calibrations diverge at higher P, and intersect the Thomas et al. (2010) Ti-in-quartz calibration over a broader range of 13-16 kbar and 550-600°C. Regardless of which intersection is used, it appears that both of these minerals have reequilibrated far below the previously reported peak conditions of >30 kbar and >750°C. Titanite, where diffusion is slower, is present in the gneiss unit as late-stage overgrowths on rutile, but records T that are approximately 150°C higher than the rutile inclusions at all P. This appears to be consistent with all minerals forming above 750°C and possibly much higher P, with quartz and rutile being reset along the retrograde path due to more rapid diffusion. When crystal sizes are taken into account, rutile and quartz are predicted to close to Zr and Ti exchange at similar T ≈ 600-650°C. Intersections of P-T lines among two or more minerals with similar closure behavior may reflect P,T at points along a retrograde path or can be used to constrain cooling rate, and may have advantages relative to using a single thermobarometer.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves injecting fluid into a low-permeability reservoir rock at high pressure in order to open a network of fractures, which act as high-permeability pathways. However, most reservoir rocks have a pre-existing network of natural fractures. The impact of these existing fractures on the hydraulic fracturing process is difficult to predict, involving the nonlinear coupling of fluid flow with rock deformation and failure in a complex (fractured) geometry. Here, we study this problem experimentally in a model system: fluid injection into a cemented packing of soft particles, which behaves as a cohesive poroelastic material. We insert \"natural\" fractures into the system by manually cutting the bonds between particles in specific places. We then inject fluid into the packing at a constant rate and measure the dynamic strain field at high resolution using particle tracking. Comparison of the strain field with and without pre-existing fractures reveals their strong and nonlocal impact on both flow and deformation.",

            "abstract": "The Aptian–Albian (~125–100 Ma, Early Cretaceous) is considered to be an interval of elevated greenhouse gases, intensified hydrologic cycle, limited polar ice, and elevated high latitude temperatures, with evidence for Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAE) as recorded by organic matter and carbonate δ13C perturbations in both the marine and continental realm (Jenkyns et al., 2004; Poulsen, 2004; Robinson & Hesselbo, 2004 and Ufnar et al., 2004). In this study four cores from Aptian­–Albian marine sediments from a single offshore basin in Abu Dhabi, UAE were examined petrographically and samples were collected to generate a high resolution organic carbon δ13C chemostratigraphic profile. The cores represent sediments from the Early Cretaceous upper most Thamama and lowermost Wasia Group and represent interbedded shale and limestone units from the Arabian Shelf. Three of the cores, cores A­–C, show a 3‰ negative excursion in δ13Corg with values of -28‰ occurring with a concurrent increase in organic carbon, likely indicative of Aptian OAE 1a. These cores also show a transition from more oxic to euxinic waters as recorded in the pyrite framboid mean diameter. The remaining core, D, shows relatively isotopically light average δ13Corg values of -26‰, with an intervening positive isotope excursion and values of -23‰, and may represent a different event either earlier or later in the sequence, but due to limited biostratigraphic data could not easily be correlated using C-Isotopes alone with the other three cores. The four cores come from different localities within a single basin and highlight issues pertaining to correlating cores across a single basin for the same time interval, as well as variability in organic matter burial and oxygenation within a single basin, and may provide a useful case study specifically related to separating regional signals from global carbon isotope signals for the Aptian–Albian, and understanding how ancient Mesozoic basins are affected by global marine transgression and changes in ocean oxygenation specifically during OAE1a.",

With longer than 10 years of data records, these measurements have been used not only for daily monitoring purposes but also for inter-annual variability and short-term trend studies. We have developed a new daily and global tropospheric ammonia product from AIRS measurements. AIRS NH3 is retrieved from an add-on module to the AIRS operational codes; and this module uses the Optimal Estimation (OE) technique. Globally, AIRS captures NH3 emissions from biogenic and anthropogenic activities over most emission regions. We will focus, in this presentation, the ammonia distribution over the US, and will particularly emphasize its variability in the last 10 years. Validation examples using in situ measurements for AIRS NH3 will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Information about the soil water characteristics is necessary for modeling water flow and solute transport processes in vadose zone. Soil spectroscopy in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR) range has been widely used as a rapid, cost-effective and non-destructive technique to predict basic soil properties. In this paper we used three different approaches to retrieve soil hydraulic parameters from spectral data in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR) region and basic soil properties. Using stepwise multiple linear statistics coupled with bootstrapping, we derived and validated three types of point and parametric transfer functions: i) spectral transfer functions (STFs), ii) pedotransfer functions (PTFs) and iii) spectral pedotransfer functions (SPTFs) which respectively used spectral data, basic soil properties and spectral based basic soil predictions as their inputs. We further evaluated a direct fit of the van Genuchten (VG) and Brooks-Corey (BC) retention models to the predicted water contents obtained with each approach. According to the results, soil water contents, the VG and BC parameters as well as basic soil properties showed significant (p<0.01) correlation with spectral reflectance values, especially for the SWIR region. The STFs performed slightly better than the PTFs in terms of R2 and RMSE in estimating water contents in the mid and dry parts of retention curve. In the wet range, PTFs were found to perform better than the other two approaches. Compared to the STFs, however, better water content estimates were obtained using the SPTFs in the wet range. The parametric STFs and SPTFs of both the VG and BC models developed from spectral data performed slightly better than parametric PTFs for the retention curve. The best predictions were obtained with a direct fit of the retention models to soil water contents estimated with point transfer functions. Our findings suggest that spectral information, as a promising approach, may be used to accurately predict soil water contents, and indirectly the water retention curve. Using spectral data as an input of PTFs provides an effective way of including this temporal dynamic soil property in soil water retention predictions.",

            "abstract": "Considerable amounts of atmospheric CO2 are incorporated in plant belowground biomass and thus contribute to soil OM. However, associated with rooting, microorganisms enter the soil and, due to priming effects, might improve C mineralisation. Although these processes are well known for recent topsoils, it remains unclear if and how microorganisms contribute to long-term C dynamics in the subsoil and underlying soil parent material.\nThis study comprises several state-of-the-art techniques like bacterial DNA and lipid molecular proxies to trace living and fossil microbial biomass in modern and ancient root systems. Throughout a 13 m thick loess-paleosol sequence in SW Germany, which has been penetrated by several generations of roots since the last glacial maximum, both bulk (Corg and Ccarb) and molecular changes in the rhizosphere were assessed at different depth intervals.\nPhospholipid fatty acids, DNA and intact polar glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers argue for the presence of living microorganisms in the rhizosphere not only of living but also ancient (≥3 ky) roots, which is associated with long-term C dynamics after the lifetime of the root. In the surrounding of living and ancient roots either C enrichment or C depletion was determined, depending on depth and rooting intensity. Especially in areas with high root densities (up to 20.000 root features like biopores, recent and calcified roots m-2), rhizomicrobial degradation led to decrease of C contents. In depth intervals of lower root feature densities (<<100 m-2), C accumulation was observed in the rhizosphere and rhizomicrobial degradation was limited.\nThe penetration of subsoil and underlying sediment by roots does not necessarily lead to additional C stabilization in the long-term, despite locally abundant root features and high portions of incorporated root- and rhizomicrobial-derived OM on a molecular level. At the contrary, priming effects may lead to considerable C loss in densely rooted sediment.",

            "abstract": "Summer monsoon rains contribute more than half of the total annual rainfall in the semi-arid region of Southwest United States, also providing important input to river systems like the Colorado River. The North American Monsoon region or Southwest United States experiences great climatic variability on a range of spatial and temporal scales. This region has also been experiencing significant climate and hydroclimate changes over the last few years. Understanding the interannual variability of moisture delivery in this region will help in natural resources management such as water resources, ecology, etc.. In this study, we investigate the major sources of moisture and their interannual variability during the monsoon season. To this end we selected eight locations in the region from the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah to cover the monsoon region of U.S and generated backward moisture trajectories for each wet day during the monsoon season (Jun–Sep) over the historical period 1964-2013, using the HYSPLIT model developed by NOAA. The tracks show clear source preferences. Gulf of Mexico is the dominant source for south eastern part of the domain, Gulf of California is dominant for the south western domain, a combination of these for regions in between and the Pacific provides the source for northern part of the domain. Decreasing trends in the frequency of the dominant moisture source events corresponds well with the decreasing trends in the rainfall over the domain. The frequencies when correlated with large scale climate variables indicate coherent patterns in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. Furthermore, the population means for each source during El Nino and La Nina years were found to be significantly different. Since the moisture from the dominant sources is also responsible for causing extreme rainfall in this region, these trajectories will provide potential predictability of monsoon rainfall and extremes.",

            "abstract": "A photon sieve is a modification of a Fresnel zone plate in which open zones are replaced by a large number of circular holes. This lightweight optical device offers a superior image forming capability compared with the Fresnel zone plate, and is specially suited to observations at UV and x-ray wavelengths where refractive lenses are not available due to strong absorption of materials, and reflective mirrors are difficult to manufacture to achieve near diffraction-limited resolution. At these shorter wavelengths, photon sieves enable diffraction-limited imaging performance with relaxed manufacturing tolerances, and simple and low-cost fabrication.\nIn this work, we present a new photon sieve imaging modality that, unlike previous designs, takes advantage of chromatic aberration. The fact that different wavelengths are focused at different distances from photon sieve is exploited to develop a novel multi-spectral imaging technique. The idea is to use a photon sieve imaging system with a moving detector which records images at different planes. Each measurement consists of superimposed images of different wavelengths, with each individual image being either in focus or out of focus. For spatially incoherent illumination, we study the problem of recovering the individual images from these superimposed measurements. We first formulate the discrete forward problem using the closed-form Fresnel imaging formulas. The inverse problem is then a multi-frame deconvolution problem involving multiple objects, and is formulated as a maximum posterior estimation problem. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is solved using a fixed-point iterative algorithm. In contrast to traditional spectral imagers employing a series of wavelength filters, the proposed technique relies on a simple optical system, but incorporates powerful image processing methods to form spectral images computationally. In addition to diffraction-limited high spatial resolution enabled by photon sieves, this technique can also achieve higher spectral resolution than the conventional spectral imagers, since the technique offers the possibility of separating nearby spectral components that would not otherwise be possible using wavelength filters. These promising aspects are illustrated for solar EUV spectral imaging.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake occurred off the coast of northern Chile, in a seismic gap that hadn’t ruptured in a major earthquake since 1877. It soon became clear from the magnitude of the earthquake, and from the distribution of aftershocks, that this event, large though it was, had by no means ruptured the entire seismic gap. The question immediately raised was, therefore: what is the remaining earthquake potential in this area of northern Chile? To address this question, we use RADARSAT-2 data to investigate aseismic and major seismic activity over the entire sequence of foreshocks, mainshock, and the first four postseismic months. Seismic event locations are used throughout the study to inform our interpretations. Multiple interferograms are inverted for slip distributions on the subduction interface and other contributing faults during the three phases. GPS displacements published by Ruiz et al. (2014) are used alongside the InSAR data to help constrain the preseismic fault slip. The subduction zone interface is simulated using the Slab1.0 model, meshed with triangular elements. We find that in the mainshock, slip occurred between about 15 and 40 km depth, with a maximum of ~7 m of slip at a depth of ~25 km. We also resolve up to 2.5 m of slip in the Mw 7.6 aftershock that occurred two days after the mainshock. The postseismic InSAR dataset, which is still being acquired and developed, is also inverted to identify the main zones of afterslip. We spatially compare the mainshock slip patches with zones of aseismic slip and also seismicity clusters during the foreshock and aftershock sequences. Stress changes on the interface due to the largest foreshock (Mw 6.7) are calculated, which indicates that stress was significantly enhanced in the area of the mainshock. In addition, the stressing effect of the possible slow slip event inferred by Ruiz et al. (2014) is investigated. The results from the various datasets are integrated to map out areas that (a) still have rupture potential and (b) are now zones of enhanced stress.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf of Mexico formed by subsidence due to continental extension and seafloor spreading that accommodated the motion of the Yucatan block during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. The Yucatan block rotated approximately 45° counterclockwise about an Euler Pole located offshore Florida. It has been proposed that mainly thermal cooling and sediment loading drove subsequent subsidence of the Gulf. However, back-stripping analysis reveals rapid tectonic subsidence (2.5 km) starting around 66 Ma and ending at 40 Ma that remains unexplained. We test the hypothesis that the rapid subsidence can be explained by dynamic topography associated with the Laramide Orogeny.\nWe develop new kinematic theory to build deforming plate models using a continental stretching factor (or crustal thickness) map and the paleogeographic software GPlates. ``Deforming tectonic blocks’’ are defined along small circles about the opening Euler Pole using neighboring stretching-factor contours. These deforming blocks are palinspastically reconstructed assuming constant true strain which means that deformation occurs more rapidly as the crust is increasingly thinned. The deforming plate model is incorporated in a global plate history model.\nWe use the combined plate history model to constrain the thermal evolution of the lithosphere and slabs in the upper mantle and plate motions in geodynamic models. This ensures that our geodynamic models are consistent with geological and geophysical observations and thus enables us to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of subsidence in the Gulf. We compare dynamic and total topography from the models with tectonic subsidence maps and subsidence curves. In addition, we predict mantle structure, notably the distribution of slabs, to compare with seismic tomography and waveform observations.",

As per US Seismic Hazard map, California lies in highly sensitive zone, which makes understanding of stimulation induced seismic events critically important. The copious number of seismic events due to presence of numerous faults in California benefits understanding seismicity of the region but makes it difficult to distinguish induced seismic events from naturally occurring seismic events. Since regional models are considered more effective in understanding the seismicity of the region, this study aims in understanding impact of hydraulic fracturing activities in various oilfields in California. The focus of the study is to identify sensitive zones in California which might have observed seismic activities induced due to hydraulic fracturing. This has been done using the criteria of spatial and temporal co-relation between fracturing activities and seismic events for oilfields with significant number of fracturing activities. The seismic and well data used for this study is acquired from public sources and have been integrated in an efficient manner using the GIS tool and iterative querying. The two step methodology implemented for this work involves segregating the induced seismic events from natural events based on the depth of the event and seismic history of the region and then spatially and temporally studying it with regards to hydraulic fracturing in vicinity of the seismic event.",

            "abstract": "The evaluation of runout is a key aspect in hazard and risk assessments of highly mobile landslides, which frequently cause significant loss of life and property. Both, empirical methods and numerical models can be used for predicting runout behavior, with preference for the latter when estimates of the spatial distribution and time evolution of landslide depths and velocities are required, as in the calculation of expected losses and the design of mitigation works. The input material parameters for numerical models can be directly measured in very few situations due to scale problems or to rheologies not being reproducible in experimental conditions. In most cases, these parameters need to be calibrated by back-analyses where runout simulations are fitted to field observations (footprint, maximum velocities, final depths, etc.). This fitting has normally been performed by comparing the observed and simulated runout area visually and only in few cases quantitative comparisons have been made, but still based only in the planimetric area. The present contribution proposes a new method for quantitatively calibrating material parameters in numerical models for landslide runout prediction. The basis for the procedure is the application of classification statistics to observed runout variables (e.g., planimetric area, depths, velocities) and sets of simulations obtained from a range of input material parameters and rheological models. A first version of the method was put forward recently. This consisted in calculating discrete classifiers for a single landslide and performing simulations for a deterministic set of input variables. The method herein presented is a generalized formulation that allows addressing the following situations: (a) calibration for a set of landslide cases; (b) stochastic input variables; (c) multiple rheologies; and (d) uncertainty in the observed runout variables. The generalized procedure is illustrated with case studies of highly mobile landslides from Central America and Norway.",

            "abstract": "Water is efficiently recycled at subduction zones. It is fluxed from the surface into the mantle by the subducted plate and back to the surface or crust through explosive arc volcanism and degassing. Fluids released from dehydrating the subducting plate are transfer agents of water. Geophysical modeling [\n1\n] and the geochemistry of arc glasses [\n2\n] suggest that at cold-slab subduction zones, such as the Mariana convergent margin, the downgoing plate mostly dehydrates beneath the volcanic arc front (≥ ~ 80 -100 km depth to slab) to trigger volcanism. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the water fluxes released beneath forearcs, as examples of forearc magmatism are extremely rare. Here, we investigate the Southernmost Mariana Forearc Rift (SEMFR), where MORB-like spreading occurred unusually close to the trench, sampling slab-derived aqueous fluids released at ~ 30 to 100 km depth from the subducted plate. Examining the trace element and water contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions and glassy rinds from the young (2 - 4 Ma) and fresh SEMFR pillowed basalts provide new insights into the global water cycle. SEMFR lavas contain ~2 wt % H2O, and the olivine-hosted melt inclusions have the highest subduction-related H2O/Ce ratios (H2O/Ce = 6000 - 19000) ever recorded in arc magmas (H2O/Ce < 10600 and global averaged H2O/Ce < 3000). Our findings show that (i) slab-derived fluids released beneath forearcs are water-rich compared to the deeper fluids released beneath the arc system; and (ii) cold downgoing plates lose most of their water at shallow depths (~ 70 - 80 km slab depth), suggesting that water is efficiently recycled beneath the forearc (≥ 90%).\n1.

            "abstract": "Since 1986 the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) has archived, curated, and distributed digital data from NASA’s planetary missions. The goals of the PDS are both to provide the planetary science community convenient access to data from NASA’s missions- and to curate, maintain, and provide a permanent archive for mission data sets so that scientists will be able to access these data, including meta data, in the future. The PDS contains data from almost 60 years of NASA missions to our planetary system. The PDS is a distributed system, with nodes that are archive data centers for specific discipline areas (from planetary geology to space physics). The PDS also provides engineering support to the entire PDS through the Engineering Node.\n In order to adequately capture complete mission data sets into the PDS containing not only raw and reduced instrument data, but also calibration and documentation and geometry data required to interpret and use these data sets both singly and together, we (PDS) work with NASA Flight Programs and missions from the initial Announcement of Opportunity to the end of mission to define, organize, and document the data for the archive. This process includes peer-review of data sets by members of the science community to ensure that the data sets are scientifically useful, effectively organized, and well documented (and searchable). The PDS works to make the data in our accumulating archives easily searchable so that members of the science community can both query the archive to find data relevant to specific scientific investigations and easily retrieve the data for analysis. In order to ensure long-term preservation of data and make data sets more easily searchable with the new capabilities in Information Technology becoming available (and as existing technologies become obsolete), the PDS has developed and deployed a new data archiving system, known as PDS4, released in 2013. The LADEE, MAVEN, OSIRIS REx, InSight, and Mars2020 missions are using this new system. The PDS is actively working to develop tools to aid data providers and users. The PDS is also incorporating challenge-based competitions to rapidly and economically develop new tools for both users and data providers.",

            "abstract": "The question we want to address is to quantify the respective contribution of internal variability, difference among forcings (type, pattern, timing) and difference among models when comparing the pattern of climate changes that can be diagnosed in the CMIP5 muli-model and multi-experiment data base.\nTo that end, we analyze a suite of CMIP5 experiments (the different RCPs, the 1%/year CO2 and the abrupt 4xCO2) using the pattern scaling framework, i.e. we normalize the pattern of the changes by the global mean surface change. This approach allows to compare, at first order, the general pattern of temperature and precipitation changes for different scenarios which, otherwise, could not be compared. However is has many know limitations: non linearity of the model response, sensitivity to the type and the pattern of the forcings, etc.\nWe estimate for the individual models the effect of difference in forcings by comparing the pattern we obtain with forcings that have different patterns, amplitude and time evolution (RCPs, 1%CO2). We also estimate the differences due to models by exploring model results for a same scenario. We obtain that the pattern of differences between models are much larger than pattern differences between scenarios. For scenarios with small radiative forcings (e.g. RCP2.6), the internal variability has a significant contribution to the spread of the pattern scaling for temperature (mostly at high latitudes) and precipitation (mostly in the tropics). We also show that a the pattern of the responses are very different between scenarios with permanent increase of the amplitude of forcings (RCP8.5 and RCP6.0) and scenarios with stabilization or decrease of forcing and stabilization of temperature (RCP2.6).",

            "abstract": "The paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana experienced protracted subduction and accretionary tectonics starting in late Neoproterozic-early Cambrian times. Northern Victoria Land (NVL), in East Antarctica, preserves a cryptic record of these active margin processes. Most models indicate that NVL contains three main terranes, namely the Robertson Bay, Bowers and Wilson terranes. Significant debate centres, however, on whether these are far travelled terranes with respect to the East Antarctic Craton, and on the tectonic and magmatic processes that affected its active margin and were ultimately responsible for the formation of the Ross Orogen.\nHere we interpret new aeromagnetic, aerogravity and land-gravity compilations that enable us to trace the extent of major subglacial faults in the basement of NVL, examine crustal architecture, and propose a new evolutionary model for the active margin of the craton. Prominent aeromagnetic anomalies at the edge of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin delineate the extent of an early-stage magmatic arc (ca 530 Ma?). This arc may have accreted as an exotic element onto the former Neoproterozoic rifted margin of East Antarctica or (perhaps more likely) developed in situ upon a pre-existing suture.\nRemnants of magnetic arc basement are also identified ca 150 km further to the east within the Wilson Terrane (WT). We propose that these were originally adjacent arc segments and that transtension triggered significant arc boudinage separating these segments. Transtension may have created accommodation space for the development of thick Cambrian sedimentary basins, which are marked by regional magnetic lows with an en-echelon geometry. Basin inversion likely occurred in a later traspressional stage of the Ross-Delamerian Orogen (ca. 490-460 Ma) that triggered the development of a major pop-up structure within the WT. Several buried thrusts of the pop-up can be traced in the aeromagnetic images and a prominent residual gravity high delineates its high-grade metamorphic core. High amplitude magnetic and gravity anomalies also delineate buried oceanic basement of the northern Bowers Terrane. Oceanic basement was likely uplifted and obducted onto to the margin either because of oblique subduction or because of docking of a microcontinent inferred to underlie part of the Robertson Bay Terrane.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities are responsible for the largest share of green house gas (GHG) emissions. Research has shown that greenhouse gases cause radioactive forcing in the stratosphere, leading to ozone depletion. Different land cover types act as sources or sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most dominant GHG.Under the oversight of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region countries are developing Sustainable National GHG Inventory Management Systems. While the countries in the ESA region are making substantial progress in setting up GHG inventories, there remains significant constraints in the development of quality and sustainable National GHG Inventory Systems. For instance, there are fundamental challenges in capacity building and technology transfer, which can affect timely and consistent reporting on the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) component of the GHG inventory development. SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa is a partnership project between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), an intergovernmental organization in Africa, with 21 member states in the ESA region. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), SERVIR ESA is implementing the GHG Project in 9 countries. The main deliverables of the project are land cover maps for the years 2000 and 2010 (also 1990 for Malawi and Rwanda), and related technical reports, as well as technical training in land cover mapping using replicable methodologies. Landsat imagery which is freely available forms the main component of earth observation input data, in addition to ancillary data collected from each country. Supervised classification using maximum likelihood algorithm is applied to the Landsat images. The work is completed for the initial 6 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Botswana, and Namibia) and ongoing in the additional 3 countries (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda). Our presentation focuses on the status of the GHG Project, with particular emphasis on the replicable methods adopted, dissemination mechanisms and technology transfer, as well as the database of products delivered to participating countries.",

Satelite-based remote sensing has been shown to have the potential to derive it on a global scale- accordingly it became subject of various recently published studies and stimulated an upsurge in this research field. This study presents a novel retrieval method for solar induced terrestrial plant fluorescence (SIF). When used with typical spectrometer data an additive spectral component not induced by fluorescence is often accompanying the actual SIF retrieval and can significantly deteriorate the results. To account for this effect a correction method is combined with the retrieval. The method has been applied to ten years of SCIAMACHY data with promising results. In absence of large area ground based validation data a final judgement of the results presented is not feasible. A direct comparison to data of others was showing promising and in certain regions ambivalent results.",

Connecting hazard science to societal learning is far too complex a challenge for our intuitions to be of much use. Instead, we need to use evidence - the science of science communication - to identify what actually works. As practitioners, we first worked with NGOs and local governments in coastal Sumatran communities to develop tsunami evacuation guidance that is consistent with the science of tsunamis and suitable for the communities that face the threat. This work identified important practical questions that social science can address: how do people decide whether to evacuate, and how do hazard knowledge and experience influence this? How acceptable are false alarms? What modes of communicating tsunami science and its uncertainties may lead to greater willingness to evacuate, and greater acceptance of false alarms? Which parts of the vast body of research on communication, risk perception, and decision-making might be significant in these contexts? We are beginning research at the household level that will address these questions and feed back into our continuing science-communication practice.",

Continuous ground measurements were taken at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO) including non-refractory (NR) PM1 size-resolved chemical composition using a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), aerosol light scattering using a Nephelometer, and gas-phase CO, CO2, O3, NOx, and NOy measurements. A similarly equipped sampling platform was launched aboard the Gulfstream-1 (G-1) aircraft which flew near wildfires to probe near-source emissions. Sixteen well-defined fire plumes observed at MBO were selected for detailed analysis and calculation of the modified combustion efficiency (MCE), a quantitative measure of burning conditions. The analyses include calculation of enhancement ratios relative to CO and CO2, elemental ratios of organic aerosols, and back-trajectory analysis for approximate plume age and fire source location. Strong trends were observed when comparing dilution corrected aerosol parameters vs MCE for all plumes identified. Organic PM, scattering and particle-phase inorganic nitrate enhancements displayed a negative correlation with increasing MCE. Various plumes from the G1 data set were analyzed using the same criteria and consistencies were found. We will explore the potential role that burning conditions have on wildfire emissions and how these may be used for better modeling and more accurate emissions inventories.",

This campaign known as DISCOVER-AQ stands for ‘Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality’. Recent results from the California, Texas, and Colorado deployments of DISCOVER-AQ highlight the importance of semi-continuous, daytime measurement of the vertical distribution of ozone and NO2 in the lower boundary layer. The balloon profiles, typically from the surface to 500m above ground level, fill an important gap between surface measurements and the lowest extent of aircraft measurements. This near-surface region of the atmosphere is highly variable and local circulation features including land-sea breezes and mountain-valley breezes were observed. These circulations altered local transport patterns and led to changes in the chemical regime at each site. These processes were especially apparent at Smith Point, Texas during an extreme pollution event on 25 September 2013. The extent to which these local circulations influenced diurnal variation and vertical distribution of NO2 and ozone is evaluated and compared for each semi-rural site using wind direction and other meteorological data. NO2-sonde profile data is compared to ground station trace gas analyzers and where available, column and profile measurements from PANDORA spectrometer instruments. These data measured in the segment of the near-surface atmosphere most critical for human health are unique and crucial for validation of satellite columns and atmospheric chemical models.",

            "abstract": "Bringing atmospheric concentration to 550 ppm CO2 or below by 2100 will require large-scale changes to global and national energy systems, and potentially the use of land (IPCC, 2013) The Danish government aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 40 % in 1990-2020 and energy consumption to be based on 100 % renewable energy by 2035. By 2050, GHG emissions should be reduced by 80-95 %. Strategies developed to reach these goals require land use change to increase the production of biomass for bioenergy, further use of catch crops, reduced nitrogen inputs in agriculture, reduced soil tillage, afforestation and establishment of permanent grass fields. Currently, solar radiation in the growing season is not fully exploited, and it is expected that biomass production for bioenergy can be supported without reductions in food and fodder production. Impacts of climate change on the hydrological sensitivity of biomass growth and soil carbon storage are however not known. The present study evaluates the hydrological sensitivity of Danish land use options for climate mitigation in terms of crop yields (including straw for bioenergy) and net CO2 exchange for wheat, barley, maize and clover under current and future climate conditions. Hydrological sensitivity was evaluated using the agrohydrological model Daisy. Simulations during current climate conditions were in good agreement with measured dry matter, crop nitrogen content and eddy covariance fluxes of water vapour and CO2. Climate scenarios from the European ENSEMBLES database were downscaled for simulating water, nitrogen and carbon balance for 2071-2100. The biomass potential generally increase, but water stress also increases in strength and extends over a longer period, thereby increasing sensitivity to water availability. The potential of different land use scenarios to maximize vegetation cover and biomass for climate mitigation is further discussed in relation to impacts on the energy- and water balance.",

            "abstract": "The dependence of aerosol particle hygroscopicity on particle composition is often represented with the single parameter k commonly used in global models to describe the hygroscopic properties of atmospheric aerosol particles. From the theoretical formulation of k the same value is expected for ideal solutes in both the sub- and supersaturated regimes as typically calculated from hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyser (HTDMA) and cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) measurements respectively (i.e. k HGF and kCCN). Yet, a number of recent studies conducted on SOA indicate that the two measurements yield different k values (k HGF < kCCN). There are several studies discussing the behaviour but the underlying reasons are unresolved. To investigate this in more detailed, CCNc and HTDMA measurements were conducted to determine the effects of chemical composition, oxidation level, the phase state and RH on the associated water uptake properties of biogenic SOA particles formed from isoprene, a-pinene, and longifolene precursors. Pure SOA particles by OH and/or O3 oxidation of the gas-phase precursors were formed in a PAM (Potential Aerosol Mass) flow tube reactor. Hygroscopic growth factors (HGF) were measured by Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (HTDMA) at RH range of 50-~95% and CCN activation by CCN counter. To investigate the physical phase of the particles the particle bounced fraction (BF) using an Aerosol Bounce Instrument (ABI) was also measured. SOA oxidation state and composition was measured by a c-ToF-AMS. Based on the measurements we suggest that at subsaturation conditions semi solid SOA particles take up water mostly via surface adsorption resulting a large discrepancy between the kHGF and kCCN values. By calculating the aerosol direct radiative effect (Wm-2) using our results we also show that ambiguity about the κ values has important implications for quantifying the climate effects of SOA in atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "Array processing of seismic waveforms from many sensors allows the enhancement of coherent signals and the suppression of incoherent \"noise\". Time correction of a waveform enhances weak seismic phases and provides constraints on the azimuth and inclination of the incoming energy. Furthermore, signal amplification allows the use of higher frequencies, which effectively increases the imaging resolution. Although array stacking is effective in amplifying weak seismic signals, its inherent weakness lies in the assumption of the instantaneous plane wave arriving at the array. This assumption limits the size of the array (short aperture) to insure the signal coherence, which in turn limits the size of the area within the Earth’s interior that we can probe. Small array size also means that we cannot use energy scattered off a great circle path.\n In this study we address the above-mentioned issues by installing new and combing the existing several short-aperture arrays in Australia. By exploiting these multiple short aperture arrays we can pinpoint the source of scattered energy to map detailed patterns of heterogeneity in the lower mantle. The concept of multiple arrays allows us to illuminate specific point in the Earth from many different directions. The method is based on a similar approach to that the back-projection technique uses, where the point in time (i.e. part of the seismic wavetrain) is mapped onto the specific point in space through ray tracing. This allows us to achieve multiple illumination of the same structure and thereby minimize source effects. Using scattered energy enables us to cover and probe a larger area of the Earth’s interior.\nWe test the feasibility of our approach deploying the precursors to PcP and PKP seismic phases. We also test our method on synthetically created traces (both monochromatic and multi-frequency waves) varying the depths of the scatterers. We detect significant improvements, both in the signal quality and resolution, with an additional benefit of being able to accurately locate the source of the scattered energy.",

            "abstract": "Over the last few decades, various modeling studies, mostly at relatively coarse spatial resolution (50-100 km), have shown that the groundwater dynamics can control evapotranspiration (ET) at regional and global scales. It is, hence, necessary to evaluate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of land surface water, energy and carbon fluxes, and the underlying processes and mechanisms behind them, based on observational constraints.\nIn this study we, therefore, analyze the relationships between observation-based recent global estimates of water table depth (WTD), evapotranspiration (ET), and vegetation productivity, at 5 minutes (~10 km) resolution, to evaluate the controls of WTD on ET and gross primary productivity (GPP). For each climatological season, the partial correlations with WTD were calculated after controlling for confounding factors such as precipitation, net radiation, topography, soil porosity, and leaf area index among others.\nEven after accommodating for collinearity with confounding variables, WTD explains as much as 50% of the spatial variability of ET in 16-23% of the world in different seasons. Depending on the availability of moisture and energy, spatial variability of ET in the same region shows large dependence on WTD in dry period, while the controlling factors could explain all the variability in wet period. In some regions with the vegetation characterized by higher water use efficiency, GPP shows stronger dependence on WTD in all seasons, even though ET shows little or no dependence.",

The existence of deep Earth’s water affects the physical properties of Earth’s mantle minerals. Therefore it is important to study the effect of water for the subducting slab materials. Serpentine ((Mg,Fe)6Si4O10(OH)8) is major hydrous mineral in subducting slab, and chlorite ((Mg,Fe,Al)6(Si,Al)4O10(OH)8) should be also important hydrous mineral in the subducting slab because Al is included in slab materials. In this study, the dehydration reactions and P-V-T EoS of chlorite were determined by time-resolved X-ray diffraction analysis under\nhigh pressure and temperature using MAX80, PF-AR, KEK. We found that chlorite was quickly dehydrated to forsterite + pyrope + fluid within 1 hour at 3 - 7 GPa when across the phase equilibrium boundary. On the other hand, the kinetic boundary was observed above 7 GPa because of low temperature phase equilibrium boundary, and the dehydration product was Mg-sursassite + unknown + fluid. In the EoS study, we observed compressibility change, i.e. elastic softening behavior in chlorite at around 4 GPa. This behavior is consistent with the case of antigorite (serpentine) (e.g. Yang et al., 2014). The details of P-V-T results will be presented. ",

            "abstract": "The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is a nine channel multispectral imager on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter currently mapping the lunar surface. Three of its channels are dedicated to locating the Christiansen Feature (CF), the mid-infrared emissivity maximum near 8 µm that is the primary indicator of surface composition as its location changes as a function of silicate polymerization. Four of its channels detect in the mid- to far-infrared (12.5-400 µm) from which temperature and thermophysical properties are derived. The shorter wavelength thermal channels (esp. 12.5-25 μm and 25-50 µm) can also be used in the determination of surface composition as silicate minerals have strong absorption features in this region.\nWe have found that the emissivity of these thermal channels varies as a function of solar incidence angle. This is problematic as high incidence angle measurements are necessary for obtaining spectra at high latitudes. A correction has been developed for Diviner’s 8 µm channels which normalizes all Diviner daytime data to 0° incidence angles, but a correction for the thermal channels has yet to be created. Here, we describe our method for correcting the thermal channels as a function of incidence angle.\nWe assume that emissivity measured at an incidence angle of 0° are correct, and calculate the change in emissivity with increasing incidence angle as a percentage of the 0° emissivity. We use these values to create a calibration function of incidence angle for each channel. Several lunar equatorial locations were used to create the calibration and locations at higher latitudes were included in testing its viability.\nThis correction creates a global data set that is more consistent and comparable to laboratory data, and allows the thermal channels to be used to give more detailed insight into surface mineralogy by increasing the amount of compositionally useful channels from 3 to 5. This work will allow us to create more mineral spectral indices and lead to spectral unmixing models. Future improvements to our methodology include an expanded photometric database and constraints based on emission and phase angles.",

To predict and describe the processes, interactions and feedbacks in the plant-soil-system a model accounting for both compartments at an appropriate level of complexity is required.\nTo describe the processes of crop development, crop growth, water flux, heat transport, and carbon cycling three process models were coupled: the one-dimensional soil water, heat and CO2 transport model SOILCO2, the carbon turnover model RothC, and the plant growth model SUCROS. Thereby, the main focus was on the full description of the CO2 flux into the atmosphere via plant and soil processes and finally on simulating the net ecosystem exchange. Additionally, the model was modified to work at the temporal resolution between 1 and 24 hours.\nFor model evaluation a winter wheat and a grassland data set obtained within the TERENO Rur catchment (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) was used. For model initialisation soil carbon fractions were available. Plant specific parameters and soil thermal properties were taken from literature. Measured soil water contents, soil temperatures, crop measurements, autotrophic, and heterotrophic chamber-based respiration measurements were used for validation and calibration.\nThe coupled agroecosystem model AgroC described the crop development and heat transport well. Minor adjustments had to be made for carbon cycling, and to adapt the model to site specific conditions. Therefore, the soil hydraulic properties for soil water transport had to be determined by inverse modelling.",

            "abstract": "Indian scientific research on rice cultivation has been targeted primarily at enhancing crop productivity for the wide range of soil and climate conditions across India. With the understanding that rice paddies are major source of atmospheric CH4 and N2O, there is a need for careful evaluation of the source strength of this ecosystem, and the influence of soil, water and crop management practices on both CH4 and N2O fluxes. A major challenge in meeting this objective lies in reducing the large uncertainties associated with regional and global level estimates of GHG emissions. Process-based biogeochemical models like DNDC (Denitrification and Decomposition model) can provide important insights into how agricultural management of rice paddies inﬂuences water resources, yields and greenhouse gas emissions. To quantify the CH4 and N2­O emissions from rice based crop rotations of India, DNDC model was modified, calibrated and evaluated at different sites across India. The observed N uptake, yields, CH4 and N2O emissions were in agreement with the values predicted by the model. To drive the model across India, a unique database was prepared combining soil/climate/landuse and management information. By linking the spatial database to DNDC, CH4 and N2O emissions from Indian rice based crop rotations for the rice growing season in the year 2000 were simulated on day-by-day basis. CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies in India from rice based-growing season were estimated to be 3.8 and 0.1 - 0.08 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 gm). Of the total CH4 emissions 30.6% (1.2 Tg) is emitted from single irrigated rice. 30.0% (1.1 Tg) and 14.46%(0.56 Tg) of total CH4 is emitted from double rice and single rainfed rice cropping system. 32.9% (33.16 Gg) of the total N2O emissions is emitted by upland rice followed by Single rainfed rice cropping system which emits about 19.9%(20.06 Gg) of total N2O . This paper presents a framework on GIS databases and a process-based biogeochemical model for estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from Indian based crop rotations.",

The watershed is characterized by a quartz diorite bedrock with a system of heterogeneous fractures that apparently drive the formation of corestones and associated spheroidal fracturing and rindlets. Although spatially limited, direct observations along drilled boreholes from previous studies have conclusively shown that regolith thickness increases with topography, from 20-30 m at the hornfels-facies ridges to several m in the quartz diorite-dominated valleys to tens of centimeters on ridges near the major river knickpoint. In this study we used a suite of hydrogeophysical methods (mainly ground penetrating radar, GPR, and terrain conductivity measurements), to characterize regolith thickness and the lateral distribution of fracturing along km-long transects across topographic gradients. GPR common offset profiles detected vertical areas of concentrated chaotic reflections and diffraction hyperbolas (in contrast to reflection-free areas) associated with fracturing and corestone-rich zones. Terrain conductivity measurements also detected contrasts in electrical conductivity associated with both the presence of fractures/corestones and regolith thickness variability. This research demonstrates the potential of hydrogeophysical measurements for understanding variability of bedrock-regolith interface in the Icacos watershed at large (i.e. km) scales.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) comprise the most sophisticated platform for measuring precipitation from space. To make full use of both instruments, the GPM DPR-GMI combined algorithm retrieves precipitation profiles that are consistent with active and passive measurements. To accomplish this, forward models must be capable of simulating the measurements from both instruments using self-consistent physics.\nBoth passive and active measurements are sensitive to surface properties. In all but the heaviest rain, brightness temperatures are sensitive to surface emissivity, especially at low frequencies. Radar observations of the surface backscatter cross-section (σ0) are used to derive an estimate of the path-integrated attenuation, but require a rain-free reference value for comparison. Because emissivity and σ0 are related to the same physical parameters (e.g., dielectric constant, surface roughness), it is desirable for the forward models to be consistent when modeling them.\nFor the combined algorithm, we derive wind- σ0 relationships for each angle bin of DPR using matchups to GMI-derived wind estimates in clear sky conditions, where the rms error relative to ship and buoy observations is 2.1 m/s. Over land, angle-dependent emissivity- σ0 covariance matrices are estimated from GMI and DPR data in 14 different surface classes representing different levels of vegetation, snow cover, and boundaries. In the ensemble framework of the combined algorithm, it is possible to use these relationships to generate different realizations of surface properties that are consistent with the observed characteristics. The impact on rainfall estimates relative to earlier versions of the combined algorithm and the ability of the algorithm to estimate wind speed over water surfaces in raining conditions and surface emissivity over land will be demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "The Diviner Lunar Radiometer, onboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, has produced the first global, high resolution, thermal infrared observations of an airless body. The Moon, which is the most accessible member of this most abundant class of solar system objects, is also the only body for which we have extraterrestrial samples with known spatial context. Here we present the results of a comprehensive study to reproduce an accurate simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with Diviner observations of the lunar surface.\nIt has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions. The data presented here were collected at the University of Oxford Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC). In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (<10-4 mbar) sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber with liquid nitrogen to simulate radiation to the cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples with heaters and lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. A comprehensive suite of experiments were conducted using different sample preparation and heating conditions on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) and compared the results to Diviner noontime data to select the optimal experimental conditions. Additional thermal infrared measurements in optimized SLE were made of 10084 (A11 – LM), 12001 (A12 – LM), 14259 (A14 – LM), 15071 (A15 – S1), 15601 (A15 – S9a), 61141 (A16 – S1), 66031 (A16 – S6), 67701 (A16 – S11), and 70181 (A17 – LM).\n\nThe Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. We find that analyses of Diviner observations of individual sampling stations and SLE measurements of returned Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal infrared reflectance under terrestrial conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates the Diviner compositional dataset.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) in complex alpine-forested terrain is now possible with appropriate remote sensing data and analysis techniques. This research examines what minimum combination of input variables are required to obtain state-of-the-art FSC estimates for heterogeneous alpine-forested terrains. Currently, one of the most accurate FSC estimators for alpine regions is based on training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can deconvolve the relationships between numerous compounded and possibly non-linear bio-geophysical relations encountered in rugged terrain. Under the assumption that the ANN optimally extracts available information from its input data, we can exploit the ANN as a tool to assess the contributions toward FSC estimation of each of the data sources, and combinations thereof. By assessing the quality of the modeled FSC estimates versus ground equivalent data, suitable combinations of input variables can be identified. High spatial resolution imagery from IKONOS are used to estimate snow cover for ANN training and validation, and also for error assessment of the ANN FSC results. Input variables are initially chosen representing information already incorporated into leading snow cover estimators. Additional variables such as topographic slope, aspect, and shadow distribution are evaluated to observe the ANN as it accounts for illumination incidence and directional reflectance of surfaces affecting the viewed radiance in complex terrain. Snow usually covers vegetation and underlying geology partially, therefore the ANN also has to resolve spectral mixtures of unobscured surfaces surrounded by snow. Multispectral imagery if therefore acquired in the fall prior to the first snow of the season and are included in the ANN analyses for assessing the baseline reflectance values of the environment that later become modified by the snow. The best ANN FSC model performance was achieved when all 15 pre-selected inputs were used. The need for non-linear modeling to estimate FSC was verified by forcing the ANN to behave linearly. The linear ANN model exhibited profoundly decreased FSC performance, indicating that non-linear processing more optimally estimates FSC in alpine-forested environments.",

The detection of initial landslide dam formation and the estimation of its occurrence position in the upstream were essential to warn the residents and evacuate in advance. The devices currently used, such as wire sensor, geophone sensor, and infrared cameras (CCD) are classified as the post-event type sensor, which only has a shorter response time, and can just hardly satisfy the requirement which people expect from precaution system.\nTo predict disasters earlier and increase response time, this study used the change point derived from comparing theoretical and observing runoff hydrograph. Chishan River watershed was selected as a case study. Grid Rational Algorithm for Predicting Hydrograph (GRAPH), the dynamic rainfall - runoff model, was used to calibrate watershed runoff hydrograph parameter. The landslide dams were simulated at difference distances along the river, and the runoff hydrographs were compared. Then, the rainfall data and landslide dam failure during Typhoon Morakot in August 2009 was verified the model.\nThe result showed that, during the initial landslide dam formation, the observed accumulate and peak flow hydrograph reduced significantly in comparison with theoretical flow. This model can be applied to establish an efficient warning system for debris flow occurring precaution. In addition, this study has been improved for a longer response time by integrating traditional observation system and runoff hydrograph warning systems and can provide to the references of related authorities.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs), which are generated in the lower atmosphere, transport significant amount of energy and momentum into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Among many parameters to characterize AGWs, horizontal phase velocity is very important to discuss the vertical propagation. Airglow imaging is a useful technique for investigating the horizontal structures of AGWs around mesopause. There are many airglow imagers operated all over the world, and a large amount of data which could improve our understanding of AGWs propagation direction and source distribution in the MLT region.\nWe have developed a new statistical analysis method for obtaining the power spectrum in the horizontal phase velocity domain (phase velocity spectrum), from airglow image data, so as to deal with huge amounts of imaging data obtained on different years and at various observation sites, without bias caused by different event extraction criteria for the observer. From a series of images projected onto the geographic coordinates, 3-D Fourier transform is applied and 3-D power spectrum in horizontal wavenumber and frequency domain is obtained. Then, it is converted into phase velocity and frequency domain. Finally, the spectrum is integrated along the frequency for the range of interest and 2-D spectrum in horizontal phase velocity is calculated. This method was applied to the data obtained at Syowa Station (69ºS, 40ºE), Antarctica, in 2011 and compared with a conventional event analysis in which the phase fronts were traced manually in order to estimate horizontal propagation characteristics. This comparison shows that our new method is adequate to deriving the horizontal phase velocity characteristics of AGWs observed by airglow imaging technique.\nAirglow imaging observation has been operated with various sampling intervals. We also presents how the images with different sample interval should be treated.",

            "abstract": "Since 2006, the coastal community of Miami Beach has experienced an increasing rate of flooding, which caused severe property damage and significant disruptions to daily life. To evaluate the flooding frequency and its causes, we conducted a temporal analysis of tide gauge, rain, media report, insurance claim, and photo records from Miami Beach of the past 16 years. The analysis shows that most flooding events occur after heavy rain (> 80 mm) during high tide conditions, but also after the fall equinox tides regardless of rain events. In 2013, a “clear sky” flooding event also occurred just before the spring equinox. We also evaluated changes in flooding frequency over the past 16 years. Our analysis reveals that since 2006, rain-induced events increased by 33% and tide-induced events quadrupled, from 2 events during 1998-2005 to 8-16 events in 2006-2013.\nIn order to understand the causes for the observed increase in flooding frequency, we analyzed the the nearby Virginia Key tide gauge record. We used the Ensemble Emperical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique to evaluate trend change in the record and found a significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise (SLR) since 2006. The average rate of SLR since 2006 is 9±4 mm/yr, which is significantly higher than the global average rate of 3.2±0.4 mm/yr. We also have looked how SLR in the Miami area relates to the large-scale ocean circulation from a very high resolution global climate model simulation. The model results indicate that a weakening of the entire Gulf Stream system (decrease in kinetic energy) is correlated with increasing sea level in the Miami area. Our results support the hypothesis postulated by previous studies that accelerating rate of SLR along the US Atlantic coast are cause by the weakening of the Gulf Stream (e.g., Ezer et al., 2013).",

The M⁴ mission aims to address such fundamental questions as how energy is dissipated at kinetic scales, how energy is partitioned among different plasma components, what is the relative importance of waves and coherent structures in the dissipation processes. To reach the goal a careful design work of the M⁴ mission and its payload has been done and it is based on the earlier mission concepts of Tor, EIDOSCOPE and Cross-Scale.

In this work, we adopted a Lagrangian particle model to carry out an uncertainty quantification analysis of volcanic ash dispersal in the atmosphere focused on the uncertainties affecting particle source conditions. To this aim the Eulerian fully compressible mesoscale non-hydrostatic model WRF was used to generate the driving wind field. The Lagrangian particle model LPAC (de’Michieli Vitturi et al., JGR 2010) was then used to simulate the transport of mass particles under the action of atmospheric conditions. The particle motion equations were derived by expressing the Lagrangian particle acceleration as the sum of the forces acting along its trajectory, with drag forces calculated as a function of particle diameter, density, shape and Reynolds number. The simulations were representative of weak plume events of Mt. Etna and aimed to quantify the effect on the dispersal process of the uncertainty in the mean and variance of a Gaussian density function describing the grain-size distribution of the mixture and in the particle sphericity. In order to analyze the sensitivity of particle dispersal to these uncertain parameters with a reasonable number of simulations, and therefore with affordable computational costs, response surfaces in the parameter space were built by using the generalized polynomial chaos technique. The uncertainty analysis allowed to quantify the most probable values, as well as their pdf, of the number of particles as well as of the mean and variance of the grain size distribution at various distances from the source, both in air and on the ground. In particular, results highlighted the strong reduction of the uncertainty ranges of the mean and variance of the grain-size distribution with increasing distance from source and the significant control of particle sphericity on the dispersal process.",

GSMaP_MVK and GSMaP_Gauge series were compared to available ground rain gauge network observation. This study attempts to show feasibility of GSMaP family to enhance temporal and spatial precipitation patterns understanding to be used as input for basin scale hydrological processes simulation. It was used GSMaP for temporal downscaling from daily local rain gauge to sub-daily in order to detect flood timing and magnitude at higher resolution in Huong basin (1500 km2) in central Vietnam. After using as input to a distributed hydrological model it was possible to identify evolution of flood peaks in closer agreement to observed stream flow with GSMap_Gauge than GSMaP_MVK. The spatial pattern of these products was reproduced in Tone River (17000 km2) Japan when compared to high resolution local ground-based radar products. In this basin GSMaP_Gauge showed an inverse relationship between the precipitation intensity bias and elevation. Actually, precipitation was underestimated mountain regions and slightly overestimated at lowlands. So far the results indicate that both GSMaP products still underestimate daily precipitation intensities, but they were able to depict spatial patterns. GSMaP_Gauge showed better precipitation detection ability than GSMaP_MVK at both test basins in terms of statistical indicators such as Pearson’s correlation and probability of detection. In short, latest GSMap products were found useful to identify precipitation pattern in two steep highly vegetated basins and feasibility to simulate river flow. Satellite products can be support flood peak identification when combined with available local observed precipitation. This evaluation can provide feedback for parameterization of satellite products at basin scale which is expected to consider with the most recent product: Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM).",

            "abstract": "The remediation of sites contaminated with industrial chemicals – specifically dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) like coal tar and chlorinated solvents - represents a major geoenvironmental challenge. Remediation activities would benefit from a non-destructive technique to map the evolution of DNAPL mass in space and time. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has long-standing potential in this context but has not yet become a common tool at DNAPL sites. This work evaluated the potential of time-lapse ERT for mapping DNAPL mass reduction in real time during remediation. Initially, a coupled DNAPL-ERT numerical model was developed for exploring this potential at the field scale, generating realistic DNAPL scenarios and predicting the response of an ERT survey. Also, new four-dimensional (4D) inversion algorithms were integrated for tracking DNAPL removal over time. 4D ERT applied at the surface for mapping an evolving DNAPL distribution was first demonstrated in a laboratory experiment. Independent simulation of the experiment demonstrated the reliability of the DNAPL-ERT model for simulating real systems. The model was then used to explore the 4D ERT approach at the field scale for a range of realistic DNAPL remediation scenarios. The approach showed excellent potential for mapping shallow DNAPL changes. However, remediation at depth was not as well resolved. To overcome this limitation, a new surface-to-horizontal borehole (S2HB) ERT configuration is proposed. A second laboratory experiment was conducted that demonstrated that S2HB ERT does better resolve changes in DNAPL distribution relative to surface ERT, particularly at depth. The DNAPL-ERT model was also used to demonstrate the improved mapping of S2HB ERT for field scale DNAPL scenarios. Overall, this work demonstrates that, with these innovations, ERT exhibits significant potential as a real time, non-destructive geoenvironmental remediation site monitoring tool.",

            "abstract": "SourceURL:file://localhost/Users/socquet/Auboulot/congres/socquetAGU2014.doc\nThe subduction zone at the latitude of the Central Andes did not experience a Mw>8.5 earthquake since the 19thcentury, and forms a ~500km long seismic gap in North Chile - South Peru.\nUnderstanding the factors that limit the extent of seismic ruptures is crucial for risk mitigation and for understanding physical processes that govern the behavior of seismogenic faults. It appears crucial to evaluate interseismic coupling and its spatial variation in seismic gaps to assess seismic potential.\nRecent geodetic studies combining continuous and campaign GPS measurements as well as InSAR measurements showed that the subduction interface in north Chile, was accumulating interseismic elastic strain, likely to rebound into a large megathrust Earthquake.\nA Mw8.2 earthquake occurred on the 1st of April 2014 in this seismic gap, in front of Pisagua (North Chile), ~150 km south of the Chile-Peru Border. In spite of its already large magnitude, that earthquake was smaller expected in the area, and has most probably increased the stress in the unbroken segments at both edges. Most of accumulated strain remains to be relaxed in the North Chile-South Peru seismic gap. Here we propose to present a first assessment of the interseismic loading in the South Peru part of the seismic gap, at the northern extremity of Pisagua Earthquake, where it is poorly known.\nIn south Peru, over an area of 500 x 250 km, 33 campaign markers have been installed and measured in June 2012. This network has been partially remeasured in June 2013 and April 2014 (after Mw8.2 Pisagua Eaquake). These measurements provide us with an estimate of the Pre-Pisagua-Earthquake coupling, and the co-seismic static displacements. These displacements are combined together with the ones of previous studies that occurred in North Chile and provide a unique and dense velocity field spreading through the Chile Peru border. In particular this provides a unique assessment on the pre-earthquake interseismic coupling at the latitude of the Arica bend, often described as a seismic barrier, and therefore expected to slip aseismically. Results of the GPS derived interseismic segmentation are compared with the seimicity and geomorphic features in the area.",

            "abstract": "Quartz is a common crustal mineral that deforms plastically in a wide range of temperatures and pressures, leading to the development of different types of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) patterns. In this contribution we present the results of an extensive modelling of quartz fabric transitions via visco-plastic self- consistent (VPSC) approach. For that, we have performed systematic simulations using different sets of relative critical resolved shear stress of the main quartz slip systems. We have performed these simulations in axial compression and simple shear regimes under constant Von Mises equivalent strain of 100% (γ=1.73), assuming that the aggregates deformed exclusively by dislocation glide. Some of the predicted CPOs patterns are similar to those observed in naturally and experimentally deformed quartz. Nevertheless, some classical CPO patterns usually interpreted as resulting from dislocation glide (e.g. Y-maxima due to prism <a> slip) are clearly not developed in the simulated conditions. In addition we report potentially new preferred orientation patterns that might develop in high temperature conditions, both in axial compression and simple shear. We have demonstrated that CPOs generated under axial compression are usually stronger that those predicted under simple shear, due to the continuous rotation observed in the later simulations. The fabric strength depends essentially on the dominant active slip system, and normally the stronger CPOs result from dominant basal slip in <a>, followed by rhomb <a> and prism [c] slip, whereas prism <a> slip does not produce strong fabrics. The opening angle of quartz [0001] fabric used as a proxy of temperature seems to be reliable for deformation temperatures of ~400°C, when the main slip systems have similar behaviours.",

            "abstract": "Shrub expansion into Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems is well documented, mostly over the last 50 years, based on remote sensing data, aerial photography, and in-situ observations. Warming temperatures are considered the main driver of the observed change in shrub vegetation patterns. Here, we assess the relationship between temperatures and shrub growth from five populations of Salix spp. (willow) and Alnus spp. (alder) in Alaska growing within the tundra and the boreal forest (~taiga) using dendrochronological techniques. The three tundra shrub sites are located on the Dalton Highway north from Toolik Lake (~69ºN 148ºW), whereas the two taiga shrub sites are located closer to Fairbanks at the Twelve Mile Summit site (~65ºN 146ºW). Because shrub ages vary among the studied populations lead to different time spans for the ring-width chronologies generated, a common period with available satellite data spanning from 1982 to 2010 was selected for this study. All tundra shrub chronologies shared a strong positive response to summer temperatures despite growing in heterogeneous site conditions and belonging to different species. In contrast, in the taiga, summer temperatures enhance willow growth, whereas alder growth appears almost insensitive to temperature over the interval studied. Extending the analyses back in time, a very strong positive relationship was found between alder ring-width and June temperatures prior to 1970. This phenomenon, a weakening of the previously existing relationship between growth and temperatures, was also detected in white spruce (Picea glauca) growing at the same site, and it is known in the literature as the ‘divergence problem’. Thus, at this taiga location, alder shrubs and trees seem to have similar growth patterns. Summer temperatures no longer seem to enhance taiga alder growth. Shrubs of different species exposed to the same climatic conditions can exhibit varied growth responses. The distinct temperature sensitivities among the tundra and taiga shrubs highlight the complexity of shrub dynamics, and the fact that warming may not uniformly enhance shrub growth in Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 is one of the main rock-forming minerals of the Earth crust and is often used as a model compound of the whole silicate part of our planet. In equilibrium conditions in the Earth interior olivine undergoes a series of phase transitions and further breaks into ferropericlase and bridgmanite phases at about 25 GPa. All these transitions are responsible for major seismic discontinuities in the Earth. However, if olivine in compressed at temperature that is too low to overcome kinetic barrier, it preserves its original structureuntil ~35 GPa and then gradually becomes amorphous. This transformation have been observed before by mean of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, but very little is known about the amorphisation mechanism and the local structure of (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 glass under high pressure.\nWe performed a combined XANES and Raman spectroscopic study of a pressure-induced amorphisation is natural olivine sample (Mg0.92Fe0.08)2SiO4 from San Carlos location. Despite the fact that this natural sample has very low iron concentration and therefore absorption jump was quite small (about 0.06), a decent quality XANES spectra were recorded in transmission mode on the energy-dispercive beamline ID24 at the ESRF usind a diamond anvil cell technique.\nThe amorphisation process can be clearly seen in Raman spectra as a significant broadening and further disappearance of the Raman peaks starting from 35-40 GPa, in perfect agreement with the previous literature data. The most interesting result is a dramatic change of the near-edge structure of X-ray absorption spectra. Since XAS is sensitive to the local structure only, one would not expect significant changes in spectra (apart for some broadening) if only long-range order in the material is lost. Our experimental results indicate that pressure-induced amorphisation in olivine is accomplished with a significant variation of the local atomic structure around Fe cation, probably forming effective coordination number similar to the bridgmanite rather than a 6-fold coordination typical for low-pressure phases.",

            "abstract": "We investigate time-dependent compaction and permeability changes by cycling pore pressure with application to compressed air energy storage (CAES) in a reservoir. Preliminary experiments capture the impacts of hydrostatic stress, pore water pressure, pore pressure cycling, chemical, and time-dependent considerations near a borehole in a CAES reservoir analog. CAES involves creating an air bubble in a reservoir. The high pressure bubble serves as a mechanical battery to store potential energy. When there is excess grid energy, bubble pressure is increased by air compression, and when there is energy needed on the grid, stored air pressure is released through turbines to generate electricity. \nThe analog conditions considered are depth ~1 km, overburden stress ~20 MPa and a pore pressure ~10MPa. Pore pressure is cycled daily or more frequently between ~10 MPa and 6 MPa, consistent with operations of a CAES facility at this depth and may continue for operational lifetime (25 years). The rock can vary from initially fully-to-partially saturated. Pore pressure cycling changes the effective stress.\nJacketed, room temperature tap water-saturated samples of Castlegate Sandstone are hydrostatically confined (20 MPa) and subjected to a pore pressure resulting in an effective pressure of ~10 MPa. Pore pressure is cycled between 6 to 10 MPa. Sample displacement measurements yielded determinations of volumetric strain and from water flow measurements permeability was determined. Experiments ran for two to four weeks, with 2 to 3 pore pressure cycles per day. The Castlegate is a fluvial high porosity (>20%) primarily quartz sandstone, loosely calcite cemented, containing a small amount of clay.\nPore pressure cycling induces compaction (~.1%) and permeability decreases (~20%). The results imply that time-dependent compactive processes are operative. The load path, of increasing and decreasing pore pressure, may facilitate local loosening and grain readjustments that results in the compaction and permeability decreases observed.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.SAND2014-16586A",

            "abstract": "The climate of Colombia is characterized by a high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, temperature, and wind due to its tropical location, a complex terrain (coastal regions, plains, and three mountain ranges with strong gradients of elevation [0 - 4500 m]), and the influence of two oceans. Given the high variability of rainfall, achieving a complete and accurate coverage of the country based on in-situ measurements becomes a difficult task, so satellite measurements provide a good alternative. The Meteorological Office of Colombia has joined forces with the U.S. Geological Survey Famine Early Warning Systems Network program to integrate historical data from rainfall stations with the Climate Hazards Infrared Precipitation with Stations satellite-derived rainfall estimates to develop a historical database from 1981-2013 at a temporal resolution of 5 days and a spatial resolution of 5 km. This database accurately describes key characteristics of precipitation such as bimodal and single mode regimes, for example 1) regions such as the western part of the country and the mountainous region of the Andes in which a bimodal regime is present showing two rainy seasons, the first rainy season between the months of April and May and a second season from September to November, and 2) areas with a single mode regime during July-August in the eastern plains of the country and another focused on May-October for the Caribbean region in the northern part of the country. Furthermore, correlating the sea surface temperature in El Niño 3.4 region and the new historical rainfall database corroborated results from previous studies showing, with high statistical significance, a negative correlation over central, western and northern Colombia, as well as a positive correlation for the eastern and southern parts of the country. The study also confirms that the relationship mentioned above is stronger (greater correlation) in the months of lowest precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The onset process of substorm is one of the most controversial issues of magnetospheric physics. Attention has been paid to wave signatures in the near-Earth plasma sheet observed during several minutes prior to the onset because they are believed to be a manifestation of a plasma instability that may trigger the substorm. The ballooning instability in the near-Earth tail has been considered as one of onset instability candidates, but there is still a controversy about its excitation and the role in the auroral substorm initiation. On the other hand, recent auroral observations from the ground and spacecraft have shown that in the pre-breakup arc, there exists a characteristic small-scale auroral structure, which consists of azimuthally arrayed and propagating wave-like forms. The typical azimuthal wave number is ~100-300, comparable to the ion gyro radius in the near-Earth plasma sheet. The auroral forms move at azimuthal propagation speeds usually of the order of several km/s, much faster than the ionospheric convection. Based on these results, one may interpret the auroral forms as a visible counterpart of ballooning modes developing in the near-Earth tail. Despite recent efforts to find such a manifestation, however, little one-to-one correspondence between pre-breakup wave processes in the optical aurora (ionosphere) and in the near-Earth tail has been investigated. In this presentation we report simultaneous obaservations of the evolution of pre-breakup auroral arc using ground-based all-sky imager(s) and near-Earth spacecraft (THEMIS, Van Allen Probes) that were favorable for magnetic conjunction with the arc. The near-Earth spacecraft measured field and particle oscillations with almost the same period as that deduced from the fine-scale structures of pre-breakup auroral arc. We will discuss the possible connection based on such simultaneous observations.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, projection systems in most planetariums, traditional sites of outreach and education, have advanced from interfaces that can display the motion of stars as moving beam spots to systems that are able to visualize multicolor, high-resolution, immersive full-dome videos or images. These extraordinary capabilities are ideally suited for visualization of global processes occurring on the surface and within the interior of the Earth, a spherical body just as the full dome. So far, however, our community has largely ignored this wonderful interface for outreach and education, and any previous geo-shows have mostly been limited to cartoon-style animations. Thus, we here propose a framework to convey recent scientific results on the origin and evolution of our PLANET to the >100 million per-year worldwide audience of planetariums, making the traditionally astronomy-focussed interface a true PLANETarium. In order to do this most efficiently, we intend to show „inside-out“ visualizations of scientific datasets and models, as if the audience was positioned in the Earth’s inner core. Such visualizations are expected to be renderable to the dome with little or no effort. For example, showing global geophysical datasets (e.g., gravity, air temperature), or horizontal slices of seismic-tomography images and spherical computer models requires no rendering at all. Rendering of 3D Cartesian datasets or models may further be achieved using standard techiques. Here, we show several example pilot animations. These animations rendered for the full dome are projected back to 2D for visualization on a flatscreen. Present-day science visualizations are typically as intuitive as cartoon-style animations, yet more appealing visually, and clearly with a higher level of detail. In addition to e.g. climate change and natural hazards, themes for any future geo-shows may include the coupled evolution of the Earth’s interior and life, from the accretion of our planet to the evolution of mantle convection as well as the sustainment of a magnetic field and habitable conditions. We believe that high-quality tax-funded science visualizations should not exclusively be used for communication among scientists, but also recycled to raise the public’s awareness and appreciation of the geosciences.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, the air quality model, CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air\nQuality), is driven by the meteorology model, WRF, forming a one way\ndata interaction pathway without aerosol feedback. We coupled the WRF\nand CMAQ models to create a two-way coupled modeling system to\nfacilitate feedbacks between chemistry and meteorology through the use\nof memory resident buffer data files. Simulated aerosol composition and\nsize distributions are used to estimate the optical properties of\naerosols which are then used in the radiation calculations in WRF.\nThus, direct radiative effects of scattering and absorbing aerosols in\nthe troposphere estimated from the spatially and temporally varying\nsimulated aerosol distributions, can be fed-back to the WRF radiation\ncalculations, resulting in “two-way” coupling between the atmospheric\ndynamical and chemical modeling components.\nTo examine the effectiveness of the coupled system to capture aerosol\nradiative feedback effects, we conducted a simulation with 12 and 4km\nresolution (10 Jun – 30 Jun 2008 and the first ten day is the spinoff\nperiod) of a wildfire event in California. Widespread wildfires\nresulted in significant particulate matter (PM) pollution during\nmid-late Jun 2008 in California and surrounding states. We compare our\nmodel with a high resolution (500m) MODIS data with model AOD result to\nvalidate the performance of the two-way coupled model on aerosol direct\neffects. We also evaluate the performance of the two-way model with and\nwithout feedback turn on with respect to 2-m temperature and radiation\nmeasurement.",

            "abstract": "Information on Global Solar Radiation provides only the first approximation for the evaluation of solar energy that is necessary for locating potential exploitation sites. Depending on what technology is used, more specific components of the solar radiation (Direct. Diffuse, Global, inclined planes), as well as, certain physical characteristics of the atmosphere (atmospheric aerosol) are required for evaluating solar resources. In order to measure these radiation components in a large country such as Mexico, where there are many abrupt changes in topography and differences in climatic conditions even over small distances, it would be necessary to have a network with several hundred stations. In this situation, the use of models is a more viable solution that has been proven with a high degree of certainty, considering it is based on reliable control points for the adjustment.\nHere we present the network that was developed on a regional classification based on climatic elements, geology, land use, vegetation and albedo. Solar stations from different universities and research institutes in Mexico also form part of this network for the evaluation of the solar resources in Mexico and its components.",

            "abstract": "Some atmospheric chemical processes are influenced by the presence of convection and/or lightning. Therefore, it is often important to determine whether a sampled air parcel previously has encountered these influences. This paper describes procedures for making these determinations and provides uncertainties associated with the procedures. Prior locations of the sampled air are obtained by calculating backward trajectories based on 1 h WRF output with 3 domains (horizontal grid spacing of 36, 12, and 4 km). Back trajectories are released along every DC-8 flight track from the recent NASA SEAC4RS campaign (~22,000 trajectories total). If lightning influence is sought, locations of the flashes usually are obtained from ground-based networks such as the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Results show that the user-defined spatial and temporal separation between a trajectory and the flash location greatly influences whether the trajectory is considered lightning influenced. For example, a spatial threshold of 0.5 (0.25) deg lat/lon leads to 69% (60%) of the trajectories being lightning influenced. If model-derived convective influence is sought, a vertical displacement threshold corresponding to w≥1 m s-1 is used to identify convectively influenced parcels. Remarkably, the model-derived method using the 4 km WRF output leads to only 5% (compared to ~60% from lightning) of the trajectories being convectively influenced. Additionally, the horizontal grid spacing (36 km vs. 4 km) exerts a major influence on the paths of the trajectories. The overriding conclusion is that very different results are obtained depending on whether simulated convectively influenced or lightning influenced air is being sought. Also, once this choice is made, the resolution of the model and the time/space thresholds that are chosen will have a major impact on the number of trajectories that are determined to be influenced. This paper will provide guidance on these choices.",

            "abstract": "Projections for Earth’s future suggest that wildfire activity will increase with global warming, but the factors controlling fire are complex. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a geologically abrupt global warming event that had profound effects on vegetation and hydrologic patterns and serves as an analog for modern climate change. Carbon burn-down (i.e., oxidation of organic matter) could amplify feedbacks with warming through release of carbon to the atmosphere. To assess relationships between climate, fire and soil respiration, we evaluated biomarkers, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), charcoal and total organic carbon (TOC) for three paleo-floodplain depositional sites in the Western USA. Samples were selected from Bighorn Basin Coring Project cores in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (at Basin Substation and Polecat Bench) and from an outcrop section in the Piceance Basin, Colorado.\nIn general, the Paleocene had higher PAH concentrations (μg/g TOC) than the Eocene, but there was no clear trend during the onset (~20 kyr) or through the PETM (~200 kyr). Median %TOC decreased through the PETM, then increased in the Eocene, but did not return to Paleocene values. At Basin Substation, PAH concentrations decreased by an order of magnitude during the PETM interval, concurrent with a decline in TOC and charcoal. High molecular weight (MW) PAHs tend to dominate, especially in low TOC samples; this suggests preferential loss of low MW PAHs, which are relatively more susceptible to post-depositional processes. Lithology, TOC and the relative proportion of PAHs help discern the signals of carbon oxidation, by fire and by soil respiration.\nDespite climate conditions that tend to promote fire, there is no evidence for increased fires at the onset or throughout the PETM. Biomarker and petrographic data suggest decreased organic carbon preservation, including loss of refractory carbon, at Basin Substation during the PETM. This suggests soil carbon loss, possibly due to higher rates of organic matter decay associated with a hotter and more seasonal climate during the PETM. We propose that higher carbon burn-down, due to accelerated decay rates, outpaced terrestrial productivity during the hyperthermal event, which hindered soil carbon sequestration and enhanced the atmospheric greenhouse.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeologic characterization of karst limestone aquifers is difficult due to the variability in the spatial distribution of porosity and dissolution features. Typical methods for aquifer investigation, such as drilling and pump testing, are limited by the scale or spatial extent of the measurement. Hydrogeophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) can provide indirect measurements of aquifer properties and be expanded spatially beyond typical point measures. This investigation used a multiscale approach to identify and quantify porosity distribution in the Miami Limestone, the lithostratigraphic unit that composes the uppermost portions of the Biscayne Aquifer in Miami Dade County, Florida.\nAt the meter scale, laboratory measures of porosity and dielectric permittivity were made on blocks of Miami Limestone using zero offset GPR, laboratory and digital image techniques. Results show good correspondence between GPR and analytical porosity estimates and show variability between 22 and 66 %. GPR measurements at the field scale 10-1000 m investigated the bulk porosity of the limestone based on the assumption that a directly measured water table would remain at a consistent depth in the GPR reflection record. Porosity variability determined from the changes in the depth to water table resulted in porosity values that ranged from 33 to 61 %, with the greatest porosity variability being attributed to the presence of dissolution features. At the larger field scales, 100 – 1000 m, fitting of hyperbolic diffractions in GPR common offsets determined the vertical and horizontal variability of porosity in the saturated subsurface. Results indicate that porosity can vary between 23 and 41 %, and delineate potential areas of enhanced recharge or groundwater / surface water interactions.\nThis study shows porosity variability in the Miami Limestone can range from 22 to 66 % within 1.5 m distances, with areas of high macroporosity or karst dissolution features occupying the higher end of the range. Spatial variability in porosity distribution may affect ground water recharge, allowing zones of high porosity and thus enhanced infiltration to concentrate contaminants into the aquifer and may play a role in small and regional scale aquifer models.",

This region’s antecedent geology, sediment type and distribution, deposit geometry, and transport pathways are poorly constrained. Here we present preliminary findings from chirp and 16-channel boomer seismic reflection profiles, swath bathymetry, acoustic backscatter data and sediment samples collected in June-July, 2014, over 3220 km2 of the inner continental shelf. These co-located datasets characterize the broad-scale geologic framework of the central offshore Delmarva Peninsula, and also provide the geologic underpinnings to National Ocean Service (NOS) hydrographic bathymetry and previously unpublished acoustic backscatter data collected in the region between 2007 and 2011. The combined datasets extend 100 km along the coast from approximately the 8-m isobath to 30 km offshore in water depths up to ~ 30 m. They provide unprecedented resolution and spatial coverage of an inner continental shelf environment along the U.S. eastern seaboard. Analyses of these high-resolution datasets will improve understanding of inner continental shelf features and processes including: shoal massif origins, sand-ridge development, barrier-island system migration, shallow natural gas occurrence and distribution, paleochannel evolution, regional sea-level history and the role of antecedent geology in the central Delmarva coastal system. In addition to scientific insights, these data provide the foundation for a variety of management applications, such as sand resource, habitat, and coastal vulnerability assessments.",

They confirm that the both periods were dominated by persistent NAO+ and NAO-conditions respectively. In addition; they highlight new evidence of the NAO evolution to beyond the last 1000 years. NAO+ conditions recorded during the MCA persist until 500 AD and NAO- conditions dominate the Dark cold Period (DACP) as recorded during the LIA.

The development of a Cold Atom Gravity Gradiometer (CAGG) instrument for geodesy, based on the LPA measurement approach, was recently selected for funding under NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) Instrument Incubator Program (IIP).\nThe CAGG IIP development includes the design, build and testing of a high-performance, single-tensor-component gravity gradiometer applicable to Earth science studies on a satellite platform in low-Earth orbit. The gradiometer has a target gravity gradient noise floor of 7×10-5 E/Hz1/2 when extrapolated to operation in a low-noise microgravity environment. This is an improvement over the noise performance of ESA’s Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) gradiometers, whose short-term noise is approximately 3×10-3 E/Hz1/2. In contrast to NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, the instrument will be capable of high-precision geodesy from a single satellite platform. In contrast to previous gradiometers based on atom interferometry, the proposed instrument achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity by exploiting the advantages of the microgravity environment. The sensor incorporates an intrinsic method of compensation for rotation-induced errors in the gravity gradient measurement.\nWe present the current status of the CAGG IIP development. We also present the current measurement performance estimate of the CAGG and the simulated performance of the space-based CAGG instrument in recovering Earth time variable gravity. We explore the accuracy, and spatial and temporal resolution of surface mass change observations from several space-based implementations of the CAGG instrument, including various orbit configurations and multi-satellite/multi-orbit configurations.",

Caboclos of the estuary maintain a diverse and flexible land-use portfolio, with a shift in dominant use from agriculture to agroforestry and forestry since WWII (Vogt et al., 2014). The current landscape is configured for acai, shrimp and fish production. In the last decade the frequency of wet seasons with anomalous flood levels and duration has increased primarily from changes in rainfall and discharge from upstream basins. Local rainfall, though with less influence on extreme estuarine flood levels, is reported to be more sporadic and intense in wet season and variable in both wet and dry seasons, for yet unknown reasons. The current production portfolio and its flexibility are felt to build resilience to these increases in hydro-climatic variability and extreme events. What is less understood, for time and costliness of daily measures at household levels, is how variations in flood and rainfall levels affect shifts in the current production portfolio of estuarine Caboclos, and the proportions of it they sell and consume. This is needed to identify what local hydro-climatic thresholds are extreme for current livelihoods, that is, that most adversely affect food security and income levels. It is also needed identify the large-scale forcings driving those extreme conditions to build forecasts for when they will occur. Here we present results of production, rainfall and flood data collected daily in households from both the North and South Channel of the Amazon estuary over last two years to identify how they co-vary, and robustness of current production portfolio under different hydro-climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Global increase of methane that started in 2007-2008 after a decade of stability requires investigation and explanation. Recent Arctic warming has stimulated speculation about dissociation of Arctic Ocean methane hydrates providing a potentially important new climatic positive feedback. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data do not require sunlight, providing key advantages for Arctic data collection compared to shortwave infrared spectroscopy. The US Atmospheric IR Sounder (AIRS) has been delivering CH4 tropospheric data since 2002; NOAA CH4 retrievals from the European Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) radiation data are available since 2008 and analyzed here since 2009. Accuracy of TIR satellite retrievals, especially for the lower troposphere, diminishes for a cold, underlying surface. In this analysis the dependence is parameterized using the Thermal Contrast (a difference between surface temperature and air temperature at the altitude of 4 km, defined THC). A correction function was applied to CH4 data based on a data-derived relationship between THC and retrieved CH4 for areas with positive THC (in other words, without temperature inversions). The seasonal cycles of the adjusted low tropospheric data are in agreement with the surface in situ measurements. Instantaneous IASI retrievals exhibit less variability than AIRS v6 data. Maximum positive deviation of methane concentration measured by IASI for the study period was found for Baffin Bay in November-December, 2013 (Figure). It was concluded that the methane anomaly could indicate both coastal and off-shore emissions. Off-shore data were spatially consistent with a hydrate dissociation mechanisms, active for water depths below the hydrate stability zone top at ~300 m. These are hypothesized to dissociate during seasonal temperature maximum in the bottom layer of the ocean, which occurs in fall.

            "abstract": "We used a new high-precision MC-TIMS method to generate Ca isotope records (δ44/40Ca; 2SD = ± 0.04‰) for three sections spanning OAE 2: central Colorado, USA (Portland #1 core), southeastern France (Pont d’Issole), and Eastbourne, England (Eastbourne Chalk). The Eastbourne Chalk δ44/40Ca values are higher than previously reported but define a similar trend, where δ44/40Ca values increase prior to OAE 2 and then decrease at the onset. The Portland core and the Pont d’Issole section display comparable δ44/40Ca values, which increase by ~0.10 – 0.15‰ immediately at the onset of OAE 2 and then decrease to near-initial values across the event. According to a numerical model of the marine Ca cycle, reasonable changes to the riverine and hydrothermal input fluxes cannot explain the rate and magnitude of the positive isotope excursion. A decrease in the magnitude of the carbonate fractionation factor provides the best explanation for the data. Because a decrease in the fractionation factor corresponds to an increase in the Ca/CO3 ratio of seawater, we tentatively attribute the positive Ca isotope excursion to transient ocean acidification, i.e., a reduction in the concentration of CO3 during CO2 uptake. Other studies implicate eruption of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province as the most likely source of CO2.",

            "abstract": "Mount Rainier towers over the landscape of western Washington, ranking with Fuji-yama in Japan, Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, and Mt. Vesuvius in Italy, as one of the great stratovolcanoes of the world. Notwithstanding it's picturesque stature, Mt. Rainier is potentially the most devastating stratovolcano in North America, with more than 3.5 million people living beneath its shadow in the Seattle-Tacoma area. The primary hazard posed by the volcano is in the form of highly destructive volcanic debris flows (lahars). These lahars form when water and/or melted ice erode away and entrain preexisting volcanic sediment. At Mt. Rainier these flows are often initiated by sector collapse of the volcano’s hydrothermally rotten flanks and compounded from Mt. Rainier’s extensive snow and glacial ice coverage. It is therefore imperative to ascertain the extent of summit hydrothermal alteration within the volcano, and determine areas prone to collapse. Despite being one of the sixteen volcanoes globally designated by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior as warranting detailed and focused study, Mt. Rainier remains enigmatic both in terms of shallow internal structure and the degree of summit hydrothermal alteration. We image this shallow internal structure and areas of possible summit alteration using ambient noise tomography. Our full waveform forward modeling includes high-resolution topography, allowing us to accurately account for the effects of topography on the propagation of short-period Rayleigh waves. Empirical Green’s functions were extracted from 80 stations within 200 km of Mount Rainier and compared with synthetic greens functions over multiple frequency bands from 2-28 seconds. The preliminary model shows a broad (60 km wide) low shear-wave velocity anomaly in the mid-crust beneath the volcano. The mid-crust low-velocity body extends to the surface beneath the volcano summit in a narrow near-vertical conduit, the likely path of magma ascent. There is a peculiar aseismic high Vs and low Vp/Vs zone (possibly indicative of a high quartz bearing lithology) beneath the eastern edifice. We interpret it as a possible remnant of a more felsic (and perhaps more explosive) proto Mount Rainier volcano.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation covers 70% of land surface, significantly influencing water and carbon exchange between land surface and the atmosphere. Vegetation transpiration (Et) contributes 80% of the global terrestrial evapotranspiration, making an adequate illustration of how important vegetation is to any hydrological or climatological applications. Transpiration can be estimated through upscaling from sap flow measurements on selected trees. Alternatively, transpiration (or tree water use for forests) can be correlated with environmental variables or estimated in land surface simulations in which a canopy conductance (gc) model is often used. Transpiration and canopy conductance are constrained by supply and demand control factors. Some previous studies estimated Et and gc considering the stresses from both the supply (soil water condition) and demand (e.g. temperature, vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation) factors, while some only considered the demand controls. In this study, we examined the performance of two types of models at daily and half-hourly scales for transpiration and canopy conductance modelling based on a native species in South Australia. The results show that the significance of soil water condition for Et and gc modelling varies with time scales. The model parameter values also vary across time scales. This result calls for attention in choosing models and parameter values for soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and land surface modeling.",

            "abstract": "Diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton class in coastal upwelling systems, accounting for a large proportion of global primary production. Their frustules preserved in sediments are powerful paleoceanographic and paleoproductivity proxies. However, despite high diatom abundance in the water column, they are frequently affected by dissolution and their sedimentary record is discontinuous. A more robust reconstruction independent of preservation characteristics in the sediments would thus be desirable. Lipid biomarkers have a specific structure that might remain intact in the sediments and may be better preserved under conditions corrosive to diatom frustules. This research aims to investigate the organic imprint of upwelling-related diatom species, which may allow the reconstruction of past primary productivity in areas where diatoms are not preserved in the sediments.\nTo better understand the preservation and chemical signature of diatoms in the sedimentary record, we are studying diatom abundance, assemblages and lipid biomarkers in samples from the water column, sediment traps, surface sediments and diatom cultures recovered at the Iberian Margin. This study aims 1) to understand the present-day seasonal abundance and diversity of diatoms, their relation to the hydrographic conditions, along with their transfer/preservation pathways into the sediments; 2) to identify the major groups of lipid biomarkers related with upwelling diatom species in this area.\nDiatom abundances and assemblages observed in the water column and sediment traps evidence seasonal primary productivity. Sediment traps and surface sediment samples are dominated by Leptocylindrus spp. and Chaetoceros spp. resting spores, suggesting these genera as productivity tracers.\nPreliminary results of the biomarkers study show that sterols, known to be one of the major groups of biomarkers related to diatoms, occur in different composition and concentration in the analyzed diatom cultures, water column and sediment trap samples. Others known diatom related lipid biomarkers, namely highly branched isoprenoids and long - chain diols, are also being investigated.",

This evolution is periodically manifested as a new data version release by carefully reprocessing the entire database with the most current algorithms that fundamentally change the database and ultimately the data products used by the community. The newest processing, Version 3, will be released in 2015 after the entire database is reprocessed and real-time data processing becomes operational. All V 3 algorithms have been developed, individually vetted and represent four main categories: aerosol optical depth (AOD) processing, inversion processing, database management and new products. The primary trigger for release of V 3 lies with cloud screening of the direct sun observations and computation of AOD that will fundamentally change all data available for analysis and all subsequent retrieval products. This presentation will illustrate the innovative approach used for cloud screening and assesses the elements of V3 AOD relative to the current version. We will also present the advances in the inversion product processing with emphasis on the random and systematic uncertainty estimates. This processing will be applied to the new hybrid measurement scenario intended to provide inversion retrievals for all solar zenith angles. We will introduce automatic quality assurance criteria that will allow near real time quality assured aerosol products necessary for real time satellite and model validation and assimilation. Last we will introduce the new management structure that will improve access to the data database. The current version 2 will be supported for at least two years after the initial release of V3 to maintain continuity for on going investigations.",

We established a significant correlation between metal concentration (leaching) in the leaves with Klf and IRM1T. This relationship was not as high as those found in other studies carried out on airborne dust, sediments and soils. Further analyses pointed out that local humidity played a dual roll, controlling availability of airborne lithogenic dust and the incorporation of trace metals in the leaf tissue, modulating the magnetic enhancement.\nFurther to these findings, the comparison between cities of different climatic regimes showed that air humidity is the major factor controlling the interaction of the atmosphere and tree leaves, thus their magnetic properties. The relative influence of pollutants, lithogenic dust and biological effects depends not only on local meteorology but also on climate. Their influence should be most seriously considered to design methodological approaches that are appropriate to the environmental characteristics of each study area, if the magnetic properties of tree leaves are intended as an atmospheric pollution-monitoring tool.",

            "abstract": "Injection of carboxymethyl-cellulose stabilized nanoscale Zero Valent Iron (CMC/nZVI) has received significant attention in the last decade as an emerging alternative for in-situ remediation of chlorinated solvents and other recalcitrant compounds. There has also been some indication that injection of nZVI will create conditions that will stimulate in-situ microbial populations, leading to further contaminant degradation. Carboxy-methyl cellulose (CMC) is commonly used for nZVI synthesis as it provides steric stabilization for the nanoparticles, however, the CMC is equally important as a subsurface amendment as it may act as a fermentable substrate for microorganisms in-situ. In this study, microbial communities were monitored over a 2.5 year period following the injection of CMC/nZVI at a chlorinated solvent remediation site. Dehalococcoides spp. genetic markers and vinyl chloride reductase genes (vcrA) were targeted in the 16s RNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This analysis was complimented with a suite of aqueous chlorinated ethene, ethane, and methane compounds to monitor degradation. Following the injection of CMC/nZVI a decline of parent chlorinated compound concentrations was observed as well as the emergence of daughter products. A period of abiotic nZVI oxidation is believed to be responsible for a portion of the degradation at the site, however, a prolonged period of contaminant degradation followed and is believed to be the result of organohalide-respiring microorganisms native to the site. Further analysis was performed on the microbial samples using 454 pyrotag sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes to obtain the genetic profile of the microbial community. Of particular interest within this large genomic profile is the characterization of the stable population of important organohalide-respiring microorganisms on site. Results suggest that there is a distinctly different response in the organohalide-respiring microbial community in areas of the site where CMC/nZVI amendments were injected compared to a background response.",

            "abstract": "Although marine environments contribute approximately 30% of the global atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) flux, coastal systems appear to comprise a disproportionately large majority of the ocean-atmosphere flux. However, there exists a wide range of estimates and future projections of N2O production and emission are confounded by spatial and temporal variability of biological sources and sinks. As N2O is produced as an intermediate in both oxidative and reductive microbial processes and can also be consumed as an electron acceptor, a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these pathways remains poorly understood. To improve our understanding of N2O dynamics in coastal sediments, we conducted a series of intact flow-through sediment core incubations (Sylt, Germany), while manipulating both the O2 and NO3- concentrations in the overlying water. Steady-state natural abundance isotope fluxes (δ15N and δ18O) of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and nitrous oxide were monitored throughout the experiments. We also measured both the isotopomer composition (site preference (SP) of the 15N in N2O) as well as the Δ17O composition in experiments conducted with the addition of NO3- with an elevated Δ17O composition (19.5‰), which provide complementary information about the processes producing and consuming N2O.\nResults indicate positive N2O fluxes (to the water column) across all conditions and sediment types. Decreasing dissolved O2 to 30% saturation resulted in reduced N2O fluxes (5.9 ± 6.5 μmol m2 d-1) compared to controls (17.8 ± 6.5 μmol m-2 d-1), while the addition of 100 μM NO3- yielded higher N2O fluxes (49.0 ± 18.5 μmol m-2 d-1). In all NO3- addition experiments, the Δ17O signal from the NO3- was clearly observed in the N2O efflux implicating denitrification as a large source of N2O. However, Δ17O values were always lower (1.9 to 8.6‰) than the starting NO3- indicating an important role for nitrification-based N2O production and/or O isotope exchange with water in influencing the O isotope composition of N2O from the sediment-water interface. A steady-state multi-isotope flux model will help to constraining rates and isotope effects of these processes and improve our understanding of the dynamics and pathways of N2O production and emission under varying scenarios of environmental change.",

The ice transitions from a largely coherent sheet in the late spring to an ensemble of discrete floes surrounded by open water. We examine the thermodynamic and dynamic processes governing this evolution by using a Lagrangian-based time series of nested satellite images. The satellite images were collected by tracking the movement of buoys deployed in the ice cover as they drifted across the Beaufort Sea from April to October 2013. Radarsat images provide the large scale context. Higher resolution (up to 1 meter) images from TerraSAR-X, Worldview, and the US Geological Survey Global Fiducial Program, taken around the same time, provide detailed characteristics of the ice cover and its evolution. Using the images we compute time series of ice concentration, floe size distribution, and floe characteristics, including number, size, shape and perimeter. The results of this analysis are used to investigate the floe breaking function, which quantitatively describes the influence of dynamics on the floe size distribution.",

Like the rest of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), the Langmuir probe instrument (RPC-LAP) has been operating from early summer 2014 to cover also the approach of Rosetta toward comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The instrument uses two spherical probes mounted on short (few meters) solid booms protruding from the spacecraft body. The probes can be used as classical Langmuir probes, as electric field probes with bias current and for wave observations up to 8 kHz. In the low density solar wind, probe bias sweeps are dominated by spacecraft photoelectrons, but plasma density variations can still be accessed through the spacecraft potential. As the density of the comet plasma increases with growing comet activity, direct plasma measurements become possible. We present initial data and first results on the comet plasma environment.",

            "abstract": "The growth and retreat of continental ice sheets in the past has largely been a response to changing climatic forcing. Since ablation is the principal component of mass loss for land-based ice sheets, the calculation of surface melt is an important aspect of paleo ice sheet modeling. Changes in insolation are often not accounted for in calculations of surface melt, under the assumption that the near-surface temperature transmits the majority of the climatic forcing to the ice sheet. To assess how this could affect paleo simulations, here we investigate the importance of different orbital configurations for estimating melt on the Greenland ice sheet. We find that during peak Eemian conditions, increased insolation contributes 20–50% to the surface melt anomaly. However, this percentage depends strongly on the temperature anomaly at the time. For higher temperature anomalies, the role of insolation changes is less important. This relationship is not homogenous over the ice sheet, since the contribution of insolation to melt is modulated by the local surface albedo. In coupled simulations, the additional insolation-induced melt translates into up to threefold more ice volume loss, compared to output using a model that does not account for insolation changes. We also introduce a simple correction factor that allows reduced-complexity melt models to account for changes in insolation.",

Each year the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Fleet supports a broad spectrum of research operations and their associated logistics support requirements. Operations can vary from single Principle Investigator (PI) cruises to multi-investigators field programs with multi-disciplinary research objectives in locations all over the world.\nOver the past decade, the process for access to the sea has evolved and continues to be refined through the critical feedback of scientists, marine technicians, and ship operators.\nUnder UNOLS guidance, key guidelines have been identified for all phases of cruise planning; from pre-award to post-expedition to help ensure that the research objectives of programs can be met and that optimal use of our Nation’s oceanographic facilities is maintained.\nAn expeditionary roadmap has been created that captures the major milestones essential to executing a research cruise. The roadmap has been introduced during early career scientist workshops and also during the Chief Scientist Training Cruise programs of recent years. It is a useful planning tool not only for early career scientists and new ship users, but also for experienced sea-going scientists. The roadmap will soon be available as a resource tool on the new UNOLS website. This poster will feature the roadmap for expeditionary planning and offer key information about requirements and tips for a successful, safe, research cruise experience. In addition, existing and new requirements associated with custom clearances, export licensing requirements and additional planning considerations also needed when the research requires special facilities such as aircraft or deep submergence vehicles will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The ice-capped Eyjafjallajökull volcano, south Iceland, had been dormant for 170 years when it first showed signs of a new unrest period in 1994, the third one known during historical time in Iceland (the past 1100 years). It culminated during a flank and summit eruption in 2010. Previous known eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull volcano occurred in year 500 (pre-settlement), in 1612 and 1821-23.\nThe resent unrest period was characterized by intermittent swarm activity and crustal uplift. The first seismic swarm was recorded during 1994 and was accompanied by inflation, suggesting a sill intrusion at ~6.5 km depth beneath the south-eastern flank. A similar but longer episode of seismic swarms and crustal uplift took place again in 1999-2000, also modelled as a sill centered at the south-eastern flank. A deeper swarm was recorded in 1996, near the crust mantle boundary (20-24 km depth) indicating injection of magma from the mantle into the crust. In spring 2009, several deep seismic events were detected again, followed by swarm activity during the summer and a small crustal signal indicating inflation at the southern flank. This was followed by a new period of escalating seismicity and inflation, indicating a complicated pattern of intrusion activity from December 2009 until the two eruptions broke out in March and April 2010. Geodetic and seismic data show that the three-week-long basaltic flank eruption was fed by a deep source (20-30 km). The intrusive activity triggered the more silicic and explosive six-week-long summit eruption. Two weeks into the summit eruption a new swarm of deeper earthquakes and inflation was detected, indicating that a new wave of material was being fed into the system from depth. This changed the phase of the eruption, again to an explosive phase and was repeated at least two more times during the next two weeks. The summit eruption ended in late May but since July 2010 GPS measurements indicate inflation of the volcano.\nHere, we focus on the 18-year-long period preceding the 2010 events. We have improved the seismic catalog locations by applying a double-difference relocation method and reanalyzed GPS campaign data between 1992 and 2009 which not only show the uplift during the intrusion episodes but also the subsidence following the inflation periods, caused by the cooling and contraction of the new intrusions.",

To provide regional context for the interannual changes in river channel geometry we conduct spatiotemporal (ST) analyses of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery for 2000-2013 using a new method of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. We use EVI because it distinguishes water from wet and dry sediment on the basis of the spectral slope at VNIR wavelengths. Water has a negative slope while dry sediment has a small positive slope and vegetation has a large positive slope. To characterize the ST patterns associated with river channel migration we use iterative EOF analysis (iEOF). In iEOF we first conduct a single year EOF analysis for each year in the time series to identify the primary spatial principal component (PC1) for each year and separate this from the spatial structure of the subannual temporal patterns associated with vegetation phenology. We then construct a decadal time series of PC 1 for each single year and conduct a second EOF analysis of the time series of 13 individual year PCs. The standard EOFs of the full (312 images x 16 day) time series only resolve a decadal trend (EOF 8), but the iEOF clearly distinguishs the progressive decadal trend (EOF 2) from the cyclic component (EOF 3) of decadal changes in sediment reflectance. The temporal feature space constructed from PC 2 and PC 3 (corresponding to temporal EOFs 2 and 3) distinguishes pixels with progressive decadal increases and decreases in reflectance from pixels with cyclic changes. Evolution of the annual structure is animated at\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=UM1UYvdnYXk\nDespite significant differences in the 2 rivers’morphologies, and the considerable magnitude of flooding every year, we observe year-to-year continuity in the progressive downstream migration of the larger meanders on both rivers. We also observe a pronounced change in the morphology and evolution of the channels in the Brahmaputra braid plain upstream and downstream of the hinge zone with more rapid changes in channel geometry upstream and a more stable configuration of two anastamosing primary channels downstream.",

            "abstract": "As oil and gas well completions utilizing multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have become more commonplace, the potential for seismicity induced by the deep disposal of frac-related flowback waters and the hydraulic fracturing process itself has become increasingly important. While it is rare for these processes to induce felt seismicity, the recent increase in the number of deep injection wells and volumes injected have been suspected to have contributed to a substantial increase of events = M 3 in the continental U.S. over the past decade. Earthquake template matching using multi-station waveform cross-correlation is an adept tool for investigating potentially induced sequences due to its proficiency at identifying similar/repeating seismic events. We have sought to refine this approach by investigating a variety of seismic sequences and determining the optimal parameters (station combinations, template lengths and offsets, filter frequencies, data access method, etc.) for identifying induced seismicity. When applied to a sequence near a wastewater injection well in Youngstown, Ohio, our optimized template matching routine yielded 566 events while other template matching studies found ~100-200 events. We also identified 77 events on 4-12 March 2014 that are temporally and spatially correlated with active hydraulic fracturing in Poland Township, Ohio. We find similar improvement in characterizing sequences in Washington and Harrison Counties, which appear to be related to wastewater injection and hydraulic fracturing, respectively. In the Youngstown and Poland Township cases, focal mechanisms and double difference relocation using the cross-correlation matrix finds left-lateral faults striking roughly east-west near the top of the basement. We have also used template matching to determine isolated earthquakes near several other wastewater injection wells are unlikely to be induced based on a lack of similar/repeating sequences. Optimized template matching utilizes high-quality reliable stations within pre-existing seismic networks and is therefore a cost-efficient monitoring strategy for identifying and characterizing potentially induced seismic sequences.",

            "abstract": "An important source of model uncertainty in climate models arises from unconfined model parameters in physical parameterizations. These parameters are commonly estimated on the basis of manual adjustments (expert tuning), which carries the risk of over-tuning the parameters for a specific climate region or time period. This issue is particularly germane in the case of regional climate models (RCM), which are often developed and used in one or a few geographical regions only. Here we address the role of objective parameter calibration in this context. Using a previously developed objective calibration methodology, we calibrate an RCM over two regions (Europe and North America) and investigate the transferability of the results. A total of eight different model parameters are calibrated, using a metamodel to account for parameter interactions. We demonstrate that the calibration is effective in reducing model biases in both domains. For Europe, this concerns in particular a pronounced reduction of the summer warm bias and the associated overestimation of interannual temperature variability, that has persisted previous expert tuning efforts and that is common in many global and regional climate models. The key process responsible behind this improvement is an increased hydrological conductivity. Over North America, there is also some reduction of the summer warm bias, but in addition the calibration achieves a pronounced reduction of winter biases in interannual temperature variability. We also find that the calibrated parameter values are almost identical for both domains, i.e. the parameter calibration is transferable between the two regions. This is a promising result and indicates that models may be more universal than previously considered.",

            "abstract": "Suspended dust in the air can directly change the energy budget in the atmosphere and at the surface through scattering and absorption of radiation. Thus, dust can potentially modify the development of weather systems. To explore the dust-radiation effects on weather systems, a dust model was developed based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The calculations of dust processes in the WRF dust model include emission, advection, boundary layer mixing, cumulus mixing, dust-radiation interaction, wet scavenging, and sedimentation. Due to a high vertical spatial resolution near the surface a time splitting method was applied to the calculation of dust sedimentation to relax the numerical time step.\nThe “Hexi Corridor” is the historical name given to a string of oases along the northern slope of the Tibetan Plateau that formed a relatively easy transportation route between eastern China and central Asia. As trade developed over the centuries, this route became known as the Silk Road. This corridor also marks the transition from the relatively flat Gobi desert area in northern China to the elevated mountains of the Tibetan Plateau. These mountains present a southern barrier to the paths of dust storms that develop during spring outbreaks of the Mongolian Cyclone. In March of 2010, a series of dust storms developed in the Gobi Desert north of the Hexi Corridor that transported massive amounts of dust eastward to central and northeastern China, Korea and Japan. On March 17 during this event, a low-level jet developed along the northern perimeter of the Plateau, in alignment with upper level winds and the Hexi Corridor. Over the course of the day, a well-defined short-duration dust plume was emitted in the southern Gobi desert area and was transported over 1300 km in a southeast direction, over the Loess Plateau and into the Gansu Province. In this study, the interactions of synoptic conditions with regional topography that led to the development of the low-level jet are evaluated. A dust model based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model V3.2.1 is used to investigate the interaction of dust and radiation on air temperatures in and around the plume, dust emission and transport, and the resulting regional radiative forcing in the presence of the low-level jet.",

            "abstract": "We analyze “seismic” rupture process of the March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (GCMT Mw9.1) by using a non-linear multi-time-window waveform inversion method. We incorporate the effect of the near-source laterally heterogeneous structure on the synthetic Green's tensor waveforms; otherwise the analysis may result in erroneous solutions [1]. To increase the resolution we use teleseismic and strong-motion seismograms jointly because the one-sided distribution of strong-motion station may cause reduced resolution near the trench axis [2]. We use a 2.5D FDM [3] for teleseismic P-waves and a full 3D FDM that incorporates topography, oceanic water layer, 3D heterogeneity and attenuation for strong-motions [4]. We apply multi-GPU acceleration by using the TSUBAME supercomputer in Tokyo Institute of Technology [5]. We \"validated\" the Green’s tensor waveforms with a point-source moment tensor inversion analysis for a small (Mw5.8) shallow event: we confirm the observed waveforms are reproduced well with the synthetics.\nThe inferred slip distribution using the 2.5D and 3D Green's functions has large slips (max. 37 m) near the hypocenter and small slips near the trench (figure). Also an isolated slip region is identified close to Fukushima prefecture. These features are similar to those obtained by our preliminary study [4]. The land-ward large slips and trench-ward small slips have also been reported by [2]. It is remarkable that we confirmed these features by using data-validated Green's functions. On the other hand very large slips are inferred close to the trench when we apply “1D” Green’s functions that do not incorporate the lateral heterogeneity. Our result suggests the trench-ward large deformation that caused large tsunamis did not radiate strong seismic waves. Very slow slips (e.g., the tsunami earthquake), delayed slips and anelastic deformation are among the candidates of the physical processes of the deformation.\n[1] Okamoto and Takenaka, EPS, 61, e17-e20, 2009.\n[2] Yokota et al., GRL, doi:10.1029/2011GL050098, 2011.\n[3] Takenaka and Okamoto, in Seismic Waves, Intech, 2012.\n[4] Okamoto et al., 2012.http://www.jaee.gr.jp/event/seminar2012/eqsympo/pdf/papers/94.pdf\n[5] Okamoto et al,2013. http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16405-7_24#page-1",

            "abstract": "Erosion in bedrock-floored rivers is both driven and limited by the amount of sediment transported along the bed. Some sediment boosts wear rates, whereas too much generates a protective cover. This phenomenon determines the shape of river channels in a variety of landscapes and limits how fast they evolve. Here we reevaluate data from a well-known bedrock wear experiment to throw new light on how the saltation-abrasion process. Instead of a symmetric form for erosion versus sediment flux relative to transport capacity, we find the erosion rate peak shifts towards lower sediment fluxes when blocking of oblique saltation trajectories is taken into account. The theoretical context for this reevaluation is a cover-saltation-abrasion model, based on queueing theory (QT), for bedload transport over a planar bedrock bed. The QT approach provides some clarity in the stochastic treatment of granular impacts and cover, and generates closed-form solutions for wear rate in terms of sediment flux and simplified saltation geometry. Applied to the Sklar & Dietrich (2001) experiments in a very small recirculating flume, the two-parameter QT model fits the observed relation between erosion rate and sediment load, infers sediment flux as a function of load, admits non-negligible wear rates for a mean sediment depth of one grain, i.e., for full cover on average, but also suggests that bedrock erosion is blocked at >=50% instantaneous cover. The QT model makes testable predictions for future laboratory experiments and highlights the need for specific improvements in more comprehensive treatments of bedrock erosion and cover.",

            "abstract": "Environmental impacts from industrialized agriculture have been studied extensively over the past two decades. Degradation of surface water occurs, primarily as a result of nutrient loading, causing algal blooms in streams and lakes. Discovery of the toxin microcystin in Lake Erie, a drinking water source for some municipalities, has been associated with agricultural runoff and created a new awareness in the general public. This study used data gathered over ten years by local residents, high school students and undergraduates on surface water around the Lower Peninsula of Michigan to test a simple correlation of nutrients (soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrogen ammonia) along with the presence of specific antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to identify dominant sources of nutrient loading in the Lake Huron Watershed. Data gathering came from multiple sources and were processed by faculty and students at an undergraduate, liberal arts institution. College students from various disciplines worked with community members and municipalities in an effort to describe the problem. Students proposed solutions which by-passed relatively inactive regulatory agencies to create an integrative, interactive resolution that involved a surprisingly wide extent of the community. Addressing cultural norms beginning with those most affected by a degraded environment has reaped some success in changing behavior and moving towards a sustainable solution. The research conducted and supervised by undergraduate students has significance in the broader, professional area of geochemistry, environmental health and sustainable agriculture. That fact plays an important role in how the students see themselves in the process and what motivated them to: 1. Choose to participate in the research in the first place, 2. Reach out to the broader community (scientific and regional) to carry out their research and 3. Pursue solutions beyond the classroom and summer research experience.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of the grounding line is necessary for predictions of long-term ice sheet stability. However, despite a growing number of observations of the tidal influence on grounding line migration, this short-timescale migration is poorly understood, with most modeling attempts assuming beam theory to calculate displacements. Here, we present an improved model of tidally-modulated grounding line migration that treats the migration as an elastic fracture problem forced by the additional ocean water pressure from the tide. This new model predicts that the grounding line cannot be assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and furthermore that the migration is inherently asymmetric and non-linear, with migration distances that are not simply proportional to the tidal load. Specifically, grounding line migration is approximately 10 times greater over the high tide part of the tidal cycle compared to low tide, and migration distances are substantially larger than simple flotation arguments would suggest. Numerical tests also show that the dependence of migration distance on elastic moduli and ice sheet thickness are inconsistent with the predictions of beam theory for a wide range of realistic values. Finally, applying the new model to observations in Antarctica results in new estimates of bed slopes, though these estimates remain uncertain due to imperfect knowledge of the relevant parameters.",

            "abstract": "Budgets of the tendency of convective available potential energy (CAPE) are calculated using reanalysis data in case studies of several North American severe weather outbreaks from the years 2012 and 2013. These budgets separate the tendency of CAPE into terms arising from diabatic heating of the subcloud boundary layer, radiative cooling of the free troposphere, and advection of air in the free troposphere relative to the motion of a parcel to be lifted. It is found that in most cases, the CAPE tendency budget is dominated by the term representing diabatic heating of the subcloud layer, which establishes high CAPE values in advance of thunderstorm development. This result suggests the relative importance of surface entropy fluxes in supporting midlatitude severe local storms through atmospheric preconditioning (CAPE buildup). By extension, this result warrants further investigation into the roles of environmental land surface properties as controls on the climatology of midlatitude severe convecton, as such properties play important roles in modulating surface entropy fluxes.",

Pakistan InSAR measurements from the German TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Canadian RADARSAT-2 (RS2) satellites include TSX narrow stripmap beams on a descending track, RS2 wide strip modes, and TSX wide-swath ScanSAR images on an ascending track, specially acquired with interferometric alignment of ScanSAR bursts. For the EMC earthquake, InSAR includes Envisat, ALOS, and RS2 satellites and NASA/JPL UAVSAR airborne InSAR, with piece-wise time coverage. Plate Boundary Observatory acquires continuous GPS data and others collect campaign GPS.\nInterferograms show significant afterslip on both main ruptures in the first weeks and months, not masked by the atmospheric effects. Balochistan shallow afterslip reaches at least 10 cm in 2-4 months in the same area as the largest coseismic slip, but less near the aftershock activity. Rapid afterslip was observed primarily at the ends of the EMC mainshock rupture where the strike changes, with magnitudes up to 30 cm. Large variations of tropospheric water vapor complicate measurement of small long-wavelength deformation so we do time series analysis.\nWe expect viscoelastic relaxation after these two strike-slip earthquakes to differ due to completely opposite tectonic settings: EMC earthquake in the Salton Trough rift and fast-moving strike-slip system, where crust and lithosphere are thin and hot with very shallow asthenosphere, and Balochistan earthquake in the shortening Makran accretional prism with much slower strike-slip deformation rates and cold and thick lithosphere of the subducting Arabian plate directly beneath it, so asthenosphere is much deeper. Studies have found rapid and large viscoelastic relaxation for the EMC quake, but we don’t expect measurable relaxation in the Balochistan area in the first year, based on preliminary modeling. These very different lithospheric configurations have strong implications for transfer of stress and future earthquake risk.",

            "abstract": "While subsidence has affected Mexico City for over a century, other cities in central Mexico have been subjected to subsidence since the '80, as a result of their large urban expansion, population increase and aggressive groundwater extraction rates. The continuous subsidence results in severe damage to urban infrastructure and civil structures. Unfortunately the damage cost assessment and vulnerability are difficult to evaluate, because of the variable geographic extent and the continuous nature of the process, which have different characteristics than localized, short duration hazards, as earthquakes or flood events.We have monitored land subsidence in 17 cities in central Mexico using both InSAR and GPS observations. InSAR provides an unsurpassed synoptic view of the earth's dynamic surface. However, different satellite sensors and sometimes widely spaced data availability make it difficult to derive long-term time series, rapid changes or nonlinear variations of subsidence velocities. To alleviate this situation, higher temporal resolution subsidence observations of associated fault motion has been pursued using continuously operating GPS stations. We have developed a GPS network that covers 6 urban centers to detect short duration variations using different processing schemes that include both real-time solutions using RTNet as well as daily solution using Gipsy-Oasis.Cartographic products based on these techniques have been merged with other population, hydrology and meteorology data sets. This approach allows a better hazard assessment and provides information for other purposes, such as vulnerability for shallow faulting, land use zonations, and other decision elements for water resource management agencies. We will provide examples of these hazard assessments for several cities, including Mexico City, Aguascalientes, Morelia, Irapuato and Celaya and the challenges encountered to integrate these results with other data sets from federal and state organizations.",

            "abstract": "The Chron C19r event in the late middle Eocene was first described at ODP Site 1260 in the equatorial Atlantic. It is characterized by strong dissolution expressed in a dark, clay-rich layer and a distinct peak in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning Fe intensities as well as by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in bulk sediment. All similar to early Paleogene hyperthermal events - the Chron C19r event could also be a hyperthermal event but in the late middle Eocene. The dissolution of carbonate at Site 1260 prevented so far to retrieve a benthic stable isotope record with a typical CIE and warming of deep water. The C19r event occurred ~1.0 myr prior to the onset of the Middle Eocene Climate Optimum (MECO, 40.5 Ma) and several million years after the Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, 51 Ma) during a slightly cooler climate. No significant CCD changes have been observed one million years before and after the event as expressed by regular Fe cycles at Site 1260. The duration of the event estimated by orbital calibration is in the order of 40-50 kyr, similar to other transient hyperthermals in the early to middle Eocene.\nHere we present new high-resolution bulk and benthic stable isotope data revealing the widespread nature of the event. We investigated ODP Sites 702B (~2200m) near the crest of the Islas Orcadas Rise in the southern South Atlantic, 1263 (~1800 m) on Walvis Ridge in the SE Atlantic, and 1051 (2100 m) on Blake Nose in the NW Atlantic. The position of the event was initially narrowed by careful analysis of magnetostratigraphy and XRF scanning data. First results of stable isotope data show a ~0.7 δ13C and ~0.4‰ δ18O excursion very similar to the pattern observed at Site 1260. Although the magnitude of the bulk δ13C excursion is comparable, the bulk δ18O excursion at Site 702B is only a third of that observed at Site 1260 which might be related to diagenetic and/or latitudinal effects. 702B benthic isotope data show a ~0.75 ‰ CIE and a ~0.4‰ shift in δ18O. For the first time the new records validate the C19r event in the southern South Atlantic and its ocean-wide if not global nature with a ~2°C deep sea warming. The magnitudes of the CIE and δ18O excursion are comparable to the H2 event (53.6 Ma) suggesting a similar response of the climate system to carbon cycle perturbations even in relatively cooler climate.",

The algorithm includes four consecutive steps: a) constructing a local piecewise model of a reflecting surface in the neighbourhood of the reservoir; b) solving a direct problem by calculating the reflected waveforms within the framework of the model; c) imposing restrictions and validity criteria for the algorithm based on waveform modelling; d) solving the inverse problem by retrieving a tracking point by the improved threshold algorithm. The results obtained on the basis of standard algorithm and method for adaptive re-tracking at Rybinsk , Gorky, Kuibyshev, Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs and middle-sized lakes of Russia: Chany, Segozero, Hanko, Onego, Beloye are compared to each other and to the field data of hydrological stations in reservoirs and lakes.\nThe possibility of determination of significant wave height (SWH) in the lakes through a two-step adaptive retracking is investigated. Comparing results of retracting of SGDR data and ground measurements shows, that retrieving wave parameters in medium sized water bodies still meets difficulties. The direction of improvement of the existing algorithm is associated with comprehensive use of altimetry data, field studies and numerical modeling of high resolution.\nA simple method for timing of water freezing and ice break-up in lakes based on analysis of along-track dependencies of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 34 GHz registered by microwave radiometer of altimetry satellite Jason-2. Comparison with in situ data of Russian Register of hydraulic structures on the example of reservoirs of the Volga River and the Don River confirms ability of the proposed method to determine quantitatively the freezing and break-up times for middle-sized inland water bodies.",

            "abstract": "As plant roots take up water and the soil dries, water depletion is expected to occur in the rhizosphere. However, recent experiments showed that the rhizosphere was wetter than the bulk soil during root water uptake. We hypothesise that the increased water content in the rhizosphere was caused by mucilage exuded by roots. It is probably that the higher water content in the rhizosphere results in higher hydraulic conductivity of the root–soil interface. In this case, mucilage exudation would favour the uptake of water in dry soils. To test this hypothesis, we covered a suction cup, referred to as an artificial root, with mucilage. We placed it in soil with a water content of 0.03 cm3 cm–3, and used the root pressure probe technique to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the root–soil continuum. The results were compared with measurements with roots not covered with mucilage. The root pressure relaxation curves were fitted with a model of root water uptake including rhizosphere dynamics. The results demonstrated that when mucilage is added to the root surface, it keeps the soil near the roots wet and hydraulically well conductive, facilitating the water flow from dry soils towards the root surface. Mucilage exudation seems to be an optimal plant trait that favours the capture of water when water is scarce.",

            "abstract": "Myrmekites are fine intergrowths of (generally Na-rich) plagioclase and vermicular quartz developed on K-feldspar. The myrmekite-forming reaction is intimately related to deformation as it results in volume decrease and finer grainsize, thus enhancing plastic behaviour. In south Brazil, myrmekites are described in 642 Ma syntectonic syenites intrusive in a ca. 650 Ma collisional thrust pile comprised of granulite-facies gneisses. Syenites are porphyritic or fine-grained equigranular, with biotite, clinopyroxene (Cpx) and amphibole as mafic phases. They are variably deformed, and disposed in alternating m- to cm-thick layers. Within low-strain zones, well-developed magmatic foliation and lineation are marked by shape alignment of K-feldspar (Kf) and mafic minerals. Subgrains and recrystallized grains (ca. 0,5 mm) are common features at the border of Kf megacrysts, developed to different degrees. In highly deformed sites, the strain softening promoted by the inflow of late-magmatic fluids has lead to deformation partitioning into wet and dry zones, where different end-products are formed from a single syenite protolith. Within the dry zones, high-T recrystallization is abundant in both Kf and Cpx, but primary mineralogy is preserved. Within the wet zones the rock contains biotite and minor amphibole, but no Cpx. Kf megacrysts are progressively invaded by myrmekite (An38-43) mantles, especially along foliation-parallel faces. In their pressure shadows, 5mm-sized, subhedral plagioclase crystals (An44-48) containing irregular quartz inclusions are interpreted as crystallized from Ca-enriched, late-magmatic fluids which have destabilized Cpx. Large plagioclase crystals and myrmekite aggregates are further recrystallized, and the process has eventually lead to the formation of plagioclase-rich rocks restricted to m-thick bands. Deformation partitioning into dry and wet zones, and the fact that myrmekites are restricted to the latter demonstrate that fluids are the necessary triggering factor to promote mineral changes. Pervasive myrmekite formation as a consequence of deformation coupled with late-magmatic fluid flow in syntectonic environments may contribute significantly to deformation partitioning and strain softening in the lower continental crust.",

This study evaluates the options of counteracting the rising polar temperatures by stratospheric sulphur injections in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes.10 Mt of sulphur dioxide are emitted in a point emission source setup centred at the 100 hPa pressure level over Svalbard island (80°N,15°E). We perform simulations with the general circulation models ECHAM5, ECHAM6, and GISS ModelE.\nWe study pulsed emission simulations that differ among themselves by the injection starting date (March-September), injection length (1, 30, or 90 day emission period), and the vertical resolution of the model (for ECHAM6).\nWe find injections in April to be the most efficient in terms of the shortwave radiative forcing at the top-of-the atmosphere over the Arctic region. The distribution of sulphate aerosol spreads out beyond the injection region, with a significant share reaching the Southern Hemisphere.\nResults from ModelE show high latitude injections could counteract the spring and summer temperature increase due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Preliminary results with a more realistic description of clouds in ECHAM-HAM reveal a complex pattern of responses, most notably:\na decrease in Northern Hemisphere cirrus clouds strengthening the effect of stratospheric aerosols in ECHAM5\na decrease in low-level clouds over the Arctic increasing the incoming solar radiation and causing a net positive radiative balance\ncirrus clouds are resilient to stratospheric sulphur injections in the absence of sulphate warming ",

            "abstract": "Separated and in situ ultrahigh pressure (UHP), highly reduced and crustal-type minerals are common in podiform chromitites of the Luobusa and Dongqiao ophiolites, Tibet and the Ray-Iz ophiolite of the Polar Urals, Russia. Highly reduced and crustal-type minerals have also been recovered from the Oman ophiolite. UHP minerals include diamond, coesite-stishovite and kyanite, whereas highly reduced minerals are mainly moissanite (SiC), native elements (e.g., Si, Fe, Cr, Al, Ti, Mn, W, Ta) and a wide variety of metallic alloys. Crustal-type minerals are represented by various combinations of zircon, corundum, almandine garnet, kyanite, andalusite, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, apatite, amphibole, rutile, and titanite. Most in-situ grains are hosted in small, circular to irregular patches of amorphous carbon within grains of magnesiochromite, indicating the former presence of a C-rich fluid, either during or after crystallization of the chromite. The recovered zircons are typically rounded to sub-rounded grains with complex internal structures indicating polyphase growth. Their trace element contents and low-pressure inclusion assemblages (quartz, muscovite, K-feldspar, apatite, ilmenite, rutile) indicate a continental crustal origin. The zircons have SIMS U-Pb ages that are generally much older than the host ophiolite (total range: 90 to 2500 Ma). The presence of numerous crustal minerals, particularly zircon, suggests derivation from metasedimentary rocks subducted into the mantle. The preservation of UHP, highly reduced and crustal-type minerals in chromitites implies effective isolation from the mafic melts that formed the ophiolites and chromitites. Clearly, the formation of ophiolites and podiform chromitites must be a complex, multistage process involving crystallization of magnesiochromite grains at depth in the upper mantle, upwelling of the host peridotites and chromitites, capture of mantle wedges above suprasubduction zones, further crystallization and modification of magnesiochromite grains, allowing incorporation of crustal-type minerals from the underlying subducting slab. Slab rollback and/or slab tear may facilitate uprise of mantle peridotites leading to concentration of podiform chromitites within individual ophiolitic blocks.",

            "abstract": "The δD is an important probe for studying the cycle of water within the Earth and between planetary bodies. D/H fractionation between silicate melts, minerals, aqueous fluids and gases governed the δD-evolution of the various geochemical reservoirs. It is usually assumed that D+ and H+ have the same chemical properties and structural environments in silicate melts and aqueous fluids, so that the only mass-dependent fractionation takes place with values approaching 1 at magmatic temperatures. However, recent in situ studies reveal important D/H fractionation between silicate melts and aqueous fluids even at high temperature. H and D MAS NMR data from sodium silicate glasses also shown that D+ and H+ occupy different structural positions in the structure of silicate glasses. This suggests that mass-dependent fractionation is not the only factor governing D/H fractionation in magmatic systems.\nTo assess how the chemical composition and the structure of alkali silicate glasses affect the environments of H+ and D+, the H and D MAS NMR spectra of M2Si4O9 glasses (M = Li, Na or K) with different concentrations of pure H2O or D2O (from 3.3 up to 17.6 mol%) were recorded. Other spectra were acquired from M2Si4O9 glasses with 17.6 mol%(1H,1D)2O. Signals at ~1, ~3.5, ~5, ~12 and ~16 ppm in 1H MAS NMR spectra are assigned to H+ in H2O molecules and Si-OH groups in the glasses. These five signals indicates protons distribution between at least five environments with O…O distances ranging from ~305 to ~240 pm. The ionic radius of alkali affects the distribution of H+ between those environments.\nD MAS NMR spectra reveal that by exchanging H+ with D+, the intensity of the 16 ppm NMR line increases, whereas the intensity of the 5 ppm line decreases. Consequently, D+ seems to be more concentrated than H+ in environments with small O...O distances. In other words, the structural environments of H+ and D+ in the silicate glasses, and hence in melts at their glass transition temperature, differ. These structural differences may promote fractionation of H+ and D+ during melting, crystallization and exsolution of aqueous fluids from magma in the Earth's interior. These effects, in turn, may cause variations of δD between the different Earth reservoirs.",

Cloud environments reduce the amount of time and money spent to procure, install, and maintain new hardware and software, and reduce costs through resource pooling and shared infrastructure. Cloud services aimed at providing any resource, at any time, from any place, using any device are increasingly being embraced by all types of organizations.\nGiven this trend and the enormous potential of cloud-based services, Unidata is taking moving to augment its products, services, data delivery mechanisms and applications to align with the cloud-computing paradigm. Specifically, Unidata is working toward establishing a community-based development environment that supports the creation and use of software services to build end-to-end data workflows. The design encourages the creation of services that can be broken into small, independent chunks that provide simple capabilities. Chunks could be used individually to perform a task, or chained into simple or elaborate workflows. The services will also be portable, allowing their use in researchers’ own cloud-based computing environments.\nIn this talk, we present a vision for Unidata’s future in a cloud-enabled data services and discuss our initial efforts to deploy a subset of Unidata data services and tools in the Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure cloud environments, including the transfer of real-time meteorological data into its cloud instances, product generation using those data, and the deployment of TDS, McIDAS ADDE and AWIPS II data servers and the Integrated Data Server visualization tool.",

The primary purpose of this work is to assess microwave ice particle scattering models by comparing forward model calculations with dual-frequency airborne radar and multi-frequency passive microwave observations of select surface snowfall events from GCPEx. Forward model radar and radiometer calculations require snowflake scattering properties to be integrated over particle size distributions, and both of these inherent microphysical quantities strongly influence unconstrained radar-radiometer simulations under snowing conditions. Therefore, direct airborne and ground-based ice particle size distribution measurements and other relevant microphysical properties will be used to build a physically realistic microphysical rendition of the atmospheric column to simulate both layer radar reflectivity signatures and top-of-the-atmosphere microwave radiometer brightness temperatures for select GCPEx cases. Comparisons of measured particle size distributions will also be made to particle size distribution parameter retrievals from airborne-only observations, and the subsequent sensitivity in simulated brightness temperatures will be discussed. Other simulation complicating factors (e.g., surface emissivity effects, cloud liquid water location and amount, etc.) and implications for GPM radar and radiometer retrievals will also be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Data democracy is a concept that has great relevance to the use and value of geospatial data and scientific information. Data democracy describes a world in which data and information are widely and broadly accessible, understandable, and useable. The concept operationalizes the public good nature of scientific information and provides a framework for increasing benefits from its use.\nData democracy encompasses efforts to increase accessibility to geospatial data and to expand participation in its collection, analysis, and application. These two pillars are analogous to demand and supply relationships. Improved accessibility, or demand, includes increased knowledge about geospatial data and low barriers to retrieval and use. Expanded participation, or supply, encompasses a broader community involved in developing geospatial data and scientific information. This pillar of data democracy is characterized by methods such as citizen science or crowd sourcing.\nA framework is developed for advancing the use of data democracy. This includes efforts to assess the societal benefits (economic and social) of scientific information. This knowledge is critical to continued monitoring of the effectiveness of data democracy implementation and of potential impact on the use and value of scientific information.\nThe framework also includes an assessment of opportunities for advancing data democracy both on the supply and demand sides. These opportunities include relatively inexpensive efforts to reduce barriers to use as well as the identification of situations in which participation can be expanded in scientific efforts to enhance the breadth of involvement as well as expanding participation to non-traditional communities.\nThis framework provides an initial perspective on ways to expand the “scientific community” of data users and providers. It also describes a way forward for enhancing the societal benefits from geospatial data and scientific information. As a result, data democracy not only provides benefits to a greater population, it enhances the value of science.",

            "abstract": "Over the past two decades, satellite measurements are being increasingly used in weather and climate prediction systems and have made a considerable progress in accurate numerical weather and climate predictions. However, it is noticed that the utilization of satellite measurements over land is far less than over ocean, because of the high land surface inhomogeneity and the high emissivity variabilities in time and space of surface characteristics. In this presentation, we will discuss the application efforts of satellite land observations in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational Global Forecast System (GFS) in order to improve the global numerical weather prediction (NWP). Our study focuses on use of satellite data sets such as vegetation type and green vegetation fraction, assimilation of satellite products such as soil moisture retrieval, and direct radiance assimilation. Global soil moisture data products could be used for initialization of soil moisture state variables in numerical weather, climate and hydrological forecast models. A global Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) has been developed at NOAA-NESDIS to continuously provide global soil moisture data products to meet NOAA-NCEP's soil moisture data needs. The impact of the soil moisture data products on numerical weather forecast is assessed using the NCEP GFS in which the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation algorithm has been implemented. In terms of radiance assimilation, satellite radiance measurements in various spectral channels are assimilated through the JCSDA Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) on the NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system, which requires the CRTM to calculate model brightness temperature (Tb) with input of model atmosphere profiles and surface parameters. Particularly, for surface sensitive channels (window channels), Tb largely depends on surface parameters such as land surface skin temperature, soil moisture, and emissivity. Therefore, in order to improve radiance data assimilation, we have to improve not only surface emissivity calculation but also model surface parameters simulation. Some improvements of satellite radiance assimilation over land will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The volcano-tectonic setting in which the InSAR-detected Lazufre deformation is developing is particularly relevant in the evolution of this Andean volcanic arc segment (25-26°S). Through regional mapping techniques, a comprehensive field control in addition to geochronological sampling, various volcanic units comprising stratovolcanoes, volcanic complexes, ignimbrites and caldera structures are distinguished. The Lazufre intumescence is located above the overlying block of the NE trending Middle Miocene, Pedernales-Arizaro overthrust. This area comprises an Upper Miocene (8-4 Ma) basal unit of andesitic-dacitic volcanoes and lava fields, upon which nine volcanic complexes of similar composition, including Caletones de Cori Ignimbrite and Escorial Volcano, Lastarria, Cordón del Azufre and Bayo volcanic complexes, were emplaced in several pulses between 3.5 Ma and Holocene times. Coalescing Lazufre structure, immediately to the SE, we have discovered the Miocene (9.8 Ma) Los Colorados caldera. This caldera is 30 km in diameter and sourced the homonymous dacitic ignimbrite of about 500 km3. The caldera scarp was formed in Paleozoic rocks, Miocene dacitic-rhyolitic ignimbrites and ~16 and 10 Ma volcanoes. A 6.9-6.8 Ma andesitic-dacitic volcano ridge formed by Abra Grande, Río Grande and Aguas Calientes stratovolcanoes, from NE to SW, is nested on the caldera floor. Lavas of early stages of Cordón del Azufre and Bayo complexes were shed into the NW part of the caldera. The coalescing structure formed by the Lazufre intumescence and Los Colorados caldera is conjugate at about 30° to the Pedernales-Arizaro overthrust, and has a NW-SE orientation, parallel to the Archibarca lineament. A SE to NW migration of volcanism is observed along this structure at least since the Middle Miocene. We proposed that, since Miocene, tectonic spaces with no surficial fault displacements and conjugated to the main compressive structures within the upper crust, have been created as a result of tensional stresses. Subsequently, the so increased lithostatic gradient could play a major role in the vertical traction of magma rising, favoring crustal assimilation processes. The available geochronological data indicate that the deformation that preceded the Los Colorados caldera occurred in a maximum period between 13 and 10 Ma.",

            "abstract": "In the US, residential and commercial building infrastructure combined consumes about 40% of total energy usage and emits about 39% of total CO2emission (DOE/EIA “Annual Energy Outlook 2013”). Thus, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings is paramount to reducing energy costs and emissions. Building codes, as used by local and state enforcement entities are typically tied to the dominant climate within an enforcement jurisdiction classified according to various climate zones. These climates zones are based upon a 30-year average of local surface observations and are developed by DOE and ASHRAE (formerly known as the American Society of Hearting, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers). A significant shortcoming of the methodology used in constructing such maps is the use of surface observations (located mainly near airports) that are unequally distributed and frequently have periods of missing data that need to be filled by various approximation schemes. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of using NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) atmospheric data assimilation to derive the ASHRAE climate zone maps and then using MERRA to define the last 30 years of variability in climate zones. These results show that there is a statistically significant increase in the area covered by warmer climate zones and some tendency for a reduction of area in colder climate zones that require longer time series to confirm. Using the uncertainties of the basic surface temperature and precipitation parameters from MERRA as determined by comparison to surface measurements, we first compare patterns and variability of ASHRAE climate zones from MERRA relative to present day climate model runs from AMIP simulations to establish baseline sensitivity. Based upon these results, we assess the variability of the ASHRAE climate zones according to CMIP runs through 2100 using an ensemble analysis that classifies model output changes by percentiles. Estimates of statistical significance are then compared to original model variability during the AMIP period. This work quantifies and tests for significance the changes seen in the various US regions that represent a potential contribution by NASA to the ongoing National Climate Assessment.",

            "abstract": "We present new wet chemical determination of the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio for 41 glassy samples from the East Scotia back-arc basin (South Atlantic) showing a chemical continuum from MORB-like to arc-like compositions. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of East Scotia samples vary from 0.05 to 0.21. Proxies of subduction inputs such as H8.0 (H2O content corrected for fractional crystallization) and Ba/Y ratios display along the ridge axis three arc-like spikes (H8.0> 1.5 wt.%; Ba/Y >2) that are correlated to high Fe3+/ΣFe ratios (0.21, 0.18, and 0.20). MORB-like samples (H8.0<0.3; Ba/Y<2) display lower Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of 0.08±0.02. We show that fractional crystallization processes cannot account solely for the observed Fe3+/ΣFe variation and propose that the high Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of arc-like samples reflect higher oxidation states of primary magmas compared to MORB-like samples.\nPrevious studies have shown that the northernmost subduction spike is characterized by a complex interplay between various subduction inputs and the westward inflow of enriched mantle derived from the Bouvet hotspot. We did not find evidence for any influence of the OIB-like enriched mantle on the Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of lavas samples. Correlations between Fe3+/ΣFe and trace element ratios diagnostic of subduction inputs (e.g. Ba/Y, r=0.83) indicate that input of water-rich subduction components is related to high oxidation states in arc-like samples. Further south, the inflow of Bouvet mantle fades to almost no influence and reveals the central spike that show the most arc-like influence with the contribution of water-rich and sediment-melts components. In this section, the Fe3+/ΣFe is also strongly and positively correlated with Ba/Y ratios (r=0.85) and shows, for a given Ba/Y ratio and compared to northern and central samples, lower Fe3+/ΣFe ratios. Finally, when the southern samples are characterized by high H2O/[LILE] ratios. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratio of southern samples is also strongly correlated with the Ba/Y ratio (r=0.94) showing, for a given Ba/Y higher Fe3+/ΣFe ratios compared to samples from the northern spike. East Scotia back-arc lavas display 3 different relationships between Fe3+/ΣFe data and proxies of subduction inputs. We discuss the origin of those 3 different trends and the potential mantle wedge oxidation by subduction fluids.",

Such basin were formed in association with the subduction of the Pacific plate, the opening of the Caribbean or the growth of allocthonous oceanic arcs and were extensively deformed in the Late Cretaceous initiation of Andean orogeny.\nTectonic models for these basins have been mainly postulated from the stratigraphic interpretations or regional characterization of the tectonomagmatic affinity of volcanic rocks. Less attention have been paid on the pontential to evaluate the tectonic history from the characterization of the paleothermal record recorded in diagenetic and very low grade metamorphic evolution of the pelitic rock.\nIn the Central Cordillera outcrops two main Albian Cretaceous units: the Abejorral formation which is characterized by a pelitic succession with minor sandstones beds and the Quebradagrande Complex that include intercalations of volcanic and pelitic rocks. Such relatively deep accumulation environment is contemporaneous with shallow carbonates and pelitic succesions in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes.\nRocks from the Eastern Cordillera that have been widely characterized due to their relation with petroleum exploration are characterized limited development of cleavage and well defined sedimentary structures. In contrast field field relations have shown that the central Cordillera units are characterized by the development of a well defined slaty cleavage, limited development of quartz veins.\nPublished vitrinite constraints from the Eastern Cordillera have revealed very high burial temperatures which is compatible with proposed extensional setting during burial and accumulation. New illite and chlorite mineralogical characterization is being obtained on the Abejorral and Quebradagrande formation in order to test if the low grade metamorphic record still preserved the high geothermal gradient expected from an accumulation environment and the quick transition from extension to compression.",

Rapid reactivation of soil heterotrophic activity and a pulse of available carbon are both required to fuel the CO2 pulse. Better understanding of the effects of altered summer precipitation on the metabolic state of indigenous microorganisms may be important in predicting future changes in carbon cycling.\nHere, we investigated the effects of a controlled rewetting event on the soil CO2 efflux pulse and on the present (DNA-based) and potentially active (rRNA-based) soil bacterial and fungal communities in intact soil cores previously subjected to three different precipitation patterns over four months (full summer dry season, extended wet season, and absent dry season). Phylogenetic marker genes for bacteria (16S) and fungi (28S) were sequenced before and after rewetting, and the abundance of these genes and transcripts was measured.\nEven after having experienced markedly different antecedent water conditions, the potentially active bacterial communities showed a consistent wet-up response. Moreover, we found a significant positive relation between the extent of change in the structure of the potentially active bacterial community and the magnitude of the CO2 pulse upon rewetting dry soils.\nWe suggest that the duration of severe dry conditions (predicted to change under future climate) is important in conditioning the response potential of the soil bacterial community to wet-up as well as in framing the magnitude of the associated CO2 pulse.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge to sample return is the transport to Mars of an adequate supply of fuel and oxidizer (the heavier component) for the return trip. A possible novel architecture would be for the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to share a platform with a device that would manufacture the oxidizer in situ. Far from fanciful, that hypothetical platform would look very much like the Mars 2020 rover. The Mars Oxygen In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Experiment, MOXIE, will produce 22 g/hr oxygen from atmospheric carbon dioxide using solid oxide electrolysis (SOXE). With proper refrigeration, it could readily fill a MAV tank with high Isp LOx while waiting for rendezvous with a sample acquisition rover.\nThe immediate motivation for MOXIE, however, is as a prototype for a 100:1 scale unit that would serve the same function on an eventual human expedition. If optimistic plans for a crewed mission are realized, it may well carry the second, and far more bountiful, Mars sample return. To make 22 g/hr oxygen from the CO2 in the martian atmosphere, MOXIE must first collect and compress that CO2, while purging other atmospheric components (4-5 vol%) that would otherwise build up and choke the process.

            "abstract": "The dangerous control engineering often stacks stones, named the footstone, outside the sediment matrix to resist the scour erosion in lower Yellow River. In order to ensure the stability of the bank, the footstones are stacked in the certain proportion. Due to the effect of the seasonal changes and the adjustment of the upstream reservoir, the water depth of the Yellow River near the lobes of banks changes constantly. The scouring erosion in flood season and depositing in dry season make the stacked footstones to be washed away. The thickness and the location of the maximum burial depth of the footstones are the important supporting data for calculating the river scour. Thus, it is significant to investigate the location, thickness and slope of the footstones. This study proposed a new method to distinguish the silt and footing stones according to their frequency differences by applying time-frequency analysis to the sub-bottom profiler data, and to estimate the thickness of the footstones by using the messy reflection waves formed by the riprap, and then to has solved the estimation of the maximum scour depth.",

The GPM mission is a satellite program led by Japan and the U.S. to measure the global distribution of precipitation accurately in a sufficient frequency. The GPM Core Observatory carries the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The frequent precipitation measurement about every three hours will be achieved by constellation satellites with microwave radiometers or microwave sounders, which are provided by international partners. JAXA also provides the Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) - Water (GCOM-W) named “SHIZUKU,” as one of the constellation satellites.\nThe Japanese GPM research project conducts scientific activities on algorithm development, ground validation, application research. JAXA develops the DPR Level 1 algorithm, and the NASA-JAXA Joint Algorithm Team develops the DPR Level 2 and DPR-GMI combined Level 2 algorithms.

Robinson et al. (2014) used detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic analysis to show that Eocene and Oligocene sedimentary rocks were primarily sourced from the Gangdese magmatic arc that lies exclusively within the southern Lhasa terrane, and that the Yarlung Tsangpo and Irrawaddy River were connected at this time. Detrital thermochronology reveal these Paleogene deposits contain broadly distributed, mainly pre-Himalayan 40Ar/39Ar white mica cooling ages, reflecting the contribution from multiple source areas with a cooling history that is similar to the Lhasa terrane. A distinct change in provenance to a single, sustained source area during deposition of the Miocene units is recorded by a white mica 40Ar/39Ar cooling age peak of 37 Ma and a lesser peak of 17 – 21 Ma that is also observed in detrital zircon fission track age data. These two age peaks, 37 Ma and 17 – 21 Ma, likely reflect an initial period of crustal thickening, metamorphism and exhumation in the southern Mogok Metamorphic Belt, and a later phase of exhumation associated with deformation in the eastern syntaxis and the onset of extension in Myanmar and other parts of SE Asia. The latter events are also associated with the disconnection of the Yarlung Tsangpo from the Irrawaddy River around 18 Ma (Robinson et al., 2014). The combined dataset provides constraints on the position and movement of the West Burma block from the Late Eocene to Early Miocene, supports an Oligocene (~37 Ma) age for the timing of India-West Burma-Sibumasu coupling, and an Early Miocene age for extension-related exhumation associated with deformation in the eastern Himalayan region.\nRobinson, RAJ, Brezina, CA, Parrish, RR, Horstwood, MSA, Nay Win, O, Bird, MI, Myint, T, Walters, AS, Oliver, GJH, and Khin, Z, (2014) Large rivers and orogens: The evolution of the Yarlung Tsangpo–Irrawaddy system and the eastern Himalayan syntaxis: Gondwana Research, 26, 112-121.",

            "abstract": "The ocean at mesoscale (20-200 km) and submesoscale (0.5-20km) is highly populated by vortices. These recirculating structures are more energetic than the mean flow, they trap water masses from their origin areas and advect them across the ocean, with consequent impact on the 3D distribution of heat and tracers. Mesoscale and submesoscale structures characterize the ocean dynamics both at the sea surface and at intrathermocline depths (0-1500m), and are presently investigated by means of model outputs, in-situ and satellite (surface) data, the latest being the only way to get high resolution and synoptic observations at planetary scale (e.g., thermal-band observations, future altimetric observations given by the SWOT satellite mission). The scientific question arising from this context is related to the role of the ocean surface for inferring informations on mesoscale and submesoscale vortices at depth. This study has also been motivated by the recent detection of subsurface eddies east of the Arabian Peninsula (PHYSINDIEN experiment - 2011).\nUsing analytical models in the frame of the QG theory, we could describe the theoretical altimetric signature of non-drifting and of drifting subsurface eddies. Numerical experiments, using both coupled QG-SQG and primitive equations models, allowed us to investigate the surface expression of intrathermocline eddies interacting with baroclinic currents or evolving under planetary beta-effect. The eddy characteristics (radius, depth, thickness, velocity) were varied, to represent various oceanic examples (Meddies, Swoddies, Reddies, Peddies, Leddies). Idealized simulations with the ROMS model, confirming theoretical estimates, showed that drifting subsurface-intensified vortices can induce dipolar sea level anomalies, up to 3 cm. This result, compatibly with future SWOT measurement accuracies (about 2 cm), is a first step towards systematic and synoptic detection of subsurface vortices.",

            "abstract": "Western Wilkes Land provides an unusual setting with regard to passive margin subsidence and exposure of Cenozoic sedimentary units across the continental shelf, due to the unique rift to drift history off of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance and subsequent deep glacial erosion of the evolved continental shelf. The first factor has provided extensive accommodation space for the preservation of stratigraphic sequences that in turn represent critical periods in the climate evolution of Antarctica. Glacial erosion has then provided access to this stratigraphy that is usually inaccessible to all but deep drilling programs. Such stratigraphies are well exposed to within cm of the seafloor off the Sabrina Coast. Cruise NBP1402 investigated this region via a combination of multi-channel seismic imaging and innovative, strategic coring. The geophysical data imaged the geologic evolution of the margin, which exhibits a continuum from non-glacial, partly glaciated, to fully glaciated depo- and erosional systems. Based on the seismic stratigraphy, we collected dredges and one barrel Jumbo Piston Cores (JPCs) across areas of outcropping strata imaged seismically, a unique strategy that allowed us to identify and sample specific reflectors. The stratigraphically deepest coring targeted sections for which the seismic character suggested a pre-glacial context, with non-glaciated continental margin sequences including deltas. Coring recovered dark organic rich siltstones and sandy mudstones, and a large concretion whose center contained a cm-sized plant fossil. In addition, the sediments contain a fossil snail. These fossils provide a glimpse into the pre-glacial terrestrial environment in Antarctica. Overlying this section, coring recovered similar dark siltstones with a 20 cm thick horizon with abundant large angular clasts of variable lithology, interpreted to be ice-rafted debris and indicative of early glacial ice in Antarctica. Finally, JPCs targeting a younger part of the sequence recovered diatomites suitable for biostratigraphic control. We highlight this new mode of operation for JPCs as a relatively inexpensive way to acquire stratigraphic samples at key seafloor outcroppings with the tremendous benefit of being able to conduct this kind of sampling from a mobile platform in icy waters.",

In this paper, we report experimental measurements of mean velocities and turbulent fluctuations in the upper five pore spaces of an idealized gravel bed beneath a turbulent water flow. These experiments were conducted in the Hyporheic Flow Facility (HFF) at the University of Illinois. Systematic two-dimensional flow measurements were collected by an endoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry technique (EPIV), at five different pore locations with varying wall-normal distance from the interface. Several different surface flow conditions varying in Re and Froude have been investigated for all the pore space measurements. Herein, we report on the effect of the flow Reynolds number and Froude number on the flow structure within these five pore spaces, and examine the changing nature of mean flow and turbulence penetration with depth in the sediment bed.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation projections estimated from regional climate models are subject to large uncertainties. Several probabilistic procedures based on multi-model ensembles have been suggested in the literature to quantify the uncertainty. These procedures often require several assumptions. Two common assumptions are that the climate models are independent and that changes in climate model biases are negligible. However, there is evidence suggesting that these assumptions might not be valid. This study presents a Bayesian framework that accounts for model dependencies and changes in model biases. The Bayesian framework is used to estimate the uncertainty in extreme precipitation projections over Denmark with and without making these assumptions based on the multi-model ensemble of regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project.\nThe evaluation of the two assumptions confirms that the regional climate models cannot be considered independent and shows that the bias depends on the precipitation amount. The results from the Bayesian framework show that this has a large influence on the uncertainty estimated. If the interdependency and change in bias are not taken into account, the results may be treated as more precise than they really are and underestimate the climate change impact on extreme precipitation. This study highlights the importance of investigating the underlying assumptions in climate change impact studies and suggests a Bayesian framework which is flexible and allows testing different assumptions and their influence.",

            "abstract": "The Turkey Lake Watershed (TLW) is located on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario, Canada and has been the site of multi-discipline ecosystem research since 1979. The 10.5 km2 watershed is within the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence forest region with an uneven-aged tolerant hardwood forest having 90% of the basal area as mature to over-mature sugar maple. Podzolic soils and small forested wetlands have developed in the complex topography of the watershed where variable glacial till deposits occur over predominantly metamorphic silicate bedrock. Within the watershed, 13 first-order catchments that vary in size and topography have been monitored to elucidate spatio-temporal processes controlling run-off patterns. Over the 35 year period mean annual air temperatures at the TLW have increased at a rate of 0.75 oC per decade, with large inter-annual climate variability due to the influence of regional climate oscillations. As a result of warmer climate there has been a decline in annual export of water, as well as, changes in the seasonal distribution of runoff, Snowmelt has been occurring earlier and the number of zero-flow days are increasing. Declines in runoff were greater for catchments with steep slopes and less for those with shallow slopes and wetland areas. The large year to year variability in weather conditions made detecting the impacts on runoff from different harvesting treatments in 1997 difficult. These changes and fluctuations in water yields induced by fluctuating and changing climate have been shown to have had large consequences on element (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) cycling within and export from catchments.",

            "abstract": "Since the late 1980s a large number of numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models has been used to assess the impacts of deforestation on global and regional climate, and one of the main motivations is the Amazon rainforest. In the same way, in the last decade several studies have shown that a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere could lead changes in climate in the Amazon region. In this study we performed new analyses to quantify how deforestation, fire and the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration may combine to affect the climate in Amazonia during this century. For the projection of land use was considered a spatially explicit land use scenario from Aguiar et al. (2013). The scenario was built using LuccME generic modelling framework and the potential of change considering the proximity to previously deforested areas and also spatial drivers (roads and protected areas). In order to quantify the response of Brazilian Earth System Model, with INLAND-IBIS surface model, to climate change, deforestation and forest fire we performed a suite of simulations in two main categories: 1) the model was running under historical and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration, and 2) the model was forced by the same configuration in 1 but also considering the effects of deforestation and forest fire in Amazon. In summary, the most important changes occur in the East/Northeast and South of the Amazonia and are more evident when are considered all effects (climate change, deforestation and fire). The results show warmer near-surface air temperature in all cases compared to the control case. This relative warming of the deforested land surface is consistent with the reduction in evapotranspiration, the lower leaf area and the lower surface roughness length. There is a reduction in annual precipitation in both cases mainly over eastern/northeastern Amazonia. The reduction in precipitation occurs mainly during the dry season (June-November) in both cases, and there is an increase in dry season length that is more evident when are considered all effects. In summary, we conclude that the synergistic combination of deforestation and climate change resulting from global warming may lead to important impacts that add considerably to the vulnerability of tropical forest ecosystems in the region.",

            "abstract": "Rapid predictions of flood using high resolution process-based numerical models applied at global scale is a useful tool for flood forecasting. Usually it requires days or even months to create such a model for a specific area and in most cases the process assumes a lot of manual work. Our goal is to significantly decrease the time required for this process by means of software integration of data processing tools, numerical models and global data sets. The methodology is based on the use of the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB to identify the potential flood areas. An automated set of tools will be applied to generate a coupled hydrological / hydraulic model using a high resolution input data based on free global data sets such as SRTM, HydroSHEDS, CORINE, and OpenStreetMaps. This information should be sufficient to generate high resolution input for distributed rainfall-runoff and shallow water flow models. For the detection of potential flood areas, and generation of the unstructured model grid required by the D-Flow FM hydrodynamic model, we will use Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND) dataset derived from SRTM. For coupling the distributed hydrological and shallow water models we will use the Basic Model Interface (BMI). BMI is a lightweight API that enables communication with numerical models at runtime. We will validate benefits of the algorithm by applying it to the San Francisco bay area. The models and data processing tools will be integrated into an interactive user interface that will enable data exploration and will allow generation of new models based on user request or automatic rules. Using our approach we expect to make significant steps towards realizing our goal of global availability of flood forecasting models.",

            "abstract": "Present day dynamo models simulate thermally-driven convection in fluids differently from liquid metals that exist in planetary cores. In such models, quasi-steady, columnar convection structures drive dynamo action. Here we present the results of an idealized model of core-style convection first by studying rotating convection in liquid gallium and then by including the effect of magnetic fields. In rotating convection in liquid metal, we find that the convection occurs via oscillatory motions occurring throughout the bulk of the fluid. These liquid metal inertial motions are fundamentally different than the quasi-steady modes in present day dynamo models and, further, are unlikely to be efficient at generating quasi-steady planetary magnetic fields. Withthe addition of a magnetic field, the bulk oscillatory convection mode is suppressed and replaced by a previously unobserved flow: a magneto-Coriolis sidewall-attached mode slowly precessing around the rim of the container. This slow wall mode is similar to a rapidly-rotating convection mode found in non-metals. Non-intuitively, then, the effect of the magnetic field is to dampen the inertial aspects of the the liquid metal flow while allowing for large-scale slow modes that can develop in rapidly rotating systems. Overall, our experiments show that the convection driven MC wave modes that can develop in liquid metals are remarkably different from the canonical flows that develop in the fluids used in present day dynamo models.",

            "abstract": "The record-setting drought in the state of California was further aggravated by extreme low precipitation in the winter of 2013-2014 and the associated low snow cover over the Sierra Nevada. Attribution work on the decline in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover (Rupp et al. 2013) has shown that the decrease was likely the result of combined natural and anthropogenic forcing but not by natural forcing alone. Regional model superensemble simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) with the Hadley Regional Climate Model (HadRM3P) shows the decline as a statistically-significant, linear trend for the Western US from 1961 to 2010. The present work focuses on attribution of these events by employing a superensemble of regional climate model simulations from the climateprediction.net (CPDN) experiment, which allows for robust statistical analysis of extreme events. Specifically, we compare the decade of the 2000s and the 1960s, which had different levels of heat-trapping gases and forcing from natural variability, among other factors. A linear regression of wet days and number of days with precipitation above 40 mm shows a strong drying pattern for the winter months of December, January, February, March (DJFM), especially for northern California and the Sierra Nevada. A strong warming pattern is also present during the winter months, with the minimum temperatures outpacing maximum temperatures for the Pacific Northwest. We will also investigate how simulations for DJFM 2013-2014, using only natural forcing provided CMIP5 HistoricalNat boundary conditions, compare against the model simulations using observations as boundary conditions. Results from this experiment also highlight the influence of increasing number of simulations on confidence intervals, which significantly reduces the uncertainty of both the change in magnitude of a given event and its corresponding return period.\nRupp, David E., Philip W.

            "abstract": "Currently, some of the most promising efforts to address climate change are taking place at the scale of cities and municipalities. Large urban areas host an active population of organizations working to influence local environmental policies more rigorous than those at the state and national level. The composition of these groups is broadening as impacts of climate change are being recognized as relevant to more sectors within urban systems, from health centers to community leaders, leading more organizations to consider how they can raise awareness and gain support for their needs. The National Geographic Society, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Climate and Urban Systems Partnership (CUSP), has convened a pilot “community of practice” (CoP) consisting of organizations working at the local level in Washington, DC to communicate with audiences, from the general public to local government agencies, about ways that climate change is predicted to affect the city and what can be done about it.\nThe purpose of the CoP was initially to help these groups coordinate their activities, share knowledge and resources, and to create a platform for ongoing collaborative learning. While the CoP is still evolving, it is clear that it has potential to provide even deeper and more meaningful support to these groups’ efforts. Developing effective messaging about climate change across an urban system depends on the valuable insight these groups have into their audience’s interests, beliefs, and knowledge, but it also requires a set of competencies that few members of the CoP hold. As conveners of the CoP, we have identified and prioritized those competencies and are developing a process for training CoP members to apply their expertise to implement empirically-based best practices in climate change messaging, public communication, and integration of data and visualizations. The process of training the group has the potential to both create a CoP that becomes a trusted resource for climate messaging activities in DC and an enduring network of professionals who identify participating in the group’s ongoing work as essential to their own professional development",

During this campaign, smoke originating from agricultural fires in the Mississippi River Valley contributed up to 80% of the aerosol optical depths (AODs) and thus complicated estimation of ground-level PM2.5 from AOD. Comparison with measurements of fresh agricultural fires during both DISCOVER-AQ and SEAC4RS showed that these lofted layers were considerably aged with higher single scattering albedos and water-uptake potential (f(RH)). This more hygroscopic aged smoke (with f(RH)’s of 1.5) created higher AODs than would be obtained if fresh smoke (f(RH) on the order of 1.1) had been present. In addition, profiling done as part of SEAC4RS throughout the Southeast will be compared to ground-based PM2.5 allowing for determination of background aerosol vertical distributions in the region and the extent of the smoke transport. Historic long-term measurements of AOD (from AERONET) and PM2.5 (from ground-based monitoring sites) will also be addressed to determine the frequency of these long-range transport events.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the need to decrease CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been recognized because of the role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is one of the most promising long term solutions for the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. To this end, injection of CO2 into deep geological formations has been proposed and investigated theoretically and experimentally in the last years. The fracture permeability, an important parameter controlling CO2 migration throughout sequestration, affects the amount of mineralization trapping of CO2 which enhances the long-term CO2 storage. A long-term geochemical modeling of subsurface CO2 storage is carried out in a single fracture to investigate its impact on CO2 transport and storage capacity. We model the fracture by considering flow of CO2 between finite plates. CO2 is initially dissolved in the brine and then precipitates during the geochemical reactions between H2O-CO2 and minerals. We study the physics and the critical time of blockage for a fracture to interpret the results. We employ direct numerical simulation tools and algorithms to simulate incompressible flow along with necessary transport equations that capture the kinetics of relevant chemical reactions. The numerical model is based on a finite difference method using a sequential non-iterative approach. It is found that mineral precipitation has an important effect on reservoir porosity and permeability. The fracture ceases to be a fluid channel because of the precipitation of minerals.",

To support risk management the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service and Economic Research Service are tasked with providing area statistics and production estimates. A Decision Support Tool (DST) is being developed to provide real-time estimates of rice extent and indicators of condition. The DST is largely driven by multi-scale Earth Observations including Landsat and MODIS that provide daily and 8-day indices that are sensitive to rice growth status and management practices. A multitemporal Classification And Regression Tree approach ingests multiscale imagery in real time to provide rice crop metrics. We hindcast the archives of Landsat (1984-2014) and MODIS (2002-2014) for California and achieve >80% accuracy by June and >95% accuracy by end of July as compared to the Crop Data Layer and county statistics. Outcomes are similar for the Midsouth rice region. The DST was utilized to assess the impact of current drought in California on rice. We predicted a 20% reduction in rice area based on our near time rice extent projections and assuming yields similar to 2013 and recent USDA average farm price estimates, 2014 production losses associated with the drought will amount to approximately $175 million.

            "abstract": "The Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) of northwestern Canada preserves some of Earth’s oldest granitic crust (>4.03 Ga) and thereby contains important insight into crust forming processes on the early Earth. In general, rocks of the AGC have undergone a complex history of metamorphism and deformation (Archean and Paleoproterozoic)1,2, and, as a consequence, the zircons retain a complex history including inheritance, magmatic and metamorphic overgrowths, recrystallization, and multi-stage Pb loss. Previously published Hf isotopic data on zircons show within sample variability in excess of analytical uncertainty2,3,4. In order to assess the meaning and significance of this apparent isotopic variability, we are using two different methods to obtain coupled U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data in zircon from a suite of rocks ranging in age from ca. > 3.9 Ga to 3.3 Ga. To obtain these data from the same volume of zircon, our approach involves: 1) split stream LA-ICPMS for U-Pb and Lu-Hf; 2) mechanical isolation of zircon domains for chemical abrasion and ID-TIMS U-Pb analyses and solution ICPMS for Lu-Hf recovered from U-Pb ion exchange chromatography. The deconvolution of complex histories requires this integrated approach and permits us to take advantage of both high spatial resolution and highest precision measurements to ultimately decipher the age and isotopic composition of discrete domains of multi-phase zircon.\nWe demonstrate our approach with both relatively simple and complex grain populations in an attempt to understand within and between grain heterogeneity. The samples with the simplest zircon systematics have increasingly negative εHf from oldest to youngest, consistent with involvement of 4.0 Ga or older crust in later generations; also, none of our samples have been derived solely from strongly depleted sources. The presence of intra-zircon variability within samples from the AGC reflects a complex history of magmatic additions requiring melting/assimilation of older rocks consistent with the inherited zircon record (4.2-4.06 Ga)1,5.\n[1]Bowring and Williams (1999).

The processes that influence the distribution of atmospheric constituents in the UTLS occur on small vertical scales that are a challenge for models to reliably capture. As a consequence, models typically underestimate the mean age of air in the lowermost stratosphere, reflecting excessive vertical transport and/or mixing in the region. Using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model, we quantify the potential impact of discrepancies in vertical transport in the UTLS on inferred sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2. Comparisons of the modeled CO2 and O3 in the polar UTLS with data from the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaign show that the model overestimates CO2 and underestimates O3 in the region. Using the observed CO2/O3 correlations in the UTLS, we correct the modeled CO2 in the Arctic UTLS (primarily between the 320 K and 360 K isentropic surfaces) and quantify the impact of the CO2 correction on the flux estimates using the GEOS-Chem data assimilation system together with XCO2 data from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). As a result of isentropic transport, the correction is transported down into the subtropical troposphere, where it impacts the regional flux estimates. Our results suggest that discrepancies in mixing in the UTLS could bias the latitudinal distribution of the inferred CO2 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane and tropical storm activity in Central America has consistently caused over the past decades thousands of casualties, significant population displacement, and substantial property and infrastructure losses. As a component to estimate future potential losses, we present a new regional probabilistic hurricane hazard model for Central America. Currently, there are very few openly available hurricane hazard models for Central America. This resultant hazard model would be used in conjunction with exposure and vulnerability components as part of a World Bank project to create country disaster risk profiles that will assist to improve risk estimation and provide decision makers with better tools to quantify disaster risk.\nThis paper describes the hazard model methodology which involves the development of a wind field model that simulates the gust speeds at terrain height at a fine resolution. The HURDAT dataset has been used in this study to create synthetic events that assess average hurricane landfall angles and their variability at each location. The hazard model also then estimates the average track angle at multiple geographical locations in order to provide a realistic range of possible hurricane paths that will be used for risk analyses in all the Central-American countries. This probabilistic hurricane hazard model is then also useful for relating synthetic wind estimates to loss and damage data to develop and calibrate existing empirical building vulnerability curves. To assess the accuracy and applicability, modeled results are evaluated against historical events, their tracks and wind fields. Deeper analyses of results are also presented with a special reference to Guatemala.\nThe findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the authors.

            "abstract": "Every year floods cause much damage around the world. It is important to understand historical changes in major floods to help inform how flood frequency may change in the future. To date, however, there is very limited evidence of past changes in major-flood magnitude and occurrence (exceeding 25, 50, and 100 year return-period thresholds). Many studies have analyzed annual-maximum flood trends but they have often not differentiated between trends influenced by human catchment alterations and those caused by climatic changes. Here we present the first intercontinental assessment of historical climate-driven trends in major-flood occurrence using many diverse but minimally altered catchments. There is no compelling evidence for consistent increases in major-flood occurrence across this very large domain. Flood occurrence at 1206 gauges increased from 1961 to 2010 but not significantly, driven primarily by European increases. There also were non-significant increases in flood occurrence at 322 gauges from 1931 to 2010, but this time driven primarily by North American increases. Flood occurrence both increased and decreased for different subgroups of gauges (a few were significant changes) differentiated by catchment size, type of climate, flood threshold, and period of record. Past changes in major-flood occurrence are complex and future changes will be likewise. International hydrologic networks containing minimally altered catchments will play a key role in understanding these complexities for both historical and future climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Information on ice-sheet surface accumulation, A(t), is needed for studies of mass balance, polar climate variability, ice-sheet evolution, and dynamics. This paper describes a new method for deriving time series of A(t) variations, δA(t), on a monthly basis from continuous altimeter measurements. Changes in ice-sheet thickness and surface elevation are driven by a combination of δA(t), changes in the rates of firn compaction, and the rates of dynamic ice thickening or thinning (dHd/dt). Relevant time scales range from monthly fluctuations in δA(t) and surface temperature, Ts(t), to decadal to millennial scales of dynamic changes in ice flow. Our concept is based on the widely differing time-scales of principal processes, e.g. T> 5 years for dynamic changes and t = year/12 for δA(t) so that T >> t. An important aspect is our use of a baseline of ICESat-1 and ERS-1/ERS-2 altimeter measurements to obtain the multi-year (e.g. 5 to 17 years) dHd/dt of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. We calculate changes in surface elevations caused by variations in the rate of firn compaction driven by both δA(t) and Ts(t) to adjust the altimeter-observed height changes, dH/dt, in order to derive dHd/dt over time periods of ≥ 5 years. Although monthly values of both δA(t) and Ts(t) are used, the derived dHd/dt is dependent only on the average change in δA(t) over the period and not on the higher-frequency monthly δA(t). On a monthly basis, the total accumulation-driven height change, dHaCA/dt, is a sum of the direct-height change, dHa/dt, and the change in firn compaction, dCA/dt, both caused by δA(t). dHa/dt is equal to δA(t)/ρs, where ρs is relative density of surface snow (typically 0.3) and δA(t) is w.e. Model simulations of dHaCA/dt driven by monthly δA(t) from ERA-interim re-analyses show that altimeter-observable dHaCA/dt and the desired dHa/dt = δA(t)/ρs are closely related. The relationship is better at colder locations such as the South Pole (Tm = -47̊C), for which the slope of dHaCA/dt versus dHa/dt is 0.989 and the correlation is 0.995 for 1982 to 2009, but it is also very good in warmer locations such as Law Dome (Tm = -17̊C), for which the slope is 0.816 and the correlation is 0.952. The relevant difference at South Pole is the slower response time of the firn compaction to perturbations.",

            "abstract": "This contribution presents new integral-based estimators for evaluation of gravitational gradients at satellite altitudes from ground values of the disturbing gravitational potential derived from satellite sea surface altimetry. The estimators are based on surface integral equations of Green’s type. The respective tensor-valued Green’s function is derived in both spectral and spatial forms and its spatio-spectral properties are studied and discussed. Computer implementation of the new apparatus is based on truncated spherical integration due to spatially limited altimetry data with truncation errors evaluated by a spherical harmonic series from available global gravitational models. The algorithm was validated using synthetic data in closed-loop tests which were also used for propagation of data errors through spatially restricted surface integration. Moreover, the effect of omission and commission errors associated with global gravitational models used for evaluation of truncation errors were also estimated. These studies prove that spatially restricted altimetry data with the 10 cm white noise and truncation errors derived from GRACE-based global gravitational models result in estimation of satellite gravitational gradients with the 1 mE level accuracy. The new estimators were applied for validation of actual satellite gravitational gradients measured by the GOCE gradiometer. As input sea surface altimetry data DTU10MSS (corrected by mean dynamic ocean topography) and the GRACE-based global gravitational model GGM05S were used. Gravitational gradients estimated by the new apparatus were compared with GOCE observations and respective differences were spectrally analyzed. Results of the analyses show a large potential of the new algorithms in connection with available altimetry data for validation and calibration of satellite gravitational gradients.",

            "abstract": "Paleoceanographic and ecologic studies suggest that gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway (CAS) as the Isthmus of Panama rose between ~13 to 2 Ma caused a stepwise shutdown of deep, intermediate, and shallow Pacific water flow through the seaway into the Caribbean. This diminishing communication is thought to have significantly influenced surface currents, ocean circulation at depth, and ultimately regional and global climate. However, new studies of Panama’s volcanic/tectonic history suggest the isthmus rose much earlier than previous estimates, calling into question many of our accepted implications for this gateway event under the ‘Panama Hypothesis,’ including strengthened thermohaline circulation, North Atlantic Deep Water production, increased North Atlantic temperature, and ties to Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Despite considerable research, few paleoceanographic studies have directly examined the possibility of earlier events in the closure history of the CAS and thus the precise linkages and timing are not well defined.\nTo investigate early restricted CAS flow related to sill formation or pulsed exhumation events, we examine two sets of independent paleoceanographic reconstructions from Ocean Drilling Program sediment cores from the region. We assess the presence of Pacific waters within the Caribbean over the last 30 Ma via the Nd-isotopic composition of fish teeth from several Caribbean sites; these records point to sustained transport of Pacific waters into the Caribbean from at least 30 to 10 Ma. Further, alkenone-derived sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) indicate the presence of consistently warm (>27 °C) waters in the EEP from ~12 to ~5 Ma, after which time SSTs at sites within the modern cold tongue begin to cool appreciably. The SST data imply that the EEP cold tongue, which some studies suggest is linked in part to the rise of the Panamanian isthmus, did not develop until after 5 Ma. Collectively, these paleoceanographic reconstructions and model outputs indicate notable communication of water between the Pacific and the Caribbean until at least 10 Ma and provide improved understanding of the sequence of events associated with the rise of the Isthmus of Panama and closure of the CAS.",

            "abstract": "In light of predicted climate change, high-resolution paleoclimate records are essential to accurately contextualize future warming. The Arctic region in particular is currently lacking terrestrial paleoclimate reconstructions that extend beyond the last glacial period. A sediment core from Lake El’gygytgyn (Russia) provides a continuous record of Arctic climate spanning the past 3.6 Ma. Here we utilize molecular organic proxies to create millennial-scale paleotemperature reconstructions through Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 19 and 31, two interglacial periods considered to be good analogs for the current interglacial and future climate change, respectively. MIS 31 has been previously identified a “super interglacial” period at Lake El’gygytgyn whereas MIS 19 provides an analog for the current MIS 1 interglacial, without anthropogenic influences, due to similar orbital forcing. Our paleotemperature reconstructions, based on the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) paleothermometer, demonstrate that Lake El’gygytgyn sediments capture glacial-interglacial climate variability noted in global climate records (Figure 1) and suggests close ties to Antarctic climate. We find that MIS 31 was the warmest interglacial period of the past ~ 1 Ma, in agreement with pollen-derived temperature estimates. Our cm-scale brGDGT temperature reconstruction, with an average time step of <500 years, to the best of our knowledge provides the highest resolution Arctic paleoclimate record of this “super interglacial” and reveals variability hitherto unobserved by lower resolution marine records. Our results are placed in context of paleotemperature reconstructions over the period of MIS 19-35. Remarkably, multiple proxies display a number of abrupt and short-lived temperature fluctuations of ca. 3-5°C occurring within MIS 19 and 31, as well as within other previous interglacials at Lake El’gygytgyn. We examine our results in the context of other biomarker records, existing paleolimnological data, and modeling studies of Lake El’gygytgyn, as well as other high latitude records, to better understand the nature of interglacial climate during these two important intervals in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the temporal evolution of runoff source areas represents a grand challenge in hydrology. While catchment structural characteristics, including topography and soils, are known to drive hydrologic connectivity of upland areas to the riparian and stream system, the effects of vegetation on the connectedness of water flow pathways are less well identified. The combination of lateral water redistribution by topographically driven drainage and water uptake by vegetation leads to shifting patterns of catchment storage. Hydrologic response exhibits threshold behavior with the transition from unsaturated to saturated subsurface conditions. This threshold nature in conjunction with changing storage patterns leads to effective runoff sources areas that are dynamic through time. To investigate these dynamics, we developed and applied a parsimonious but spatially distributed watershed modeling framework and used it to quantify the effects of vegetation on the temporal evolution of catchment connectivity over two years in a snow-dominated watershed in central Montana. Spatially distributed catchment water inputs were derived from two NRCS SNOTEL sites nearby with a simple temperature based snowmelt model. Evapotranspiration was measured at an eddy-covariance tower in the watershed and disaggregated based on vegetation structure. We used this modeling framework to further explore the effects of different vegetation pattern scenarios on the temporal expansion and cessation of catchment connectivity. With this work we seek to improve our understanding of how the intersection of physical (topography) and biological (vegetation) factors mediates hydrologic connectivity in headwater catchments.",

The climatology uses a simple two-category framework of precipitation organization based on instantaneous precipitating feature size: mesoscale precipitation features (MPF) and isolated precipitation. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: First, what are the discharge response characteristics to seasonal changes in precipitation in different watersheds across North Carolina, from the mountains to the coastal plain? Second, how does precipitation organization, whether long-lasting mesoscale systems or short duration isolated convection, affect these watershed characteristics? This analysis defines five watersheds in North Carolina based on five North Carolina river basins using GIS watershed delineation techniques. It was found that lag time between maximum precipitation and maximum discharge increased from 1-2 days in the western mountainous watersheds to 7-8 days in the eastern coastal plain watersheds. The steeper and more impervious western watersheds promoted more rapid discharge of precipitation, while the flat and swampy eastern watersheds drained more slowly. Precipitation originating from MPF events produced stronger precipitation-discharge correlations in the winter and fall than in the summer and spring, while most isolated precipitation-discharge correlations were relatively weak. Overall, it was found that MPF precipitation is the main mode of precipitation organization that drives daily watershed discharge, and differences in watershed precipitation-discharge lag times can be best explained by the watershed characteristics rather than differences in precipitation organization.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Phobos holds many keys for understanding its formation and evolution as well as the history and dynamics of the Mars-Phobos system. Visible to near infrared (VNIR) observations suggests that Phobos’ surface is compositionally heterogeneous with ‘redder’ and ‘bluer’ units that both appear to be anhydrous in nature. Lunar highland spectra have been identified as spectral analogues for the ‘redder’ and ‘bluer’ units while thermally metamorphosed CI/CM chondrites, lab-heated carbonaceous chondrites and highly space weathered mafic mineral assemblages have been identified as the best analogues for the ‘bluer’ surface units. Additionally, thermal infrared emissivity spectra indicate that if Phobos’ surface is optically mature it may be rich in feldspar, which is consistent with VNIR observations of Phobos’ surface being spectrally similar to lunar highland spectra.\nWhile remote observations provide key insights into the composition and evolution of planetary surfaces, a fundamentally important component to any remote compositional analysis of planetary surfaces is laboratory measurements of well-characterized samples measured under the appropriate environmental conditions. The vacuum environment of airless bodies creates a steep thermal gradient in the upper hundreds of microns of regolith. Lab studies of particulate rocks and minerals as well as selected lunar soils under vacuum and lunar-like conditions have identified significant effects of this thermal gradient on thermal infrared (TIR) spectral measurements. However recent lab measurements of carbonaceous chondrites demonstrated that simulated asteroid conditions do not affect the resulting emissivity spectra to the degree observed in lunar soils and is highly dependent on composition. Such lab studies demonstrate the high sensitivity of TIR emissivity spectra to environmental conditions under which they are measured and indicate that the near surface environment of all airless bodies do not spectrally behave in similar ways. An initial set of TIR emissivity measurements of Phobos analogue materials will be made in the Simulated Lunar Environment chamber at the University of Oxford. These lab measurements will be characterized in an effort better understand how to interpret current and future TIR observations of Phobos.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in atmospheric measurements from satellites and other remote sensing platforms comes from several sources. Users are familiar with concepts of accuracy and precision for physical measurements made using instrumentation, but retrieval algorithms also frequently require statistical information since measurements alone may not completely determine the parameter of interest. This statistical information has uncertainty associated with it as well, and it often contributes a sizeable fraction to the total uncertainty. The precise combination of physical and statistical information in remotely sensed data can vary with season, latitude, altitude, and conditions of measurement. While this picture is complex, it is important to clearly define the overall uncertainty for users without oversimplifying so they can interpret the data correctly. Assessment of trends, quantification of radiative forcing and chemical budgets, and comparisons of models with satellite observations all benefit from having adequate uncertainty information. But even today, terminology and interpretation of these uncertainties is a hot topic of discussion among experts. Based on our experience producing a 44 year-long dataset of total ozone and ozone profiles, we discuss our ideas for describing uncertainty in atmospheric datasets for global change research. Assumptions about the atmosphere used in retrievals can also be provided with exact information detailing how the final product depends on these assumptions. As a practical example, we discuss our modifications to the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) algorithm in Version 9 to provide robust uncertainties for each measurement and supply as much useful information to users as possible. Finally, we describe how uncertainties in individual measurements combine when the data are aggregated in time and space.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone (GSZ) is located along the left-lateral strike slip boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates in central Guatemala. This highly tectonized geotectonic unit contains a variety of metamorphic complexes thrusted north and south of the plate boundary. The northern section of the GSZ consists of (a) a serpentinite-matrix mélange that contains high-pressure–low-temperature (HP–LT) rocks, (b) a continental high-grade felsic belt that includes relics of eclogite facies, (c) a low-grade disrupted volcano-sedimentary sequence, and (d) large ultramafic bodies associated with fragments of Cretaceous island arc sequences. Currently, this section of the GSZ is interpreted as the result of subduction-exhumation-collision and obduction in a back-arc basin.\nHowever, our new petrochronological study challenges this simple interpretation because multiple metamorphic ages (Sm–Nd, U–Pb and Ar–Ar) and different PT paths are recorded in the HP–LT rocks. Eclogites within the mélange display a polymetamorphic history consisting of a metamorphic peak at 130–125 Ma and ~60 km depth, an early exhumation to the middle section of a subduction channel (~35 km) at 117–116 Ma, a subsequent metamorphic event at amphibolite facies and a final exhumation at ~85 Ma. In contrast, continental eclogites show a younger metamorphic peak of 77–75 Ma at ~80 km depth, and exhumation ages of ~76–66 Ma. Synchronous jadeitite and mica rocks within the mélange yielded crystallization and exhumation ages of ~ 95 Ma and ~77–53 Ma, respectively.\nThese PTt paths reveal a complex history that can be linked to multiple tectonic events during subduction. Ages and PT conditions of eclogites within the mélange suggest an early coupling and storage of eclogitic slices in the subduction channel. Their subsequent record at lower P and higher T may indicate the initiation of continental crust subduction which will have increased the subduction thermal gradient. Continuous subduction and fluid infiltration into the mantle wedge is indicated by the occurrence of jadeitites and mica rocks within the serpentinite mélange. Finally, the metamorphic peak of continental eclogites may mark the end of subduction and beginning of exhumation of the subduction channel and the subducted continental crust during a major collisional event.",

            "abstract": "Classic approaches to understand sediment transport and channel-hillslope coupling focus on magnitudes of forces at a point location or reach. Yet often overlooked are downstream gradients in forces along a river. Here we show a physical rationale supported by field evidence that downstream spatial gradients in sediment transport capacity affect lateral exchange of material in the form of landslides, bank failures and floodplain deposition. Taking advantage of the strong signals of near-channel deposition and erosion during the record-high 2011 Irene floods in Vermont and 2013 floods in Colorado, USA, we test if these spatial gradients can predict geomorphic response in flood events. Total stream power, an indicator of total sediment transport capacity, was mapped using GIS analysis along the Saxtons River (190 km2) and West Branch of White River (112 km2) in Vermont and Fourmile Creek (20 km2) and an unnamed creek on Mt Sanitas (7 km2) in Boulder, CO. These mountainous streams exhibit reach slopes of 0.5 to > 10%, with less steep reaches interspersed among steeper reaches. Near-channel erosion and deposition were quantified along 52 river km by pre/post satellite imagery, field surveys, and, when available, differencing of pre/post topography measured by aerial LiDAR. Zones of abundant mass wasting inputs—up to 11,000 m3 per km—were generally distinct from zones of abundant floodplain deposition—up to 30,000 m3 per km. Spatial patterns indicate that zones of abundant mass wasting into the channels align approximately with zones of down-flow increasing stream power. These reaches can convey material delivered from upstream plus additional lateral inputs of sediment. Conversely, reaches of abundant lateral flux out of the channel via near-channel deposition occur predominantly where mapped total stream power declines in the down-flow direction. These reaches appear unable to convey material supplied from upstream, which induces lateral deposition. The demonstrated interaction between downstream and lateral fluxes of material provides insight on physical controls on broad-scale geomorphic processes at channel margins as well as the sources and fates of matter transported by rivers, with implications for flood recovery and long-term river management.",

            "abstract": "Leaf waxes (i.e. n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids) and their carbon isotopes (δ13C) are commonly used to track past changes in the carbon cycle or plant ecophysiology. Previous studies indicated that conifer n-alkane concentrations are lower than in angiosperms and that 13C fractionation during n-alkane synthesis (εlipid) is smaller than in angiosperms. These prior studies, however, sampled a limited phylogenetic and geographic subset of conifers, leaving out many important subtropical and Southern Hemisphere groups that were once widespread and common components of fossil assemblages. To expand on previous work, we collected 44 conifer species from the University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley, capturing all extant conifer families and most extant genera. By collecting all specimens at a common site we attempted to minimize the confounding effects of climate, allowing phylogenetic patterns in the δ13C of leaf waxes to be expressed more strongly. We find that Pinaceae, including many North American species used in previous studies, have very low or no n-alkanes. However, other conifer groups have significant concentrations of n-alkanes, especially the Araucariaceae (Norfolk Island pines), Podocarpaceae (common in the Southern Hemisphere), and many species of Cupressaceae (junipers and relatives). Within the Cupressaceae, we find total n-alkane concentrations are high in subfamilies Cupressoideae and Callitroideae, but significantly lower in the early diverging taxodioid lineages (including bald cypress and redwood). Individual n-alkane chain lengths have a weak phylogenetic signal, except for n-C29 alkane, but when combined using average chain length (ACL), a strong phylogenetic signal emerges. The strong phylogenetic signal in ACL reinforces that it is strongly influenced by factors other than climate. An analysis of εlipid indicates a strong phylogenetic signal in which the smallest biosynthetic fractionation occurs in Pinaceae and the largest in Taxaceae (yews and relatives). We are currently exploring potential mechanisms to explain the εlipid patterns. These results have important implications for interpreting n-alkane δ13C values in sedimentary archives, especially outside of North America.",

            "abstract": "Geysers are important subjects for studying processes involved with multi-phase eruptions. As part of a larger field effort, this study applies imaging geodesy and seismology to study eruptive cycles of the Lone Star Geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Lone Star Geyser is an ideal candidate for such study, as it erupts with a nearly regular period of approximately 3 hours. The geyser includes a 5 m diameter cone that rises 2 meters above the sinter terrace, and the entire system can be viewed from a nearby hillside. Fieldwork was accomplished during April 2014. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) were used to image possible surface deformations associated with Lone Star Geyer’s eruption cycles. Additional observations were provided by global positioning system (GPS) measurements and six broad-band seismometers deployed in the immediate vicinity of the geyser. The GBIR and TLS were deployed approximately 65 meters from the sinter cone of the geyser. The GBIR involves a ku-band radar (1.7 cm wavelength) that is sensitive to approximately half-millimeter changes in the line-of-sight distance. Radar images were acquired every minute for 3 or more eruptions per day. Temporally redundant, overlapping interferograms were used to improve the sensitivity and interpolate a minute-wise time series of line-of-sight displacement, and efforts were made to account for possible path-delay effects resulting from water vapor around the geyser cone. Repeat (every minute) high-speed TLS scans were acquired for multiple eruption cycles over the course of two-days. Resulting measurement point spacing on the sinter cone was ~3cm. The TLS point-clouds were geo-referenced using static surveyed reflectors and scanner positions. In addition to measuring ground deformation, filtering and classification of the TLS point cloud was used to construct a mask that allows radar interferometry to exclude non-ground areas (vegetation, snow, sensors). Preliminary results suggest deformations are very small, with possible uplift around the sinter cone of up to 1 cm. Ongoing analysis is examining temporal variations in the seismological data that may correlate with apparent temporal and spatial patterns of surface displacement.",

            "abstract": "New systems for early warning of coastal hazards, and a more accurate assessment of vulnerability of coastal regions and resources are needed to safely occupy, use, and protect the ecosystem services of our coastal landscapes and waters. The US Geological Survey and their Federal, State, Local, Non-government, and Academic partners have initiated a suite of projects to improve coastal resilience in the Northeast through better scientific understanding, modeling, and decision support. Improving coastal resilience requires understanding the complex interactions of several components of the coastal environment and their combined response to disturbances such as sea level rise, more powerful storms, development pressure, pollution, and resource extraction. New USGS research is focused on improving our capacity to predict coastal hazards and define the thresholds of resilience required for a range of sea-level rise and storm-surge scenarios. Predictive models of earth processes and ecological responses are being refined, thus improving early warning of disturbance in specific coastal sub-regions, and refining maps of the relative vulnerabilities of coastal features and communities from Virginia to Maine. Better understanding of sand sources and transport for beach replenishment and protective berms, mapping contaminant sources and release pathways, defining the factors controlling marsh accretion or migration, linking coastal and watershed hydrology, and networking new and existing tide, surge, and wave monitoring for real-time tracking of water hazards represent the multiple science products being combined to understand and protect coastal ecosystems, communities, and commerce. The integrated science underway is clarifying the thresholds of tolerance for multiple disturbance vectors in the coastal environment, and informing long-term, science-based strategies that will support “whole system” resilience into the future. A new multi-agency effort to establish metrics for measuring change in coastal resilience will build off this integrated science to help guide future coastal science in the most productive directions.",

This paper uses new DZ data from Lower Cretaceous strata of the Alberta foreland basin, and Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata of the Gulf of Mexico passive margin, to reconstruct paleodrainage and sediment routing, and illustrate significance to giant hydrocarbon systems. DZ populations from the Lower Cretaceous Mannville Group of Alberta and Saskatchewan infer a continental-scale river system that routed sediment from the eastern 2/3rds of North America to the Boreal Sea. Aptian McMurray Formation fluvial sands were derived from a drainage sourced in the Appalachians that was similar in scale to the modern Amazon. Albian fluvial sandstones of the Clearwater and Grand Rapids Formations were derived from the same Appalachian-sourced drainage area, which had expanded to include tributaries from the Cordilleran arc of the northwest US and southwest Canada. DZ populations from the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain complement this view, showing that only the southern US and Appalachian-Ouachita cordillera was integrated with the Gulf through the Late Cretaceous. However, by the Paleocene, drainage from the US Western Cordillera to the Appalachians had been routed to the Gulf of Mexico, establishing the template for sediment routing that persists today. The paleodrainage reorganization and changes in sediment routing described above played key roles in establishment of the Alberta oil sands and Gulf of Mexico as giant petroleum provinces. Early Cretaceous routing of a continental-scale fluvial system to the Alberta foreland provided large and contiguous fluvial point-bar sand bodies that became economically viable reservoirs, whereas mid- to late Cretaceous drainage reorganization routed greatly increased sediment loads to the Gulf of Mexico, which loaded the shelf, matured source rocks, and drove the gravitational and salt tectonics that helped establish the working hydrocarbon systems extant today.",

            "abstract": "Experiments to determine the H storage capacity of nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) can be used to place strong constraints on the degree of hydration required to initiate volatile fluxed melting in the mantle. Moreover, accurate measurements of H in NAMs from mantle xenoliths may be used to constrain the rheological properties of the source region. However, accurate measurements of H concentrations using infrared and ion beam techniques require mineral specific calibrations. Standardless measurements of H using elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) in some cases have provided valuable verification of calibrations for other techniques, but so far have had limited application to experimental samples owing to sample size and analytical background. Results of recent measurements of H in garnet, pyroxene and feldspar will be used to illustrate the potential of the technique. Some of the results we will present include the following:\n1) Forsterites grown at 2 and 3 GPa in the MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system exhibit low frequency absorption bands in the OH stretching region between 3300 and 3400 cm-1, but very limited absorption at higher frequencies where the strongest absorption bands are usually seen for Al-free olivine. Analyses of H in these samples by ERDA will be used to develop a tentative site-specific molar absorption coefficient for the low frequency OH absorption band.\n2) ERDA measurements of H in silicate glass standards verify previous determinations by Karl Fischer titration and FTIR spectroscopy, validating the ERDA technique. Samples of these rhyolitic glasses are available on request for use as analytical standards, and come with a compendium of analyses that have been used to characterize major and minor elemental composition and H content.\n3) ERDA measurements of three homogeneous grossular garnets from East Africa show an excellent correlation (r2 = 1) with absorbance in the O-H stretching region and indicate an integral molar absorption coefficient significantly higher than that determined by Rossman and Aines (1991) based on reduction of a global data set on grossulars and hydrogrossulars with 0.2-13 wt% H2O. These new results can be reconciled well with a model for matrix effects in SIMS analysis of H in NAMs presented elsewhere at this meeting (Mosenfelder and Rossman).",

            "abstract": "Lena Trough in the Arctic ocean is the oblique spreading continuation of Gakkel Ridge through the Fram Strait (eg Snow et al. 2011). Extreme trace element and isotopic compositions seen in Lena Trough basalt appear to be the enriched end member dominating the geochemistry of the Western Volcanic Zone of the Western Gakkel Ridge as traced by Pb isotopes, K2O/TiO2, Ba/Nb and other isotopic, major and trace element indicators of mixing (Nauret et al., 2011). This is in contrast to neighboring Gakkel Ridge which has been spreading for 50-60 million years. Basalts from Lena Trough also show a pure MORB noble gas signature (Nauret et al., 2010) and peridotites show no evidence of ancient components in their Os isotopes (Lassiter, et al., in press). The major and trace element compositions of the basalts, however are very distinct from MORB, being far more potassic than all but a single locality on the SW Indian Ridge.\nWe determined H2O and trace element composiitions of a suite of 17 basalt glasses from the Central Lena Trough (CLT) and the Gakkel Western Volcanic Zone, including many of those previously analyzed by Nauret et al. (2012). The Western Gakkel glasses have high H2O/Ce for MORB (>300) suggesting a water rich source consistent with the idea that the northernmost Atlantic mantle is enriched in water (Michael et al., 1995). They are within the range of Eastern Gakkel host glasses determined by Wanless et al, 2013. The Lena Trough (CLT) glasses are very rich in water for MORB (>1% H2O) and are among the highest H2O/Ce (>400) ever measured in MORB aside from melt inclusions in olivine. Mantle melting dynamics and melt evolution cannot account for the H2O/Ce variations in MORB, as these elements have similar behavior during melting and crustal evolution. Interestingly, the H2O/K2O ratios in the basalts are only around 1. This is because the K2O levels in the CLT glasses are very high as well relative to REE. The absolutely linear relationship between H2O and K2O/TiO2 in Lena and Gakkel basalts shows that water systematics in these rocks are completely governed by source composition, with little or no modification by mantle melting dynamics or crystal fractionation. The geochemical influence of the WVZ enriched mantle source declines with distance from Lena Trough along Gakkel Ridge.",

            "abstract": "While the source of the fast solar wind is well understood to be linked to coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind has remained elusive. A distinguishing characteristic of the slow solar wind is the high variability of the plasma parameters, such as magnetic field, velocity, density, composition, and charge state. Many previous studies of the slow solar wind have examined trends in the composition and charge states over long time scales and using data with comparatively low temporal resolution. In this study, we take advantage of high time resolution (12 min) measurements of the charge-state abundances recently reprocessed by the ACE SWICS science team to probe the timescales of solar wind variability of coherent structures at relatively small scales (<2000 Mm, or ~ 90 minutes at slow wind speeds). We use an interval of slow solar wind containing quasi pressure-balanced, periodic number density structures previously studied by Kepko et al and shown to be important in solar wind-magnetospheric coupling. The combination of high temporal resolution composition measurements and the clearly identified boundaries of the periodic structures allows us to probe the elemental slow solar wind flux tubes/structures. We use this train of 2000Mm periodic density structures as tracers of solar wind origin and/or acceleration. We find that each 2000 Mm parcel of slow solar wind, though its speed is steady, exhibits the complete range of charge state and composition variations expected for the entire range of slow solar wind, in a repeated sequence. Each parcel cycles through three states: 1) 'normal' slow wind, 2) compositionally slow wind with very high density, and 3) compositionally fast but typical slow solar wind density. We conclude by suggesting these structures form elemental building blocks of the slow solar wind, and discuss whether it is necessary to decouple separately the process(es) responsible for the release and acceleration.",

            "abstract": "This project aims to understand whether the foreclosure crisis of 2007-2010 led to change in yard management with consequences for property and neighborhood land cover. By triangulating across analyses that vary in spatial and temporal resolution, this study examines whether foreclosure has resulted in changes in household and neighborhood vegetation structure. One common hypothesis is that the of financial distress is a reduction in lawn management (mowing, irrigating, and fertilizing ) due to economic constraint, vacancy or abandonment. However, changes in these practices differ across space as they are mediated by individual idiosyncrasies as well as complex social norms encoded in formal and informal institutions. The aim of our broader research project is to gain understanding of how foreclosure changes yard management within the context of these institutions. This poster presents preliminary results of analyses that aim to understand the relationship between foreclosure and land cover change in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona. We synthesize foreclosure data with other social data sources focused on demographics, property characteristics, and vacancy to quantify both general and spatially dependent signatures of foreclosure in remotely-sensed NDVI data from MODIS and LANDSAT. Through results from multiple sources of data, we aim to isolate and describe signals that can be correlated with housing distress and foreclosure-induced vacancy. Arizona is analytically advantageous as area with an arid climate where the vegetation changes resulting from cessation of lawn maintenance are often dramatic and clearly observable.\nOur preliminary analysis indicates that there are specific NDVI signatures reflecting differing landscape-maintenance responses to foreclosure, supporting our central thesis that foreclosure influences land cover. These results provide a foundation upon which we will engage in both detailed investigation of the environmental effects of this phenomenon, as well as the social drivers that have result in the dramatic differences in behavior across space. The broader value of this project is to understand the short and long-term influences of foreclosure over human-environment relationships in urban and suburban developments.",

            "abstract": "Paleoceanographic studies have used Nd isotope ratios to characterize paleo-ocean deep-water mass distributions. The Southern Ocean has nearly homogeneous εNd that reflects the relative inputs from the north Atlantic and north Pacific, offering the possibility to quantify the AMOC strength through time. However, obtaining an εNd record from the Southern Ocean is a challenge because carbonates are poorly preserved there, hindering stratigraphic control and generally precluding use of this important substrate. Alternatively, studies of deep-sea corals and ferromanganese crusts provide snapshots or poor time resolution.\nDeep-sea core E33-22 (55°S, 120°W, 2743m) lies in the polar frontal zone of the Pacific sector, above the carbonate compensation depth, where foraminifera are preserved. It spans ~400,000 years (from the Holocene to MIS11) with a sedimentation rate of ~2.5 cm/kyr. We measured its εNd record with the purpose of determining the best estimate of the export of NADW out of the Atlantic system, which we suggest is our best measure of the vigor of the global thermohaline circulation system. The record shows expected εNd variability during orbital and sub-orbital time-scales, that is lower εNd during warm and higher εNd during cold climate intervals. Moreover, the record passes a critical test in that εNd-values are almost always between South Atlantic and Pacific values. The only exceptions are glacial periods when they coincide with South Atlantic values, indicating extension of Southern Ocean system into the South Atlantic. We conclude that these data represent a conservative record of AMOC variability through the late Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "We will present the foundation for an Coastal Watershed Integrated Plan for three communities in southern New Hampshire. Small communities are often challenged by complex regulatory requirements and limited resources, but are wary of perceived risks in engaging in collaborative projects with other communities. Potential concerns include loss of control, lack of resources to engage in collaboration, technical complexity, and unclear benefits. This project explores a multi-town subwatershed application of integrated planning across jurisdictional boundaries that addresses some of today’s highest priority water quality issues: wastewater treatment plant upgrades for nutrient removal; green infrastructure stormwater management for developing and re-developing areas; and regional monitoring of ecosystem indicators in support of adaptive management to achieve nutrient reduction and other water quality goals in local and downstream waters. The project outcome is a collaboratively-developed inter-municipal integrated plan, and a monitoring framework to support cross jurisdictional planning and assess attainment of water quality management goals.\nThis research project has several primary components: 1) assessment of initial conditions, including both the pollutant load inputs and the political, economic and regulatory status within each community, 2) a pollutant load model for point and non-point sources, 3) multi-criteria evaluation of load reduction alternatives 4) a watershed management plan optimized for each community, and for Subwatersheds combining multiple communities. The final plan will quantify the financial and other benefits/drawbacks to each community for both inter municipal and individual pollution control approaches. We will discuss both the technical and collaborative aspects of the work, with lessons learned regarding science to action, incorporation of social, economic and water quality assessment parameters, and stakeholder/researcher interaction.",

            "abstract": "The lateral expansion and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau causes devastating earthquakes, but is poorly understood. In particular, the links between regional variations in surface motion and the deeper structure of the plateau are still unclear. The plateau may deform either by movement of rigid crustal blocks along large strike-slip faults, by continuous deformation, or by the eastward flow of a channel of viscous crustal rocks. Recently, high resolution seismic imaging, by using seismic data recorded with an array of about 300 seismographs in western Sichuan, China, has identified zones of weak rocks in the deep crust, which is interpreted as crustal flow channels. They also found gradual crust-mantle transition as commonly found in tectonically active area. Here we further identify the upper and lower boundary of the transitional Moho under the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau using the same data set. The upper layer of the boundary is relatively clear and thicker than normal Moho discontinuity. The lower boundary is commonly visible under the Chuan-dian block despite it is normally weaker. Combined with the widely spread low-velocity middle and lower crust and upper-most mantle, this may indicate the geodynamic process in the region of the Eastern Tibetan Plateau is not solely limited in the crust, the whole lithosphere could have involved in the building of the plateau and the collision between the Tibetan Plateau and the Yangzi block.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the patterns of climate variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is key for exploring forced versus unforced variability during the last 1000 years. Tropical Atlantic climate is currently not well resolved during the MCA despite it being an important source of heat and moisture to the climate system today. To fill this data gap, we collected cores from Diploria strigosa corals brought onto the low-lying island of Anegada, British Virgin Islands (18.7˚N, 64.3˚S) during an overwash event and use paired analysis of Sr/Ca and δ18O in the skeletal aragonite to explore climate in the tropical Atlantic at the end of the MCA. The three sub-fossil corals used in this analysis overlap temporally and together span the years 1256-1372 C.E. An assessment of three modern corals from the study site indicates that the most robust features of climate reconstructions using Sr/Ca and δ18O in this species are the seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability. The modern seasonal temperature range is 2.8 degrees Celsius and the similarity between the modern and sub-fossil coral Sr/Ca indicates a similar range during the MCA. Today seasonal salinity changes locally are driven in large part by the migration of a regional salinity front. The modern corals capture the related large seasonal seawater δ18O change, but the sub-fossil corals indicate stable seawater δ18O throughout the year, supporting the idea that this site remained on one side of the salinity front continuously throughout the year. Inter-annual variability in the region is influenced by the cross-equatorial SST gradient, the North Atlantic Oscillation and ENSO. Gridded instrumental SST from the area surrounding Anegada and coral geochemical records from nearby Puerto Rico demonstrate concentrations of variance in specific frequency bands associated with these phenomena. The sub-fossil coral shows no concentration of variance in the modern ENSO frequency band, consistent with reduced ENSO variability found in central Pacific corals growing at the same time.",

Here, we present an improved regional GIA estimate based on GRACE, Envisat/ICESat and GPS measurements. Making use of the different sensitivities of the observations to surface-mass and solid Earth processes, we derive an improved GIA field, using an ensemble of viscoelastic response functions to a disc load forcing. The estimated GIA signal is interpreted for recent ice load changes in West Antarctica in the presence of a low-viscous upper mantle, and evaluated for correcting GRACE and CryoSat-2 measurements when determining present-day ice-mass balance in Antarctica.

A near-explicit chemical model that incorporates detailed measurements obtained during three successive winter field studies in the Uintah Basin, Utah, accurately reproduces the observed buildup of ozone and other photochemically generated species. It also identifies the sources of free radicals that drive this unusual photochemistry, and quantifies their relative contributions. Although sharing the same basic atmospheric chemistry, winter ozone formation differs from its summertime, urban counterpart in its dependence upon the relative concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) precursors. Observed NO­­x mixing ratios in the Uintah basin are lower than is typical of urban areas, while VOC levels are significantly larger. These extreme VOC concentrations allow for nearly optimal efficiency of ozone production from the available NO­x. This analysis will inform the design of mitigation strategies and provide insight into the response of winter ozone to primary air pollutants in other regions, particularly those where oil and gas development is contemplated.",

Existing lumped and steady-state peatland models do not address the development and dynamics of tropical peatlands on the spatial scale of peat domes and time scales of their hydrological response. Our distributed model for tropical peat dynamics, parameterized by measurements in Brunei Darussalam, show that tropical peat domes approach a solution to Poisson's equation as they grow. They approach this stable topography centripetally from the boundaries, so that rates of carbon upake are proportional to the area of the growing interior. Exponentially greater drainage at higher water table leads to strong dependence of peat accumulation or loss on variability of rainfall. Our findings imply a fundamental link between statistics of climate, hydrological properties of peat, metrics of peat landscape topography, and dynamics of carbon sequestration and release.",

            "abstract": "During close flybys of the Galileo spacecraft on the Jovian moon Ganymede, the onboard dust detector discovered that the moon is wrapped in a faint dust cloud. The generation of these dust clouds is a general phenomenon - all airless bodies in the solar system are expected to maintain a dusty, surface bound exosphere due to the continual bombardment by micrometeoroids of interplanetary or even interstellar origin. The Galilean moons Europa and Callisto were found to have dust atmospheres as well. The Cassini dust detector CDA provided some evidence for dust exospheres around Saturn’s ice moons Enceladus and Rhea, and even Pluto and its moon Charon were proposed to have a dust exosphere.\nImpacts of fast interplanetary meteoroids with the satellites’ surfaces produce ejecta particles populate tenuous clouds around the moons. This process is very efficient: a typical interplanetary 10−8 kg micrometeoroid impacting the Earth’ Moon produces a large number of dust particles, whose total mass is about 650 times that of the impactor. The ejecta particles move on bound trajectories, most of which have lower initial speeds than the moon’s escape velocity and re-collide with the surface. Particles ejected fast enough to escape from the moon’s gravity may form tenuous dust rings such as Jupiter’s gossamer rings.\nThe Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX) on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is the first instrument flown in the vicinity of the Moon, which is sufficiently sensitive to observe the lunar dust exosphere. The spacecraft was launched in September 2013 and operated about the Moon on a low altitude orbit between October 2013 and April 2014. The collected data set is larger than any other existing observation of a dust exospheres by orders of magnitudes and deepened our insight into the physics of this important phenomenon.\nThis talk will report about first insights into the dynamical properties of the Lunar dust exosphere based on a in-depth analysis of the LDEX data. We will present for the first time size and speed distributions of the Lunar ejecta as function of their altitude and their sites of origin on the Lunar surface. We will discuss the implications of our findings for the mean field models currently favored to describe the density profile of bound dust exospheres.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a new method of constraining geotherms deep in the crust. Steady-state geotherms are most commonly derived by solving the heat flow differential equation with surface boundary conditions, and do not explicitly involve temperature constraints at depth. In a new method, we incorporate the magnetic Curie depth, derived from the spectral analysis of magnetic anomaly data, as an a posteriori condition into the solution of 1-D heat-flow equation to anchor geotherms at the Curie depth. The Curie depth is derived carefully from the Defractal Spectral Method where the fractal parameter of the field is also derived. The Curie depth constraint allows determination of an additional parameter: the ratio of radiogenic heat production (A) to thermal conductivity (K). When K is observed or can be estimated from geologic knowledge, A can be calculated. Furthermore, it is possible to renormalize the derived A to the value where radiogenic elements exponentially decrease with depth (the value of A at the surface denoted as As). The renormalization permits comparison of surface observed and computed values of As which we use to validate the method. We crosschecked observed values of As and K against the ratio As/K derived from the method in New Hampshire and across the border of Wyoming and Colorado. Excluding high heat-flow locations in these regions as anomalous, the difference between the observed and computed As in all these cases is less than 6-7%. There are also regions where both the derived parameters (As and K) are not within the acceptable range for the given reduced heat flow; these are generally the regions of complex active tectonics or anomalously high or low heat-flow values where the steady-state assumption is not valid. In the mid-oceanic ridge scenario of the Red Sea, the Curie depth corresponds to the Moho and reasonable values of K yield low values of A consistent with the expectation from mafic oceanic crust. There are many areas of the world where high quality aeromagnetic data are available and, therefore, our new method will be useful in constraining lithospheric geotherms and thermal parameters where the steady-state assumption is valid in a regional sense. One could also use the method of constraining geotherms to deep crustal temperature proxies other than the Curie depth.",

            "abstract": "Recent insights from low-gradient streams dominated by fine surficial sediments have shown fluvial organic matter dynamics are governed by coupled hydrologic and biotic controls at event to seasonal timescales. Notwithstanding the importance of shorter timescales, quantity and quality of carbon in stream ecosystems at annual and decadal scales is of increased interest in order to understand if stream ecosystems are net stores or sinks of carbon and how stream carbon behaves under dynamic climate conditions. As part of an ongoing study in a low-gradient, agricultural watershed in the Bluegrass Region of Central Kentucky, an eight year dataset of transported particulate organic carbon (POC) was analyzed for the present study. The objective was to investigate if POC dynamics at multi-year timescales are governed by biotic or hydrologic processes. A statistical analysis using Empirical Mode Decomposition was performed on an 8 year dataset of transported sediment carbon, temperature, and log-transformed flowrates at the watershed outlet. Simulations from a previously validated, process-based, organic carbon model were utilized as further verification of drivers. Results from the analysis suggest that a 4 degree Celsius mean annual temperature shift corresponds to a 63% increase in organic carbon content at the main-stem, third order outlet and a 33% increase in organic carbon content at the main-stem inlet. Model and stable isotope results for the 8 year study support that long-term increases in organic carbon concentration are governed by biotic growth and humification of algal biomass in which increasing annual temperatures promote increased organic carbon production, relative to ecosystem respiration. This result contradicts conventional wisdom, suggesting projected warming trends will shift autotrophic freshwater systems to net heterotrophic, which has significant implications for the role of benthic stream ecosystems under changing climate conditions. Future work is needed to extrapolate the extent of this long-term sequestration at broader spatial scales in order to quantify the role of stream ecosystems in comprehensive carbon budgets and to better understand the net impact on benthic food web dynamics.",

Our new EGS design is based on the concept of a cooling radiator of an internal combustion engine, which we call the Radiator EGS (RAD-EGS). Within a hot sedimentary aquifer, we propose to construct vertically extensive heat exchanger vanes, which consist of rubblized zones of high permeability and which emulate a hydrothermal system. A “crows-foot” lateral drilling pattern at multiple levels is used to form a vertical array that includes S1 and Shmax. To create the radiator, we propose to use propellant fracing. System cool-down is delayed by regional background flow and induced upward flow of the coolant which initially heats the rock. Tomographic Fracture Imaging is used to image and control the permeability field changes. Preliminary heat transfer calculations suggest that the RAD-EGS will allow for commercial electricity production for at least several tens of years.",

The capacity of the critical zone to withstand perturbations, whether driven by climate, land use change, or spread of invasive species, depends on its chemical composition and physical state, which in turn depends on the time evolution of the critical zone. Many temperate and/or tectonically active critical zones contain a relatively short history due to rapid erosion but tectonically quiescent, tropical regions of the planet contain much longer records that need to be understood to cover the full suite of critical zone processes. Southern Hemisphere Critical Zone Observatories such as those proposed for Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa and for portions of the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australa will allow us to extend our temporal understanding of development of spatial heterogeneity in the chemical and physical structure of the critical zone. In addition to considering Earth and climate boundary conditions, these sites incorporate the roles that humans play in driving critical zone processes. For instance along the edges of KNP there is strong evidence of soil erosions due to periurbanization and small-scale agriculture. The existence of KNP provides an important contrast between a “natural” and “human-dominated” landscape that can be exploited to evaluate human impacts on critical zone resources and to develop targeted mitigation strategies. Western Australia has an exploitive economy that relies on large-scale agriculture and mineral extraction, both are intensive users of water which is scarce. The proposed CZO there will be partly focused on managing water under intense economic pressures. It is evident that if funding can be found for these sites they will enhance both critical zone science and practical applied science.",

School-age children are an appropriate target audience for improving Earth Science literacy and attitudes towards scientific practices. However, many teachers charged with geoscience instruction lack awareness of local geological significant examples or the pedagogical ability to integrate place-based examples into their classroom practice. This situation is further complicated because many teachers of Earth science lack a firm background in geoscience course work. Strategies for effective K-12 teacher professional development programs that promote Earth Science literacy by integrating inquiry-based investigations of local and regional geoheritage sites into standards based curriculum were developed and tested with teachers at a rural school on the Hannahville Indian Reservation located in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The workshops initiated long-term partnerships between classroom teachers and geoscience experts. We hypothesize that this model of professional development, where teachers of school-age children are prepared to teach local examples of earth system science, will lead to increased engagement in Earth Science content and increased awareness of local geoscience examples by K-12 students and the public.",

            "abstract": "Soil iron (Fe) serves three broad categorical functions in terrestrial ecosystems: (Role 1) a structural component of the soil matrix and as a cementing bridge in soil aggregates; (Role 2) a sorbent retaining P, C and trace elements; and (Role 3) a host to electron-transfer reactions including acting as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic soil respiration. The dynamics of iron cycling are defined by the timescales required to shift the amount and/or composition of iron participating in these roles. The degree of crystallinity of Fe phases has great significance because it is typically inversely related surface area and by extension adsorptive (Role 2) and electron transfer (Role 3) reactivity. As soils age, Fe phases with higher crystallinity predominate consistent with their overall higher thermodynamic stability. Thus, soil aging leads to a progressive loss of C and P storage capacity. Changes in crystallinity are driven by dissolution/re-precipitation reactions associated with repeated wet/dry or oxic/anoxic cycles, but the process is non-linear. In drier climates, these cycles promote crystalline Fe phases; whereas in more humid climates they can be protected. However, excessive moisture leads to anoxia and fundamental changes in the microbial metabolisms that drive soil respiration. Anoxia leads to redox changes that produce their own pulsing effects on Fe mineral evolution via dissolution/re-precipitation cycles (Role 3), which in turn promote soil structural changes (Role 1) and changes in sorption capacity (Role 2). For instance, we find they can mobilize organic-rich colloids and contribute to the formation of deep C reservoirs. Furthermore our empirical observations suggest the same reactions influence P mobilization or re-partitioning from mineral to organic adsorbents. In this presentation we present evidence of Fe transformations and their implications for terrestrial ecosystems by considering a series of climo- and chrono-sequences in Hawaii.",

            "abstract": "The size and intensity of volcanic eruptions is controlled by a combination of the physical properties of magmas and the conditions of magma ascent. At basaltic volcanoes, where relatively fluid magmas are erupted, sustained explosive eruptions vary widely in style, from Hawaiian fountains erupted 10s to 100s of meter high to large Plinian type events, involving >20 km high eruption plumes. Decompression of magmas leads to volatile saturation and bubble growth, however it remains disputed how the dynamics of shallow ascent and degassing might control this disparate eruptive behaviour, or whether factors such as the initial volatile content exert the primary control on eruption style. A key issue is that the physical conditions of magma ascent, which may significantly impact eruptive dynamics, remain largely unconstrained by observational data. Here we quantify two primary variables - decompression rates and volatile contents - for magmas from three contrasting eruptions of Kīlauea volcano, Hawaii, using microanalysis and modelling of volatile diffusion along small melt tubes or embayments found in olivine crystals carried by the ascending magmas. During ascent decreasing solubility causes dissolved volatiles to diffuse along the embayment towards growing bubbles at the crystal edge. By modelling the diffusion of H2O, CO2 and S we obtain decompression rates, and indirectly ascent velocities, for the rising magma. For Hawaiian style fountaining events we obtain ascent rates of 0.05-0.07 MPa s-1 (~1 m s-1), whereas for a more intense subplinian eruption we obtain a notably faster rate of 0.29 MPa s-1 (>10m s-1). The timescales of melt transport from the storage region during these eruptions varied from around 3 to 40 minutes. We find no link between pre-eruptive volatile contents and eruption intensity, rather our results suggest that the eventual size of sustained explosive basaltic eruptions is likely governed by factors affecting the ascent velocity of melts in the volcanic conduit. The observed decompression rates are consistent with measured discharge rates, and with models predicting greater magma chamber overpressure for larger eruptions. Ascent rates may also further modulate dynamic processes in the volcanic conduit, such as the flow regime and bubble expansion, and consequently eruptive intensity.",

            "abstract": "Over long timescales, microbial populations and communities living in environments where CO2 has been sequestered will adapt to this environmental stress. Their presence and activities can have implications for fluid flow, geochemistry, and the fate of the stored CO2. Because of the interplay between microorganisms and environment, many environmental factors beyond CO2 will also contribute to community structure, including groundwater composition and mineralogy. To determine the long-term effect of CO2 on microbial communities, we analyzed terrestrial CO2 springs as analogues to CO2 sequestration in 3 locations in the United States: the Little Grand Wash Fault (LGW), UT; Bravo Dome (BD), NM; and Klickitat Mineral Spring (KMS), WA. These sites differed in multiple aspects such as depth, salinity, Fe content, and mineralogy. LGW and BD were located in the Colorado Plateau in sedimentary locations while KMS was located within the Columbia River Basalt Group. Sites were compared to non-CO2 springs in similar sedimentary formations for comparison. Microbial communities from sedimentary formations were characterized by low diversity and the dominance of the phylotypes Acinetobacter or Burkholderia compared to non-CO2 springs, suggesting community stress and the selection of specific organisms most resilient to CO2. Communities in the basalt formation were more diverse, though diversity is lower than a non-CO2 community sampled from the same formation (Lavalleur and Colwell 2013). Organisms present at the basalt site contained novel lineages, such as the OP candidate phyla. KMS was also the only site containing Archaea, such as Methanoplanus, suggesting CH4 production at depth. Statistical analyses indicate other factors such as depth and nutrient availability may be other factors that can affect diversity in addition to CO2. Growth of a CO2-tolerant organism from LGW also shows organisms in these environments are viable. Results confirm the presence of microbial communities at high PCO2 and suggest that while CO2 is one environmental stress that can lower diversity, many other environmental factors can also influence survival.\nLavalleur, H.J., Colwell, F.S., 2013.

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the spatial correlation structure of the hydraulic properties in the shallow subsurface is critical for the detailed characterization of near surface aquifers and realistic simulation of flow and transport processes. While the vertical correlation structure is often well constrained by borehole analysis, the lateral correlation structure is often poorly estimated, due to unreliable interpolation between sparsely spaced boreholes and methods that only capture bulk aquifer properties (e.g. pump tests, slug injections). Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) velocity measurements are highly sensitive to changes in water content. In the saturated zone, water content is equivalent to porosity, making ground-penetrating radar a promising tool for extraction of lateral correlation lengths of important hydrologic properties in the near surface. Previous work has shown that there is a simple relationship relating the 2D autocorrelation of a GPR reflection image and the underlying velocity field, allowing for a Monte Carlo inversion strategy to generate sets of parameters describing the autocorrelation of the velocity field, that are consistent with recorded GPR reflection data.\nWe extend this method to the three-dimensional case and apply it to a realistic synthetic GPR dataset. Results obtained from applying this inversion strategy to the 3-D case are similar to the results from previous work done on the 2-D case, and indicate that the inverse solution is non-unique. Multiple combinations of vertical and lateral correlation parameters describing the velocity heterogeneity can generate GPR reflection images with the same 3-D autocorrelations. Despite the non-uniqueness, the aspect ratios of the extracted parameter pairs are the same, indicating that the aspect ratios of the velocity heterogeneity can be reliably extracted. We are currently applying this method to a densely sampled GPR dataset collected at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS). The BHRS is an experimental well field located near Boise, Idaho, consisting of 13 boreholes that provide experimental control.",

Such forecasts would be an official NOAA statement of the expected thermal state of permafrost ALT in Alaska and would require: (1) long-term climate outlooks, (2) a permafrost model, (3) detailed specification of local spatial and vertical controls upon soil thermal state, (4) high-resolution vertical measurements of that thermal state, and (5) demonstration of forecast skill in pilot studies.\nPilot efforts should focus on oil pipelines where the cost can be justified.

In addition, the central Cascadia accretionary prism is characterized by an extremely low wedge taper angle, landward vergent initial thrusting, and a flat midslope terrace between the inner and outer wedges, unlike most other accretionary prisms (e.g. the Nankai Trough, Japan). The Cascadia Open Access Seismic Transect (COAST) lines were shot by R/V Marcus Langseth in July of 2012 off central Washington to image this subduction zone. Two trench-parallel and nine trench-perpendicular lines were collected. In this study, we present detailed seismic interpretation of both time- and depth-migrated stacked profiles, focused on elucidating the deposition and deformation of both pre- and syn-tectonic sediment in the trench and slope. Distribution and timing of sediments and their deformation is used to unravel the evolution of the wedge through time. Initially, interpretation of the time-sections is carried out to support the building of tomographic velocity models to aid in the pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) of selected lines. In turn, we use PSDM velocity models to estimate porosity and pore pressure conditions at the base of the wedge and across the basal plate interface décollement where possible, using established velocity-porosity transforms. Interpretation in this way incorporates both accurate structural relationships and robust porosity models to document wedge development and present-day stress state, in particular regions of potential overpressure. Results shed light on the origin and evolution of the mid-slope terrace and the low taper angle for the forearc wedge. This work may shed light ultimately on the position of the potential updip limit of the seismogenic zone beneath the wedge.",

            "abstract": "A synthesis of the impacts of the Amazon River hydrological changes on the sedimentation process of organic matter (OM) in three different floodplain lakes (Santa Ninha, Maracá, and Comprido lakes) is presented in this study. Today the Santa Ninha and Maracá lakes are directly and permanently connected with the main channel of the Amazon River, in contrast to Comprido Lake, which is indirectly and periodically influenced by the Amazon River due to its high distance from the main channel. All the sedimentary lake records showed a reduced river inflow due to dry climatic conditions during the Early and Middle Holocene followed by a humid Late Holocene with an increased fluvial input. In Santa Ninha and Maraca Lakes the reduced river inflow period was characterized by sediments with a low abundance of smectite (on average ~20 wt. %), a clay mineral mainly transported by the fluvial system, high total organic carbon (TOC) contents and a predominant C3 vegetation input evidenced by the C/N ratio and d13C. During the Late Holocene, a higher smectite abundance (on average ~43 wt. %) and a low TOC content (on average ~1.4 wt. %) pointed to dilution with the riverine lithogenic matter. In this period a enhanced aquatic primary productivity was evidenced by the increased d13C values and by a C/N typical of algae, suggesting an increased lake water level. In Comprido Lake, a sedimentation gap occurred during the Early and Middle Holocene. The humid Late Holocene, after 3,000 cal years BP, was characterized by high TOC values (on average ~9 wt. %) and increasing abundance of planktonic species, like Aulacoseira sp., which reflects the expansion of water bodies. The predominance of C3-vegetation and low smectite content suggest that in Comprido Lake the soil OM input from the local catchment area was predominant during the humid Late Holocene due to its high distance from the Amazon River main stem. Consequently, our study shows that the sedimentation processes of OM in Amazonian floodplain lakes are strongly influenced by variations in the hydrodynamic regime of the Amazon River during the Holocene. However, its impacts on floodplain lakes were different, mainly depending on the distance from the main stem of the Amazon River.",

            "abstract": "We present progress in the development of an Eddy Diffusion / Mass Flux (EDMF) turbulence parameterization, with the goal of improving the representation of the cloudy boundary layer in NCEP's Global Forecast System (GFS), as part of a multi-institution Climate Process Team (CPT). Current GFS versions substantially under-predict cloud amount and cloud radiative impact over much of the globe, leading to large biases in the surface and top of atmosphere energy budgets. As part of the effort to correct these biases, the CPT is developing a new EDMF turbulence scheme for GFS, in which local turbulent mixing is represented by an eddy diffusion term while nonlocal shallow convection is represented by a mass flux term. The sum of both contributions provides the total turbulent flux. Our goal is for this scheme to more skillfully simulate cloud radiative properties without negatively impacting other measures of weather forecast skill.\nOne particular challenge faced by an EDMF parameterization is to be able to handle stratocumulus regimes as well as shallow cumulus regimes. In order to isolate the behavior of the proposed EDMF parameterization and aid in its further development, we have implemented the scheme in a portable MATLAB single column model (SCM). We use this SCM framework to optimize the simulation of stratocumulus cloud top entrainment and boundary layer decoupling.",

            "abstract": "Raindrop impulses applied to soils can break up larger soil aggregates into smaller particles, dispersing them from their original position. The displaced particles can self-stratify, with finer particles at the top forming a crust. Occurrence of this phenomenon reduces the infiltration rate and increases runoff, contributing to downstream flooding, soil erosion, and non point source pollutant loads. Unprotected soil surfaces (e.g. without vegetation canopies, mulch, or other materials), are more susceptible to crust formation due to the higher kinetic energy associated with raindrop impact. By contrast, soil that is protected by vegetation canopies and mulch layers is less susceptible to crust formation, since these surfaces intercept raindrops, dissipating some of their kinetic energy prior to their impact with the soil. Within this context, this presentation presents preliminary laboratory work conducted using a rainfall simulator to determine the ability of new urban vegetation and mulch to minimize soil crust formation. Three different scenarios are compared: a) bare soil, b) soil with mulch cover, and c) soil protected by vegetation canopies. Soil moisture, surface penetration resistance, and physical measurements of the volume of infiltrate and runoff are made on all three surface treatments after simulated rainfall events. The results are used to develop recommendations regarding surface treatment in green infrastructure (GI) system designs, namely whether heavily vegetated GI facilities require mulching to maintain infiltration capacity.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are crucial ecosystem features that provide important ecological benefits to improve water quality and reduce the climate change impact. This ecosystem functioning of wetlands is largely dependent upon their hydrological characteristics and linkage to the downstream waters. However, the cumulative impacts of the climate on wetlands and the hydrological connection between wetlands and downstream waters have been rarely quantified at the landscape scale. This study reports findings from time series satellite observation that can illustrate the changes in extent of wetland inundation at a high spatial resolution (30-m) over the period 1985-2010. This remote sensing based observation provides crucial information to gain insights onto inter-annual variability of inundation dynamics, and we analyze this product with the drought indices, streamflows, the USFS NWI-hydrologic modifier. This study focuses on natural palustrine wetlands, densely distributed in the coastal plain of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW). We observe inundation patterns change in response to the weather variability, and it is proportionally related to the downstream flow discharge. While those wetlands with a longer hydro-period (i.e., permanently ponded wetlands during the growing season) show the strongest relationship with stream discharge (including baseflow, contributed from the shallow groundwater), inundation patterns of headwater/isolated wetlands are also strongly related to stream discharge. It shows the strong relationship between wetlands and downstream water regardless of geographic isolation and their mutual reliance on groundwater. The study provides the support for the conservation of wetlands through section 404 of the Clean Water Act.",

            "abstract": "The Indo-Gangetic basin in northwest India is a major hotspot of groundwater depletion over the last four decades, with significant consequences for future agricultural productivity. However, little is known about groundwater dynamics in this region. We use environmental isotope analysis of rainfall, groundwater and surface water to characterize zones and sources of groundwater recharge in the Ghaggar basin lying between the Himalayan-fed Yamuna and Sutlej river systems. Around 700 groundwater samples were collected from 182 locations within the Ghaggar basin during pre- and post-monsoon periods of 2013. The δ18O values of river water vary from -7.3‰ to -5.3‰ and δ2H varies from -50.6‰ to -46.4‰, suggesting source of water from lower altitude. Depleted isotopic values of δ18O between -12.1‰ and -11.5‰, and δ2H between -79.1‰ and -74.9‰, are observed in canal water sourced from the Sutlej. The δ18O values of groundwater vary from -12.6‰ to -3.1‰ and δ2H from -84.8‰ to -28.6‰. Groundwater isotopic values fall on the LMWL, indicating local precipitation as the main recharge source, although a few depleted samples falling above the LMWL suggest local canal recharge.\nA key point in our data is the marked longitudinal as well as vertical variability in composition of groundwater samples reflecting differences in age and recharge sources. Longitudinal variability in groundwater is reflected from a much larger scatter in both δ18O and δ2H values for the downstream reaches compared to the upstream reaches, suggesting mixing of various sources of recharge. Also, groundwater in downstream reaches is saline or brackish with EC values of >4000 μS/cm reflecting evaporation of irrigation water. Further, groundwater samples above 60 m bgl show tritium values in range of 1.88-8.0 TU indicating sub-modern to modern recharge whereas those below 60m bgl show a much lower values of 0.3-1.88 TU suggesting groundwater is sub-modern to older than 50 yrs. It indicates that replenishment of groundwater below 60 m bgl is very little. Stable isotope data also show that the shallow aquifers have a larger variability in both δ18O and δ2H values compared to those for the deeper aquifers. Such inhomogeneity in groundwater structure has important implications for sustainable groundwater management in this region",

            "abstract": "Continental and oceanic core complexes are characterized by fairly smooth, unfaulted, but corrugated surfaces of high grade rocks often domed both along and orthogonal to the transport direction. The corrugations, or mega-mullions, are remarkably continuous in the transport direction and may be tens of kilometers long. Spencer [1999] suggests that corrugations with across-transport wavelengths of millimeter to ~25 km scales are formed when the lower plate of a large-offset normal fault is “continuously cast,” as warm, ductile mantle and gabbro is pulled up against the cooler upper plate. Continuous casting is widely accepted as a mechanism to form the shorter wavelength corrugations as a result of irregularities of the brittle upper plate surface. However, doming is generally ascribed to upflow of buoyant diapirs or transtensional deformation of the lithosphere.\nWe suggest that doming of core complexes can be a product of continuous casting when a large-offset fault evolves to be curved in plan-view. For oceanic core complexes along-axis variation in magmatism can lead to lateral offset of a detachment fault relative to the spreading axis. We assume that near-ridge normal faults form relatively straight and consider that horizontal offsets in the along-axis position of a large-offset fault (or detachment) result from variations in the rate of magmatic diking. Assuming a sinusoidal variation in the rate of dike opening with distance along the axis the evolution of fault offset and the plan-view shape of the active fault is easy to describe. Because the fault length increases as it is offset, the work to slip on the fault increases with time. Eventually, it should be easier to slip in a new straight fault and the conditions for this can be described with an approximate analytic model.\nWe are developing 3D numerical models to test the predictions of this analytic model and show how the topographic amplitude of the domes depends the fault dip, the amplitude of the horizontal offset of the fault and the thickness of the brittle layer. Consistent with observations, the model predicts that flexurally supported domes occur where the magma supply is the lowest.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini Mission has turned our view of Saturn’s icy moons from scientific sketches to fully realized worlds. Among the major discoveries are: Activity on Enceladus and associated plumes that originate in small hot spots on its south pole and that appear to be modulated by tidal forces; a liquid subsurface water ocean on Enceladus that is a habitable environment; several new moons; debris rings associated with moons; a unique equatorial ridge on Iapetus; the identity of new constituents on the moons including carbon dioxide ice on most of them and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)on Iapetus; differentiated or partially differentiated interiors; nano-iron on the surfaces of the moons and in the rings; volatile segregation on Iapetus and Hyperion; and a bewildering array of geologic processes on the small moons. But our new view of these icy worlds has spawned new questions. Among these unanswered questions are: How variable are the plumes? Have any other moons had activity similar to that on Enceladus and did it continue up to the recent past? How much dust do the moons contribute to the region around Saturn? What caused the ridge on Iapetus? What are the interiors of the moons like? How differentiated and compensated are they? Five additional targeted flybys, two of Dione and three of Enceladus, have been designed to answer these questions and will be implemented during the remainder of the Solstice Mission. The Dione flybys both include gravity passes to determine its state of differentiation. One of the flybys is optimized to measure the fields and particle environment around Dione. One of the two remote-sensing flybys of Enceladus will scrutinize the south polar region to further understand the size, temperature, and variability of the emitting areas, while the other will observe the north pole to determine why it is so different from the south. The third Enceladus flyby involves an unprecedented pass less than 50 km above the surface into the midst of the plume. The spacecraft’s daring swoop into the inner parts of the saturnian system during the F-ring and proximal orbits will bring many of the small inner satellites into clearer focus. Funded by NASA.",

            "abstract": "Long-term, high-resolution stalagmite carbon and oxygen isotope records from eastern North America (ENA) provides a mid-latitude history of relative changes in moisture availability and climate states during the last interglacial and glacial inception (127.7 to 41.6 ka before present). The West Virginia carbon record (δ13C) shows low-amplitude variability at orbital time scales, superimposed on a long-term asymmetric pattern similar to global sea level changes. Relative moisture availability peaked at ~114ka and following a brief dry interval at ~96ka, moisture availability gradually decreased. The gradual changes in moisture availability over ENA may reflect similarly gradual changes in mid-latitude zonal circulation as the polar cell and Laurentide Ice Sheet expanded or decreased. However, high frequency isotopic fluctuations are present and correlative with climatic phenomena recorded in Greenland. In contrast to the gradual changes in carbon isotopes, our oxygen record (δ18O) is precession-modulated and in phase with spring insolation, perhaps due to changes in precipitation seasonality. Altered precipitation seasonality or seasonal moisture availabilities would, as a result of annual variability in meteoric δ18O, have caused a weighting effect in stalagmitic calcite precipitation. However, this explanation for changes in δ18O does not explain why the two isotopic records of eccentricity (carbon) and precession (oxygen) are paced differently because moisture availability might resonably be expected to covary with precipitation seasonality. The same pattern is observed in a stalagmite from the previous interglacial-glacial cycle, so it is a persistent feature in our study area. We will present possible explanations.",

            "abstract": "The initial breakdown stage of a lightning flash encompasses its first several to tens of milliseconds and it is characterized by a sequence of pulses typically detected with electric field change sensors on the ground [e.g., Villanueva et al., JGR, 99, D7, 1994]. A typical (referred to as \"classical\") initial breakdown pulse (IBP) has duration of tens of microseconds and it is one of the largest pulses at the beginning of a lightning flash, but a wide range of pulse durations and amplitudes also occur [e.g., Nag et al., Atmos. Res., 91, 316, 2009]. Recent results by Marshall et al. [JGR, 119, 445, 2014] suggest that IBPs should be observable in all lightning discharges. Complementarily, Stolzenburg et al. [JGR, 118, 2918, 2013] correlated individual IBPs to bursts of light that appear to be illumination of a lightning leader channel and Karunarathne et al. [JGR, 118, 7129, 2013] have determined that as a flash evolves the location of IBP sources inside the cloud coincide with the position of negative leaders as determined by a VHF lightning mapping system. In view of the above listed properties of IBPs, we have developed a new numerical model to investigate the electromagnetic signatures associated with these events and to relate them to the initial lightning leader development. The model is built on a bidirectional (zero-net-charge) lightning leader concept [e.g., Mazur and Ruhnke, JGR, 103, D18, 1998]. We simulate a finite-length finite-conductivity leader elongating in the thunderstorm electric field and we solve a set of integro-differential equations to retrieve the full dynamics of charges and currents induced in it. Our proposed approach is a generalization of the transmission-line [e.g., Nag and Rakov, JGR, 115, D20102, 2010] and electrostatic [e.g., Pasko, GRL, 41, 179, 2014] approximations used for analysis of in-cloud discharge processes. We also allow for different propagation mechanisms at the different polarity leader extremities, i.e., continuous (VHF-dark) elongation of positive tip and impulsive (through streamer corona flashes) elongation of negative leader tip [e.g., Williams and Heckman, J. Aerospace Lab, 5, 2012]. We demonstrate that a wide range of observed IBP morphologies can be effectively explained by the variation of only two parameters in the developing leader: step length and conductivity.",

            "abstract": "We have synthesized aluminum-bearing MgSiO3 bridgmanite samples at 25GPa and various temperatures from 1600 to 2200ºC in a multi-anvil press and have characterized the samples by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, electron microprobe (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Bridgmanite crystals range up to 100 micrometers in size and contain 1 – 2.5% by weight Al2O3. SIMS analysis indicates up to several thousand ppm by weight H2O within probe spot areas of approximately 10 x 10 mm, which corresponds to one H per Al atom in the structure. Microprobe chemical analysis and crystal structure refinement from single crystal X-ray data indicates that Al substitutes in the Si site, but not in the Mg site. However, Raman spectroscopy indicates the presence of micro-inclusions of brucite, super-hydrous phase B (Shy-B), possible magnesite, and stishovite in most of the runs. Some of the bridgmanite crystals in the samples synthesized at temperatures above 2100º C exhibit rounded inclusions that are interpreted to be melt that quenched to bridgmanite plus brucite, phase D, and/or stishovite.\nThese results indicate that hydrogen may have a small but significant solubility in at least the upper part of Earth’s lower mantle related to the presence of Al in bridgmanite. The solubility of H in the lower mantle is thus likely to be much lower than in the phases of the transition zone at depths less than 660 km. This raises the possibility that significant amounts of H may be trapped and stored in the transition zone.",

This initiative supports the building of a comprehensive, integrated, secure and sustainable cyberinfrastructure necessary to support complex science and engineering research, supporting the development of a broad range of computational and data-enabled scientists and engineers, and assisting and encouraging their careers.\nThe main goal of the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program is the advance of discovery, research and education across both the Arctic and Antarctic disciplines through the integration of cyberinfrastructure and polar research and activities. The integration of updated computing, data management, information, networking, sensor and software technologies into polar research is one aspect of the evolution of a polar cyberinfrastructure. Data-enabled discoveries, the storage and distribution of large complex data sets and the continuity to access long-lived publicly accessible data sets are some examples of outcomes. In this talk I will provide an overview of the previous and currently funded research activities with the program. I will also summarize the outcome of an NSF-funded Workshop on Polar Cyberinfrastructure and will discuss potential areas of future programmatic investments.",

            "abstract": "Slow-slip events (SSE) and tectonic tremors offer a unique window into a broad spectrum of earthquake behavior and fault mechanics at the bottom of seismogenic zones. Our previous heterogeneous fault models composed of brittle asperities embedded in a matrix with velocity weakening-to-strengthening transition reproduced tremor migration patterns observed in the Cascadia subduction zone including forward tremor propagation and Rapid Tremor Reversals (RTRs). Tremors were driven by a background SSE whose existence did not require tremors. Here we assess the importance of feedback between tremors and SSE by considering a ductile (pure velocity-strengthening) background matrix. In this new model complex tremor swarms and SSE result solely from the interaction between brittle asperity failures via intervening transient creep. In particular, in the absence of tremor asperities the model produces no SSE. The new model is less complicated than our previous one and matches some observations better. It reproduces the scale and recurrence interval of large tremor episodes and the migration speed and distance of RTR observed in Cascadia, and the ratio of RTR to forward migration speeds spans a wider range. Observations of tremor-genic and tremor-less slow slip occurring in a same segment of the Cascadia subduction zone suggest that natural faults are in between these two end-member models.\nWe study the tremor-driven SSE model through numerical simulations of heterogeneous rate-and-state faults with mixed velocity-weakening (VW) and velocity-strengthening (VS) materials. We find that the (b-a)*sigma value (effectively the frictional properties and pore pressure) of the VW fault portions determine the criticalness of the whole fault (i.e. its ability to produce spontaneous transient events). A combined analytical and numerical study of fault criticalness as a function of density of VW material and contrast of (b-a)*sigma values reveals subcritical-to-supercritical transitions both with increasing criticalness of the individual VW patches and, less trivially, by increasing the (b-a)*sigma value of the VW patches. Higher effective normal stress of the VW portions can bring the whole fault to a supercritical state even if the VW patches are individually subcritical.",

            "abstract": "Along the Southeast Indian Ridge, variations in axial depth, crustal thickness, hydrothermal venting [1], basaltic major elements and U-series disequilibria [2] all indicate a west-to-east decrease in magma supply and mantle temperature from the Amsterdam-St. Paul hotspot to the Australian-Antarctic Discordance. Paired Hf-Pb isotopes in closely spaced glasses (5-10 km) from 81-100°E deﬁne two populations revealing compositional streaks in the upper mantle [3]. The number density of the streaks follows a Poisson distribution with a characteristic thickness of ~20 km. K/Ti and Na8 do not correlate with Pb or Hf isotopes, and both isotopic domains encompass N- and E-MORB types indicating the variations represent mantle source heterogeneities. 3He/4He varies from 7.5 - 10.2 RA, more than half the range in global MORB away from hotspot influence [4]. No systematic relationship exists between 3He/4He and Pb or Hf isotopes. A general negative correlation between K/Ti and Fe8 for the SEIR resembles that for MORBs globally, with higher K/Ti associated with lower 3He/4He. Collectively the observations suggest the presence of lithologically heterogeneous mantle. Lower 3He/4He derives from a source containing a few percent pyroxenite or ecologite, while 3He/4He > 9 RA arises from peridotite. Mantle convection has folded together distinct composite reservoirs of heterogeneous mantle, and stretched them into streaks that remain discernible units. The mantle ‘unit’ giving rise to each MORB sample represents a ‘mixture of mixtures’ with a multi-stage mixing history. Spectral analysis of the length scales of Hf, Pb and He isotopic variability allows a visual representation of this upper mantle ‘texture’. The dominant length scales reflect large (1000, 500 km) and regional scale (100-150 km) structures in mantle flow, and sampling of heterogeneities during partial melting (20-30 km).\n1-Baker et al., doi:10.1002/2014GC005344; 2-Russo et al., doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2008.11.016; 3-Hanan et al., doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2013.05.028; 4-Graham et al., doi:10.1002/2014GC005264",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP, 3.264 to 3.025 Ma) has been considered a possible analog for the future long-term consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas changes. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for this period have been estimated to be approximately 350 to 450 ppmv. We have now nearly surpassed globally the mid-point of this range and could surpass 450 ppmv by shortly after year 2030 in the most dire pathway of future emissions. In Phase I of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP), twelve coupled climate models simulated the mPWP time slab. These models could not reproduce the mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere warmth indicated by the PRISM3 dataset. Models suggest that Arctic sea ice, particularly no summer sea ice and much reduced winter sea ice, rather than changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and associated ocean heat transport, are key for reproducing the high-latitude warmth.\nPlanning for the modeling experiments, CMIP6, which will contribute to the IPCC AR6 in 2019, is underway. PlioMIP Phase II and PRISM4 have selected a time-slice centered at 3.205 Ma (3.204 to 3.207 Ma) to better constrain the comparisons between models and data and help reduce uncertainties associated with forcings incorporated into the model designs. In this talk, we will introduce the PlioMIP II protocols. We will also discuss those differences in the paleogeography and forcings from modern that may need to be considered when assessing the climate model simulations against proxy indicators of mid- and high-latitude temperature and the Pliocene as an analogue for the future. The model experiments included in PlioMIP II and PRISM4 dataset will be important not only for Pliocene4Future but also Pliocene4Pliocene, thus advancing our knowledge of this period in its own right.",

            "abstract": "Carbon acts as a component in greenhouse gases that regulate global climate. It is imperative to understand the transport and storage of carbon in order to understand and manage climate change. We examine terrestrial carbon storage in mountain lake deltas as a way of furthering our understanding of the terrestrial carbon sink, which is a poorly understood but significant contributor to the global carbon cycle. We examined subalpine lake deltas in the Washington Cascade Range and Colorado Front Range to test the following hypotheses: 1) The size of the deltaic carbon sink is strongly correlated with incision at the outlet of the lake and the topography of the basin. 2) Areas of high exhumation rates will have smaller and fewer deltas because a high exhumation rate should lead to more confined basins and more colluvium available to dam lake outlets, preventing lake level drop and corresponding delta formation. 3) High-energy deltas will transport more carbon to lakes, avoiding the deltaic carbon sink. At 27 lakes, we surveyed mountain lake deltas and took sediment samples, surveyed lake outlets in the field, and measured lake valley confinement in GIS to test hypotheses 1 and 3. Across the Snoqualmie and Skykomish watersheds in the Washington Cascades and the Colorado Front Range, we took a census of the number of natural lakes and the proportion of those lakes with deltas to test hypothesis 2. Preliminary results indicate that the Washington Cascades (high exhumation rate) have a higher density of lakes, but fewer deltas, than the Colorado Front Range (low exhumation rate). We also suspect that deltas in the Washington Cascades will have a lower carbon content than the Colorado Front Range due to generally higher energy levels on deltas. Finally, we found a substantial difference in the geomorphology and sediment type between beaver-affected and non-beaver-affected lakes in the Colorado Front Range.",

            "abstract": "The largest dust source in the world is the Sahara desert, which occupies most of the northern half of Africa. A recent international modeling experiment conducted under the auspices of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AEROCOM) initiative estimated that the annual dust generation from the Sahara and its peripheries is in the range of 400 to 2200 Tg yr−1. It is estimated that about 240±80 Tg yr−1 of the dust leaves the western shores of Africa on its way across the Atlantic. Therefore, a majority of the dust emitted from and around the Sahara remains and circulates within Africa, potentially affecting the environment, air quality, and human health, among other effects. Given the apparent scarcity of ground-based air-quality monitoring networks in Africa, we are exploring approaches that utilize satellite measurements and regional models to estimate the air-quality impacts of aerosols (particularly those of biomass burning and dust) in northern Hemisphere Africa. Some of the model simulations evaluated using ground-based and satellite observations show that the regional models deliver a high performance in capturing the mixing and transport of biomass-burning (smoke) and dust aerosols. In this presentation, we will share our preliminary results and future perspectives.",

Studies of the anisotropies can therefore probe interplanetary conditions far from the observer. The Low Energy Telescopes onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft measure SEP pitch angle distributions for protons, helium, and heavier ions with energies of about 2-12 MeV/nucleon. Among the more interesting periods observed to date is the very large SEP event of 23 July 2012. At the Ahead spacecraft, the solar source of the activity was near central meridian and the pitch angle distribution was initially an outward-flowing beam, but it exhibited peculiar oscillations in beam width on a timescale of several minutes. After a shock passed, particle flow became bidirectional while inside a magnetic cloud. At the Behind spacecraft, more than 120 degrees of heliolongitude away, particles flowed in towards the Sun once the spacecraft was magnetically connected to the back side of the shock after it reached about 2 AU. These particles then experienced partial mirroring closer to the Sun, forming a distinctive loss-cone distribution indicating that the magnetic field strength at the mirror point was too small to turn around particles with the smallest pitch angles. We present the observations of this rich variety of anisotropies within a single event, compare with observations in other events, and discuss the implications for SEP transport in the inner heliosphere.",

How it goes about this will depend upon the nature of impending international agreements, national laws, regional strategies, and social and economic forces. The challenge to those making observations to support, inform, or verify these reduction efforts, or to address potential Earth System feedbacks, lies in harmonizing a diverse array of observations and observing systems. Doing so is not trivial. Providing coherent, regional-scale information from these observations also requires improved modelling and ensemble reanalysis, but in the end such information must be relevant and reasonably certain. The challenge to us is to ensure a globally coherent observing and analysis system to supply the information that society will need to succeed.

            "abstract": "Geologic materials, basically calcium or magnesium-rich rocks, can provide much of the thermodynamic driving force for distributed carbon capture from air – if we can work out appropriate processes. One apparent challenge is that the rate of reaction is slower than we would like it to be. This rate is a combination of the mineralization rate (forming calcite from solution) and, since the reactions are much faster in water, the rate at which carbon dioxide can be added to solution, providing a more concentrated source of CO2(aq) for reaction. This latter problem of mass transfer across the gas-liquid interface is addressed in power plant capture schemes through increasing the chemical driving force, catalytic formation of dissolved CO2 via carbonic anhydrase and its analogues, and simple increases of surface area. An important learning from that body of research is that surface area is critically important – no amount of catalysis or chemical driving force can make up for simple transfer area. This talk will relate those learnings in power plant capture studies to the issue of accumulating CO2 to react with rocks for permanent sequestration. Not only is it important to create surface area for the reactive rocks, such as by grinding or fracturing, but it is equally valuable to increase the concentration of CO2(aq) by rapid transfer across the gas-water interface. Successful future carbon dioxide management schemes will have to take advantage of every kinetic advantage possible, in order to make good use of the thermodynamic advantage that geologic materials present for controlling atmospheric carbon levels.",

            "abstract": "Radar wave velocity in dry snow depends solely on density. Consequently, ground-based pulsed systems can be used to accurately measure snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) using signal travel-time, along with manual depth-probing for signal velocity calibration. Travel-time measurements require a large bandwidth pulse not possible in airborne/space-borne platforms. In addition, radar backscatter from snow cover is sensitive to grain size and to a lesser extent roughness of layers at current/proposed satellite-based frequencies (~ 8 – 18 GHz), complicating inversion for SWE. Therefore, accurate retrievals of SWE still require local calibration due to this sensitivity to microstructure and layering. Conversely, satellite radar interferometry, which senses the difference in signal phase between acquisitions, has shown a potential relationship with SWE at lower frequencies (~ 1 – 5 GHz) because the phase of the snow-refracted signal is sensitive to depth and dielectric properties of the snowpack, as opposed to its microstructure and stratigraphy. We have constructed a lab-based, experimental test bed to quantify the change in radar phase over a wide range of frequencies for varying depths of dry quartz sand, a material dielectrically similar to dry snow. We use a laboratory grade Vector Network Analyzer (0.01 – 25.6 GHz) and a pair of antennae mounted on a trolley over the test bed to measure amplitude and phase repeatedly/accurately at many frequencies. Using ground-based LiDAR instrumentation, we collect a coordinated high-resolution digital surface model (DSM) of the test bed and subsequent depth surfaces with which to compare the radar record of changes in phase. Our plans to transition this methodology to a field deployment during winter 2014-2015 using precision pan/tilt instrumentation will also be presented, as well as applications to airborne and space-borne platforms toward the estimation of SWE at high spatial resolution (on the order of meters) over large regions (> 100 square kilometers).",

We present a suite of modeling and analysis tools, including uncertainty analysis, that can provide quantitative constraints on cycling for these data-limited problems, and we illustrate their applicability through examples of Hg and selected POPs. Specifically, we summarize recent insights from inverse modeling of mercury, polynomial chaos-based methods for PAHs. Finally, we assess how uncertainty in timescales affects the entire emissions-to-impacts pathway for atmosphere-surface exchangeable pollutants. We discuss the implications of this analysis for policies under the Stockholm and Minamata Conventions.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic-fracture microseismicity in layered rock often exhibits fairly uniform source mechanisms characterized by one of the nodal planes aligned vertical and striking close (~10°) to the principal stress direction. Typically, displacements are dip slip and/or strike slip. When combined with precise source locations, the events sometimes form simple linear trends and distinct depth bands separated by aseismic intervals. The simple geometry and observed shearing on planes with little or no expected in-situ shear stress suggest that the signal generation is closely associated with the near-field stress and strain conditions of hydraulic-fracture opening. Further, the distinct depth bands suggest the seismic failure is controlled by the mechanical stratigraphy.\nBased on the analog of natural tensile joint structures observed in layered rock, I interpret the aligned strike-slip and dip-slip mechanisms in terms of en echelon fringe cracks and bedding-plane slip on step-over features, respectively. Dip-slip mechanisms are common in shales, and may represent slip on bedding surfaces if the alternate, horizontal nodal plane is considered the fault plane. Modeling studies of bedding-plane slip and the formation of jogs or step overs of a tensile fracture along bedding suggest that the fracture growth is controlled by crack tip stresses and the mechanical properties of the layer interfaces. The observation of strike-slip events aligned in horizontal bands could be similarly associated with tensile joint behavior at layer interfaces where the parent tensile crack can break up into a set of en echelon cracks in response to local stress rotations. Breakdown into en echelon cracks is initiated by strike-slip shearing parallel to the tensile parent fracture, representing a mode III deformation. In this interpretation, of critical failure associated with bedding plane slip and fringe fracture break up, the microseismicity provides a direct picture of tensile fracture growth through the rock, highlighting the deformation at and near bedding boundaries as the hydraulic fracture rips through or along layer interfaces.",

The biggest challenge relates to the flexibility of the instrument payload. Within the life of the mission, instruments may be removed from or added to the payload, or even reconfigured on a yearly, monthly or daily basis. Although modification of the instrument payload provides a distinct advantage for airborne missions compared to spaceborne missions, it does tend to wreak havoc on the underlying data system when introducing changes to existing data inputs or new data inputs that require modifications to the pipeline for processing the data. In addition to payload flexibility, it is not uncommon to find unsupported files in the field data submission. In the case of CARVE, these include video files, photographs taken during the flight and screen shots from terminal displays. These need to captured, saved and somehow integrated into the data system.\nThe CARVE data system was built on a multi-mission data system infrastructure for airborne instruments called the Airborne Cloud Computing Environment (ACCE). ACCE encompasses the end-to-end lifecycle covering planning, provisioning of data system capabilities, and support for scientific analysis in order to improve the quality, cost effectiveness, and capabilities to enable new scientific discovery and research in earth observation. This well-tested and proven infrastructure allows the CARVE data system to be easily adapted in order to handle the challenges posed by the CARVE mission and to successfully process, manage and distribute the mission’s science data.\nThis research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration",

The functional form of the electronic absorption edge for all kerogens measured is in excellent agreement with the \"Urbach tail\" phenomenology. The Urbach decay width extracted from the exponential fit within the visible range is strongly correlated with the aliphatic/aromatic ratio in isolated kerogen, regardless of the kerogen type. The direct correlation is confirmed by density functional theory calculations on proxy ensemble models of kerogen. The correlation of the decay width with conventional maturity indicators such as vitrinite reflectance is found to be good within a particular kerogen type, but not consistent across different kerogen types. This is explained in terms of the evolution of the population of aromatic constituents in kerogen, which is instead directly measured through the Urbach decay. The optical absorption edge and the Urbach decay width are therefore presented as excellent candidates for the evaluation of thermal maturity in kerogen.",

Recent work has examined (and narrowed) these differences through systematic model intercomparison using a high-emissions pathway to highlight the differences. New work extends that analysis to cover a range of plausible socioeconomic scenarios and emission pathways. Results from three general circulation models are combined with one crop model and five global economic models to examine the global and regional impacts of climate change on yields, area, production, prices and trade for coarse grains, rice, wheat, oilseeds and sugar to 2050. Results show that yield impacts vary with changes in population, income and technology as well as emissions, but are reduced in all cases by endogenous changes in prices and other variables.",

However, relatively little is known about the asymmetries that arise on meso and smaller spatial scales or in the course of reconfiguration of the global convection following changes in IMF or substorm onsets. Moreover the correspondence between the hemispheres in space weather effects such as the occurrence of ionospheric plasma irregularities is almost unexplored. Some of the challenges in conducting such studies are traceable to more limited observational capabilities in the southern hemisphere. New capabilities have recently been achieved with the expansion of the SuperDARN radar network such that simultaneous and quasi-conjugate coverage is sometimes possible from midlatitudes to the polar cap. We review findings on the asymmetric aspects of high-latitude convection and press further to consider evidence of correspondence and asymmetry in convection when varying in time and across the equatorward auroral and midlatitude regions where conjugacy should obtain more reliably. We also discuss evidence of correlation between the hemispheres in terms of the occurrence of small-scale irregularities as a space weather phenomenon of practical importance.",

Most current physics-based models derive from the meander-morphodynamics equations introduced by Ikeda et al. (1981). Corresponding linear theories have focused almost exclusively on periodic sequences of small-amplitude meanders. Mathematical consideration of the equations shows that boundary conditions must be chosen carefully to yield numerical solutions for a well posed boundary value problem. The numerical algorithms presented in this work yield 2D solutions to the (corrected) Ikeda et al. (1981) equations with second order convergence in both time and space. We explore the characteristics of spatially versus temporally growing waves, as well as the effects of stochastic variations in the upstream boundary condition and in the dimensionless parameter β, which characterizes the strength of secondary flow relative to cross-stream shear. Consideration of the growth patterns for spatially growing waves provides some insight for the design of experimental systems exhibiting self sustaining river meanders.",

            "abstract": "In the Laurentian Great Lakes region of the Upper Midwest, USA, agricultural and urban land uses together with high N deposition are contributing to elevated flows of N in rivers and groundwater to coastal wetlands. The functioning of coastal wetlands, which provide a vital link between land and water, are imperative to maintaining the health of the entire Great Lakes Basin. Elevated N inflows are believed to facilitate the spread of large-stature invasive plants (cattails and Phragmites) that reduce biodiversity and have complex effects on other ecosystem services including wetland N retention and C accretion. We enhanced the ILHM (Integrated Landscape Hydrology Model) to simulate the effects of land use on N flows in streams, rivers, and groundwater throughout the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. We used the hydroperiods and N loading rates simulated by ILHM as inputs to the Mondrian model of wetland community-ecosystem processes to estimate invasion risk and other ecosystem services in coastal wetlands around the Michigan coast. Our linked models produced threshold behavior in the success of invasive plants in response to N loading, with the threshold ranging from ca. 8 to 12 g N/m2 y, depending on hydroperiod. Plant invasions increased wetland productivity 3-fold over historically oligotrophic native communities, decreased biodiversity but slightly increased wetland N retention. Regardless of invasion, elevated N loading resulted in significantly enhanced rates of C accretion, providing an important region-wide mechanism of C storage. The linked models predicted a general pattern of greater invasion risk in the southern basins of lakes Michigan and Huron relative to northern areas. The basic mechanisms of invasion have been partially validated in our field mesocosms constructed for this project. The general regional patterns of increased invasion risk have been validated through our field campaigns and remote sensing conducted for this project.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater management is highly dependent on the type and quality of field data available describing a given aquifer system. Our increasing reliance on groundwater, especially as traditional surface supplies continue to be overexploited due to rising population and standard of living, requires that we better understand the state of our subsurface supplies and how to best manage them. The dense spatial and temporal variability of subsidence provided by time series InSAR allows us to constrain the extent of an aquifer, its storage coefficient, estimates of hydraulic head, and hydraulic conductivity. We present examples of these parameters associated with groundwater systems in the San Luis Valley, CO, and the Central Valley area of California, as observed by several spaceborne radar systems and validated by comparison with field data.\nGroundwater is one component of a water system, which includes surface supplies and all of the various sources and end uses of water in a particular area. Confined aquifers remain the most difficult components of a full water system to characterize and properly manage, as they lie deep underground and are hidden from direct observation. We show that observing subtle deformations of the surface elevations on the order of mm to cm yield important constraints on the underlying aquifer and its hydraulic properties, because variations in the surface height expresses changes in water pressure below.\nThe fundamental relation between pressure and stress resulting in changes in hydraulic head yields a simple linear relationship between deformation Δb, hydraulic head Δh, and skeletal storage coefficient: Sk = Δb / Δh, so that measuring deformation everywhere above an aquifer over time yields change in head. Using InSAR-observed temporal response of the head (deformation) to changes in forcing by water sources and sinks, and applying the one dimensional diffusion equation resulting from Darcy’s Law and the continuity relation allows us to estimate conductivity in the reservoir. This is important in order the supplement the usually sparse geologic knowledge describing the shape of the various layers in the aquifer system and their compressibility. These tools point toward an approach for forecasting future head levels.",

C stocks of mangroves are among the highest of any forest type on Earth. We have measured the ecosystem carbon stocks in mangroves across the world and found them to range from 250 to >2000 Mg C/ha which is a CO2 equivalence of 917 to 7340 Mg/ha.\nBecause the numerous values of mangroves are well known, it is ironic that rates of deforestation largely relating to land use/land cover change are among the highest of any forest type on earth exceeding that of tropical rain forests. Dominant causes of deforestation include conversion to aquaculture (shrimp), agricultural conversion, and coastal development. The carbon emissions arising from conversion of mangroves to other uses is exceptionally high. This is because vulnerability of the soil carbon stocks to losses with conversion. Emissions from conversion of mangrove to shrimp ponds range from about 800 to over 3000 Mg CO2e/ha. This places the carbon footprint of shrimp arising from such ponds as among the highest of any food product available.\nOf great interest is the potential value of mangroves in carbon marketing strategies and other financial incentives that are derived from the conservation of standing forests. This is because of the combination of high carbon stocks in intact mangroves, the high greenhouse gas emissions arising from their conversion, and the conservation of other valuable ecosystem services provided by intact mangroves.",

            "abstract": "Lunar impact melts appear to be some of the roughest materials on the Moon at the centimeter scale, even though they appear smooth at the meter scale. These characteristics are unlike any terrestrial analogues yet studied, such as Hawaiian pahoehoe and a’a lava flows. The morphology of impact melt flows can be related to their emplacement conditions and melt properties through thermo-rheological models, so understanding the origin of these unique surface properties will inform us as to the conditions at which they were emplaced. In collaboration with the SSERVI FINESSE team, I am investigating the surface properties of several transitional lava types (e.g., rubbly pahoehoe) at Craters of the Moon National Monument in Idaho. I compare AIRSAR radar images of a range of lava flows to ground-based and high-resolution aerial imagery, for comparison to Mini-RF and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images of impact melts on the Moon. In the process, I will identify appropriate terrestrial analogues for these unusual materials, helping us to understand their emplacement conditions. Information about the surface properties of impact melt will also be critical for any future landed missions that wish to sample these materials on terrestrial planets.",

            "abstract": "Disaster management relies increasingly on interpreting earth observations and running numerical models; which require significant computing capacity - usually on short notice and at irregular intervals. Peak computing demand during event detection, hazard assessment, or incident response may exceed agency budgets; however some of it can be met through volunteered computing, which distributes subtasks to participating computers via the Internet. This approach has enabled large projects in mathematics, basic science, and climate research to harness the slack computing capacity of thousands of desktop computers. This capacity is likely to diminish as desktops give way to battery-powered mobile devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets) in the consumer market; but as cloud computing becomes commonplace, it may offer significant slack capacity -- if its users are given an easy, trustworthy mechanism for participating. Such a “volunteered cloud computing” mechanism would also offer several advantages over traditional volunteered computing: tasks distributed within a cloud have fewer bandwidth limitations; granular billing mechanisms allow small slices of “interstitial” computing at no marginal cost; and virtual storage volumes allow in-depth, reversible machine reconfiguration.\nVolunteered cloud computing is especially suitable for “embarrassingly parallel” tasks, including ones requiring large data volumes: examples in disaster management include near-real-time image interpretation, pattern / trend detection, or large model ensembles. In the context of a major disaster, we estimate that cloud users (if suitably informed) might volunteer hundreds to thousands of CPU cores across a large provider such as Amazon Web Services. To explore this potential, we are building a volunteered cloud computing platform and targeting it to a disaster management context. Using a lightweight, fault-tolerant network protocol, this platform helps cloud users join parallel computing projects; automates reconfiguration of their virtual machines; ensures accountability for donated computing; and optimizes the use of “interstitial” computing. Initial applications include fire detection from multispectral satellite imagery and flood risk mapping through hydrological simulations.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes lead to a wide range of societal and environmental impacts; indeed, strong evidence has accrued that such impacts are already occurring, as summarized by the newest National Climate Assessment and other analyses. Among the most important will be alterations in the hydrologic cycle, changes in water supply and demand, and impacts on existing water-related infrastructure. Because of the complexity of our water systems, adaptation responses will be equally complex. This problem has made it difficult for water managers and planners to develop and implement adaptation strategies. This talk will address three ways to think about water-related adaptation approaches to climate change: (1) strategies that are already being implemented to address population and economic changes without climate change; (2) whether these first-line strategies are appropriate for additional impacts that might result from climatic changes; and (3) new approaches that might be necessary for new, non-linear, or threshold impacts. An effort will also be made to differentiate between adaptation strategies that influence the hydrologic cycle directly (e.g., cloud seeding), those that influence supply management (e.g., construction of additional reservoirs or water-distribution systems), and those that affect water demand (e.g., removal of outdoor landscaping, installation of efficient irrigation systems).",

            "abstract": "Particle injections in the magnetotail are signatures of particle energization and transport towards the inner magnetosphere and radiation belts. Recent statistical studies of observations of trans-geosynchronous injections by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission indicate that injections are correlated with fast flows, dipolarization fronts, and impulsive dawn-dusk electric field increases. This correlation extends down the magnetotail as far as 30 RE, and the associated magnetic and electric fields are azimuthally localized. We therefore model particle transport analytically using the guiding-center equations of motion for electrons under the effects of localized, earthward traveling electric and magnetic fields superposed on background fields. During an injection, THEMIS spacecraft observe increases in particle energy flux. We simulate injections by altering parameters of the electric and magnetic field model to transport particles in agreement with observations, constraining the location, velocity, width, and magnitude of the fields. We explain features of the simulated energy flux spectrograms, and therefore features of the observed spectrograms, by examining particle trajectories prior to and during the injection. Modeling particle injections illuminates how features of fast flows and dipolarization fronts affect the trajectories of energetic particles. Thus, we provide insight into how particle acceleration due to phenomena associated with reconnection in the magnetotail affect the particle populations of the inner magnetosphere, including the populations of the radiation belts.",

            "abstract": "As part of its Phase 1 Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) activities, NASA initiated a Local-Scale Biomass Pilot study. The goals of the pilot study were to develop protocols for fusing high-resolution remotely sensed observations with field data, provide accurate validation test areas for the continental-scale biomass product, and demonstrate efficacy for prognostic terrestrial ecosystem modeling. In Phase 2, this effort was expanded to the state scale. Here, we present results of this activity focusing on the use of remote sensing in high-resolution ecosystem modeling. The Ecosystem Demography (ED) model was implemented at 90 m spatial resolution for the entire state of Maryland. We rasterized soil depth and soil texture data from SSURGO. For hourly meteorological data, we spatially interpolated 32-km 3-hourly NARR into 1-km hourly and further corrected them at monthly level using PRISM data. NLCD data were used to mask sand, seashore, and wetland. High-resolution 1 m forest/non-forest mapping was used to define forest fraction of 90 m cells. Three alternative strategies were evaluated for initialization of forest structure using high-resolution lidar, and the model was used to calculate statewide estimates of forest biomass, carbon sequestration potential, time to reach sequestration potential, and sensitivity to future forest growth and disturbance rates, all at 90 m resolution. To our knowledge, no dynamic ecosystem model has been run at such high spatial resolution over such large areas utilizing remote sensing and validated as extensively. There are over 3 million 90 m land cells in Maryland, greater than 43 times the ~73,000 half-degree cells in a state-of-the-art global land model.",

Development of more predictive mechanistic carbon cycle models is currently limited by the lack of understanding of physiological growth controls and quantitative information on the forces of mortality that act on the phytoplankton responsible for this CO2 uptake. A complication for research in this area is the fact that phytoplankton are exceptionally diverse. Primary productivity is not only partitioned between cyanobacterial and eukaryotic phytoplankton, but groups within the latter also have very different evolutionary histories and only some are represented in culture. Here, we will explore the advances and challenges in studying eukaryotic phytoplankton and factors that limit their growth in nature. Specifically, we will discuss ecosystems biology approaches that involve iteration between the lab and field and are proving most successful for gaining insight to environmental parameters that structure phytoplankton communities and growth.",

We use a path integral formulation combined with density functional theory, which allows us to incorporate NQEs in a direct and controllable way. In addition, we use state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations to benchmark the accuracy of more approximate mean-field electronic structure calculations based on DFT, and we use GW and hybrid DFT to calculate the optical properties of the solid and liquid phases near metallization. We present accurate predictions of the metal-insulator transition on the solid, including structural and optical properties of the molecular phase.

Malfunctions commonly occur with radar reflectivity less than 30 or even 20 dBZ at flight level and with heavy precipitation below. Airbus airborne measurements in several tropical regions were obtained with the sole objective of encountering and characterizing regions of substantial ice water content (in excess of ~3 g m-3) in the absence of radar reflectivity exceeding 30 dBZ in mesoscale convective systems. Measurements of particle size distributions (PSDs) and particle shapes reveal signatures of ice microphysical pathways associated with the targeted conditions. First we show that column simulations with size-resolved microphysics of quasi-steady, heavy stratiform rain indicate that the measured PSDs are generally consistent with a range of ground-based radar measurements and retrievals obtained under similar, steady stratiform rain conditions in the tropics. Second we consider the convective updraft microphysical pathways that may lead to the observed stratiform ice PSD features using parcel simulations with size-resolved microphysics that include heterogeneous and homogeneous ice nucleation, in which aerosol and ice microphysical properties and microphysical processes in updrafts are informed by relevant measurements. We find that a partially resolved smaller mode in the observed PSDs is likely attributable to homogeneous droplet freezing whereas the dominant mode in the observed mass distributions is consistent with an ice multiplication process active at warmer temperatures, such as Hallett-Mossop splintering.",

            "abstract": "Digital elevation models (DEMs) created using images from a consumer DSLR camera are compared against simultaneously acquired LiDAR on a number of airborne mapping projects across Alaska, California and Utah. The aircraft used is a Cessna 180, and is equipped with the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute (UAF-GI) scanning airborne LiDAR system. This LiDAR is the same as described in Johnson et al, 2013, and is the principal instrument used for NASA’s Operation IceBridge flights in Alaska. The system has been in extensive use since 2009, and is particularly well characterized with dozens of calibration flights and a careful program of boresight angle determination and monitoring. The UAF-GI LiDAR has a precision of +/- 8 cm and accuracy of +/- 15 cm. The photogrammetry DEM simultaneously acquired with the LiDAR relies on precise shutter timing using an event marker input to the IMU associated with the LiDAR system. The photo positions are derived from the fully coupled GPS/IMU processing, which samples at 100 Hz and is able to directly calculate the antenna to image plane offset displacements from the full orientation data. This use of the GPS/IMU solution means that both the LiDAR and Cessna 180 photogrammetry DEM share trajectory input data, however no orientation data nor ground control is used for the photorammetry processing.\nThe photogrammetry DEMs are overlaid on the LiDAR point cloud and analyzed for horizontal shifts or warps relative to the LiDAR. No warping or horizontal shifts have been detectable for a number of photogrammetry DEMs. Vertical offsets range from +/- 30 cm, with a typical standard deviation about that mean of 10 cm or better. LiDAR and photogrammetry function inherently differently over trees and brush, and direct comparisons between the two methods show much larger differences over vegetated areas. Finally, the differences in flight patterns associated with the two methods will be discussed, highlighting the photogrammetry requirements for a well planned grid pattern and the effects of significant end lap and side lap in the imagery coverage.",

            "abstract": "The exceptionally close encounter of long-period comet comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) to Mars on October 19, 2014, may result in the first meteor observations in the atmosphere of Mars. Large (few-mm to cm-sized) meteoroids are not easily observed by other techniques. The manner in which these meteoroids fragment will shed light on the physical properties of large freshly-ejected dust grains of a long-period comet, which carry most of the comet's mass loss. Their physical properties may be very different than those of the much more aged meteoroids typically encountered in annual meteor showers and the sporadic meteor background. The 2014 May 24 close encounter of comet 209P/LINEAR to Earth, for example, showed that the meteoroids ejected by this short-period comet about 100 years ago were still unusually fragile, some breaking vigorously into a cloud of dust towards the end of their entry trajectories. Moreover, the meteoroid stream encountered by Earth was dominated by small meteoroids, with a steep differential mass distribution index of s = 2.42+/-0.15 (0.003-4 g) and a differential size distribution index of a = 5.3 +/- 0.4 (0.2-2 cm). The fragile nature of the grains is likely the reason for the lack of large meteoroids in the stream. The encounter with comet Siding Spring may shed light onto the question whether this is because they do not survive the ejection process (in which case the shower on Mars would also lack bright meteors) or because they do not survive the thermal cycling in interplanetary space for more than a century or so (in which case larger meteoroids may still be present in the stream).",

            "abstract": "Proxy data reveal the existence of episodes of increased deposition of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial period. These are interpreted as massive iceberg discharges mainly from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Although these have long been attributed to self-sustained ice sheet oscillations, growing evidence points to an active role of the oceanic circulation. Here we present simulations of the last glacial period carried out with a hybrid ice sheet–ice shelf model. Two mechanisms producing iceberg discharges are compared. First, we reproduce the classic binge-purge by which the iceberg surges are produced thanks to the existence of an internal thermo-mechanical feedback that allows the ice sheet to behave under an oscillatory regime. Second, our ice-sheet model is forced by an oceanic warming index derived from proxy data that accounts for the impact of past ocean circulation changes on ocean temperatures. In this case, the model generates a time series of iceberg calving that agrees with ice-rafted debris records over the past 80 ka. We compare the two theories and discuss their advantages and weaknesses in terms of both the robustness of the physics on which they are based and their comparison with proxies.",

            "abstract": "The last deglaciation (~ 21-9 ka) presents a series of opportunities to study the underlying mechanisms of abrupt climate changes and long-term trends in the Earth System. Most of the forcings are relatively well constrained and geological archives record responses over a range of timescales. Despite this, large uncertainties remain over the feedback loops that culminated in the collapse of the great Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and a consensus has yet to be reached on the chains of events that led to rapid surface warming and cooling during this period.\nClimate models are powerful tools for quantitatively assessing these outstanding issues through their ability to temporally resolve cause and effect, as well as break down the contributions from different forcings. This is well demonstrated by pioneering work; for example by Liu et al. (2009), Roche et al. (2011), Gregoire et al. (2012) and Menviel et al. (2011). However, such work is not without challenges; model-geological data mismatches remain unsolved and it is difficult to compare results from different models with unique experiment designs.\nTherefore, we have established a multidisciplinary Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project working group to coordinate transient climate model simulations and geological archive compilations of the last deglaciation. Here, we present the plans and progress of the working group in its first phase of activity; the investigation of Heinrich Stadial 1 and the lead into the Bolling warming event. We describe the set-up of the core deglacial experiment, explain our approach for dealing with uncertain climate forcings and outline our solutions to challenges posed by this research.\nBy defining a common experiment design, we have built a framework to include models of different speeds, complexities and resolution, maximising the reward of this varied approach. One of the next challenges is to compile transient proxy records and develop a methodology for dealing with uncertainty and error in model-geological data comparisons.\nThrough this global and interdisciplinary initiative, we combine multi-proxy records with a suite of different modelling techniques to test hypotheses for abrupt climate changes and reconstruct the chain of events that deglaciated the Earth 21-9 ka.",

However despite the rapid evolution and growing complexity in models of science-society interaction, the rate and breath of use of scientific knowledge in environmental decision making, especially related to climate variability and change, remain below expectations. This suggests a persistent gap between production and use that, to date, efforts to rethink and restructure science production have not been able to surmount. To begin to understand why this gap persists, I review different models of science-policy interfaces to understand how they have influenced the organization of knowledge production and application. Included in this review is a consideration of general and specific knowledge used (or not) for decision- and policy-making at different scales focusing on the water sector. Lastly, the review considers what structures or interconnections need to be in place to foster incorporation of knowledge in ways that foster more resilient governance and management decisions. Building on this review, I then explore how new approaches to the creation of knowledge have emerged and what gaps remain in fostering greater use of knowledge in environmental decision making.",

Despite this baseline data shortage, many of Alaska’s coastal communities are involved in mitigation or adaptation efforts in response to natural hazards such as erosion and flooding. To provide coastal communities with the tools that are necessary to support local decision-making, the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) has undertaken focused field studies to improve quality, quantity and access to coastal datasets such as topography, nearshore bathymetry, rates of shoreline change and relevant water levels. These efforts are inclusive of both standard approaches (e.g. lidar, repeat coastal profile measurements, Digital Shoreline Analysis System assessments and fully-instrumented tide stations) as well as alternative methodologies that improve our ability to economically accomplish this work in harsh, remote areas (e.g. Structure From Motion surface models, quantification of local knowledge observations, stop-gap tidal datum conversion tools, and pressure-sensor water level networks). We present a comprehensive summary of the geographic variability of coastal dynamics and geohazard potential along the Alaska shoreline, from the erosion-prone North Slope coastline to low-lying areas in western Alaska that are at elevated risk to storm surge inundation. This work provides a graphical summary of the existing quality and spatial extent of data in Alaskan coastal communities while highlighting critical data gaps, such as high-precision elevation models, which are delaying more robust flood and erosion vulnerability mapping. By outlining ongoing work and providing examples from recent DGGS projects we will showcase some of the new vulnerability mapping tools under development for our state and also identify opportunities for necessary collaborations in the Alaska coastal zone.",

            "abstract": "While discussions of global climate change tend to center on greenhouse gases and sea level\nrise, other factors, such as technological developments, land and energy use, economics, and population\ngrowth all play a critical role in understanding climate change. There is increasing urgency for methods\nto forecast how different sectors, in particular ecosystems and the goods and services they provide, may\nbe altered as a result of climate change. However, due to their complexity, it is difficult to assess these\necosystem services at a single point in space or time, as they may be influenced by surrounding and\ndistant patterns of land use and biophysical attributes in addition to climate change. In order to make\nmeaningful conservation and adaptation choices, specific ecosystem components must be viewed in\nrelation to future climate information. The US Environmental Protection Agency and its partners, have\ndeveloped EnviroAtlas, a web‐based geospatial tool that allows users to interact with climate change\nmodeling information while simultaneously providing a range of information and data on different\necosystem goods and services. This can be a useful platform for inquiry about the supply, demand, or\nbenefits provided by a specific ecosystem service, and to understand the potential impacts to that\necosystem service due to our changing climate. Housing a variety of data in one publicly available tool\nencourages users to think in new, trans‐disciplinary ways that focus on the relationships between\necosystem services and climate change impacts. By combining many fields of research through this easyto‐\nuse interface, the result is a novel tool that is spatially and temporally explicit and enables better\ndecision making across multiple sectors. This talk will illustrate how the information presented in\nEnviroAtlas can be used in research.",

Numerical weather prediction models and decision support tools have been developed to provide forecasters a better basis for forecasting heavy precipitation and consequent flooding. The HMT also involves a joint project with California Department of Water Resources (CA-DWR) and the Scripps Institute for Oceanography (SIO) as part of CA-DWR's Enhanced Flood Response and Emergency Preparedness (EFREP) program. The HMT activities have included development and calibration of a distributed hydrologic model, the NWS Office of Hydrologic Development’s (OHD) Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM), to prototype the distributed approach for flood and other water resources applications. HMT has applied RDHM to the Russian-Napa watersheds for research assessment of gap-filling weather radars for precipitation and hydrologic forecasting and for establishing a prototype to inform both the NWS Monterey Forecast Office and the California Nevada River Forecast Center (CNRFC) of RDHM capabilities.\nIn this presentation, a variety of precipitation forcings generated with and without gap filling radar and rain gauge data are used as input to RDHM to assess the hydrologic response for selected case study events. Both the precipitation forcing and hydrologic model are run at different spatial and temporal resolution in order to examine the sensitivity of runoff to the precipitation inputs. Based on the timing of the events and the variations of spatial and temporal resolution, the parameters which dominate the hydrologic response are identified. The assessment is implemented at two USGS stations (Ukiah near Russian River and Austin Creek near Cazadero) that are minimally influenced by managed flows and objective evaluation can thus be derived. The results are assessed using statistical metrics, including daily Nash scores, Pearson Correlation, and sub daily timing errors.",

            "abstract": "With global population predicted to reach around 9 billion by 2050 and the area of arable land per person declining, there is increased focus on the need to increase food production. As part of a systematic response to that need, improved monitoring of global food production has been identified by the G20 as a priority. The Global Agricultural Monitoring initiative has been established under the Group on Earth Observations (known as GEOGLAM) as a response to this need, with initial focus on the four main food crops of the world and the major exporting regions. However, it is not only the world’s croplands that will come under pressure to further increase their productivity and production. Global rangelands, scrublands and pasturelands must become more productive in producing grassland plant biomass and increased animal protein production, to supply an ever-growing global demand for essential animal protein. An essential complementary focus is needed on the sustainability of these systems to both ensure sustained productivity and to maintain the broader range of ecosystem services providing out of these large global lands. Termed “GEOGLAM Rangelands and Pasture Productivity (RAPP)”, this new GEO initiative will provide the global community with the means to monitor the world’s rangelands and pasture lands on a routine basis, and the capacity to produce animal protein in real-time, at global, regional and national levels. The primary scope of RAPP will be to monitor aboveground biomass and the condition of land cover for those lands and ecosystems that are integral to producing animal protein on a ‘free-range’, open-field basis, and their sustainable management. Using available national animal herd statistics, aims to include global and regional population information on beef cattle, goats, sheep, camels, pork, dairy cattle, wild and managed buffalo and deer. This paper will provide a broad overview of the status of implementation of the RAPP monitoring system, and some highlights of the Australian pilot and partnerships that are contributing to this GEO task.",

            "abstract": "The OMPS/LP was launched on board the NPP space platform in October 2011. Over the past two years, the OMPS/LP was used to retrieve the global distribution of ozone and aerosol. The paper will describe the aerosol product, which NASA is presently preparing for public release.\nThe current OMPS/LP aerosol product consists of latitude-altitude curtains along the NPP Sun-synchronous orbit, from cloud top to about 40 km. These curtains extend from local sunrise in Southern polar region to local sunset in Northern polar region. Aerosol extinctions are produced at five distinct wavelengths, namely 513, 525, 670, 750 and 870 nm, with a sampling of 1 km in vertical direction and 1 degree latitude in the along-track direction. The OMPS/LP aerosol dataset is fairly large, with 7000 vertical profiles produced each day for each wavelength. The aerosol product will be presented in terms of extinction monthly median values and mean Angstrom coefficient (particle size).\nOver the past two years, the Junge layer was affected by several events such as volcanic eruptions (Nabro and Kelut) and a meteor (Chelyabinsk), the effects of which are clearly visible in the OMPS/LP dataset. The Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) can also be observed in the OMPS/LP dataset. Moreover the effect of the Brewer Dobson Circulation (BDC) can be observed at high altitudes: the BDC velocity at 35 km can be estimated from the time variation of iso-density heights and was found to compare well with BDC velocities evaluated with the water vapor tape recorder technique as well as MERRA model values. Finally, aerosol filaments are clearly visible in OMPS/LP aerosol dataset as they appear as distinct \"bubbles\" on the OMPS/LP curtain files at periodic intervals in both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. These filaments are a main source of transport from tropical to polar region, and OMPS/LP data can therefore be instrumental in quantifying the rate of this transport.\nThe quality of the OMPS/LP aerosol product is being assessed by comparison with correlative measurements made by CALIPSO, OSIRIS and GOMOS.

            "abstract": "It has been said that scientists and experts usually use 80% of their research time for data management (DOE, 2002). Only 20% of research time is used for purely scientific activities. This ratio should be reversed by introducing computer science technology. To realize this goal, the Japanese government supported the development of a data system called “Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS),” as one of the national key projects promoted by the Council for Science and Technology Policy (CSTP) from 2006 to 2010. A follow-up 5-year project is also ongoing. The essential aim for the DIAS was to create knowledge that would enable solutions to problems and generate socioeconomic benefits. DIAS mainly consists of four data components including data injection, management, integration, and interoperability.\nDIAS is now tackling a large increase in the diversity and volume of data from observing the Earth. Dictionaries have been developing an ontology system for technical and geographical terms, and a metadata design has been completed according to international standards. The volume of data stored has exponentially increased. Previously, almost all of the large-volume data came from satellites, but model outputs occupy the largest volume of our data storage nowadays. In collaboration with scientific and technological groups, DIAS can accelerate data archiving by including data loading, quality checking, metadata registration, and our system data-searching capability is being enriched. DIAS also enables us to perform integrated research and realize interdisciplinarity. Essentially, we are now working in the fields of climate, water resources, food, fisheries, and biodiversity by collaborating between different disciplines and trying to develop bases of contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

In the basin region, there are 17 cities altogether, including the province city Chengdu. By applying the leaf biomass, emission factor and the meteorological variables, the BVOCs emissions were estimated. The leaf biomasses for different vegetation species were deduced from the local forest volume data, leaf biomass density data, the relevant statistic data combining with the local vegetation distribution data. The emission factor mainly cited from the domestic research. The meteorological variables were simulated by the WRF model. The inventory showed that in the year of 2012,the emission of BVOCs was 487kt in Sichuan Basin,of which isoprene contributes about 64% (314kt), monoterpenes and other VOCs both 18 %(85kt).Mianyang city emitted 121kt in 2012,being the largest contributor, followed by Guangyuan city(110kt).The average emission intensity of BVOCs in the Basin was 2.63 t/km2,the high intensity region mainly distributed around the basin edge.

            "abstract": "Historical records as far back as 1600 document 79 damaging earthquakes and 50 tsunamis in the E. Sunda-Banda Arc transition. One of the largest events in 1629 generated a tsunami that reached a height of >16 m. Another event in 1674 caused a submarine landslide that produced a tsunami >100 m based on the vegetation trim line. An earthquake storm struck the region between 1814 and 1857. During this time there were two mega-earthquakes (1820 and 1852) felt throughout most of Indonesia, which generated tsunamis as high as 26 m. Tsunamis also occurred from earthquakes in 1814, 1818, 1836 and 1857, and the eruption of Tambora (1815). This eruption is the one of the most notable extreme historical geohazards not only in the Indonesian region, but globally. The earthquake storm ended with an event along the north coast of East Timor in 1857, which caused a 3 m tsunami that inundated the capital city of Dili and flooded many villages. Tsunamigenic earthquakes have also struck the area around Kupang, West Timor, which is one of the main commercial centers of the region with a population of half a million. The population of the region is now at least 10 million. Another 2 million people live along the coast of the Makassar Strait, which has experienced 18 tsunamis since the 1820 earthquake. Most people now live in cities, most cities have unreinforced masonry construction and some are in historical tsunami inundation zones. Cities along the NW coast of Australia are also at risk of a tsunami from mega-thrust earthquakes along parts of the Timor Trough, which accumulates strain at the rate of 22 mm/a. No major earthquakes are documented along the Timor to Tanimbar part of the plate boundary since historical records have been kept. However, a major mega-thrust earthquake (8.5-9.0) occurred along the Tanimbar trough in 1852, which caused an 8 m tsunami. We have modeled both the 1629 and 1852 mega-thrust events and used these data to map inundation zones for coastal communities. We have also discovered deposits from these and other tsunamis throughout the region. Much of the historical records are now translated into Indonesian. The WAVES team of the Non-Profit Organization ‘In Harms Way’ is distributing the records throughout the region and has made > 30 presentations in cities and villages in tsunami inundation zones.

            "abstract": "Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) inhabit regions rich in biodiversity that play an important role in the local and regional water cycle. Canopy plants such as epiphytes and hemiepiphytes are an important component of the biodiversity in the TMCF and therefore play a significant role in the carbon, nutrient and water cycles. With only partial or no access to resources on the ground, canopy plants may be vulnerable to changes in climate that increase canopy temperatures and decrease atmospheric humidity or precipitation inputs. Despite their importance in the TMCF, there is little information regarding drought tolerance and water balance in this community. In this study we quantified variation in functional traits and water relations in 12 species of epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in a Costa Rican TMCF. We also generated pressure-volume curves and xylem vulnerability curves that we used as indicators of drought tolerance. Lastly, we determined the capacity for foliar water uptake in the laboratory and measured whole-plant transpiration in the field. We found that all species had a high turgor loss point (ψTLP), high vulnerability to cavitation (P50), and low bulk elastic modulus (εmax, i.e. high cell wall elasticity). These results indicate that capacitance may be high in canopy plants and that stored water may help to maintain high leaf water potentials during dry periods. We also found that all species had the capacity for foliar uptake and that this process contributed substantially to their water status and water balance. On average, foliar uptake contributed to the reabsorption of 70% of the water transpired over a 34-day period at the beginning of the dry season. Our results indicate that canopy plants can mitigate water loss substantially, but they may be vulnerable to changes in the overall precipitation patterns or increases in cloud base heights.",

The target is a reduction in CO2 emissions of 139 Mt/year by 2050. To encourage uptake of CCS by industry, the province has provided partial funding to two demonstration scale projects, namely the Quest Project by Shell and partners (CCS), and the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line Project (pipeline and CO2-EOR). Important to commercial scale implementation of CCS will be the requirement to prove conformance and containment of the CO2 plume injected during the lifetime of the CCS project. This will be a challenge for monitoring programs. The Containment and Monitoring Institute (CaMI) is developing a Field Research Station (FRS) to calibrate various monitoring technologies for CO2 detection thresholds at relatively shallow depths. The objective being assessed with the FRS is sensitivity for early detection of loss of containment from a deeper CO2 storage project. In this project, two injection wells will be drilled to sandstone reservoir targets at depths of 300 m and 700 m. Up to four observation wells will be drilled with monitoring instruments installed. Time-lapse surface and borehole monitoring surveys will be undertaken to evaluate the movement and fate of the CO2 plume. These will include seismic, microseismic, cross well, electrical resistivity, electromagnetic, gravity, geodetic and geomechanical surveys. Initial baseline seismic data from the FRS will presented.",

            "abstract": "In the Arctic and northern North Atlantic, the relationships between ocean and climate are complex as sea-surface temperatures (SST) are intimately related to salinity, water mass stratification and sea-ice cover. From this viewpoint, the assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), whose distribution is dependent upon all the above mention parameters, yield proxies of sea-surface conditions and reveal particularly useful for the reconstruction of past ocean conditions in such environments. Analysis of dinocyst assemblages and application of the modern analogue technique in more than 30 sediment cores were used to document the surface ocean changes in the northern North Atlantic and Arctic oceans during the Holocene. Among salient features, we note little variations in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Channels. In contrast, relatively large amplitude variations in the Chukchi Sea and the Barents Sea are recorded and suggest millennial type oscillations with amplitude exceeding long-term trends (e.g., up to 4°C in summer SST). Data also indicate an almost opposite pacing between the western and eastern Arctic. Another important feature is the major SST-increase and sea-ice cover reduction in eastern Baffin Bay and along the south-east Greenland margins at about 7.5 ka ago, linked to the penetration of warmer and more saline North Atlantic water. This led to production of the Labrador Sea Water through winter cooling and convection and was followed by a reorganisation of water masses in the Nordic seas around 7.0 ka. The ~ 7.5-7.0 ka transition thus marks the actual onset of “interglacial” conditions in the subpolar North Atlantic. Whereas a more or less diachronic “thermal optimum” might be recorded at some sites during the early-mid Holocene, a strong regionalism in trends and millennial-scale instabilities persisted throughout the postglacial. Finally, one should mention that last decade variations of ocean conditions in these basins exceed those of the mid-late Holocene, notably for what concerns the sea ice cover.",

            "abstract": "Climatic changes are recorded by biogenic remains fossilized in marine sediment. These remains and their chemical and isotopic properties allow the establishment of times series of ocean/climate parameters (temperature, sea ice cover, salinity, productivity), as well as of inland vegetation (from pollen grains in continental margin sediments). Such \"paleoclimate\" studies provide a comprehensive picture of Holocene climate changes at low to mid latitudes but Arctic-subarctic regions remain poorly documented. The rarity of representative records is mostly due to their remote and difficult access, as well as to the generally low biogenic content of marine sediment because of low productivity and/or poor preservation of biominerals (carbonates and opal). Moreover, when available, time series from Arctic-subarctic often suffer poor time resolution and chronological control. Nevertheless, a few paleoclimate records are available. Some of the best-resolved time series are from the Canadian Arctic (eastern and northern Baffin bay, Hudson Strait). They show large amplitude changes during the glacial/interglacial transition in relation with meltwater discharge rates and sea-level changes, and point to the inception of full “postglacial conditions” some 7000 years ago only. Since then, they also recorded millennial type oscillations of smaller amplitude, but out of phase in the western vs eastern subpolar North Atlantic. Paleoclimate reconstructions from marine cores often provide a picture of a \"mean\" decadal to centennial state of the environment because of the time span represented by sediment samples adding to smoothing effect of sea-floor sediment mixing by benthic organisms. In contradistinction, humane occupation and mobility might be more directly influenced by climate instabilities and extreme events, whose documentation from sedimentary archives represents a real challenge for the geoscience community.",

            "abstract": "Convection in porous media controls mass and energy transport in many natural and engineered systems. The convective flux driven by solute transport in a porous medium with hydrodynamic dispersion is determined by the balance between buoyant driving forces and dissipation by either molecular diffusion or mechanical dispersion. Numerical results show that the dimensionless flux, given by the Sherwood number, only scales linearly with the Rayleigh number, if both dissipative mechanisms are included, Rah = 1/(1/Ram+1/Rad). Here Ram is the standard diffusive Rayleigh number and Rad=H/αt is a dispersive Rayleigh number, where H is the domain height and αt is the transverse dispersivity. Due to the nonlinear feedback induced by the velocity dependence of mechanical dispersion, Rad does not contain physical parameters from Darcy's law and depends only the thickness of the formation H and its transverse macrodispersivity αt. The ratio of these Rayleigh numbers Δ=Ram/Rad determines the contribution of mechanical dispersion to dissipation and identifies diffusion limited (Δ«1) and dispersion limited (Δ»1) convection regimes. In both natural and laboratory systems, convection is commonly dispersion limited so that the solute flux is determined by Rad and not by Ram as commonly assumed in previous studies. Our results, therefore, change the fundamental governing paramter for solute driven convection in porous media and the determination of macrodispersivities is a key component for the reasonable estimate of the solute driven convective flux.",

            "abstract": "This presentation addresses how the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite mission under discussion between NASA and ISRO - entitled NISAR - will help us better understand and project the evolution of ice sheets and glaciers in a changing climate. NISAR is a dedicated L-band interferometry mission that will document changes in ice flow dynamics, grounding line positions and other critical boundaries over the lifetime of its mission. Changes in ice sheet dynamics represent by far the largest uncertainty in sea level projections. NISAR will better constrain critical boundaries of ice sheets at the base (basal friction) and at the seaward margins (ice melt rate) by providing the first set of continuous, systematic and comprehensive observations of ice sheet dynamics that will help us better understand ice sheets and glaciers and enable massive data assimilation in numerical ice sheet models. NISAR will contribute observations of areas of irreversible retreat taking place in Greenland and Antarctica, provide detailed time series of glacier velocities throughout entire seasonal cycles, document grounding line dynamics on weekly time scales, enable estimations of temporal and spatial changes in basal friction during glacial retreat; it will also in combination with other data help us map the bed topography of entire ice sheets at a high spatial resolution, document changes in ice shelf melt rate around the periphery of the continents, and provide a first systematic 3D vector mapping of ice velocity. NISAR will constitute a much needed warning system for ice sheet and ice shelf changes, it will document fundamental processes poorly observed in the past (e.g. calving, ice shelf melt, grounding line dynamics) and enable robust data assimilation to play a critical role in reducing uncertainties of coupled numerical models of ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions.

            "abstract": "One factor for some Americans being confused about climate change is their lack of understanding its underlying science concepts (Somerville & Hassol, 2011). In spite of this, climate change has been under-emphasized in school curricula (Bardsley & Bardsley, 2007). This is an important challenge for science educators, especially given the increasing public awareness of climate change impacts in their everyday lives (NCADAC, 2013).\nOne way to address this challenge is to involve teachers in professional learning projects with the expectation that their enhanced content and pedagogical knowledge about climate change will transfer into more effective instruction resulting in increased student learning. For teacher educators, this translates into providing vibrant professional learning activities that energize and engage science teachers to develop interesting lessons that stimulate their students to learn important science concepts and develop positive attitudes to science.\nThis study examined content knowledge and views about climate change of 33 high school science teachers and their1050 students who participated in lessons developed in a NASA-funded professional learning project. The teachers participated in a seven-day climate change summer institute and received in-classroom follow-up support throughout the school year. Teacher data sources included a background survey (undergraduate majors, number of years teaching science), science teaching self-efficacy (STEBI-A) scores, Climate Science Inventory of Knowledge (CSIK), and Six-America’s Views on Climate Change. Student data included journal entries, and pre-post measures using the CSIK and Six-Americas instruments. T-tests and ANOVA showed that both students and their teachers increased in climate science knowledge. Teachers’ views about climate change were more aligned to climate scientists’ views. Teachers also increased in their science teaching self-efficacy and those with higher self-efficacy demonstrated higher climate change science knowledge.\nIn addition to these data, the professional learning model and examples of the hands-on activities utilized by teachers will be shared in this presentation.

            "abstract": "We present the results of a rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy of the Ediacaran Wonoka Fm., from the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. The Wonoka Fm. records the Shuram C-isotope excursion, and the results of this study provide an estimate of its duration. Measurements of magnetic susceptibility (MS) were made in the field with a portable susceptibility meter (GF Instruments SM-20) every 0.4 m over 600 m of dominantly carbonate stratigraphic section, with a 100 meter interval of fine sand turbidites. We filter the data series to pass wavelengths shorter than 300 meters (the Rayleigh frequency for our data series) and use Multi Taper Method (MTM) time series analysis to estimate the power spectrum of the series. We fit a red noise model to the MTM spectrum and calculate 99% chi squared confidence limits to identify cycles with statistical significance. Unambiguous spectral peaks rise above the 99% confidence level with wavelengths of 116.9 m, 45.5 m, 23.1 m, 7.0 m, 2.5 m, 1.7 m, 1.3 m, 1.2 m, 0.9 m, and 0.8 m. Haines (1988, Sed. Geo. V 58) recognizes cycles in clastic sediment delivery to the carbonate portions of the Wonoka with an average wavelength of 8 m and hypothesizes a climate driver related to Milankovitch cycles. The 7 m cycle in MS is likely a more precise measure of the same phenomenon. Furthermore, cycles with wavelengths of 24.1 m, 7.0 m, 1.7m, 1.26 m, and 0.9 m exhibit ratios matching modeled durations of long eccentricity (405 kyr), short eccentricity (123 kyr), obliquity (29 kyr), and the 2 periods of precession (19 and 14 kyr) for the late Neoproterozoic. This interpretation yields a duration of 10 Myr for the 600 m we sampled. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate yields an 11.3 Myr estimate for the ~675 m thick Shuram C-isotope excursion. However, uncertainty lies in applying the MTM-based estimate to the turbidite section. Our estimate will be refined and compared with laboratory rock magnetic measurements in an ongoing study of the Wonoka Fm.",

Earth Syst. Sci. 17, 2013). Hence, if a functional relationship between the stormflow and storage optimized for the conversion in the fixed source area covering the entire catchment is applied to that for its variable condition with less rainfall amounts, we may inversely examine the storage dynamics such as time or spatial changes in the source area and the water-pressure propagation within it by comparing the assumed application results with the observed rainfall and runoff records. Based on this methodology, we attempted to analyze observed stormflow responses in small headwater catchments to estimate the storage dynamics, and the analyzed results were also examined against hydrometric observations within the soil layer to detect the hydraulic mechanisms of stormflow. This study may have a potential for a re-evaluation of physical backgrounds in lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models widely used as practical tools for stormflow in active tectonic regions with large-magnitude storms like Japan.",

These areas include: (1) rapid and unobtrusive algorithm integration; (2) intelligent and automatic data movement; (3) automated and rapid extraction text, metadata and language from heterogeneous file formats; and (4) participation and people power via open source communities.\n\nIn this talk I will revisit these four areas and describe current progress; future work and challenges ahead as we move forward in this exciting age of Data Science.",

In order to enhance the teaching and student learning on various issues in the Environmental Sciences Programs, Climatology, Climate Change Sciences and Adaptation or related courses were developed at Delaware State University and its partner institutions (Virginia State University and Morgan State University). These courses were prepared to deliver information on physical basis for the earth's climate system and current climate change instruction modules by AMS and historic climate information (NOAA Climate Services, U.S. and World Weather Data, NCAR and NASA Climate Models). By using Global Seminar as a Model, faculty members worked in teams to engage students in videoconferencing on climate change through Contemporary Global Studies and climate courses including Climate Change and Adaptation Science, Sustainable Agriculture, Introduction to Environmental Sciences, Climatology, and Ecology and Adaptation courses.

Although they are characterized as the F-region plasma density irregularities, they are substantially controlled by the E-region effect such as the conductivity gradient in the evening and patchy sporadic-E layers.

            "abstract": "Talus does not always indicate mass wasting due to destructive faulting, landslides, or caldera collapse. That talus slopes might be constructed during submarine volcanic eruptions was first recognized in 2005 from ROV observations and samples of lava that dripped over a cliff of a steep pillow mound of the 1996 eruption on the Gorda Ridge. Such talus was also found in 2013 along the steep pillow ridge that formed on the South Rift of Axial Volcano during the 2011 eruption. At each site, wedges and stubby cylinders of broken glass-rimmed pillow lava lie at the base of a vertical cliff of truncated pillows, as they do in other places where faults may have broken them. However, more telling evidence of this process is slender, elongate glassy rods of lava, which we call “lavacicles” from their resemblance to icicles, which were lying below the overhanging cliffs from which they had dripped and fallen. The drips can be phyric and aphyric lava, primitive to evolved in composition. Therefore they don’t indicate a particular basaltic composition or viscosity; they probably result from very slow eruption rate that builds a steep stack of pillows.\nIn 1 meter resolution AUV bathymetric maps, these talus slopes appear much like talus found at the base of fault-block slices at other parts of those ridges and at the highly faulted Endeavour Segment, however these pillow ridges are too young to have been tectonically faulted. Their orientations are not necessarily aligned with the dominant strike of faults in the area, but instead with the outline of the pillow mounds. We now have identified numerous other constructional talus slopes at Gorda and Juan de Fuca Ridges, Alarcon Rise, and Davidson Seamount off California that meet this criterion so are likely to be constructional also. At intermediate rate ridges constructional talus and cliffs contribute a small amount of the area, but perhaps significant permeability pathways for hydrothermal circulation.",

The opposite is true for containment structures and caprocks. The complex stress state coupled with pre-existing fracture networks means that new flow pathways may develop in complex ways including varied modes of dilatation and slip, deformation that may be seismic or aseismic and permeability that may net increase of decrease. Where this deformation relies on either the reactivation, extension or development of fractures, this evolution is intrinsically scale dependent requiring that an improved understanding of this dynamic response must interrogate its evolution at representative scales – scales of decimeters to a few meters. We explore the controls on instability through frictional slip and instability including changes related to environmental conditions and physical properties. The former relate to changes in effective stress driven by fluid pressures, thermal and chemical stresses and the latter to changes in strength and stability conditioned on initial or evolving mineralogy. We identify important contemporary questions that are intrinsically scale dependent and may be effectively probed by field experimentation linking deformation and permeability.",

A targeted approach to science questions has resulted in leveraging new scientific knowledge to improve not only our understanding of the Heliophysics domain, but also to develop predictive capabilities in key areas of LWS science. This fascinating interplay between science and applications promises to benefit both domains. Scientists providing feedback to the LWS program are now discussing an evolution of the targeted approach that explicitly considers how new science improves, or enables, predictive capability directly. Long-term program goals are termed “Strategic Science Areas” (SSAs) that address predictive capabilities in six specific areas: geomagnetically induced currents, satellite drag, solar energetic particles, ionospheric total electron content, radio frequency scintillation induced by the ionosphere, and the radiation environment. SSAs are organized around user needs and the impacts of space weather on society.\nScientists involved in the LWS program identify targeted areas of research that reference (or bear upon) societal needs. Such targeted science leads to new discoveries and is one of the valid forms of exploration.

These changes in ecosystem function and services typically result from shifts in climate or land use and are enhanced by positive feedbacks with the biota and human societies. Here we show the important role of ecohydrological feedbacks in determining pathways of land degradation and highlight their long range environmental and societal impacts. Crucial to several desertification feedbacks is plants’ sensitivity to limited water availability and the ability of vegetation to modify its physical environment. We investigate how by reducing soil susceptibility to wind erosion and dust emissions plants can improve the hydrological conditions that are crucial to their survival.

These are\nthe dusty plasma environment near Enceladus, in particular within its plume\nthe dusty plasma environment in the Saturn inner plasma disk enveloping the E-ring\nthe aerosol-plasma environment in Titan’s deep ionosphere.\nIt is also believed to affect the dynamics substantially in a comet coma, now studied by Rosetta. The motion of plasma is changed considerably by the presence of substantial amounts of charged dust due to the added effect of gravity and radiation pressure forces on the dust component, thereby affecting the dynamics of the magnetosphere. Conversely the Lorentz force affects the charged dust through electric and magnetic fields that normally govern the motion of the plasma. Part of the dust size distribution should be considered a component of the plasma collective ensemble. The Cassini RPWS Langmuir Probe clearly detects a difference between the electron and ion number densities in all these regions, from which the total charge density of the negatively charged dust can be estimated. Moreover, the Cassini electron spectrometer (CAPS/ELS) detects negatively charged nanometer sized particles both in Titan’s ionosphere as well as in Enceladus’ plume. The inferred number densities are consistent with the Langmuir probe measurements. Here, the dust absorption of electrons is so strong that an ion-dust plasma is created with few free electrons. In the case of Titan’s ionosphere this triggers the formation of aerosols that then diffuse to the ground. We show here new measurements from the E-ring showing electron density depletions due to dust absorption, a dust tail region of Enceladus, and confirm the consistency between measurements of negative ions by CAPS/ELS and the Radio and Plasma Wave Science Langmuir Probe (RPWS/LP) in Titan’s ionosphere. We will also show initial hints regarding dust-plasma interaction near comets from the Rosetta Langmuir probe instrument (LAP).",

            "abstract": "The increasing global demand for farmland products is placing unprecedented pressure on the global agricultural system. The increasing demand can be met through either the intensification or the expansion of agricultural production at the expenses of other ecosystems. The ongoing escalation of large scale land acquisitions in the developing world may contribute to both of these two processes. Investments in agriculture have become a priority for a number of governments and corporations that are trying to expand their agricultural production while securing good profits. It is unclear however to what extent these investments are driving the intensification or the expansion of agriculture. In the last decade large scale land acquisitions by external investors have increased at unprecedented rates. This global land rush was likely enhanced by recent food crises, when prices skyrocketed in response to crop failure, new bioenergy policies, and the increasing demand for agricultural products by a growing and increasingly affluent human population. Corporations recognized the potential for high return investments in agricultural land, while governments started to enhance their food security by purchasing large tracts of land in foreign countries. It has been estimated that, to date, about 35.6 million ha of cropland – more than twice the agricultural land of Germany – have been acquired by foreign investors worldwide. As an effect of these land deals the local communities lose legal access to the land and its products. Here we investigate the effect of large scale land acquisition on agricultural intensification or expansion in African countries. We discuss the extent to which these investments in agriculture may increase crop production and stress how this phenomenon can greatly affect the local communities, their food security, economic stability and the long term resilience of their livelihoods, regardless of whether the transfer of property rights is the result of an informed decision and the land was paid at market value.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica is comprised of alpine and terminal glaciers, large expanses of patterned ground, and permanently ice-covered lakes in the valley floors, which are linked by glacial meltwater streams that flow during the austral summer. These valleys were first explored by Robert Scott and his party in 1903. In 1968 the New Zealand Antarctic Program began a gauging network on the Onyx River, a 32 km river in Wright Valley which is the longest river in Antarctica. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological research project our research group has monitored meteorological conditions, glacial mass balance, lake level and streamflow in the adjacent Taylor Valley. The extent of liquid water throughout the landscape is strongly controlled by summer climate, and the availability of liquid water in turn is a limitation to the microscopic life that is present in the diverse habitats in the valleys. We have studied the responses of soil, lake, stream and cryoconite ecosystems through a sustained cooling period that has been driven by atmospheric changes associated with the ozone hole. In the past decade, this cooling period appears to have ceased and summer conditions have become more variable. Three warm sunny summers have occurred since 2001/02. These conditions have created weeks long \"flood events\" in the valleys, causing wet areas to emerge in the soils, thermokarsting in some stream channels and increases in lake level. These flood events can be considered as pulse events that drive an increase in ecosystem connectivity, changing rates of biogeochemical processes and the distribution of biota. Collectively the ecosystems of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are highly responsive to dynamic climatic influences associated with the ozone hole and global warming.",

            "abstract": "While continuous monitoring of stream flow and stream temperature has been a widely used resource for some time, currently there is great potential to expand continuous monitoring to include important water quality parameters such as nutrients and dissolved organic material. In many systems distinguishing between watershed and stream ecosystem controls can be challenging, and the usefulness of such monitoring can be enhanced by application of quantitative models to interpret observed patterns. The glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are surrounded by large expanses of patterned ground devoid of plants. In contrast, many streams have thriving cyanobacterial mats that are freeze-dried through the winter and begin photosynthesis with the onset of flow. Thus, the daily signal in terms of biogeochemical processes controlling water quality is generated within the stream. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research project, we have conducted field experiments and developed coupled biogeochemical transport models for the role of hyporheic exchange in controlling weathering of major ions, microbial cycling of nitrogen species, and streams temperature regulation. We have also adapted modelling approaches from sediment transport to understand mobilization of stream biomass with increasing flows. These models are relevant to understanding the role of in-stream processes in diverse stream systems where watershed processes also contribute to observed patterns.",

            "abstract": "The petrologic complexity of the archtypical ‘monotonous intermediate’ Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) has been previously established by a variety of mineralogical and geochemical proxies [1-2], and the unusual storage and eruptive dynamics of the FCT have been delineated by several geochronological studies [3-5]. Titanite is an apparent equilibrium phase in the penultimate FCT magma, and can be linked petrographically to hornblende crystals that preserve up-temperature core-to-rim zoning profiles. As a reactive, trace element-rich phase, we hypothesized that titanite may record an intracrystalline record of magma chamber dynamics. Titanite crystals from the same separate analyzed in [4] were oriented and doubly-polished to yield characteristic wedge-shaped cross-sectional wafers approximately 300 µm in thickness. BSE imaging guided LA-ICPMS analyses of a full suite of trace elements using a 25 µm beam diameter and crater depth on multiple locations across both sides of the wafer.\nMost titanite crystals are characterized by large variations in trace elements, including at least two generations of REE-enriched, actinide-poor, low Sr, large Eu anomaly cores overgrown by REE-depleted, actinide-rich, high Sr domains with small Eu anomalies and distinctive concave-up middle to heavy REE patterns. Trace element contents and patterns correlate strongly with Eu anomaly; intermediate compositions are abundant and spatially correlated to reaction zones between core and rim domains.\nWithin the context of the batholithic rejuvenation model for the FCT magma [1-2], these trace element variations are interpreted to record the partial melting of a differentiated crystalline FCT precursor and its hybridization with a more ‘mafic’ flux. ID-TIMS dating of end-member titanites confirm older ages (ca 28.4 to 29.0 Ma) for cores and define a younger age for rejuvenation of ca 28.2 Ma, consistent with recent U-Pb zircon and 40Ar/39Ar studies [5-7].\n[1] Bachmann & Dungan (2002) Am Mineral 87, 1062–1076.

Spatio-temporal variability of potential drivers – hydroclimate and water use – influencing the freshwater sustainability are examined both individually as well as collectively by considering the eco-region and 4-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-4)as the spatial reference for the analysis. A detailed analysis on national water use also indicates a north-south gradient with Frostbelt being more efficient in water use as opposed to the Sunbelt. This basically stems from the understanding of regional cross-differences in public supply consumption per capita which is significantly low in high-income urban counties. National analyses on agricultural water use efficiency (i.e., per-acreage application) also shows sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation being the primary drivers of differences in agricultural consumption. Given the well-known hydroclimatic west (arid)-east (humid) gradient across the Sunbelt, the study also evaluates the role of flow anomalies – represented by the changes in magnitude, frequency and timing of extremes (high flows and low flows) and by the changes in seasonality – in influencing native fish diversity patterns, as a proxy for freshwater biodiversity, in virgin basins and in basins influenced by significant storage and pumping. Cross-regional differences in water consumption during and after droughts are also presented in the context of adaptations and policy relevance.",

DYNAMICO solves the multi-layer rotating shallow-water equations, a compressible variant of the same equivalent to a discretization of the hydrostatic primitive equations (HPE) in a Lagrangian vertical coordinate, and the HPE in a hybrid mass-based vertical coordinate.\nIn line with more general lines of thought known as physics-preserving discretizations and discrete differential geometry, kinematics and dynamics are separated as strictly as possible. This separation means that the transport of mass, scalars and potential temperature uses no information regarding the specific momentum equation being solved. This disregarded information includes the equation of state as well as any metric information, and is used only for certain terms of the momentum budget, written in Hamiltonian, vector-invariant form.\nThe common Hamiltonian structure of the various equations of motion (Tort and Dubos, 2014 ; Dubos and Tort, 2014) is exploited to formulate energy-conserving spatial discretizations in a unified way. Furthermore most of the model code is common to the three sets of equations solved, making it easier to develop and validate each piece of the model separately. This design permits to consider several extensions in the near future, especially to deep-atmosphere, moist and non-hydrostatic equations.\nRepresentative academic three-dimensional benchmarks are run and analyzed, showing correctness of the model (Figure : time-zonal statistics from Held and Suarez (1994) simulations). Hopefully preliminary full-physics results will be presented as well.\n",

            "abstract": "Non-dispersive or “young” plasma injection events observed near midnight at Saturn are modulated at the period associated with the winter hemisphere [Kennelly et al., 2013]. Most other periodic dynamics of the magnetosphere are dominated by responses at the period of the summer hemisphere. The anomalous periodicity of plasma injection has not been explained. We present a theoretical explanation of ionospheric control, noting (as do Kennelly et al.) that the growth rate of the interchange instability is controlled by ionospheric conductance although the instability condition does not involve the ionosphere [Southwood and Kivelson, 1989]. The motion of the foot of a flux tube through the ionosphere is impeded by high conductance (line tying). Low conductance allows slippage and rapid growth of the instability. When the ionospheres have very different conductances, flux tube motion may be asymmetrical, with rapid displacement occurring only in the low conductance, winter hemisphere. A rotationally modulated low conductivity in that hemisphere would impose periodicity on injections. Pre-equinox (2009) at Saturn, the northern hemisphere conductance was low but probably varied with rotation phase because of the pattern of field-aligned currents (FACs) thought to rotate about the pole at the northern period, TN[Jia and Kivelson, 2012]. The upward current region in the ionosphere was probably more highly ionized than the downward current region because of electron precipitation. Two predictions follow. (1) The probability of an injection event in the midnight sector should maximize when the downward FAC in the winter hemisphere (conductivity minimum) has rotated into the midnight sector and (2) in northern winter, the tilt of the interchanging flux tube should produce positive radial field perturbations at and above the equator for inward-moving flux tubes and negative radial field perturbations for outward-moving flux tubes. Tests of these predictions will be reported.\n______________\nJia, X., and M. G. Kivelson (2012), J. Geophys. Res., doi:10.1029/2012JA018183\nKennelly, T. J., J. S. Leisner, G. B. Hospodarsky, and D.

            "abstract": "Metabolic rates of microbial communities constitute a key physiological parameter for understanding the in situ growth constraints for life in any environment. Isotope labeling techniques provide a powerful approach for measuring such biological activity, due to the use of isotopically enriched substrate tracers whose incorporation into biological materials can be detected with high sensitivity by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Nano-meter scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) combined with stable isotope labeling provides a unique tool for studying the spatiometabolic activity of microbial populations at the single cell level in order to assess both community structure and population diversity.\nHowever, assessing the distribution and range of microbial activity in complex environmental systems with slow-growing organisms, diverse carbon and nitrogen sources, or heterotrophic subpopulations poses a tremendous technical challenge because the introduction of isotopically labeled substrates frequently changes the nutrient availability and can inflate or bias measures of activity. Here, we present the use of hydrogen isotope labeling with deuterated water as an important new addition to the isotopic toolkit and apply it for the determination of single cell microbial activities by NanoSIMS imaging. This tool provides a labeling technique that minimally alters any aquatic chemical environment, can be administered with strong labels even in minimal addition (natural background is very low), is an equally universal substrate for all forms of life even in complex, carbon and nitrogen saturated systems, and can be combined with other isotopic tracers.\nThe combination of heavy water labeling with the most commonly used NanoSIMS tracer, 15N, is technically challenging but opens up a powerful new set of multi-tracer experiments for the study of microbial activity in complex communities. We present the first truly simultaneous single cell triple isotope system measurements of 2H/1H, 13C/12C and 15N/14N and apply it to study of microbial metabolic heterogeneity and nitrogen metabolism in a continuous culture case study. Our data provide insight into both the diversity of microbial activity rates, as well as patterns of ammonium utilization at the single cell level.",

            "abstract": "We use here SAR interferometry using archived Envisat data to map the interseismic deformation of eastern Tibet. The area under study starts just South of the Haiyuan fault, crosses the eastern termination of the Kunlun fault and the bend on the XianShuiHe fault to the South. It includes the Longriba fault system, an active structure located 150 km west of the Longmen Shan front (Xu et al., 2008, Ren et al., 2013). GPS data suggest that it may accommodate a large part of the present-day relative movement (6-8 mm/yr) between the Aba block and the south China block (Thatcher, 2007, Shen et al 2005). The Longriba and the Longmen Shan faults might be linked at depth by a decollement zone or by ductile shear in the crust (Shu et al., 2008).\nWe process three adjacent Envisat 1000 km long swaths crossing this mountainous and vegetated terrain using a small baseline strategy. The interferograms show numerous phase perturbations that mask the interseismic motion due to : (1) coherence loss, (2) stratified atmospheric delays, (3) DEM error contribution, (4) the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. We will show how we tackle these limitations and display the effect of successive corrections. Focus will first be brought to the corrections applied before filtering and unwrapping, that increase phase spatial continuity. We estimate empirically stratified atmospheric delay polynomial relationship, depending on azimuth and elevation, on wrapped interferograms. We then estimate the local DEM error for each pixel. Multi-looking and filtering are based on various measures of pixel reliability in order to increase the signal to noise ratio of filtered interferograms. Finally, unwrapping is obtained by a region growing algorithm, from the most reliable areas to the least, avoiding to cross layover areas.\nTime series of phase delay maps in the Longriba area are dominated by a side lobe of the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake. After its extraction and correction, principal component analysis clearly evidences a linear trend modulated south of the Longriba fault system by post-seismic transient motion, in agreement with GPS data (Huang et al., 2014). Finally, we obtain a LOS velocity map of interseismic motion with an amplitude of a few mm/yr. We will discuss strain localization along the main eastern Tibet faults and possible vertical motion.",

            "abstract": "One of the potential risks associated with subsurface storage of CO2 is potentially the seepage of CO2 through existing faults and the studies devoted to this topic show that geochemistry plays an important role in rendering these faults as effective conduits for CO2 movement while others show that mineralization due to CO2 injection can result in seep migration and flow channeling. Therefore, understanding the changes in reservoir flow dynamics with time due to geochemical alteration of the porous media and accurately scaling up these changes for representation in field scale models is important to engineer the CO2storage process.\nAfter CO2 is injected in a subsurface, dispersion results in mixing of CO2 with aqueous species present in in-situ brine. The reactions of the dissolved CO2 with rock minerals lead to dissolution and/or formation of precipitates which alter the pore structure by changing the porosity and the permeability. Scale-up of reservoir properties and flow response at a single snapshot of time has been described by other authors, however, scale-up for reactive processes cannot be correctly described just at a single snapshot of time. We use the concept of a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) to explore the scaling characteristics of the reactive transport process. We model the REV using a variance-based statistical approach using high-resolution pore-scale data. For comparison purposes, we also compute the REV for a conservative transport using 3-D pressure data. The REV for reactive process is modeled using three different types of data: CO2 concentration, fluid/matrix pore-network data and dissolution data. For simplicity, we consider the spatial variations along a 2-D slice at various times, rendering this a 3D spatiotemporal dataset. The results indicate that the REV in reservoir with reactive flow changes with time and is greater when compared to the REV for conservative flow. The change in REV with time for reservoirs with reactive flow is due to changes in pore structure because of dissolution. Hence, these results suggest that changes in REV at pore-scale because of dissolution have important implications for CO2 injection at field-scale. These results on pore-scale support the conclusions proposed by other authors about flow channeling and seep migration due to changes in pore structure.",

            "abstract": "Physical exposure assessment in this study shows a methodological possibility to be used as a preliminary case study based on a global approach for flood risk assessment consisting of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The purpose of this preliminary study is to estimate potential flood inundation areas as a hazard (both present and future condition), and flood exposure change over the Asia region with consideration of climate change impacts.\nA flood hazard was characterized by inundation area at the high-resolution of 500 m, location (lowland around rivers), and probability (floods with the 50-year return period). This study introduced a new approach to moderate the global flood hazard and the exposure calculation with significant limitations of current models for continental-scale flood risk assessment by using the flood inundation depth (FID) model based on Manning’s steady, uniform flow resistance formula in extreme case during 25-year simulations based on the global BTOP distributed hydrological model using precipitations from the MRI-AGCM 3.2S with SRES A1B emissions scenarios for present-day (daily data from 1980 to 2004), and end-of-the-21st century (daily data from 2075 to 2099). It effectively simplified the complexity between hydrological and topological variables in a flood risk-prone area with assumption of the effects of natural or artificial levees. Exposure was obtained by combining the hazards at the same resolution to identify affected population by calculating with urbanization ratio and population change ratio of Asian countries from a distributed data of global population (Landscan by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory).\nAs a result of the physical exposure assessment from present to the end-of-the-21st century, potential hazards area and affected population are projected to increase 4.2 % (approximately 75,900 km2) and 3.4 % (approximately 35.1 million people) respectively, because Asian population increases about 43% in the future. We found that Bangladesh was listed at the top as the most high risk country in the Asian region: the largest vulnerable population of the river floods by the impact of climate change. For the flood risk assessment, it is important to understand the characteristic of correlation between hazard and exposure among the Asian countries.",

Understanding controls on granular-flow mobility is critical for accurate hazard prediction. The topographic form of granular-flow paths can vary significantly across different steeplands and is one of the few flow-path properties that can be readily altered by engineered control structures such as closed-type check dams. We use grain-scale numerical modeling (discrete element method simulations) of free-surface, gravity-driven granular flows to investigate how different topographic profiles with the same mean slope and total relief can produce notable differences in flow mobility due to strong nonlinearities inherent to granular-flow dynamics. We describe how varying the profile shape from planar, to convex up, to concave up, as well how varying the number, size, and location of check dams along a flow path, changes flow velocity, thickness, discharge, energy dissipation, impact force and runout distance. Our preliminary results highlight an important path dependence for this nonlinear system, show that caution should be used when predicting flow dynamics from path-averaged properties, and provide some mechanics-based guidance for engineering control structures.",

            "abstract": "Crusts of the terrestrial planets other than Earth are dominated by mafic / ultramafic volcanics, with some contractional tectonics and minor extension. This description may also fit the early Earth. Therefore, a single process may have controlled early crustal development. Here we explore the hypothesis that heat-pipe cooling mode dominates early phases of terrestrial planet evolution. Volcanism is the hallmark of heat-pipe cooling: hot magma moves through the lithosphere in narrow channels, then is deposited and cools at the surface. A heat-pipe planet develops a thick, cold, downward-advecting lithosphere dominated by mafic/ultra-mafic flows. Contractional deformation occurs throughout the lithosphere as the surface is buried and forced toward smaller radii. Geologies of the Solar system’s terrestrial planets are consistent with early heat-pipe cooling. Mercury’s surface evolution is dominated by low-viscosity volcanism until ~4.1-4.0 Ga, with little activity other than global contraction since. Similar, younger features at Venus are commonly interpreted in terms of catastrophic resurfacing events with ~0.5 billion-year periodicity, but early support of high topography suggests a transition from heat-pipe to rigid-lid tectonics. Thick heat-pipe lithosphere may preserve the crustal dichotomy between Mars’ northern and southern hemispheres, and explain the range in trace element abundances and isotopic compositions of Martian meteorites. At the Moon, global serial volcanism can explain refinement of ferroan anorthite rich rocks and coeval production of the “Mg-suite” rocks. The Moon’s shape is out of hydrostatic equilibrium; it may represent a fossil preserved by thick early lithosphere. Active development of Jupiter’s moon Io, which is warmed by tidal heating, is widely interpreted in terms of heat-pipe cooling. Given its potential ubiquity in the Solar system, heat-pipe cooling may be a universal process experienced by all terrestrial bodies of sufficient size.",

            "abstract": "We examined the effect of wind and sea ice on seasonal variation in the thickness of circumpolar deep water, to better understand the processes causing mass loss in the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). Spatial and temporal variation of the layer of warm and salty circumpolar deep water (CDW) at the center of the Amundsen Shelf was measured during two oceanographic surveys and a two-year mooring deployment. A hydrographic transect from the deep ocean, across the shelf break, and into the Dotson Trough shows a local elevation of the warm deep water layer at the shelf break. On the shelf, the water flows south-east along the trough. The thickness of the warm layer displays seasonal variation with maximum thickness in austral summer and minimum thickness in austral winter. The variation in warm layer thickness gives rise to a seasonal variation of the modified CDW heat content. In order to investigate the effects of wind and sea ice drift on the heat content, ocean surface stress was calculated using the ERA interim reanalysis wind data and observed sea ice velocity and concentration from satellites. The Ekman pumping velocity was calculated from the ocean surface stress field. The Ekman pumping at the shelf break, where the warm layer is elevated, shows a strong seasonal variation coinciding with the mooring data. The average wind field is eastward north of the shelf break and westward south of the shelf break during all seasons. The main effect of a layer of sea ice (between the wind and the water) is to reduce the surface stress which can intensify the horizontal gradient of surface stress at the marginal ice zone. This creates a divergence of the Ekman transport and a positive Ekman pumping at the marginal ice zone, if the wind direction is eastward. From February to April, a marginal ice zone close to the shelf break gives rise to a positive Ekman pumping that may explain the seasonal signal seen in the mooring data. At northern boundaries of coastal polynya, positive Ekman pumping appears under a westward wind field. During austral winter, the marginal ice zone is further north and there are almost no polynya (except for a few very small areas of open water surrounded by ice close to the coast), so Ekman pumping is reduced compared to the summer season and does not cause any flow of warm water onto the shelf.",

The vulnerability of different Amazonian areas to droughts was evaluated using the Ecosystem Demography model (ED-2.2). We simulated forest dynamics under a suite of rainfall regime scenarios for two sites in the Eastern Amazon with strong rainfall seasonality but very different total rainfall. While the model simulations predicted nearly no response in mortality or primary productivity at Paracou (wettest site), the model suggests that even moderate shifts of the mean rainfall could cause significant biomass loss at Tapajos (driest site), particularly amongst the largest trees, pioneers, and evergreens. The simulations that produced the largest losses were those in which the return period of extreme droughts became shorter than one decade hence not allowing\nsufficient time for recovery. By defining vulnerability as the change in rainfall regime needed to reduce the return period to dangerous levels, we identified the most vulnerable areas to be near the forest Southern and Eastern limits, but also over large areas in Eastern Amazon.",

These planetary waves have been observed to cause strong ionospheric day-to-day variations. We have understood that the QTDW can impact the thermosphere and ionosphere either by directly penetrating into the lower thermosphere and modulating E-region dynamo in a period of about 2-days, or by enhancing mixing and decreasing thermosphere O/N2 and in ionospheric electron density. In this work, we introduce the third mechanism of how the QTDW impacts the ionosphere, the QTDW-tidal interactions occurring in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). We employ the NCAR TIME-GCM to simulate the interaction between the QTDW and tides, and the impact of this interaction on the ionospheric E-region dynamo, equatorial fountain effect, and F-region plasma density. We find that the tidal amplitudes and phases are dramatically altered during strong QTDW events during post-solstice. In particular, the amplitudes of the migrating tides can decrease as much as 20-30%. The changed tides result in different dynamo electric field, vertical ion drift, and thus different diurnal and semidiurnal cycles in F-region electron density.",

Human observation of - and interaction with - data visualization software can augment, select, interrupt and modify computational routines and facilitate processes of pattern and significant feature recognition for subsequent human analysis, machine learning, expert and artificial intelligence systems.‘Tagger’ is a Mac OS X interactive data visualisation tool that facilitates Human-Computer interaction for the recognition of patterns and significant structures. It is a graphical application developed using the Quartz Composer framework.\n‘Tagger’ follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture: the application problem domain (the model) is to facilitate novel ways of abstractly representing data to a human interlocutor, presenting these via different viewer modalities (e.g. chart representations, particle systems, parametric geometry) to the user (View) and enabling interaction with the data (Controller) via a variety of Human Interface Devices (HID). The software enables the user to create an arbitrary array of tags that may be appended to the visualised data, which are then saved into output files as forms of semantic metadata. Three fundamental problems that are not strongly supported by conventional scientific visualisation software are addressed:1] How to visually animate data over time, 2] How to rapidly deploy unconventional parametrically driven data visualisations, 3] How to construct and explore novel interaction models that capture the activity of the end-user as semantic metadata that can be used to computationally enhance subsequent interrogation.\nSaved tagged data files may be loaded into Tagger, so that tags may be tagged, if desired. Recursion opens up the possibility of refining or overlapping different types of tags, tagging a variety of different POIs or types of events, and of capturing different types of specialist observations of important or noticeable events. Other visualisations and modes of interaction will also be demonstrated, with the aim of discovering knowledge in large datasets in the natural, physical sciences.\nFig.1 Wave height data from an oceanographic Wave Rider Buoy.

            "abstract": "Recent hydrological studies have revealed that large amounts of rainwater infiltrate into bedrock. This study investigates interactions between bedrock groundwater and surface-hydrological processes in headwater catchments, and evaluates effects of surface topographies on their rain water storages and discharge hydrographs.\nIn the steep Rokko mountain range of central Japan, which consists of granite and has been greatly affected by diastrophic activities, discharge hydrographs are characterized by significant amount of baseflow. In order to elucidate contributions of bedrock groundwater to the hydrograph formation, water storage observations were conducted by using bedrock wells with depths of 7−78 m drilled at 31 points within a 2.1-ha headwater catchment. On the other hand, discharge hydrographs from the gentle Tanakami mountain range of central Japan, which also consists of granite, produce large storm peaks and sparse baseflow discharges. In headwater regions of the Tanakami mountain range, we established a 2.3-ha catchment, in which water storage observations were conducted by using bedrock wells with depths of 3−42 m drilled at 61 points.\nResults indicated a regionalized distribution of bedrock groundwater in the Rokko catchment; that is, upper, middle, and lower aquifers were present. We observed large differences in water level among the aquifers, instead of a gradual and continuous decline in water level. Discharge hydrograph from the catchment was notably characterized by gentle and significant variations in base flow. Broad peaks in the base-flow discharge corresponded to peaks of water storage of the middle aquifer. Because of its broad regional expanse and large capacity, the middle aquifer had a dominant effect on formation of the discharge hydrograph. In the Tanakami catchment, bedrock groundwater aquifers were separated by small ridges and hollows within the catchment, and their spatial expansions were much narrower than those in the Rokko catchment. As a result, the bedrock water storage exhibited more peaky responses, causing rapid increases and declines in discharge hydrographs. Thus, this study has demonstrated how discharge from headwater catchments are dominated by water storage within bedrock.",

            "abstract": "Compressible Euler equations support the propagation of acoustic waves. Although much progress has been achieved towards efficient and accurate solutions to the resulting numerical difficulties, it can still be desirable to identify “unified” equations of motion that would not support acoustic waves while retaining accuracy at large and small scales. Even if such equations are eventually not chosen as the basis of a numerical model, they may help identifying the independent degrees of freedom of the atmospheric flow to be modeled and how the dependent fields are related to the independent fields.\nFrom Hamilton's least action principle (HP), \"semi-hydrostatic\" compressible equations of motion with density diagnosed from potential temperature through hydrostatic balance are derived. Energy, potential vorticity and momentum are conserved. Slaving density to potential temperature suppresses the degrees of freedom supporting the propagation of acoustic waves and results in a sound-proof system. Scale analysis and linear normal modes analysis for an isothermal state of rest suggest that the semy-hydrostatic system is accurate from hydrostatic to non-hydrostatic scales, except for deep internal gravity waves (Figure : decimal logarithm of relative error of the frequency of internal normal modes of a non-rotating isothermal atmosphere as a function of horizontal and vertical wavenumbers k,m normalized by the scale height H). Especially the Lamb wave and long Rossby waves are not distorted, unlike with anelastic or pseudo-incompressible systems.\nCompared to similar equations derived by Arakawa and Konor (2009), the semi-hydrostatic system possesses an additional term in the horizontal momentum budget. This term is an apparent force resulting from the vertical coordinate not being the actual height of an air parcel, but its hydrostatic height, i.e. the hypothetical height it would have after the atmospheric column it belongs to has reached hydrostatic balance through adiabatic vertical displacements of air parcels. As with hydrostatic prmitive equations (HPE), vertical velocity is diagnosed through Richardson's equation. The semi-hydrostatic system has therefore precisely the same degrees of freedom as the HPE, while retaining much of the accuracy of the fully compressible Euler equations.",

            "abstract": "More than 1,700 exoplanets have been discovered to date, including a handful of potentially habitable ones. There is on average more than one planet per star, and estimates of occurrence rates for potentially habitable planets (eta_Earth) from the Kepler mission range between ~5 and 50%.\nSeveral mission concepts have been studied to directly image planets around nearby stars. Direct imaging enables spectroscopic detection of biomarkers such as atmospheric oxygen and methane, which would be highly suggestive of extraterrestrial life. It is commonly thought that directly imaging a potentially habitable exoplanet requires telescopes with apertures of at least 1m, costing at least $1B, and launching no earlier than the 2020s.\nA notable exception to this is Alpha Centauri. The system contains two Sun-like stars with a wide separation that allows dynamically stable habitable zones around either star. Habitable zones span about 0.5-1” in stellocentric angle, ~3x wider than around any other FGKM star. A ~30cm visible light space telescope is sufficient to resolve the habitable zone and detect a potentially habitable planet in minutes with ideal components, or days with realistic ones.\nWe are developing a mission concept called ACEND (Alpha Centauri Direct Imager) consisting of a ~30cm primary, a Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization coronagraph, and a wavefront control system. It is designed to suppress the light leak from both stars and directly image their planetary systems in 3 color channels, including the capability to detect potentially habitable planets. Color imaging is sufficient to differentiate Venus-like, Earth-like, and Mars-like planets from each other and establish the presence of Earth-pressure atmosphere through Rayleigh scattering.\nTwo factors make it possible to realize the requirements of ACEND (most notably 10^10 contrast) on a small budget and fast schedule: (a) ACEND will collect a long continuous sequence of images on Alpha Centauri A and B for 2 years, enabling much better speckle subtraction than missions that have many targets, thus greatly relaxing the requirements on the raw contrast of the coronagraph; (b) the small scale regime implies greater rigidity and stability, as well as smaller optics with better wavefronts.",

This paper describes the Redwood Coast Tsunami Work Group (RCTWG), an organization formed in 1996 to address the tsunami threat from both near and far sources. It includes representatives from government agencies, public, private and volunteer organizations, academic institutions, and individuals interested in working to reduce tsunami risk. The geographic isolation and absence of scientific agencies such as the USGS and CGS in the region, and relatively frequent occurrence of both earthquakes and tsunami events has created a unique role for the RCTWG, with activities ranging from basic research to policy and education and outreach programs. Regional interest in tsunami issues began in the early 1990s when there was relatively little interest in tsunamis elsewhere in the state. As a result, the group pioneered tsunami messaging and outreach programs. Beginning in 2008, the RCTWG has partnered with the National Weather Service and the California Office of Emergency Services in conducting the annual “live code” tsunami communications tests, the only area outside of Alaska to do so. In 2009, the RCTWG joined with the Southern California Earthquake Alliance and the Bay Area Earthquake Alliance to form the Earthquake Country Alliance to promote a coordinated and consistent approach to both earthquake and tsunami preparedness throughout the state. The RCTWG has produced and promoted a variety of preparedness projects including hazard mapping and sign placement, an annual “Earthquake – Tsunami Room” at County Fairs, public service announcements and print material, assisting in TsunamiReady community recognition, and facilitating numerous multi-agency, multidiscipline coordinated exercises, and community evacuation drills. Nine assessment surveys from 1993 to 2013 have tracked preparedness actions and personal awareness of tsunami hazards. Over the twenty-year period covered by the surveys, respondents aware of a local tsunami hazard increased from 51 to 90 percent and awareness of the Cascadia subduction zone increased from 16 to 60 percent.",

            "abstract": "Four subduction zone earthquakes of magnitude ≥ 8.6 occurred between 2004 and 2013. No earthquakes of this size were reported anywhere in the world in the preceding 36 years. The wealth of seismic, geodetic, geologic and tsunami data from these great megathrust events has advanced the understanding of subduction zones and challenged a number of previously accepted ideas. This talk focuses on how they have also influenced risk assessment and preparedness programs. Megathrust earthquakes differ from other large damaging earthquakes. The size of the megathrust source means a much larger area may be impacted by earthquake shakingaffecting not only the amount of damage, but posing response and recovery challenges. A second factor is tsunami generation. About a third of the 760,000 casualties in the decade were caused by the four mega-earthquakes. All four produced deadly tsunamis and over 95% of the death total was attributed to tsunami. Even when the extraordinarily deadly 2004 Andaman Sumatra tsunami is removed from the data set, 85% of the casualties in the remaining three earthquakes were caused by tsunami. In contrast, in the non-megathrust events caused over two-thirds of the decade's casualties but less than 1 % were caused by tsunami. The Cascadia subduction zone along the coast of northern California, Oregon, Washington and southern British Columbia is the only location in the contiguous 48 states where a great megathrust earthquake will someday occur. Assessing the risk posed by Cascadia and developing effective preparedness programs pose a number of challenges. Awareness of Cascadia is relatively recent and assessing the magnitude, recurrence and nature of past events depends primarily on paleoseismology. The megathrust events of the past decade provide a proxy for and a general picture of the likely impacts of a future Cascadia earthquake and have influenced preparedness efforts throughout the Cascadia region. The recent events have also posed problems for Cascadia. Each event has changed perceptions and risk assessments among the Cascadia states and provinces that has led to differences in standards for hazard maps, sirens and education protocol. A challenges for the next decade is to bridge these differences to develop more consistency throughout the Cascadia region.",

The VIIRS instrument on-board Suomi-NPP provides continuity with NASA's Earth Observing System Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and a much-needed replacement of the long-serving, operational NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) system, to meet the expanding needs of Earth Science and Applications of Societal Benefit. Post-launch evaluation has proven the instrument to be excellent for land observations and capable of providing measurement continuity with MODIS. This provides a critical contribution to the scientific study of global change. Several regions of the World are undergoing rapid land transformations, driven by economic development and population growth. In addition, changes in climate conditions are resulting in ecosystem responses and changes in land cover and land use. Long-term, systematic observations of the global land surface at coarse resolution enable detection, monitoring and characterization of such changes to the land surface.\nA suite of Land environmental data records (EDRs) from the VIIRS, are being developed by NOAA to meet operational data needs, primarily for the National Weather Service (e.g., Albedo, Land Surface Temperature, Fractional Vegetation Cover, Surface Type, Snow and Ice Monitoring). Scientists funded by NOAA and NASA, have been evaluating and validating these products. Based on these evaluations, NASA is embarking on a program to develop enhanced and additional products to provide continuity with MODIS to meet the needs of the global change science community.\nIn addition, and as with MODIS, data from the VIIRS can be used as input to a number of practical applications of societal benefit and the associated decision support systems. For example, progress with VIIRS data is being made in the areas of fire and agricultural monitoring. These applications are being developed to meet national needs and international needs in the framework of the GOFC-GOLD and GEOGLAM Programs.",

            "abstract": "The Indian Ocean experienced its most devastating natural disaster through the action of a Tsunami, resulting from of an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on 26th of December 2004. This resulted in widespread damage both to property and human lives with over 250,000 deaths in the region and many millions homeless. Our understanding of tsunami generation and propagation has increased significantly over the past decade. In this presentation, results obtained from detailed analysis of sea level data from Western Australia and Sri Lanka together with numerical modelling are presented to highlight the effects of topography both at the surface and subsurface. The major effects are due to wave reflection and refraction. Examples of wave reflection include: impacts on Malaysia/Thailand, Sri Lanka and Western Australia due to wave reflection from Sri Lanka, Maldives and Mascarene Ridge, respectively. In the case of Sri Lanka, the maximum wave height recorded along the west coast during the 2004 tsunami was due to the reflected wave from Maldives impacting 3 hours after the arrival of the initial waves. Similarly, along the West coast of Australia highest waves occurred 15 hours after the arrival of the first wave. Here, based on travel times, we postulate that the waves were reflected from the Mascarene Ridge and/or the island of Madagascar (Figure 1b). The conclusions based on observations were verified using numerical model simulations using the MOST and ComMIT models. Numerical modelling using the MOST model indicated the role of offshore susurface topography on tsunami propagation through wave wave refraction. Examples of wave refraction included the effects of deep water seamounts (Venin Meinesz) and plateaus (Wallaby, Cuvier and Exmouth) on tsunami propagation along the West Australian coast. The tsunami waves are first scattered by the Venin Meinesz seamounts and were then refracted by the Wallaby and Cuvier plateaus resulting in waves being deflected onto the coast.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a hazard that lends itself well to diligent, sustained monitoring and early warning. However, unlike most hazards, the fact that droughts typically evolve slowly, can last for months or years and cover vast areas spanning multiple political boundaries/jurisdictions and economic sectors can make it a daunting task to monitor, develop plans for, and identify appropriate, proactive mitigation strategies.\nThe National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) and National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) have been working together to reduce societal vulnerability to drought by helping decision makers at all levels to: 1) implement drought early warning/forecasting and decision support systems; 2) support and advocate for better collection of, and understanding of drought impacts; and 3) increase long-term resilience to drought through proactive planning.\nThe NDMC and NIDIS risk management approach has been the basis from which many partners around the world are developing a collaboration and coordination nexus with an ultimate goal of building comprehensive global drought early warning information systems (GDEWIS). The core emphasis of this model is on developing and applying useful and usable information that can be integrated and transferred freely to other regions around the globe. The High–Level Ministerial Declaration on Drought, the Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP) co-led by the WMO and the Global Water Partnership (GWP), and the Global Framework for Climate Services are drawing extensively from the integrated NDMC-NIDIS risk management framework.\nThis presentation will describe, in detail, the various drought resources, tools, services, and collaborations already being provided and undertaken at the national and regional scales by the NDMC, NIDIS, and their partners. The presentation will be forward-looking, identifying improvements in existing and proposed mechanisms to help strengthen national and international drought early warning information systems to support preparedness and adaptation decisions in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Educating future Americans has long been a debate; with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) now being adopted, climate literacy has become a more dominant discussion in both the classroom and in our society where climate education has often been non-existent or dismal at best. With these new education standards climate literacy is now fundamental to science education, this means understanding climate needs to begin with those headed into the classroom with these future Americans. These educators are expected to be skilled and confident in all subject areas, including science, where they might receive less training. To address this challenge, we have focused on an interdisciplinary approach to climate literacy, which is facilitated through cross-cutting concepts in both Earth and life sciences and parallels NGSS standards. We used the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication to gauge our student’s strengths and weaknesses and compare them to the general public’s understanding of climate change and complex Earth processes, such as beliefs about climate change, understanding the greenhouse effect, weather versus climate, climate change past and present, impacts and solutions. After a semester of this interdisciplinary course our students felt 95% confident that they are informed about global climate change as compared to 62% of Americans that were surveyed. Our students could define and describe greenhouse effect and 82% of them could classify greenhouse gases as compared to 66% and 45% of Americans respectively. While these non-science, education students were generally more knowledgeable about climate change, the areas where they did not significantly outperform the general public allowed us to refocus our course to aid them in understanding this complex issue where our hopes are that they will be prepared to teach science in their future classroom which will allow their students to be competitive in today’s rapidly evolving global economy.",

            "abstract": "The demand for improved climate knowledge and information is well documented. As noted in the IPCC Reports (SREX, AR5) and other assessments, this demand has increased pressure for better information to support planning under changing rates of extremes event occurrence. This demand has focused on mechanisms used to respond to past variability and change, including, integrated resource management (watersheds, coasts), infrastructure design, information systems, technological optimization, financial risk management, and behavioral and institutional change. Climate inputs range from static site design statistics (return periods) to dynamic, emergent thresholds and transitions preceded by steep response curves and punctuated equilibria. Tradeoffs are evident in the use of risk-based anticipatory strategies vs. resilience measures. In such settings, annual decision calendars for operational requirements can confound adaptation expectations. Key knowledge assessment questions include: (1) How predictable are potential impacts of events in the context of other stressors, (2) how is action to anticipate such impacts informed, and (3) How often should criteria for “robustness” be reconsidered? To illustrate, we will discuss the climate information needs and uses for two areas of concern for both short and long-term risks (i) climate and disaster risk financing, and (ii) watershed management. The presentation will focus on the climate information needed for (1) improved monitoring, modeling and methods for understanding and analyzing exposure risks, (2) generating risk profiles, (3) developing information systems and scenarios for critical thresholds across climate time and space scales, (4) embedding annual decision calendars in the context of longer-term risk management, (5) gaming experiments to show the net benefits of new information. We will conclude with a discussion of the essential climate variables needed to implement services-delivery and development efforts such as the Global Framework for Climate Services and the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a slow-onset hazard that is a normal part of climate. Drought onset and demise are difficult to determine. Impacts are mostly nonstructural, spread over large geographical areas, and can persist long after precipitation deficits end. These factors hinder development of accurate, timely estimates of drought severity and resultant responses. Drivers of drought range from SST anomalies and global scale atmospheric response, through regional forcing and local land-surface feedbacks. Key climatological questions related to drought risk assessment, perception and management include, “Does a drought end by a return to normal precipitation; how much moisture is required and over what period; can the end of a drought be defined by the diminishing impacts e.g. soil moisture, reservoir volumes; will precipitation patterns on which management systems rely, change in the future?”\nEffective early warning systems inform strategic responses that anticipate crises and crisis evolution across climate timescales. While such “early information” is critical for defining event onset, it is even more critical for identifying the potential for increases in severity. Many social and economic systems have buffers in place to respond to onset (storage, transfers and purchase of grain) but lack response capabilities as drought intensifies, as buffers are depleted. Throughout the drought lifecycle (and between events), monitoring, research and risk assessments are required to:\nMap decision-making processes and resource capabilities including degradation of water and ecosystems\nPlace multiple climate and land surface indicators within a consistent triggering framework (e.g. climate and vegetation mapping) before critical thresholds are reached\nIdentify policies and practices that impede or enable the flow of information, through policy gaming and other exercises\nThe presentation will outline the capabilities and framework needed to ensure improved scientific inputs to preparedness and adaptation. Lessons will be drawn from recent and ongoing events in California, the Midwest, and globally.",

Despite the need for such policy-relevant research, multidisciplinary collaborations can be wrought with challenges of data integration, model interoperability, and communication across disciplinary divides. In this talk, I will present several examples where I have collaborated with colleagues from the physical, natural, and social sciences to develop novel, actionable science to inform decision-making. Specifically, I will discuss a cost analysis of water and sediment diversions to optimize land building in the Mississippi River delta (winner of American Geophysical Union Water Resources Research Editor’s Choice Award 2014) and the development of a National Climate Indicator System that uses knowledge across the physical, natural, and social sciences to establish an end-to-end indicator system of climate changes, impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses. The latter project is in the process of moving from research to operations, an additional challenge and opportunity, as we work with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and their affiliated Federal agencies to establish it beyond the research prototype. Using these examples, I will provide some lessons learned that would have general applicability to socio-environmental research collaborations and integration of data, models, and information systems to support climate and environmental decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is attributed to rising consumption of fossil fuels around the world. The development of solutions to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is one of the most urgent needs of today’s society. One of the most stable and long-term solutions for storing CO2 is via carbon mineralization, where minerals containing metal oxides of Ca or Mg are reacted with CO2 to produce thermodynamically stable Ca- and Mg-carbonates that are insoluble in water. Carbon mineralization can be carried out in-situ or ex-situ. In the case of in-situ mineralization, the degree of carbonation is thought to be limited by both mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation reaction kinetics, and must be well understood to predict the ultimate fate of CO2 within geological reservoirs. While the kinetics of in-situ mineral trapping via carbonation is naturally slow, it can be enhanced at high temperature and high partial pressure of CO2. The addition of weak organic acids produced from food waste has also been shown to enhance mineral weathering kinetics. In the case of the ex-situ carbon mineralization, the role of these ligand-bearing organic acids can be further amplified for silicate mineral dissolution. Unfortunately, high mineral dissolution rates often lead to the formation of a silica-rich passivation layer on the surface of silicate minerals. Thus, the use of novel solvent mixture that allows chemically catalyzed removal of this passivation layer during enhanced Mg-leaching surface reaction has been proposed and demonstrated. Furthermore, an engineered biological catalyst, carbonic anhydrase, has been developed and evaluated to accelerate the hydration of CO2, which is another potentially rate-limiting step of the carbonation reaction. The development of these novel catalytic reaction schemes has significantly improved the overall efficiency and sustainability of in-situ and ex-situ mineral carbonation technologies and allowed direct capture and storage of CO2 from mixture gas streams eliminating the energy-intensive solvent regeneration and CO2 compression steps.",

            "abstract": "Located at the convergence of air masses between the westerlies and monsoon, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) undergoes complex water cycle processes, which need to be documented and understood through a combination of variant methodologies. The stable oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) in precipitation is an integrated tracer of the atmospheric processes and has been used worldwide. Since the 1990s, an intensive effort has been dedicated to studying precipitation isotopic composition at more than 20 stations in the TP. Based on these observations, we establish a database of precipitation δ18O and use different models to evaluate the climatic drivers of present-day precipitation δ18O over the TP. The spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ18O and their relationships with temperature and precipitation reveal three distinct domains, respectively associated with the influence of the westerlies (Northern TP), Indian monsoon (Southern TP) and transition in between. The seasonal patterns of precipitation δ18O are diverse in different domains. High-resolution atmospheric models equipped with stable isotopes capture the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ18O and their relationships with moisture transport from the westerlies and Indian monsoon. Only in the westerlies domain are atmospheric models able to represent qualitatively and quantitatively the relationships between climate and precipitation δ18O. More significant temperature effect exists when either the westerlies or Indian monsoon is the sole dominant atmospheric process. The observed and simulated altitude-δ18O relationships strongly depend on the season and the domain (monsoon or westerlies). Our results have crucial implications for the interpretation of the abundant stable isotope information derived from natural climatic archives over the TP such as ice cores, lake sediments or tree rings, and for the application of atmospheric simulations to quantifying paleo-climate and paleo-elevation changes.",

            "abstract": "Structure of the lower mantle is dominated by a pair of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), which global shear velocity (VS) tomographic models image with remarkable consistency. The LLSVPs are spatially associated with the locations of hotspots, eruptions of large igneous provinces, and the Earth’s rotation axis. Toward their base, they appear to be bounded by laterally sharp velocity gradients, which suggest that they are compositionally distinct from the surrounding mantle. Recently, the discovery of the Perm Anomaly – a much smaller, isolated, structure otherwise similar to an LLSVP – motivates the study of meso-scale structures in the lower mantle both within and outside the LLSVPs.\nHere, we investigate how large and meso-scale structure of LSVPs varies with height above the core-mantle boundary. We do so by carrying out two re-analyses of VS tomographic models: 1.) Cluster analysis of VS profiles with depth, which allows us to map out the three-dimensional morphology of the LLSVPs that is consistent across tomographic models and present new estimates for their volumes; and, 2.) Analysis of the width and skewness of Vs anomaly distributions within LLSVPs at several depths, and their implications for the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, LLSVP temperature profiles, and predicted seismic attenuation. Based on these analyses, we show differences between the African and Pacific LLSVPs, identify meso-scale structures within and outside the LLSVPs, and relate these to inferences of lower mantle attenuation and anisotropy, location of Ultra-Low Velocity Zones, and locations of hotspots and large igneous provinces.",

This is done by a multidisciplinary and multi-national team of policy analysts, social and natural scientists and engineers. The work presents a participatory approach to formally evaluating ecosystem services and poverty in the context of the wide range of environmetnal stressors and hazards. These changes include subsidence and sea level rise, land degradation and population pressure in delta regions. The approach will be developed, tested and applied in coastal Bangladesh.\nRural livelihoods are inextricably linked with the natural ecosystems and low income farmers are highly vulnerable to changes in ecosystem services as they are impacted by geohazards and environmental stressors. Their health, wellbeing and financial security are under threat from many directions such as unreliable supplies of clean water, increasing salinisation of soils and flood, while in the longer term they are threatened by subsidence and sea-level rise. This study will contribute to the understanding of this present vulnerability and help the people who develop the relevant policy to make more informed choices about how best to reduce this vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "Previous analysis of climate model output using latitudinal averages for (combined) land-ocean has found a simple relation often summarised by the “wet get wetter dry get drier” statement. In this presentation we revisit this relation and ask whether it holds separately over land and ocean and also whether it holds at local (grid-box) scales. We find that it only applies to latitudinal averages over the ocean. It does not hold for latitudinal averages over land and does not hold over either ocean or land at grid-box scales. With that finding established we investigate a new simple emergent relation based on the long standing Budyko framework of catchment hydrology. We find that climate model output over land conforms to the Budyko framework and use that to decompose the projected changes in runoff at individual grid-boxes into a component that is due to change in rainfall and a second component due to a change in net irradiance. With that we are able to show that over land, the projected change in runoff is dominated by the change in rainfall. We present a new formulation of this result including calculation of the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) measurements of ion drifts in the ionosphere are sensitive to neutral motions through ion-neutral collisions. At D-region / mesospheric altitudes, the plasma is collisional on scales of the radar wavelength and thus ion drifts can be used as a direct proxy for neutral motions. At E-region / lower-thermospheric altitudes, the ions undergo a transition whereby the mean free path approaches the scale of the Bragg-scattering wavelength. In the F-region / upper thermosphere, the ions are collisionless and drift at the ExB velocity. The sensing of ion motions is thus extremely useful for the assessment of ionospheric electrodynamics. We utilize case studies from the Poker Flat and Arecibo ISRs to illustrate the utility of this feature of ion motions by showing (a) examples of neutral wind measurements from the mesosphere through the thermosphere, (b) the impact of derived neutral winds on the interpretation of gravity wave dissipation and forcing, and (c) climatological variations of the lower thermospheric winds and the response of the high-latitude lower thermospheric winds to forcing.",

            "abstract": "Despite nearly four decades of study since the launch of Skylab, the physical structure of coronal loops remains an enigma. Loops are guided by the magnetic field and, in the common EUV emission lines, appear to be composed of stranded structures reminiscent of field lines. This stranded structure appears to have constant or nearly-constant width, at odds with naive understanding of flux tube behavior in a field gradient. Possible explanations range from physical solutions such as twisted magnetic structure or peculiar properties of separators and quasi-separators, to observation effects that invoke finite resolution or anisotropy of the field containing each strand. The uncertainty affects many aspects of basic coronal physics, because some of the possible explanations for stranded structure have strong implications for other mysteries such as the anomalously tall scale height of the EUV corona.\nThe Hi-C EUV images are the highest resolution coronal images to date, and offer new insights into the structure of coronal loops. We present an overview of research to date, show results from a detailed analysis of several dozen well-presented loops that are visible in the Hi-C data set, and speculate on the implications for the rest of the corona.",

            "abstract": "West Mata, a small, active rear-arc volcano in the NE Lau Basin, erupts crystal and gas rich boninite magma. Eruptions were observed at the summit (1.2 km water depth) during 5 ROV Jason dives in 2009 (the deepest erupting submarine volcano observed to date). Subsequent ROV and ship-based bathymetric mapping revealed that a pit crater formed and the summit eruption ceased in 2010, with roughly simultaneous eruptions along the SW rift zone. During the summit eruption, a combination of water depth, H2O-CO2-rich and high crystallinity magma, a split in the conduit to feed two vent sites, and waxing/waning magma supply led to a range of effusive/explosive eruption styles and volcanic deposit types. The 2-3 vent Hades cluster and the lone Prometheus vent had different eruption characteristics. Petrographic, petrologic and geochemical studies of erupted products indicate a change in magma composition in time and space over a period of 3.5 yrs, suggesting a small, open-system magma reservoir within the volcano. Prometheus (1174m depth) produced mostly pyroclastic material during our observations (e.g., highly vesicular glowing fluidal ejecta that cooled in the water column and rounded recycled dense clasts), but sampling and 210Po radiometric dating show that several months prior pillowed lava flows, subsequently covered with cm-sized pyroclasts, had flowed >50m from the vent. In contrast, vents at Hades (1200m depth) cycled between lava production and vigorous degassing, 10-20m high fire fountains and bursts of glowing lava-skinned bubbles, the products of which froze/broke in the water column, forming unstable cones of spatter and scoria near the vents. We hypothesize that bubbles collapse rather than form lava balloons because of skin brittleness (from high crystal content) and hydrostatic pressure. Clast settling times and patterns suggest >100m water column rise height for 10+ cm-sized fragments. Pillow flows were also observed to be issuing from the base of the Hades cones some 30-50m below, and had traveled 100 m from the vent in the months before. This, plus hydrophone and water column data (Embley et al., G3, in review), and the occurrence of extensive deposits of young, glassy, identical composition cm-sized fragmental material 250 m from Hades suggest an earlier more vigorous phase of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Crust-mantle coupling along major strike-slip fault zones suggests that these two lithospheric layers act as an integrated system. In such a system, the spatial and temporal evolution of mantle strength across strike-slip shear zones has proven a key component in understanding lithospheric deformation and rheology. The Bogota Peninsula shear zone is exposed in the mantle section of the New Caledonia ophiolite. It contains a unique microstructural and textural record across a 4-km wide mylonitic zone bordered by a wider zone of weaker deformation. The shear zone is interpreted as a paleotransform fault, based on the orientations of fabrics and dikes inside and outside the zone. No ultramylonites or pseudotachylites were observed within the shear zone. Olivine grain size paleopiezometers suggest variation of the shear zone stresses, with the highest values recorded in the center of the shear zone, coincident with increasing olivine CPO strength toward the shear zone center. By estimating the finite strain in the zone, and assuming that all portions of the shear zone were active synchronously, we can correlate the increased stresses to increased strain rates.\nWe compare the mantle strength in the Bogota Peninsula shear zone to other transform faults, such as the San Andreas fault (SAF) system. The differential stresses in the upper mantle of the SAF system, determined from xenoliths, is similar to those observed in the New Caledonia. Further, the width of shearing deformation in Bogota Peninsula shear zone is similar to that inferred for other transform zones, in both the upper crust and lithospheric mantle. These similarities suggest that viscous flow in the lithospheric mantle is in mechanical communication to brittle deformation in the upper crust. We propose a “Lithospheric Feedback” model, in which displacement due to mantle flow loads the crust during interseismic cycles, while the upper crust effectively limits the strength of the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Global mean sea level (GMSL) rise projections are insufficient for adaptation planning; local decisions require local projections that characterize risk over a range of timeframes and tolerances. We present a global set of local sea level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We present complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling [1]. We illustrate the application of this framework by estimating the joint distribution of future sea-level change and coastal flooding, and associated economic costs [1,2].\nIn much of the world in the current century, differences in median LSL projections are due primarily to varying levels of non-climatic uplift or subsidence. In the 22nd century and in the high-end tails, larger ice sheet contributions, particularly from the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS), contribute significantly to site-to-site differences. Uncertainty in GMSL and most LSL projections is dominated by the uncertain AIS component.\nSea-level rise dramatically reshapes flood risk. For example, at the New York City (Battery) tide gauge, our projections indicate a \\emph{likely} (67% probability) 21st century LSL rise under RCP 8.5 of 65--129 cm (1-in-20 chance of exceeding 154 cm). Convolving the distribution of projected sea-level rise with the extreme value distribution of flood return periods indicates that this rise will cause the current 1.80 m `1-in-100 year' flood event to occur an expected nine times over the 21st century -- equivalent to the expected number of `1-in-11 year' floods in the absence of sea-level change.\nProjected sea-level rise for 2100 under RCP 8.5 would likely place $80-$160 billion of current property in New York below the high tide line, with a 1-in-20 chance of losses >$190 billion. Even without accounting for potential changes in storms themselves, it would likely increase average annual storm damage by $2.6-$5.2 billion (1-in-20 chance of >$7 billion). Projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity would further increase damages [2].\n",

The OBS contains four component receivers, including a three component 4.5 Hz geophone unit containing three orthogonal components and a hydrophone. GI-gun shots located at 1 mile and 1.5 miles radius from the OBS, with spacing approximately 40 m along the sail line. The OBS recorded data at a sampling rate of 250 Hz and from a shot pattern that gave good azimuthal coverage around the OBS. Based on P and P-S converted waves recorded between the direct and multiple arrivals, this experiment targeted the top few hundred meters of sediment in the study area. Synthetic seismograms were calculated from a model representative of the sediment sequence at this site indicating that converted amplitudes are dominated by P to S mode-converted waves generated on reflection. After preliminary processing, including a static correction, the data were optimally rotated to radial (R) and transverse (T) components. The principal technique used to detect the anisotropy was azimuthal stacking of the radial and transverse horizontal geophone components. The R component shows azimuthal variation of traveltime indicating variation of velocity with azimuth; the corresponding T component shows azimuthal variation of amplitude and phase. From the radial component azimuthal gather and mode-converted wave amplitude variation for the first few layers and determined corresponding anisotropy parameter and VP/VS values. We attribute the observed azimuthal anisotropy to the presence of microcracks and grain boundary orientation due to stress since fracture at this depth is not likely to occur.",

The presence of ice influences cloud radiative properties and, for mixed phase clouds, also the formation of precipitation and cloud lifetime.\nImmersion freezing has been in the focus of ice nucleation research in recent years. Here, we examine ice nucleation activity of biological ice nuclei (IN) derived from bacteria, namely of particles generated from a suspensions of Snomax®, both above and below water vapor saturation. Measurements were done with PINC (Portable Ice Nucleus Counter, Chou et al., 2011) during a measurement campaign at LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator, see e.g. Wex et al., 2014) in Leipzig. Immersion freezing measurements from PINC and LACIS were in agreement in the temperature regime for which both instruments operate reliably.

Based on its frequent explosive eruptions and high potential hazards to nearby population of several million, Taal Volcano is chosen as one of the 15 most dangerous “Decade Volcanoes” in the world. We deployed a temporary seismic network consisting of 8 stations since March 2008. The temporal network was operated from late March 2008 to mid March 2010 and recorded over 2270 local earthquakes. In the early data processing stages, unexpected linear drifting of clock time was clearly identified from ambient noise cross-correlation functions for a number of stations. The drifting rates of all problematic stations were determined as references to correct timing errors prior to further processing. Initial locations of earthquakes were determined from manually picking P- and S-phases arrivals with a general velocity model based on AK135. We used travel times of 305 well-located local events to derive a minimum 1-D model using VELEST. Two major earthquake groups were noticed from refined locations. One was underneath the western shore of Taal Lake with a linear feature, and the other spread at shallower depths showing a less compact feature around the eastern flank of Taal Volcano Island. We performed seismic tomography to image the 3D structure beneath Taal Volcano using a well-established algorithm, LOTOS. Some interesting features are noted in the tomographic results, such as a probable solidified past magma conduit below the northwestern corner of Taal Volcano Island, characterized by high Vp, Vs, and low Vp/Vs ratio, and a potential large hydrothermal reservoir beneath the central of Taal Volcano Island, characterized by low Vs and high Vp/Vs ratio. Combining the results of seismicity and tomographic images, we also suggest the potential existence of a magma chamber beneath the southwestern Taal Lake, and a magma conduit or fault extending from there to the northwestern shore of Taal Lake. Such magmatic signatures have never been reported in previous studies, suggesting that new eruption centers might be forming in places away from the historical craters on Taal Volcano Island.",

One solution proposed for the distributed capture of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere is to speed up this natural process, by applying reactive minerals (ideally Ca- or Mg-silicates) to the land or ocean surface. The potential for such “accelerated” or “enhanced” weathering remains far from well understood, especially in the quantitative terms necessary to assess whether it could achieve significant negative carbon emissions. At the same time, relatively little attention has focused on how biological activity may be used to facilitate enhanced weathering, even though biologically-accelerated weathering is widely acknowledged to have been responsible for major changes in Earth’s environment in the geologic past.\nThis contribution will briefly review the state of knowledge about enhanced weathering in general and will present a range of possible approaches to “bio-enhanced weathering,” including by taking advantage of natural biological processes or through novel engineering. Detailed discussion will focus particularly on olivine, which is proposed as a model mineral for enhanced weathering because of its generally high reactivity. Ongoing experiments to quantify the dissolution rates of olivine, and their dependence on chemical equilibrium as well as the presence of organic ligands, will be discussed in the context of how mechanistic rate information can provide the necessary background knowledge for quantifying the potential of different (bio-)enhanced weathering proposals.",

The fluvial and lacustrine sediments at Yellowknife Bay have a basaltic composition, with main variations only related to diagenetic features including calcium sulfate veins and nodules, and raised ridges with enriched Mg proportion. Conglomerates, interpreted as fluvial in origin, were observed in the initial phase of the mission and later along the traverse from Yellowknife Bay to Mount Sharp. Conglomerates contain granules and clasts with a strong diversity in albedo and textures indicating multiple sources on the Gale crater rims. This includes identification of minerals such as feldspars. Assuming the conglomerates are a mechanically altered product of crustal rocks with relatively little aqueous alteration, the average composition of conglomerates can be considered as a proxy for the source rock composition. This average composition displays a more felsic composition than the Martian average crust as defined by meteorites and orbital data implying that the Gale crater rim is enriched in felsic rocks. More layered sandstones have been observed in the second terrestrial year of investigation in the outcrops named Cooperstown, Kylie and Kimberley, located unconformably over the conglomerates. They have compositions that are distinct from the Yellowknife Bay sandstones with especially enhanced K proportion. The three groups of sediments have been interpreted to be dominated by fluvial transport across Gale crater. They suggest distinct source rocks, and/or a distinct diagenetic history that needs to be considered in the broad context of Gale crater’s evolution.",

            "abstract": "After the Wenchuan earthquake occurred, whether the big earthquake triggered by the storage of the Zipingpu Reservoir has attracted wide attention in international academic community. In addition to the qualitative discussion, many scholars also adopted the quantitative analysis methods to calculate the stress changes, but due to the different results, they draw very different conclusions. Here, we take the dispute of different teams in the quantitative calculation of Zipingpu reservoir as a starting point. In order to find out the key influence factors of quantitative calculation and know about the existing uncertainty elements during the numerical simulation, we analyze factors which may cause the differences. The preliminary results show that the calculation methods (analytical method or numerical method), dimension of models (2-D or 3-D), diffusion model, diffusion coefficient and focal mechanism are the main factors resulted in the differences, especially the diffusion coefficient of the fractured rock mass. The change of coulomb failure stress of the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake attained from 2-D model is about 3 times of that of 3-D model. And it is not reasonable that only considering the fault permeability (assuming the permeability of rock mass as infinity) or only considering homogeneous isotropic rock mass permeability (ignoring the fault permeability). The different focal mechanisms also could dramatically affect the change of coulomb failure stress of the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake, and the differences can research 2-7 times. And the differences the change of coulomb failure stress can reach several hundreds times, when selecting different diffusion coefficients. According to existing research that the magnitude of coulomb failure stress change is about several kPa, we could not rule out the possibility that the Zipingpu Reservoir may trigger the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. However, for the background stress is not clear and coulomb failure stress change is too little, we also not sure there must be a connection between reservoir and earthquake. In future work, we should target on the basis of field survey and indoor experiment, improve the model and develop high performance simulation.",

Here, with new data analysis techniques, evidence suggests that damping can actually be neglected. Specifically, near the equator, the east--west overturning circulation is in agreement with the undamped wave response to atmospheric heating. To estimate the heating, satellite observations of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are used. Frequently OLR is used as a heuristic indicator of cloudiness. Here, the results further suggest that OLR variations are actually proportional to total diabatic heating variations, with a proportionality constant of 18 W m-2 (K/day)-1. While the agreement holds best over long time averages of years or decades, it also holds over shorter periods of one season or one month. Consequently, it is suggested that the strength of the Walker circulation -- and its evolution in time -- could be estimated using satellite data.",

Despite the primary importance of the MJO and the\ndecades of research progress since its original discovery, a generally accepted theory for its essential mechanisms\nhas remained elusive. In recent work by two of the authors, a minimal dynamical model has been\nproposed that recovers robustly the most fundamental MJO features of (i) a slow eastward speed of roughly\n5 m/s, (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dω/dk≈0, and (iii) a horizontal quadrupole vortex structure.\nThis model, the skeleton model, depicts the MJO as a neutrally stable atmospheric wave that involves a simple\nmultiscale interaction between planetary dry dynamics, planetary lower-tropospheric moisture, and the\nplanetary envelope of synoptic-scale activity. In this article, it is shown that the skeleton model can further\naccount for (iv) the intermittent generation of MJO events and (v) the organization of MJO events into wave\ntrains with growth and demise, as seen in nature. The goal is achieved by developing a simple stochastic\nparameterization for the unresolved details of synoptic-scale activity, which is coupled to otherwise deterministic\nprocesses in the skeleton model. In particular, the intermittent initiation, propagation, and shut\ndown of MJO wave trains in the skeleton model occur through these stochastic effects. This includes examples\nwith a background warm pool where some initial MJO-like disturbances propagate through the western region\nbut stall at the peak of background convection/heating corresponding to the Maritime Continent in nature. Also shown are examples with an idealized seasonal cycle, namely a background warm pool state of heating/moistening displacing meridionally during the year. This seasonally varying case considers both equatorial and off-equatorial components of the envelope of synoptic scale convective activity, which allows for a large diversity of meridionally symmetric and asymmetric intraseasonal events found in nature.",

            "abstract": "It is widely thought that oceanic redox state is essential for the evolutionary history of life on the earth, and “anoxic events” have been proposed as one of the causal mechanisms for mass extinctions. During mid-Cretaceous, widely known as the extremely warm period, oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) occurred several times and they would have caused a substantial impact on the biosphere. Planktonic foraminifera are marine planktons with calcite tests and their productions constitute ~30-80% of the modern deep-marine calcite budget, thus they play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Previous study reported that planktonic foraminifera displayed the high turnover (extinction and speciation) rate at or near the major OAEs. However, the impact of Cretaceous OAEs on the evolutionary trend of planktonic foraminifera remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the role of spatiotemporal extent of anoxia on the evolutionary trend of planktonic foraminifera by assessing the extinction/speciation rate of planktonic foraminifera around Cretaceous OAEs. The number of foraminiferal species increased across the OAE1a and then showed a peak after this episode. Around OAE2, several planktonic foraminifera species became extinct and several speciated, however, long-term trends in foraminiferal evolution showed no drastic changes near the event. Therefore these results suggest that the ocean surface environment at OAEs would not have a direct effect on foraminiferal extinction/speciation. This interpretation is reinforced when considering the recent culturing results, which demonstrate that modern planktonic foraminifera have a high tolerance to extremely low dissolved oxygen levels than expected. Accumulating geochemical data also suggest a spatial heterogeneity of oceanic anoxia/euxinia during OAE2. These results lead us to conclude that Cretaceous OAEs would not directly related to planktonic foraminiferal extinction due to regional distribution of anoxia/euxinia.",

            "abstract": "Climate is a primary driver of mountain landscape evolution, and recent research indicates that hydrologic variability – characterized by the distribution of flood magnitudes – may control mean mountainous landscape erosion rates. The connection between precipitation and river incision is regulated, however, by coarse-grained bed load transport and dynamic channel adjustment. The nature of these connections has been explored with numerical models that arrive at sometimes conflicting conclusions. Here we show that the critical stress to initiate bed-load transport is a filter for extreme flood events, acting to decouple the distribution of fluid stress in a river from its regional climate and discharge. Results are drawn from a detailed study of a tropical-montane bedrock river with extreme discharge variability, and from a compilation of stream-flow data from gravel-bedded bedrock and alluvial rivers across the United States. Discharge distributions vary widely in their form depending on geographic context, we find that the distributions of fluid stress above critical have a narrow range and all follow a universal exponential decay with a mean value consistent with analytical predictions. We demonstrate that channel geometry in each river is adjusted to a characteristic flood that coincides with the bankfull depth. Two important conclusions are: (1) bedrock channels are near-threshold transport-limited systems, similar to alluvial gravel rivers, providing a useful constraint for models; and (2) the most important control of climate is the frequency of flows above critical. Results call into question the significance of extreme events in determining longterm landscape evolution, and suggest the importance of grain size as a controlling parameter on channel geometry and river incision rates.",

To properly assess risk of future melting, it is crucial to understand the formation and growth of the GRIS during past climate regimes. However, despite decades of research, it remains debated when and in what environment GRIS got established and to what extent GRIS changed in size during past warm interglacials, such as MIS 5e some 130 kyr BP. Here, we present results from analyses of environmental DNA, 10Be/36Cl, 234U/238U, single grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), palaeomagnetics, macrofossils and molecular clock dating of basal ice from the Camp Century ice core in north western Greenland and the Kap København Formation in North Greenland. We combine these with results from the DYE 3 and GRIP ice cores from southern and central Greenland to evaluate the evolution of the GRIS. We find evidence that the present GRIS formed quickly some time before 900 kyr BP in a largely forested Greenland and that it has changed by only 30-40% of its present volume since it was established. Our DNA findings of boreal forest imply that warming of more than 10oC is needed to have an ice-free Greenland. This threshold is higher than earlier predictions and the corresponding palaeo-calibration of the GRIS contribution to sea level changes suggests a sensitivity of 0.3-0.5 m GSLR per degree Celsius of warming over Greenland. Ice core data from the deep Greenland ice cores can be used to reconstruct the size of the ice sheet during the present interglacial (the Holocene) and the last interglacial (the Eemian). Reconstructions based on stable water isotopes and gas content is used to validate the resilience of the GRIS.",

To improve the water quality of the Barato River, water has been diverted from the Ishikari River and the Toyohira River into the uppermost reach and the middle stream of the Barato River since 2007. This study clarifies the water quality change by water conveyance, based on our surveys and simulations.\nThe water quality surveys found that inorganic nitrogen (IN) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were decreased after water conveyance. And inorganic phosphorus (IP) was increased.\nTo estimate these water quality findings, we constructed a water quality simulation model that incorporates the freezing-over of water bodies. The constructed model shows good temporal and spatial reproducibility and enables water quality to be forecast throughout the year, including the ice-cover period. The forecasts using the model agree well with the survey results of the 2007-2010. From calculation results, it was assumed that IN and BOD decreasing was caused by dilution and phytoplankton decreasing. IP increasing assumed due to accumulation of unused phosphorus by phytoplankton.\nAnd remarkable changes seem in survey result. Blue-green algae decreased selectively with water conveyance year by year from 2007.However, blue-green algae increased from 2011, in additionally dominant species of blue-green algae change to Merismopedia punctate from Phormidium spp. These change suggest that regime sift occurred in blue-green algae selectively and BOD value of the Barato River showed to improved.

            "abstract": "Landscape attributes that vary with micro-topography, such as active layer thickness (ALT) in ice-wedge polygon ground, are labor-intensive to document in the field at large spatial extents, necessitating remotely sensed methods. Robust techniques to estimate ALT over large areas would improve understanding of coupled dynamics between permafrost, hydrology and landsurface processes, and improve simulations of the rate and timing of release of soil carbon from permafrost settings. In particular, it would provide critically needed data to parameterize and initialize soil property information in permafrost models and evaluate model predictions for large, complex domains. In this work, we demonstrate a new data fusion approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data for estimating cm scale ALT in a 5 km2 area of ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. We used topographic (directed distance, slope, wavelet-curvature) and spectral (NDVI) metrics derived from multisensor data obtained from LiDAR and WorldView-2 platforms to develop a simple data fusion algorithm using statistical machine learning. This algorithm was used to estimate ALT (2 m spatial resolution) across the study area. A comparison of the estimates with ground-based measurements documented the accuracy (±4.4 cm, r2=0.76) of the approach. Our findings suggest that the broad climatic variability associated with warming air temperature will govern the regional averages of ALT, but the smaller-scale variability could be controlled by local eco-hydro-geomorphic variables. This work demonstrates a path forward for mapping subsurface properties over large areas from readily available remote sensing data.\nMethodology of Mapping and Characterization Polygons:\nWe convolve LiDAR elevations with multiscale wavelets and objectively chose appropriate scales to map interconnected troughs of high- and low-centered polygons. For the ice wedges where LiDAR surface expressions (troughs) are not well developed, we used a Delaunay triangulation to connect the ice-wedge network and map the topologically connected polygons.\nPolygon slopes and curvatures as a function of DD were used to develop a microtopographic classification scheme for rims/elevated ridges (Zone 1), centers (Zone 2), and troughs (Zone 3) in both high- and low-centered polygon.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic island plays an important role in magnetic reconnection. Using a series of 2D PIC simulations, we investigate the magnetic structures of a magnetic island formed during multiple X-line magnetic reconnection, considering the effects of the guide field in symmetric and asymmetric current sheets. In a symmetric current sheet, the current in the direction forms a tripolar structure inside a magnetic island during anti-parallel reconnection, which results in a quadrupole structure of the out-of-plane magnetic field. With the increase of the guide field, the symmetry of both the current system and out-of-plane magnetic field inside the magnetic island is distorted. When the guide field is sufficiently strong, the current forms a ring along the magnetic field lines inside magnetic island. At the same time, the current carried by the energetic electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the X lines forms another ring at the edge of the magnetic island. Such a dual-ring current system enhance the out-of-plane magnetic field inside the magnetic island with a dip in the center of the magnetic island. In an asymmetric current sheet, when there is no guide field, electrons flows toward the X lines along the separatrices from the side with a higher density, and are then directed away from the X lines along the separatrices to the side with a lower density. The formed current results in the enhancement of the out-of-plane magnetic field at one end of the magnetic island, and the attenuation at the other end. With the increase of the guide field, the structures of both the current system and the out-of-plane magnetic field are distorted.",

The Microsoft Research Computational Science Lab has been pioneering research into software and methodologies to provide useful and usable new environmental information. Our approach has been very joined-up: from accellerating data acquisition from the field with remote sensor technology, targetted data collection and citizen science, to enabling proces based modelling-using multiple heterogeneous data-sets in the cloud and enabling the resulting planetary information to be accessed from any device.

            "abstract": "Changes in groundwater level have been widely reported after large earthquakes, but the mechanism for the changes is not well understood. The static elastic strain model, proposed ~40 years ago, has been tested only for its predicted sign, but not for its predicted magnitude of the groundwater-level change. Simultaneous measurements of the coseismic change in groundwater level and volumetric strain at the same location are required for testing the hypothesis, but were previously unavailable. Here we report documented coseismic changes of volumetric strain and groundwater level at three stations in China in response to the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan and the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquakes; the data provide an opportunity to test the static strain model in the intermediate distance from the epicenter. We show that the magnitude of the measured volumetric strain is mostly consistent with that required to explain the groundwater-level change, both in sign and in magnitude, but is far greater than that predicted from the static-strain model. The result shows that the documented coseismic change of volumetric strain cannot be the static elastic strain due to the earthquakes. Instead, it is likely to be the poroelastic response of the aquifer to the coseismic change in groundwater level, due perhaps to earthquake-enhanced permeability. The scenario suggests that poroelastic response to coseismic groundwater-level change may be far greater in magnitude than the static elastic strain in the intermediate distance and may thus be significant to consider in characterizing site response to earthquakes.",

We present an estimate of total methane flux from these two gas fields derived from airborne measurements and relate this flux to ground-based measurements of methane leakage from ~50 individual well pads within the fields. The fraction of basin-wide methane flux that can be accounted for by leaks from individual well pads will be discussed as well as the fraction of methane production that is leaked. We outline the difficulties and strengths of the EPA-developed methodology, referred to as Geospatial Measurement of Air Pollution Remote Emission Quantification, that was used to determined individual well-pad leakage rates using detailed wind measurements without tracers. Often the ratio of VOC:methane concentrations is combined with a known methane flux to determine VOC emission rates. In this study, we measured the flux of volatile organic compounds (VOC) independently of methane by using a proton-transfer-reactor time-of-flight mass-spectrometer and rapid 3-D wind measurements. This allows us to distinguish sources that emit primarily VOC, those that emit a mix of VOC and methane, and those that emit primarily methane. The relationship of VOC and methane fluxes from a number of different oil and gas operations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone are short-lived contributors to radiative forcing that can drive relatively rapid changes in climate. They are not emitted into the atmosphere but are formed from precursors including biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) that are emitted from terrestrial ecosystems. BVOC can also impact longer-lived climate-relevant compounds by acting as a sink for the oxidants that remove moderately reactive gases such as methane and by being a source of carbon dioxide. Emissions of BVOC are highly temperature sensitive, and some also respond to light, and so there is a potential feedback coupling between climate and BVOC emissions. Another potential feedback is associated with the water cycle since SOA can influence precipitation by serving as cloud condensation nuclei and because VOC emissions are sensitive to water availability. Anthropogenic air pollutants add to the complexity of this coupled system by enhancing the production of ozone and SOA from BVOC. The role of BVOC in the land-atmosphere-climate system and potential feedback couplings is conceptually clear but developing an accurate quantitative representation is challenging. Our current understanding of the role of BVOC in the climate system and potential feedback couplings will be presented and the major uncertainties will be discussed. Advances in observations for constraining models, including long-term measurements and recent multi-scale studies, will be presented and priorities for continued advances will be discussed.",

Here we use a 20-km-mesh global atmospheric general circulation model to investigate possible future changes in water budget over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The AMIP experiment for the present-day climate reveals an elevation dependency in precipitation, which matches well to the observations, than that obtained by lower resolution models.\nFuture AMIP-type experiment is performed using CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean sea surface temperature changes at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In the present climate, an east-west contrast in water budget is noted: over the eastern TP, moisture flux convergence and local evaporation is comparable in summertime precipitation, on the other hand, over the western TP, contribution from local evaporation dominates in water budget. In future climate, annual mean surface air temperature increases 5.0 degree C, about 50% higher than the global mean (3.5 degree C). Over TP, precipitation increases. Contribution from increasing evaporation dominates that from increasing moisture flux convergence into TP. A prominent east-west contrast is found in future surface water budget changes. Over the western TP, surface temperature increases more, increasing rate of precipitation is larger, soil moisture becomes wetter, runoff increases more, and moisture recycling or precipitation efficiency becomes larger than over the eastern TP. This suggests that an east-west contrast in surface climate over TP in the present climate becomes smaller in future climate.",

We will describe measurements O2, H2O, and aerosols from ChemCam passive sky observations. We will then discuss the evidence they provide for a seasonally active Martian O2 cycle as well as their implications for the Martian water cycle.\nChemCam passive sky observations proceed by acquiring spectra of scattered light from the atmosphere at two different elevation angles, constructing a ratio spectrum to eliminate the solar spectrum and instrument response uncertainties, and then fitting a discrete ordinates multiple scattering radiative transfer model.\nO2 was thought to have a long, greater than 10 Martian year, photochemical lifetime (e. g. Krasnopolsky 2010, Icarus 207) and thus was expected to show a seasonal behavior identical to other non-condensable inert gases. ChemCam measurements demonstrate that this is not the case, showing that O2 decreases rapidly relative to SAM-QMS-measured Ar and CRISM-measured CO during the Ls = 350° to Ls = 30° period and then doubles its mixing ratio relative to those gases during the Ls = 50° to Ls = 130° period. SAM-QMS O2 measurements confirm the ChemCam results, showing essentially identical O2 mixing ratios and seasonal variations.\nThe ChemCam water vapor measurements, when combined with the in-situ sampling of the REMS humidity sensor and with global scale orbiter data sets, provide information on the vertical distribution of water vapor and yield insights into the local and regional scale dynamics in the vicinity of Gale Crater. We observe a close match between mixing ratios inferred from REMS humidity sensor measurements and column average mixing ratios inferred from ChemCam in some seasons, but significant differences in other seasons, suggesting seasonal variations in vertical mixing processes.",

We invert centre frequencies for spheroidal and toroidal modes for three parameters of average radial anisotropy, density and P- and S-wave velocities in the lower mantle. We adopt a Bayesian machine learning approach to extract the information on the earth model that is available in the normal mode data. The method is flexible and allows us to infer probability density functions (pdfs), which provide a quantitative description of our knowledge of the individual earth model parameters. The parameters describing shear- and P-wave anisotropy show little deviations from isotropy, but the intermediate parameter η carries robust information on negative anisotropy of ~1% below 1900 km depth. The mass density in the deep mantle (below 1900 km) shows clear positive deviations from existing models. Other parameters (P- and shear-wave velocities) are close to PREM. Our results require that the average mantle is about 150K colder than commonly assumed adiabats and consist of a mixture of about 60% perovskite and 40% ferropericlase containing 10-15% iron. The anisotropy favours a specific orientation of the two minerals. This observation has important consequences for the nature of mantle flow.",

            "abstract": "In hydrological sciences many observations and model simulations have moderate linear association due to the noise in the datasets and/or the systematic differences between their seasonality components. This degrades the performance of model-observation integration algorithms, such as the Kalman Filter, that result in more accurate analysis when there is higher degree linear association between the observation and the model. To alleviate the impacts of the systematic differences, observations are linearly transformed via various rescaling techniques from observation to model space before they are assimilated into the models. In general such techniques consider rescaling either the entire timeseries or only the anomaly components of observations. In this study the impacts of rescaling seasonality and anomaly components of observations separately or together and the seasonality of these rescaling coefficients are investigated. Experiments are performed for both synthetic and real data cases. Both synthetic and real data assimilation experiments use an Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) model and assimilate observations in Kalman Filter framework, while real case assimilate LPRM observations over four USDA-ARS watersheds where the station-based observations are used to validate the analysis. Results show rescaling observations more strongly to the model is favorable when the model is more skillful than observations, while rescaling observations strongly to the model degrades the analysis if observations are relatively more accurate.",

            "abstract": "Arabia is bounded by the Dead Sea Transform (DST) to the west and by the Owen Fracture Zone (OFZ) to the east. These present-day major strike-slip fault systems activated during the Plio-Pleistocene, which contrasts with the age of inception of strike-slip motion, assumed to begin around 13-18 Ma for the DST and around 20 Ma at the edge of the Owen-Murray Ridge (OMR) for the India-Arabia plate boundary. This discrepancy between the age of the active strike-slip systems and the age of inception of strike-slip motion raises the question of the kinematic driver for the transition between successive generations of strike-slip faults. Using a recent mutibeam and seismic dataset crossing the OFZ and the OMR, we provide a new geodynamic framework for the Miocene to present-day structural evolution of the India-Arabia plate boundary, and highlight some similarities with the structural evolution of the DST. We first document a Late Miocene episode of uplift of the OMR uplift along the Miocene India-Arabia plate boundary. The onset of this uplift is coeval with a plate reorganization event marked by the onset of intra-plate deformation in the Central Indian Ocean. The OFZ emplaced around 3 Ma, with major pull-apart basins opening (20°N Basin, Dalrymple Trough) dated at 2.4 Ma by far-field correlation with ODP Sites. The opening of pull-apart basins is coeval with the last structural reorganization of the Makran accretionnary wedge, marked by the regional M-unconformity, and with a major intensification of the Indian monsoon. A Late Miocene episode of folding is also recognized at the Lebanon ranges prior to the onset of the present-day DST, which occurred in the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The similarities between the geological history of the India-Arabia plate boundary and the DST in the Late Miocene and the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene suggest that both plate boundaries recorded the same kinematic changes. Late Miocene (i.e. Tortonian) deformation is widely recognized around the Mediterranean Sea. However, the origin of the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene kinematic change recorded by both plate boundaries remains enigmatic. This kinematic change may be related to geological events at the Zagros mountain belt, subduction of seafloor asperities, or to major climate changes occurring at the beginning of the Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial ecosystem has been recognized as an environment with considerable methanogenic activity, and therefore is of significant impact on global methane budget and climate change. Although the methanogens have been discovered at a few subglacial environments, the methanogenic activity there is yet insufficiently studied, especially on the effects of environmental parameters, due to technical difficulties on sampling and cultivation. Here, in this study, we attempt to access the methanogenic activity and community structure in response to temperature and substrate availability.\nAn integrated approach including in vitro cultivation and molecular techniques were employed. A subglacial sediment from Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica was incubated at different temperatures (1, 4, 12 oC) supplied with H2+CO2 or sodium acetate to estimate the methanogenic activity. The McrA gene which is a specific marker for methanogens was amplified with primer ME and ML to construct phylogenetic trees. This functional gene was also quantified by Q-PCR before and after the incubation to estimate the increase of methanogens.\nAfter 8 months a highest methanogenesis rate of 226 pmol/ day/ gram sediment was observed at 12 oC with H2 supplying, which was 2 times higher than that with acetate supplying, clearly suggesting that H2 is a preferable substrate than acetate. The methanogenesis rate without supplying extra substrate showed positive temperature dependence with rate of 23.3, 24.8, 131 pmol/day/gram sediment at 1 oC, 4 oC, and 12 oC, respectively. The McrA copy number was increased more than 300 times and 50 times with H2 and acetate supplying respectively after the incubation. 94% and 67% of the mcrA gene sequences were classed into methanomicrobiales which were hydrogen-trophic methanogens in the two clone libraries with primer ML and ME respectively. This finding suggests the potential effect of methanogenesis under glacier on the climate change.",

            "abstract": "The widespread occurrence of intraplate volcanism is difficult to explain using the primary features of plate tectonics, such as subduction at convergent boundaries or upwelling at rifted margins, which are responsible for most volcanism on Earth. Instead, other mechanisms are invoked, foremost of which is the mantle plume model, typically characterised by a localised thermal upwelling that brings material from the deep mantle up to the base of the lithosphere to form a volcanic hotspot at Earth's surface. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many instances of intraplate volcanism do not adhere to this model, which has lead to a variety of other causes being postulated, including edge driven convection (EDC), shear driven upwelling (SDU) of the asthenosphere, lithospheric cracking, ductile removal of lithosphere via gravitational instability, glacial rebound and slab tear. Here, we use a combination of seismic tomography and geodynamic modelling to show that the source of the most recent volcanism within the Australian continent is restricted to the upper mentle and is unlikely to be plume-fed. Moreover, we demonstrate, for the first time, that mantle upwelling induced by EDC can be localised and intensified as a result of 3-D variations in lithospheric thickness and SDU caused by plate motion. In this case, geodynamic modelling constrained by seismic imaging results predicts a localised zone of mantle upwelling beneath the Quaternary Newer Volcanics Province (NVP) in southeast Australia. This helps to solve the puzzle of why EDC - which occurs at step changes in lithospheric thickness - only manifests at isolated locations along craton edges and passive margins.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt in boreal forest environments contributes substantially to spring surface runoff and is largely controlled by the local surface radiation budget. In mid-latitude forested regions, the shading, absorption and emission of incoming radiation causes significant spatial and temporal variation in the surface energy balance within forests of variable canopy densities. Canopy gaps and edges in particular have been shown to have markedly different radiative regimes compared to continuous forests and open areas due to heightened exposure to solar radiation and increased emission of longwave radiation. Improved simulation of the sub-canopy energy fluxes will reduce uncertainty in snowmelt modelling in these areas. Simulated incoming longwave radiation can be partitioned between that from the sky and the canopy, i.e. a two part model, using estimates of emissivity and temperatures. Hemispherical photography allows objective partitioning into sky-view fraction (SVF) and forest fraction (1 – SVF). While air temperature may be used as a proxy for canopy temperature in these models, explicit representation of variability of canopy temperatures have been shown to improve the simulations of longwave emission from the canopy to the snow surface. Simulated incoming longwave radiation, within close proximity to tree trunks, was evaluated at edges of gaps in a discontinuous forest of predominantly spruce and larch trees in Davos, Switzerland (46°50’N 9°52’E) between January and April 2014. Measurements were made of long- and shortwave radiation at increasing distances from tree trunks, tree trunk and air temperatures, SVF using hemispherical photography, and both closed and above canopy radiation. Results show that the simulation bias of incoming longwave radiation estimates are related to proximity of the nearest tree and the sky-view fraction at the modelled point. This suggests a greater complexity to modelling incoming longwave radiation along forest gaps and edges than a simple two-part model.",

To improve our understanding of observed climate extremes and to provide to regional decision makers the reliable scientifically based information with high special and temporal resolution on climate state, we need to operate with accurate meteorological data in our study. However, from available 231 stations across Siberia only 130 of them present the homogeneous daily temperature time series. Sparse, station network, especially in high latitudes, force us to use simulated reanalysis data. However those might differ from observations.\nTo obtain reliable information on temperature extreme “hot spots” in Siberia we have compared daily temperatures form ERA-40, ERA Interim, JRA-25, JRA-55, NCEP/DOE, MERRA Reanalysis, HadEX2 and GHCNDEX gridded datasets with observations from RIHMI-WDC/CDIAC dataset for overlap period 1981-2000. Data agreement was estimated at station coordinates to which reanalysis data were interpolated using modified Shepard method. Comparison of averaged over 20 year annual mean temperatures shows general agreement for Siberia excepting Baikal region, where reanalyses significantly underestimate observed temperature behavior. The annual temperatures closest to observed one were obtained from ERA-40 and ERA Interim. Furthermore, t-test results show homogeneity of these datasets, which allows one to combine them for long term time series analysis. In particular, we compared the combined data with observations for percentile-based extreme indices. In Western Siberia reanalysis and gridded data accurately reproduce observed daily max/min temperatures. For East Siberia, Lake Baikal area, ERA Interim data slightly underestimates TN90p and TX90p values. Results obtained allows regional decision-makers to get required high spatial resolution (0,25°×0,25°) climatic information products from the combined ERA data.\nThe authors acknowledge partial financial support for this research from the RFBR (13-05-12034, 14-05-00502), SB RAS Integration projects (131, VIII.80.2.1.) and grant of the President of RF (№ 181).",

            "abstract": "We propose a thin layer depth-averaged two-phase model to describe solid-fluid mixtures such as debris flows. It describes the velocity of the two phases, the compression/dilatation of the granular media and its interaction with the pore fluid pressure, that itself modifies the friction within the granular phase (Iverson et al., 2010).\nThe model is derived from a 3D two-phase model proposed by Jackson (2000) based on the 4 equations of mass and momentum conservation within the two phases. This system has 5 unknowns: the solid and fluid velocities, the solid and fluid pressures and the solid volume fraction. As a result, an additional equation inside the mixture is necessary to close the system. Surprisingly, this issue is inadequately accounted for in the models that have been developed on the basis of Jackson’s work (Bouchut et al., 2014). In particular, Pitman and Le replaced this closure simply by imposing an extra boundary condition at the surface of the flow. When making a shallow expansion, this condition can be considered as a closure condition. However, the corresponding model cannot account for a dissipative energy balance.\nWe propose here an approach to correctly deal with the thermodynamics of Jackson's equations. We close the mixture equations by a weak compressibility relation involving a critical density, or equivalently a critical pressure. Moreover, we relax one boundary condition, making it possible for the fluid to escape the granular media when compression of the granular mass occurs. Furthermore, we introduce second order terms in the equations making it possible to describe the evolution of the pore fluid pressure in response to the compression/dilatation of the granular mass without prescribing an extra ad-hoc equation for the pore pressure. We prove that the energy balance associated with this Jackson closure is dissipative, as well as its thin layer associated model. We present several numerical tests for the 1D case that are compared to the results of the model proposed by Pitman and Le.\nBouchut, Fernandez-Nieto, Mangeney, Narbona-Reina, 2014, ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis, in press.\nIverson, Logan, LaHusen, Berti, 2010, J.

On the other hand, if the flow rate in the river was more than 7.00 m 3/s (design flow rate of diversion facility), masu salmon smolt were concerned about accessing the dam reservoir, because the smolt can’t migrate to the sea through the diversion facility unfortunately. Therefore, the downstream migration of smolt was investigated around the diversion facility. The PIT tag system and radio transmitters as the biotelemetry were used to determine 1) whether masu salmon smolt were able to migrate downstream through the diversion facility and fishway at Pirika Dam, 2) when the smolt started to migrate downstream, 3) whether the downstream migration of smolt were affected by the flow increase in the river. It was clarified that 88% of the smolt were able to enter the diversion facility, and then 81% of the smolt were able to access the fishway. It was also clarified that smolt downstream migration had two peaks in a day (5:00 and 18:00). During the study period, although the flow rate was in the 2.21 m3/s to 30.44 m3/s range (average 6.70 m3/s), it was revealed that the diversion facility has a satisfactory function for the downstream migration of smolt as presented above. The survey clarified the downstream migration behavior of masu salmon by using two types of biotelemetry equipment. PIT tag and radio transmitter were found to be very effective in tracking the behavior of small fish such as smolt. PIT tags, in particular, require very little operating cost, because once they are inserted in the fish, they do not need human labor for tracking. It is desirable to actively introduce the biotelemetry as tracking equipment when surveying the fish migration in the river.",

            "abstract": "The H/V spectral ratio has emerged as a single station method within the seismic ambient noise\n(SAN) analysis field by its capability to quickly estimate the resonance frequency of a site and\nthrough inversion the average profile information. Although it is easy to compute from experimen-\ntal data, its counter theoretical part is not obvious when building a forward model which can help\nreconstructing the derived H/V spectrum. This has lead to the simplified assumption that the noise\nwavefield is mainly composed of Rayleigh wave and furthermore to consider only the left or right\nflank around the H/V peak frequency in the inversion for subsurface 1D shear wave velocity pro-\nfile. A new theoretical approach for the interpretation of the H/V spectral ratio has been presented\nby Sánchez-Sesma et al. (2011). Here, the fundamental idea behind their theory is presented as it applies to receivers at depths. A smooth H/V(z, f ) spectral curve on a broad frequency\nrange is obtained by considering a fine integration parameter which is in turn time consuming. We\nshow that this can be considerably optimized by first smoothing the Directional Energy Density\n(DED) spectrum. Further analysis shows that the obtained H/V(z, f ) spectrum computed by the\nmean of the imaginary part of Green’s function method could also be recovered using the reflec-\ntivity method for a medium well illuminated by seismic sources. Inversion of synthetic H/V(z, f )\nspectral curve is performed for a single layer over a half space. The striking results allow to poten-\ntially use the new theory as a forward computation of the H/V(z, f ) to fully invert the experimental\nH/V spectral ratio at the corresponding depth for the shear velocity profile (Vs) and additionally\nthe longitudinal velocity profile (Vp) using receivers both at the surface and in depth.

            "abstract": "As the world rapidly urbanizes, a grasp of water resources within an urban context becomes crucial to both the policy and scientific communities. Parameterizing and understanding the interactions between the land surface and terrestrial hydrologic budgets of the urban domain within watershed and regional models is critical to this goal. The work presented here assesses the processes simulated by an integrated, coupled land surface/hydrologic model at various spatial scales in the urban domain as well as the changes in partitioning of runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) as a function of land cover heterogeneity. Two land cover datasets for the City of Los Angeles are utilized: (1) the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) dataset at a 30-m resolution that categorizes the urban domain between developed open space, and low, medium and high intensity developed land cover; and (2) an ultra high-resolution dataset that classifies the City into grass, tree, bare soil, and impervious land cover at a 0.6-m resolution. Using these datasets and hourly observed meteorological forcings, we simulate various permutations and resolutions ranging from 0.6-m to 30-m for a two year spin-up and two year study period. Our analyses shows that increasing resolution alone, while holding all other parameters constant, greatly changes timing of hydrologic events and the overall hydrologic budget with higher resolutions producing less overland flow than lower resolution models. The impact of the highly organized, yet heterogeneous, land cover typical of the urban domain is also assessed. The runoff/runon processes characteristic of these domains create variations in overland flow of up to ±20% and ±3% in ET. Finally, the impact of scaling land surface and hydrologic parameters is shown to create systematic diurnal biases in the surface energy budget in contrast to the seasonal biases seen in the hydrologic fluxes. This work, in addition to creating land surface parameters for the widely used NLCD urban land covers, illustrates nonlinear issues of scale and resolution and improves understanding of how these processes affect the surface energy and hydrologic budgets.",

            "abstract": "Sakuraba and Yamauchi (2014) found in their linear stability analysis that a laminar flow through an infinitely extended sheetlike conduit embedded in an infinite elastic medium is destabilized with a much slower critical speed than previously thought, and proposed that this instability might be an origin of volcanic tremor. In their results, the viscous drag due to the main fluid flow amplifies the surface (Rayleigh) wave that involves flexural deformation of the conduit. The oscillation period of the surface wave, essentially determined by wavelength, naturally falls into a narrow range of about 0.1-1 s if their result is applied to a typical volcanic setting, firstly because there is an upper bound in the conduit (dike) length and secondly because there is an upper bound in the magma flow speed. The above flow-induced oscillation can explain why most of volcanic tremors produce similar oscillation periods despite the variety of volcanos, but there still remain some uncertainties in the model. Most importantly, the model assumes an infinitely extended dike and cannot explain emergence of multiple spectral peaks that is one of the most remarkable characteristics of volcanic tremor. In this presentation, I am going to report some results of a laboratory experiment. In order to understand the nature of a finitely extended sheetlike conduit as a wave generator, I am planning to observe oscillations of a gel in which a thin slit is made and a viscous fluid such as syrup is force to flow through it. The project is currently ongoing, but I expect that an oscillation can be excited due to a similar mechanism to that predicted in the linear study.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new approach to describe the spatial variability of the temporal changes of the geomagnetic field using spacecraft measurements. Temporal changes are well described at a given location by observatory time series.\nA study on its spatial variability is hampered by the uneven distribution of the observatories. The global coverage of magnetic satellite data has led to drastically improved geomagnetic field models. However it is both difficult\nto directly compare satellite and observatory data due to satellite movements, and to describe the secular variation (SV) in situ as it is done at ground observatory locations. To overcome this we follow a Virtual Observatories (VO)\napproach. A regular and globally homogeneous mesh of VO volumes is defined at satellite mean altitude. Satellite measurements are acquired at different altitudes for the same location, so correction for the altitude dependence\nis needed. We use an Equivalent Source Dipole (ESD) technique. For each VO and during a given time interval, all measurements are reduced to a unique location,leading to a time series similar to those available at ground\nmagnetic observatories. To validate this approach, tests are performed using synthetic data at satellite altitude.Several parameters such as the number of ESD, the mesh geometry and the VO lateral and altitude dimensions are\nstudied. The latter are adjusted in terms of the shortest time period required to have enough measurements inside the VO volume. We then apply our scheme to the first measurements of the ESA SWARM mission. We present\npreliminary results over the European area, where we locally compare our VO time series to ground observations, as well as to satellite-based model predictions.",

            "abstract": "Channelisation measures taken halfway the 20th century have had destructive consequences for the diversity of the ecology in the majority of the lowland streams in countries such as the Netherlands. Re-meandering is the common practice in restoring these lowland streams. Three lowland streams were monitored during the initial two years after construction of a new channel. The monitoring program included morphological surveys, sediment sampling, habitat pattern surveys, and discharge and water level measurements. Adjustments of the longitudinal bed profile formed the main morphological response. These adjustments were most likely caused by a lack of longitudinal connectivity of the streams as a whole, interrupting transport of sediment at locations of weirs and culverts. Bank erosion was observed only in a limited number of channel bends, and was often related to floodplain heterogeneity. Longitudinal channel bed adjustments and bank erosion were mainly caused by exogenous influences. In channel bends, the cross-sectional shape transformed from trapezoidal to the typical asymmetrical shape as found in meandering rivers. This behaviour can be attributed to an autogenous response to the prevailing flow conditions. Due to the prevailing fine sediment characteristics, bed material is readily set in motion and is being transported during the entire year. The existing design principles fail to address the initial morphological development after reconstruction. An evaluation of pre-set targets to realize water depth and flow velocity ranges shows the current procedures to be deficient. Based on this unfavourable evaluation, and the two-dimensional nature of habitat patterns needed to improve the conditions for stream organisms, we recommend to predict morphological developments as part of the design procedures for lowland stream restoration in the Netherlands.",

Temperature trends (grows up to 0.5 °C per decade), more frequent occurrence of temperature extremes provoked serious natural disasters (2010 heat waves in Russia, 2013 flood in Russia’s Far East) led to socio-economical impact (crop damages, infrastructure failures, respectively). To get reliable knowledge on location, frequency and magnitude of observed extremes we have studied daily max/min temperature trends based on ECMWF ERA Interim Reanalysis data (0,25°×0,25°). This dataset is most accurately reproduces observed temperature behavior in the region.\nStatistical analysis of daily temperature time series (1979-2012) indicates the asymmetric changes in distribution tails of such extreme indices as warm/cold days/nights. Namely, the warming during winter cold nights is stronger than during warm nights, especially over the north of Siberia. Increases in minimum temperatures are more significant than in maximum temperatures. Warming determined at the high latitudes of the region is achieved mostly due to winter temperature changes. South area of Siberia has slightly cooling during winter and summer. Results obtained provide regional decision-makers with detailed high spatial and temporal resolution climatic information required for adaptation and mitigation measures development.

In July 2012, over 97% of the Greenland ice sheet experienced surface melt, the first widespread melt during the era of satellite remote sensing. It had been previously unknown when the ice sheet had experienced melt events of this magnitude, or what caused them. Here we show that the most recent previous widespread melt occurred in 1889, and demonstrate that warm temperatures combined with black carbon sediments from Northern Hemisphere forest fires reduced albedo below a critical threshold, permitting the melt events in both 1889 and 2012. Furthermore, we use these data to project the frequency of widespread melt into the year 2100. Since arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires are both expected to rise with climate change, our results suggest that widespread melt events on the ice sheet may begin to occur almost annually by the end of century.",

Because of few far-ultraviolet airglow radiative research in our Country,the associated airglow emitting models and the retrieval algorithm studyare imperative. Based on the nighttime OI 135.6nm airglow excitation mechanism research, considering the radiative scattering of the atmospheric oxygen atoms and absorption of oxygen molecules at the band at the radiative transfer process ,the iterative method was used to solve the radiative transfer equation including multiple scattering and the atmospheric absorption attenuation. The volume emissive rates at the band could been obtained.Furthermore the radiative intensity was calculated by the path integral calculation of radiative transfer at 135.6nm band. Analysis of the results shows that the airglow model could be used to describe the volumeemissive rates with height distribution well. The 135.6nm radiative intensities calculated at different spatial temporal distribution and solar activity conditions have a good consistency with NmF2 and TEC. Under the same conditions of spatial temporal and solar activity input conditions, the radiative intensity calculated by the model was compared with similar foreign model and the mean deviation was 3%,and further confirms the correctness of the model.This paper finally introducedthe retrieval algorithmof NmF2 and TEC by measuring the nighttime OI 135.6nm airglow emissions.",

            "abstract": "Surface conductance acts as a key linkage between terrestrial water and carbon balances and strongly influences land surface response to and feedback on the near surface environment (temperature and humidity). Theory suggests optimal stomatal behavior that maximizes carbon gain while minimizing water loss. This is often examined by analysis of Water Use Efficiency (CO2 uptake / H2O loss) from observations of assimilation and transpiration, though is more formally tested with examination of the marginal water cost of plant carbon gain (dE/dA). Plant species and forms are known to vary in their water use habits, with some forms being relatively conservative (e.g trees) and others exhibiting more profligate behavior (e.g. grasses, crops), likely relating to plant hydraulics. Under drought conditions such relations remain little studied though one might expect profligate users to transition toward a more conservative strategy. Globally-distributed observations of ecosystem scale water and carbon fluxes and associated environmental conditions from FLUXNET provide an emerging opportunity to examine the above relationships and theory in hopes of improving ability to characterize surface conductance. This presentation will seek to review recent findings and offer new analysis and synthesis perspectives on plant water use strategies and carbon gain with implications for energy balance, runoff, the Budyko hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, the scientific community has embraced the use of RPAS (remotely piloted aircraft system) as a tool to improve observations of the Earth’s surface and atmospheric phenomena. The use of small RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) in atmospheric research has increased because of their relative low-cost, compact size and ease of operation. Small RPAS are especially adapted for observing the atmospheric boundary layer processes at high vertical and temporal resolution. To this end, CNRM, ENAC, and ENM have developed the VOLTIGE (Vecteurs d’Observation de La Troposphere pour l’Investigation et la Gestion de l’Environnement) program to study the life cycle of fog with multiple, small RPAS. The instrumented RPAS flights have successfully observed the evolution of the boundary layer and dissipation of fog events. In addition, vertical profiles from the RPAS have been compared with Météo France forecast models, and the results suggest that forecast models may be improved using high resolution and frequent in-situ measurements.\nWithin the VOLTIGE project, a flying-wing RPAS with four control surfaces was developed to separate elevator and aileron controls in order to reduce the pitch angle envelope and improve turbulence and albedo measurements. The result leads to a small RPAS with the capability of flying up to two hours with 150 grams of payload, while keeping the hand-launch capability as a constraint for regular atmospheric research missions. High frequency data logging has been integrated into the main autopilot in order to synchronize navigation and payload measurements, as well as allowing an efficient sensor-based navigation.\nThe VOLTIGE program also encourages direct participation of students on the advancement of novel observing systems for atmospheric sciences, and provides a step towards deploying small RPAS in an operational network.\nVOLTIGE is funded by the Agence Nationale de Recherche (ANR-Blanc 2012) and supported by Aerospace Valley.",

            "abstract": "The mass and composition of Titan’s massive atmosphere, which is dominated by N2 and CH4 at present, have probably varied all along its history owing to a combination of exogenous and endogenous processes. In a recent study, we investigated its fate during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) by modeling the competitive loss and supply of volatiles by cometary impacts and their consequences on the atmospheric balance. We examine the emergence of an atmosphere as well as the evolution of a primitive atmosphere of various sizes and compositions. By considering an impactor population characteristic of the LHB, we showed that an atmosphere with a mass equivalent to the present-day one cannot be formed during the LHB era. Our calculations indicated that the high-velocity impacts during the LHB led to a strong atmospheric erosion, so that the pre-LHB atmosphere should be 5 to 7 times more massive than at present (depending mostly on the albedo), in order to sustain an atmosphere equivalent to the present-day one. This implies that either a massive atmosphere was formed on Titan during its accretion or that the nitrogen-rich atmosphere was generated after the LHB.\nTo investigate the primitive atmosphere of the satellite, we consider chemical exchanges of volatils between a global water ocean at Titan's surface, generated by impact heating during the accretion and an atmosphere. We are currently developing a liquid-vapor equilibrium model for various initial oceanic composition to investigate how a massive atmosphere may be generated during the satellite growth and how it may evolve toward a composition dominated by N2. More generally, our model address how atmosphere may be generated in water-rich objects, which may be common around other stars.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the long-term trend and decadal variability of surface air temperature (SAT) are studied by using observation data from 1901-2009. We found that the warming trends of the semi-arid regions are higher than other lands, which have increased 2.42°C as compared to the global annual mean temperature increase of 1.13°C over land. To investigate the causes of Enhanced Semi-Arid Warming (ESAW), we used an advanced dynamic-adjusted method proposed by Wallace et al. (2012) to analyse the contribution of dynamically-induced and anthropogenic-induced SAT changes to ESAW. In the process of dynamic adjustment, the temperature has been divided into two parts, one for the dynamic forcing induced temperature, and the other for the temperature associated with the build-up of greenhouse gases and the other various radiative forcing. The results show that the anthropogenic-warming peak over semi-arid region plays the main role in the ESAW. Such anthropogenic warming peak may be related to reduction of snow cover due to black carbon (BC) emission by fuels for winter residential heating. Besides the impact of BC in snow, the agricultural mulch creation, wind farms and other types of human activities may also make attribution to local SAT changes that need to be further studied.",

East of the Sumba Island, the western boundary of the Savu basin originated during Middle Miocene by the southeastward slab retreat below the Sunda-Banda arc (Rigg and Hall, 2001). Previous studies has detected a global uplift of the island accommodating the Australian plate - South West Banda Arc convergence (Fleury et al., 2009). This uplift is associated with northeastward tilting and gravitational collapse to the South. Analyses of various geomorphic markers (perched low relief landscapes, rockyshore platform, coral reef terraces, drainages) and of morphometric indices allowed us to localise new structures (faults and folds), to determine the chronology of their activation and to better constraint the uplift history of Sumba Island. These results aim to understand the evolution of the deformation in Sumba Island in regard with its geodynamic context from Middle Miocene to present-day.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation distribution has received much attention in ecohydrological research because of its essential role in terrestrial hydraulic cycling. Although tightly coupled to precipitation and temperature, the real-life vegetation cover pattern under certain climate conditions is hard to be reproduced theoretically. Eagleson proposed an optimality theory on calculating the optimum vegetation cover (M, defined as fraction of total ground surface covered by vegetation) through a solution of simultaneous equations reflecting the balance of water demand and water supply. Two equations were built under a long-term equilibrium state with fixed vegetation species, climate and soil types. One represented water demand which was derived from the potential canopy conductance- the ratio of potential transpiration to potential bare soil evaporation. The other was for water supply composed of information about precipitation and soil conditions. Their joint solution would be the theoretical optimum vegetation cover. Although the optimality theory was proposed as the theoretical basis of ecohydrology, only few works have been carried out to evaluate it.\nIn this work, we tested Eagleson’s optimality in the Horqin Sand in Inner Mongolia, China, featured by natural vegetation types of grassland and bushes. MODIS datasets were used as basic data to evaluate two vegetation parameters- vegetation cover (M) and leaf area index (LAI). M was conducted from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with temporal resolution of 15 days and spatial resolution of 250 meters (from 2000 to 2012), and was averaged by 0.39 on the whole area during rainy season (May to September).LAI was used with temporal resolution of 4 days and spatial resolution of 1 kilometers (from 2003 to 2012), and mean LAI on the whole area was 0.45 during rainy season. Meteorological data over 50 years (1951-2012) were obtained from three weather stations in this area. Annual mean precipitation was 365.0mm; annual mean air temperature was 6.2℃; annual mean potential evapotranspiration was 715.4mm. Our result showed proximity to the theoretical optimal state, which meant that Eagleson’s ecohydrological optimality was practical in this area.",

            "abstract": "In regions of incipient break-up, such as Afar, it has been found that there is a variation in the composition of the erupted basalts and distribution of faulting between different segments. In Afar, the Dabbahu magmatic segment shows distributed faulting while the Erta Ale segment to the north does not. Analysis of the mafic rocks that erupted recently (< 100 ka) has found that there is a difference in rare Earth (REE) composition between these segments. Erta Ale is relatively enriched in lighter elements when compared to Dabbahu. We will explore if the observed differences in the accommodation of extension, the increased distribution of faulting, and the variation in melt composition are both functions of crustal rheology. Current research has recently found that crustal rheology impacts the onset and distribution of melting (Peréz-Gussinye et al., submitted to EPSL). We build upon this work, using a numerical model of extension and decompression melting to explore how upper and lower crustal rheology impacts the zone of partial melting.\nWe explore various Arrhenius type rheologies where the principal difference between 'strong' and 'weak' forms is a six order of magnitude larger pre-factor. The result of a large reduction in the strength of the lower crust is to delay melt generation and reduce the melt production rate. For the strong model focused strain results in a narrow, shallow region of partial melting and a rapid reduction in light REE concentrations. For the weak model extension is more distributed resulting in a period of time where melting is held at depth due to the protracted thinning of the crustal lid. This reduces the melt production rate and the rate of change in composition. The difference in melt generation only exists during rifting: all models reach the same steady-state as this is a function of mantle temperature. In Afar, kinematic reconstructions would suggest that the onset of extension becomes younger in the north as the region 'un-zipped'. Our model implies that the younger Erta Ale segment has a strong crust, extension is focused and current magmatism represents the first signs of melting (given the light REE enrichment). To the south the onset of extension is older, the crust is weaker and melting is somewhat restricted to deeper depths. Volcanism during break-up is therefore influenced by crustal rheology.",

            "abstract": "Slabs display a wide range of morphologies in the mantle transition zone. This slab transition zone deformation is likely caused by a barrier arising from a jump of viscosity between upper and lower mantle, and/or from the endothermic phase transitions at 660-km depth. We use 2-D thermo-mechanical models of a two-plate subduction system, modeled with the finite-element, adaptive-mesh code Fluidity, to investigate the influence of the viscosity jump on slab morphologies. We implement a temperature- and stress-dependent rheology, and variable viscosity increases from upper to lower mantle of 10, 30 or 100 (no mineral phase transitions). Various end-member subduction modes arise, ranging from vertical folding to horizontally deflected to retreating and penetrating slabs. For each viscosity contrast between upper and lower mantle, we build a regime diagram for subduction dynamics based on the initial subducting and overriding plate ages. Trench motion is facilitated by smaller upper-lower-mantle viscosity contrasts, and, for all but the oldest subducting plate cases, simulations with a 100-fold viscosity increase exhibit a stationary trench later in their evolution. Slower sinking rates also lead to weaker (lower-viscosity) slabs encountering the viscosity jump. These effects, together with the increased resistance to penetration associated with a more viscous lower mantle, produce increasingly deformed and stalling slabs at depth, as the viscosity contrast increases. Slab deformation in the transition zone leads to an alternation between phases of penetration into the lower mantle and stagnation phases, reflected in subducting plate velocity. The periodicity and amplitude of such oscillations is directly controlled by the magnitude of the viscosity jump. Hence, our dynamic models help to interpret present-day observations of slab morphologies, along with the time-evolution of plate surface velocities, in terms of Earth rheology. The range of observed slab morphologies is best reproduced by models with a 30-fold increase in viscosity.",

The UAV photogrammetry, optical granulometry, ground LiDAR scanning and sensor network monitoring were applied as a base for building hydrodynamic model for simulation of fluvial dynamics.\nThe UAV photogrammetry is employed to acquire high precision DTM and especially for quantitative analysis of volumetric changes related to initial flood events. The hexacopter platform has been used to acquire the data for photogrammetric analysis of complex stretch of stream with historically elevated fluvial dynamics. The SfM algorithm was used to extract accurate DTM of the channel and to consequently analyze the volumetric changes after a flood event.\nThe sensor network with automated high frequency water level monitoring was used to derive information on hydrological properties of initial flood event. The digital granulometry enabled to analyze the structure of sedimentary material in floodplain. The terrestrial LiDAR scanning allows construction of very detailed 3D models of selected fluvial forms, enabling deeper insight into the effects of fluvial dynamics and to verify the spatial information acquired using UAS photogrammetry.\nThe results of above mentioned techniques are applied to build hydrodynamic model explaining threshold conditions for initiation of changes in fluvial morphology of the riverbed in relation to known and theoretical flood magnitude.\nThe results achieved in the study enabled us to discuss the synergic potential of coupling the UAV photogrammetry, sensor networks and other high precision survey techniques to enhance significantly our knowledge on the dynamics of fluvial systems.",

The initiation of submarine slope failures may be due to long-term triggers like the formation of weak layers, sedimentation rates and fault displacements, as well as short-term triggers like earthquakes and storm waves, or a combination of both of them.\nThe recurrence period of submarine slope failures can be linked to the recurrence period of their triggers. When the main trigger of slope failure is an earthquake, it is possible to estimate numerically the probability density of the return period for slope failure by using the seismic hazard curve and a mechanical model for earthquake-triggered slope instability.\nThis paper presents a procedure to calculate the conditional probability of slope failure with the maximum probability density (peak) to obtain the return period of the earthquake event with the largest probability of inducing a slope failure. The conditional probability corresponding to the maximum probability density is estimated after obtaining several conditional cumulative probability points for different earthquake return periods, and matching a cumulative distribution function (CDF) to those points; finally, the maximum probability density of the corresponding probability density function (PDF) is obtained.\nThe suggested analytical procedure is applied and compared with available geological evidence in a site located in the Gulf of Mexico.",

            "abstract": "Warming of the global climate system is unequivocal, predominantly due to rising greenhouse gases with direct implications from rising mean global temperatures for some slow-onset events such as sea level rise, which can therefore be linked directly to past emissions. In many regions, however, extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, are associated with greater loss and damage. An increase in average temperatures will lead to an increase in the frequency or magnitude of some extreme weather events including heat waves and droughts. For example, the deaths of at least thirty-five thousand people in Europe are attributable to the record-breaking heat wave of 2003. Extreme heat events and subsequent droughts can be directly linked to the loss of human life as well as damage to, or the significant diminishment of economic productivity.\nTwo points are crucial here. First, the science of attributing slow-onset phenomena, such as higher mean temperatures or rising sea levels, to greenhouse gas emissions and other anthropogenic climatic forcings is different than the science of attributing particular extreme weather events, such as heat waves and extreme precipitation, to anthropogenic global climate change. The latter requires a different statistical approach. Second, extreme weather events, at least in the short term, will cause more damage and thus adversely affect society more than slow-onset phenomena.\nBut while there is widespread agreement that slow-onset climate affects can be reliably attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions our ability to attribute any particular extreme weather event to anthropogenic climate change is less accepted. However, with the emerging science of probabilistic event attribution it is possible to attribute the fraction of risk caused by anthropogenic climate change to particular weather events and their associated losses. Even with high uncertainty the robust link of a only a small fraction of excessive deaths in a heatwave to man-made climate change is from an ethical point of you very significant and we argue that this has widespread implications, e.g. for pending policy decisions concerning the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage.",

            "abstract": "We present a study of magma differentiation and outgassing during a unique and little studied eruption of Etna from the parasitic Monti Rossi cone in 1669, which was the most destructive event in historical times. We show that the large lava effusion rate and areal extent of the lava flows from this eruption may have caused the convective penetration of sulfur-rich gas clouds high into the atmosphere, which would have caused regional environmental effects. The eruption was highly unusual for Etna: it occurred low on the flanks (800 m.a.s.l.) and involved 607±105 ×106 m3 lava erupted over 3 months, which overran many settlements, including the city of Catania. The average lava effusion rate was 58±10 m3/s , but peak of 640 m3/s was reached in the first days of activity; the flow field covered a total area of ∼40×106 m2 in only 4 months [Branca et al., 2013]. It is the widest and longest lava field (∼17 km) produced by Etna volcano both in historical and in prehistoric times. We have carried out a detailed study of melt inclusion trace and volatile element geochemistry to reconstruct melt differentiation and degassing processes prior to eruption. We estimate the sulfur output of the 1669 eruption and we find that > 3 Mt sulfur may have been produced over the 3 months of activity which, given the large area and high mass flux of the lava flows, may have been lofted into the upper troposphere by thermal convection. The sulfur loading would have caused extensive regional perturbations to atmospheric chemistry and environmental hazards. Effusive basaltic eruptions of this size and style are common in the geological record yet infrequent enough such that they are rarely observed using modern volcano monitoring methods. As a consequence, their impact and potential environmental consequences are poorly understood.\nBranca, S. et al., 2013. Bull Volcanol. 75: 694.",

Studies have typically focussed on the storage of carbon in biomass over short timescales. Over intermediate timescales, an important component of carbon-related ecohydrological processes is the way in which carbon is transferred from biomass to soil organic matter. These transfers are also significantly affected by land degradation via erosion processes which result in redistribution and net loss of carbon from the local system. Many drylands are underlain by significant stores of inorganic carbon, some of which is deposited from aeolian material, but vertical transfer from the surface stores is also an important process. Numerous studies suggest that these stores are in place from thousands to millions of years and thus contain carbon that has long been taken out of the global cycle. As progressive land degradation occurs, these stores are increasingly being exposed at the surface, and thus reactivated as part of the global cycle. In the context of climate change where increasingly stormy conditions are likely to accelerate the mobilization of sediment and associated carbon, and where increasingly acidic rainfall exacerbates dissolution of inorganic carbon, there is the potential for a significant addition to atmospheric carbon at regional and global scales. We will evaluate the relative importance of this mechanism compared to sequestration in vegetation and discuss the implications for maximizing ecosystem-service provision in drylands.",

            "abstract": "Water escape from dehydrating rocks within the Earth’s interior is a key process for long-term global water and element cycles, eg. at subduction zones a fluid escape mechanism must exist that prevents ocean water to be drained into the mantle. Existing fluid flow models require a priori physical assumptions (eg. preexisting porosity) and cannot resolve the evolution from initial fluid production to flow channelization. In order to develop a model of this evolution, we need to unravel natural laboratories that display the incipient dehydration stages and the micro- to macro-scale fluid escape route evolution. The Erro-Tobbio meta-serpentinites (Italy) provide a unique snapshot into these early dehydration stages, recording the breakdown of hydrous antigorite to anhydrous olivine plus fluid and the formation of an olivine-vein network. We find that dehydration, fluid pooling, and flow initiation are controlled by micro-scale compositional rock differences. Our model starts with a rock in which all water is stored in solid and any preexisting porosity is negligible (zero-porosity case). As the rock descents into the mantle increasing T will initiate dehydration reactions, dividing the rock continuously into a dry solid and a fluid-filled porosity. Spatially variable reaction progress results in dynamically evolving porosity/permeability and heterogeneous fluid-pore pressure distributions. Fluid-pressure gradient relaxation causes fluid flow and its thermodynamic feedback triggers reactions to progress, resulting in a self-amplifying process.\nOur new thermodynamic-mechanical model for reaction-porosity waves shows that fluid flow occurs solely in the reaction products and self-organizes into channelized fluid escape networks. This holds the key to formulating future quantitative models that address spatiotemporal processes such as the coupling between fluid release at depth and volcanic eruptions and the amounts of structurally bound water transferred into deep Earth.",

            "abstract": "The Chaîne des Puys is a highly varied, type monogenetic field, and was acknowledged by 38th WH UNESCO Committee to contain Outstanding Universal Value. The Chaîne des Puys - Limagne Fault should be presented in 2016 for World Heritage Status. The 30 km long Chaîne des Puys contains ranges from simple basaltic scoria cones to complex, multicrater cones, and small simple domes to complicated trachytic edifices. There is also a range of phreatomagmatic landforms from tuff rings to maars and vulcanian to sub plinian deposits. There is a wide range of pahoehoe and aa lava types, that have flowed over different topographies. Here we take morphometrical data to analyse the variability of the edifices using a 10 m regional topographic DTM. The volcanoes form a broad continuum of morphological features, and height/widths of domes and cones overlap. Some edifices, are smooth and elliptical, even though they have erupted complex lava sequences, while others complex shapes, but are related to simple lava flows. There seems to be no easy correlation between cone morphology and eruption histories derived from lava fields and distal tephras. In the few cones where the interior is visible, the shape of the cone is seen to vary with changing eruption events. The final shape is a combination of changing activity, with the last events having the strongest morphometic signature. The broad variations in edifice, lava field, and deposit morphology are described and quantified, however it becomes clear from the few individual eruptions already studied, that to fully appreciate the range of monogenetic eruption scenarios presented by the Chaîne des Puys, much more detailed work is required. This is being made possible by new acquisitions of LiDAR imagery, new geophysical work, and the combination of excellent preservation and extensive outcrop that is partly the result the original geology and long term responsible land management by the local populace, regional park and local government.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are a common transport mechanism associated with explosive eruptions. They behave as particulate density current (flows of particles and fluid, whose driving force is the excess density compared to the ambient fluid). The particles thus are the defining part of the flow acting as the agent of momentum and the resultant deposits, making PDC sedimentology fundamental. We combine wind tunnel measurements with nontraditional field techniques to consider cross-bedding from dilute PDCs from the mm to the km scale.\nEach deposited particle requires 1) momentum to reach its final location, but 2) sufficiently low shearing to halt at this place. A range of shearing is constrained from wind tunnel measurements. The results are combined with field data from lacquer peel sampling (an outcrop is impregnated with a solidifying glue, preserving the primary organization of the grains). This enables quantification of the grain size of mm-scale laminae, giving an order of magnitude of turbulence during deposition.\nThe lacquer peel technique also imaged cm-scale, soft sediment deformation patterns producing overturned beds. These are interpreted as related to Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instabilities between a granular-based flow and the bed.\nDune bedform (DBs) cross-stratification at the m scale generally have an overall stoss-aggrading stacking pattern. Often interpreted as indicating supercritical flows, the wind-tunnel results and DBs’ geometry rather suggest they are a specificity of particulate density currents with high deposition rates.\nGround penetrating radar (GPR) reveals the 3D stability in location of a DB over several m depth, although stacking patterns vary with time and laterally. This emphasizes the primary influence of the basal boundary layer in the depositional dynamics.\nAt the 100 m scale, DBs’ shape evolves in dimensions and form, calling for 3D datasets. Terrestrial laser scanner and photogrammetry enable quantification of the evolution of DBs’ outer shape and document the depositional history.\nThe understanding of PDC cross-bedding is emerging, but ample evidence of the extreme variability in sedimentary facies in depth and laterally call for 3D acquisition schemes from the mm to km scale to depict correctly and understand the information in the buried deposits.",

            "abstract": "Climate models have made a notable contribution to increasing our understanding of the climate system, and in particular its response to forcings from greenhouse gases. In parallel, models of the human cognitive system have also made a notable contribution to our understanding of how people think and reason, and in particular the limitations of human cognition. In light of the challenges that climate change poses to politics and society at large, the intersection of human cognition and the climate system deserves to be examined more closely. For example, recent analyses (Lewandowsky et al., 2014, Climatic Change) have shown that the magnitude of uncertainty about future temperature increases is associated with the magnitude of future risk: That is, the greater the uncertainty, the greater the expected damage costs and risk of mitigation failure. Greater uncertainty should therefore lead to greater, not lesser, concern about climate change. However, there is evidence that uncertainty sometimes has the opposite effect on people, for example by inviting “wishful thinking.” I review some of the mismatches between the actual behavior of the climate system and people’s responses to climate change. I also identify some ways in which people and the climate behave similarly: For example, the climate system is known to include “amplifying loops” and “tipping points”, and I argue that human societies may similarly amplify small disturbances from climate change into larger ones.",

This complexity has been augmented by isolated research on the impact of ALU on the landscape’s capacity to provide ES in most climatically vulnerable areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. Though a considerable number of studies emphasise the nexus between specific land use types and their impact on ES, a sufficient modelling basis for an empirical consideration of spatial interactions between different agricultural land uses at the landscape scale within peri-urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa is consistently missing. The need to assess and address significant issues regarding size, shape, spatial location, and interactivity of different land use patches in assessing land use interactions and their impact on ecosystem service provision necessitated this investigation. To formulate a methodology to correspond to this complexity, ES obtained from a characteristically agricultural and urbanizing landscapes were mapped using analytical hierarchical processes and management expert approaches. Further, landscape metrics and mean enrichment factor approaches are explored as neighbourhood assessment tools aimed at assessing the mutual impact gradient of agricultural and adjacent urban land uses on ES provision. Implementation is undertaken in GISCAME using a 2012 rapideye image classification and primary data collected on selected ES from local farmers within the VEA catchment of Upper East, Ghana. The outcome aims to provide the understanding of expected trade-offs and synergies varying ALU could pose to current and potential ES provision within urbanizing landscapes.

            "abstract": "Glacial cycles impact continental volcanism through pressure changes associated with growth and retreat of ice sheets [e.g. Iceland - Jull, 1996]. Similarly, changes in sea level accompanying glacial cycles modulate mid-ocean ridge (MOR) volcanism by pressure changes and their influence on melt production [Crowley 2014; Lund 2011; Huybers 2009]. CO2 transport through the upper mantle is sensitive to mantle melting because CO2 partitions completely into the melt phase when present. Melt then transports CO2 to the ridge axis, where it enters the climate system. We present models of CO2 transport that investigate how sea level modulates the rate of CO2 emission from MORs. The total carbon reservoir in the mantle is circa 10^7 GtC [Dasgupta 2010], orders of magnitude more than the oceans (40,000 GtC) and atmosphere (600 GtC). Changes in the rate of CO2 emission from the solid Earth therefore have the potential to significantly affect the surface carbon system.\nWe have developed an analytical model of CO2 transport from the depth of first silicate melting (~60km) to the ridge axis, enabling a calculation of CO2 emission rate for a generic section of MOR. The model assumes homogeneous mantle and energy-conserving melt production from a simplified 2-component mantle; CO2 is taken as a perfectly incompatible trace element. Pressure variations modulate the depth of initial silicate melting and hence the flux of CO2 into the melting regime. The model can also be applied to any species that is strongly partitioned into the melt (eg. Uranium, Thorium, Niobium, Barium, Rubidium).\nResults suggest that changing sea level over the past Myr could have altered the CO2 emissions from MOR by ~8%. The magnitude of variation in emissions is sensitive to the mantle permeability, the ridge spreading rate, and the rate of change of sea level. The travel time of melt through the mantle causes a delay between sea-level change and the CO2 response of the MOR. This delay is sensitive to plate spreading rate and mantle permeability.\nDelayed CO2 response to ice-age-driven sea-level creates the possibility of climactic feedback. A dynamical-systems climate model indicates that for sufficiently large and delayed variations in emissions, such a feedback could pace the glacial/interglacial oscillations.",

We present our experience of the Chaîne des Puys and Limagne fault UNESCO World heritage project, which shows how geoheritage can be a very successful communication tool, especially as it draws in the non-peers into the geological process at many levels. First and foremost is the local level, as no geoheritage project can be successful without local participation. Few geological localities on Earth are now devoid of human influence or habitation, and thus those who live and work on sites are the necessary first stage custodians. This means that locals must gain some understanding of their geology in order to appreciate their heritage. As such people tend to have a close relationship with their land, this is often half way done: local land use, customs are often easily integrated with geological knowledge. Once this link exists, communicating ideas that can be useful for management or for dealing with hazards is easier. Sometimes more tricky is communication to visitors, tourists and politicians who do not have such as close link to the landscape. Here, the educational strategy has to be different, with a need for them to learn what the landscape is and how it is managed, and lived in. During the development of the World Heritage Chaîne des Puys and Limagne Fault project the project team has been composed of geoscientists actively working on the area, agronomists local administration (such as natural park and local government members), and landscape specialists. Each has engaged in communication at different levels channelled either through personal contacts, or through more formal means, such as exhibitions, talks, and websites. Scientists have become communicators, and non-peers have begun to see the landscape though a geolologist eyes. A Geological landscape has begun to emerge in the popular perception.",

            "abstract": "Heavily populated urban centers and natural areas located in low lying coastal regions are highly vulnerable to sea level extremes. Current practice of using probabilistic methods for predicting future sea level extremes is based on concepts of return period and risk that have been developed under stationarity conditions. Recently, similar concepts under non-stationary conditions have been developed and a paradigm shift is needed to incorporate the newer concepts into practice. Current projections of future sea levels include varying degrees of acceleration with significant uncertainty and often alternative scenarios are considered on a risk-based framework for planning coastal infrastructure. Extension of the traditional concepts of return period and risk into a non-stationary framework is demonstrated by assuming a probability distribution of extreme values that is parameterized as a function of time. Specifically, the Generalized Extreme Value distribution with time-varying parameters has been applied for fitting the distribution of extreme sea level data. The scenario based projection of mean sea level is linked to the location parameter of the extreme value distribution. This allows the estimation of return period and risk associated with future sea levels in a changing world where mean sea level is expected to be accelerating. Confidence intervals for the projections of extreme sea levels using the new paradigm are also presented. The methodology presented here as demonstrated using the data from few tide gages can be used for planning and design of coastal infrastructure in a changing climate. The presentation ends with a discussion of a number of relevant issues involved in considering non-stationarity in planning and design of coastal projects.",

The Shafdan SAT facility in Israel, one of the largest in the world, is being successfully operated for many years. However, due to increasing amounts of waste water the infiltration capacity approaches its limit. Our study aims at better understanding the infiltration process and hereupon improving the efficiency of the infiltration management using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in combination with hydrological methods. We installed three permanent ERT lines within one infiltration pond close to the city of Yavneh, south of Tel Aviv. Each line comprises 96 electrodes, separated by 2 m in one line and 0.5 m in the other two lines. The sediments below the pond are mainly composed of sands and porous sandstone. In order to calibrate the ERT results, water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity were measured in-situ at different depths in shallow regions of the pond, and cores from Geoprobe drillings were taken for lithological analyses. Continuous ERT monitoring was conducted over two months spanning infiltration scenarios characterized by different flooding sequences. The averaged apparent resistivity data over time show a clear response which can be related to the overall water content dynamics in the vadose zone (over 30 m). The inverted ERT images indicate that the infiltration is strongly affected by subsurface heterogeneity. With a view to setting up a hydrological model, we analyzed the transient behavior of the local drying curves after breakthrough of the infiltration front for each pixel of the ERT image sequence. This approach represents a new, “dynamic” method for subsurface hydraulic zonation based on time-lapse ERT. Our study shows that ERT helps to better understand the dynamics of water infiltration processes in the context of SAT under real-world conditions, and by this may contribute to enhancing the efficiency of SAT facilities.",

            "abstract": "While Archean terrains are mainly composed of a TTG (Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) suite, more mafic lithologies such as amphibolites are also a typical component of those ancient terrains. Although mafic rocks represent only ~10% of the Archean cratons, they may provide key evidence of the role and nature of basaltic magmatism in the formation of the Archean crust as well as the evolution of the Archean mantle.\nThis study focuses on the Archean crust from the West African Craton in Mauritania (Amsaga area). The Amsaga Archean Crust mainly consists of TTG and thrust-imbricated slices of mafic volcanic rocks, which have been affected by polymetamorphic events from the amphibolite to granulite facies.\nOur main objectives aim to the identification of the mafic lithology origin and a better understanding of their role in the continental crust emplacement.\nOur petrological observations show that these amphibolites have fine to medium granoblastic and nematoblastic textures. The amphibolites are dominated by amphibolite-facies mineral assemblages (mainly amphibole and plagioclase), but garnet and clinopyroxene occur in a few samples.\nTwo groups are distinct in their geochemical characteristics (major and trace elements), although both have tholeiitic basalt composition. The first group show LREE-enriched patterns and negative Nb-Ta anomalies. The second group is characterized by near-flat LREE patterns and flat HREE patterns. This second group clearly shows no Nb-Ta anomalies.\nThe first group could be related to arc-like basalts, as it is many similarities with some Archean amphibolites probably formed in a supra-subduction zone, for instance the volcanic rocks from the southern edge of the Isua Supracrustal Belt.\nOn the contrary, the second group has a MORB-like signature which is more unusual during the Archean. Different scenarios will be discussed regards to the Archean geodynamics.",

A weather generator (WG) is used for temporal downscaling of input weather data for models, where the effect of WG algorithms on reproducibility of ecosystem model outputs must be assessed. In this study simulated carbon and water cycle by Biome-BGC model using weather data measured and generated by CLIMGEN weather generator were compared.\n The measured weather data (daily precipitation, maximum, minimum air temperature) at a few sites for 30 years was collected from NNDC Online weather data. The generated weather data was produced by CLIMGEN parameterized using the measured weather data. NPP, heterotrophic respiration (HR), NEE and water outflow were simulated by Biome-BGC using measured and generated weather data. In the case of deciduous broad leaf forest in Lushi, Henan Province, China, 30 years average monthly NPP by WG was 10% larger than that by measured weather in the growing season. HR by WG was larger than that by measured weather in all months by 15% in average. NEE by WG was more negative in winter and was close to that by measured weather in summer. These differences in carbon cycle were because the soil water content by WG was larger than that by measured weather. The difference between monthly water outflow by WG and by measured weather was large and variable, and annual outflow by WG was 50% of that by measured weather. The inconsistency in carbon and water cycle by WG and measured weather was suggested be affected by the difference in temporal concentration of precipitation, which was assessed.",

            "abstract": "Using two synchronized high-speed cameras we were able to reconstruct the three-dimensional displacement and velocity field of bomb-sized pyroclasts in Strombolian explosions at Stromboli Volcano. Relatively low-intensity Strombolian-style activity offers a rare opportunity to observe volcanic processes that remain hidden from view during more violent explosive activity. Such processes include the ejection and emplacement of bomb-sized clasts along pure or drag-modified ballistic trajectories, in-flight bomb collision, and gas liberation dynamics.\nHigh-speed imaging of Strombolian activity has already opened new windows for the study of the abovementioned processes, but to date has only utilized two-dimensional analysis with limited motion detection and ability to record motion towards or away from the observer. To overcome this limitation, we deployed two synchronized high-speed video cameras at Stromboli. The two cameras, located sixty meters apart, filmed Strombolian explosions at 500 and 1000 frames per second and with different resolutions. Frames from the two cameras were pre-processed and combined into a single video showing frames alternating from one to the other camera. Bomb-sized pyroclasts were then manually identified and tracked in the combined video, together with fixed reference points located as close as possible to the vent. The results from manual tracking were fed to a custom software routine that, knowing the relative position of the vent and cameras, and the field of view of the latter, provided the position of each bomb relative to the reference points.\nBy tracking tens of bombs over five to ten frames at different intervals during one explosion, we were able to reconstruct the three-dimensional evolution of the displacement and velocity fields of bomb-sized pyroclasts during individual Strombolian explosions. Shifting jet directivity and dispersal angle clearly appear from the three-dimensional analysis.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-induced landslides are significant natural hazards in Taiwan. This study analyzes 282 shallow landslides in Taiwan during 2006-2013 to identify the rainfall conditions responsible for landslides. We used the soil water index (SWI) which can represent the conceptual soil water contents as influenced by present and antecedent rainfall. SWI is used by the Japan Meteorological Agency to assess landslide hazards in Japan. Previous studies show that SWI can successfully predict the occurrence of landslides but only for Japan. Therefore, this study examines whether SWI can be also applied to Taiwan. We used the landslide data in 2006-2012 for analyses and those in 2013 for verification. The values of SWI before the rainfall events which triggered landslides were used as the indicator of the antecedent rainfall condition. We found that under different values of SWI before rainfall events, the rainfall conditions needed for triggering landslides, such as the rainfall intensity and duration, are different. Then we classified rainfall condition for triggering landslides into two types, short duration-high intensity (SH) and long duration-low intensity (LL), based on SWI and the principal component analysis. The SH type is associated with a rapid increase of SWI with short duration, and the LL type is with a gradual rise and subsequent constancy of SWI. Based on this result, we modeled the general trend of changes in SWI for the two types. We then verified the model by analyzing 19 landslides that occurred in 2013 with 14 SH types and five LL types. We also checked hourly changes in SWI for these 19 events and found that they all followed the general trend of the inferred SH and LL curves. Based on these results, it would be possible to predict a landslide of the SH or LL type, at an early stage of a rainfall event. Our results indicate that SWI is applicable to Taiwan in assessing regional landslide hazards.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory experiments indicate that even small concentrations of CO2 in the upper mantle significantly affect the silicate melting behavior [DH06]. CO2 stabilizes carbon-rich melt at high pressure, thus vastly increasing the volume of the upper mantle expected to be partially molten [H10,DH10]. These small-degree melts have important consequences for chemical differentiation and could affect the dynamics of mantle flow. We have developed theory and numerical implementation to simulate thermo-chemically coupled magma/mantle dynamics in terms of a two-phase (rock+melt), three component (dunite+basalt+volatiles) physical model. The fluid dynamics is based on McKenzie’s equations [McK84], while the thermo-chemical formulation of the system is represented by a novel, disequilibrium approach to volatile-bearing mantle melting. An experimentally constrained ternary phase diagram, based on an effective solid solution, is used to characterize the equilibrium state in the system. This physical model is implemented as a parallel, two-dimensional finite-volume code that leverages tools from the PETSc library.\nEarly application of this simulation code to a mid-ocean ridge system suggests that the methodology captures some of the first order features of carbonated mantle melting, including deep, low-degree, volatile-rich melt formation. Melt segregation leads to continuous dynamic thermo-chemical dis-equilibration, while phenomenologically derived reaction rates continually move the system towards re-equilibration. The simulations will be used to first characterize carbon extraction from the MOR system assuming chemically homogeneous mantle, and will subsequently be extended to investigate the consequences of heterogeneity in lithology [KW12] and volatile content. Such studies will advance our understanding of the role that the mid-ocean ridge system plays in the deep carbon cycle.\nREFERENCES\nDH06 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2006), doi:10.1038/nature04612.\nH10 Hirschmann (2010), doi:10.1016/j.pepi.2009.12.003.\nDH10 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2010), doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.039.\nMcK84 McKenzie (1984), J.Pet.\nKW12 Katz & Weatherley (2012), doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.042.",

Furthermore, a rising sea level influences coastal areas like salt marshes and abets processes which will lead to elevated organohalogen formation. An additional increase of the global warming potential, of particle formation and stratospheric ozone depletion is expected. Understanding these multifaceted processes is essential for mankind to be prepared for these alterations of the atmosphere.\nFor example, Keppler et al. (2000) described the production of volatile halogenated organic compounds via oxidation of organic matter driven by ferric iron. However, the formation of long-chained alkyl halides in salt lakes is yet undisclosed. Despite the relative “inertness” of alkanes a direct halogenation of these compounds might be envisaged.\nIn 2005 Vaillancourt et al. discovered a nonheme iron enzyme which is able to halogenate organic compounds via generating the high valent ferryl cation as reaction center. Based on various publications about C-H activation (Bergman, 2007) we postulate a halogenation process in which an iron containing minerals catalyse the C-H bond cleavage of organic compounds in soils. The generated organic radicals are highly reactive towards halides connected to the iron complex.\nWe suggest that next to diagenetically altered iron containing enzymes, minerals such as oxides, hydroxides and sulfides are involved in abiotic halogenation processes.\nWe applied the amino acid methionine as organic model compound and soluble iron species as reactants. All samples were incubated in aqueous phases containing various NaCl concentrations. As a result various halogenated ethanes and ethenes were identified as reaction products.\n",

In combination with measurements of radiocarbon, neodymium isotopes and clumped isotopes, this archive has recently been exploited to reconstruct changes in ventilation, water mass sourcing and temperature in relation to millennial climate change.\nLead (Pb) isotopes in both corals and seawater have also been used to track anthropogenic inputs through space and time and to trace transport pathways within the oceans. Better understanding of the oceanic Pb cycle is emerging from the GEOTRACES programme. However, while Pb isotopes have been widely used in environmental studies, their full potential as a (pre-anthropogenic) paleoceanographic tracer remains to be exploited. In deep-sea corals, challenges exist from low Pb concentrations in aragonite in comparison to secondary coatings, the potential for contamination, and the efficient elemental separation required for measurement by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS).\nHere we discuss progress in measuring Pb isotopes in coral aragonite using a 207Pb-204Pb double spike on a ThermoFinnigan Triton TIMS. For a 2 ng NIST-981 Pb standard, the long term reproducibility (using 1011 Ω resistors) is ~1000 ppm (2 s.d.) on 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios. We now show that using a new 1012 Ω resistor to measure the small 204Pb beam improves the internal precision on these ratios from ~500 ppm (2 s.e.) to ~250 ppm (2 s.e.) and we envisage a potential improvement in the long term reproducibility as a consequence. We further assess the internal precision and external reproducibility of our method using a BCR-2 rock standard and an in-house coral standard. Preliminary evidence on the application of this method to natural samples is derived from cleaning experiments and replication tests on deep-sea corals from the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Monogenetic volcanoes form a large proportion of the world's volcanoes. They are in all tectonic environments and thus provide a significant link to understand fundamental geological processes such as plate tectonics. The Chaîne des Puys - Limagne fault World Heritage nomination is a prime example of this link where monogenetic volcanism, continental rifting, uplift and erosion are highlighted, and are made understandable to the lay person, though the actions on over 80 aligned monogenetic volcanoes. Such geoheritage is essential for monogenetic and other geological risks to be communicated to the wider public. The current scientific interest on monogenetic volcanoes is quite recent, and because of this, and probably their global distribution but small size, they have not received their due importance from a geoheritage standpoint. Some individual sites and some fields are protected and developed as attractions, but there has been no coherent global strategy for defining monogenetic heritage, or for linking sites. This is starting through the monogenetic commission of IAVCEI, and with wider participation of the IUGS and other bodies. The Chaîne des Puys – Limagne Fault UNESCO project is an example of how public awareness, at a global scale, and be increased through geoheritage. This is done integrating local stakeholders: population, industry, science, landscapers, artists, sports, government. This builds on existing protection and sustainable activities, integrating them with education programs. The result is to create a populace that 'thinks geological', and which leads visitors to also become geologically aware. This is helped by a monogenetic landscape that is easily readable and by links made to other geological sites around the world. We will explain how this process is ongoing. The project started over 35 years ago, and is a long-term vision to develop geological understanding and protection of this unique monogenetic and tectono-volcanic site.",

            "abstract": "Shallow magmatic intrusions make room for themselves by upward bending of the elastic overburden. Previous studies have shown that the dynamics of such intrusions is first controlled by the bending of the overlying layer and transitions to a gravity current regime when the radius reaches a few times the flexural wavelength of the overburden. Laccoliths have been shown to stop their spreading in the elastic regime; however, their radius are too small to be fracture-controlled. Hence their size and morphology are probably related to their cooling.\nHere, we study the thermal evolution of a shallow magmatic intrusion and account for a temperature-dependent viscosity. We model the conductive cooling of an intrusion below an overlying elastic layer through two thermal boundary layers at the contact between the magma and the encasing rocks. The magma viscosity is inversely related to temperature and is bounded between two extreme values, a \"hot\" and a \"cold\" viscosity.\nOur model shows that the hot core of the intrusion grows slower than the intrusion itself and becomes concentrated within a 'thermal radius' where heat advection compensates for diffusion within the country rocks. As predicted by our analytical scaling law, the thermal radius essentially depends upon the Peclet number as well as on the ratio between the cold and hot viscosities.\nThe effective viscosity of the flow increases with time and is much higher than the average flow viscosity. This effective viscosity depends on the temperature of the intrusion front. Indeed, with time, the intrusion radius leaves behind the thermal anomaly, the temperature of the front decreases and the effective viscosity increases. This acts to enhance the thickening over the spreading of the intrusion and would stop laccolith in the bending regime.",

            "abstract": "The Chaîne des Puys volcanic field in central France, became a celebrated mecca for 18/19th Century Scientists, only once the volcanoes were 'discovered'. Beforehand they were only hills, but the ability to interpret landscape with prior knowledge allowed these early geologists to create a popular understanding of the geology. Since that time, the Chaîne des Puys has become a well-known volcanic site to a worldwide audience through textbooks, tourism, and commerce (Look at a Volvic water bottle!). To the 19th century geologists, the Limagne escarpment was just as fascinating, but lacking the ability to fully interpret this rift margin, the idea of a fault did not percolate down to the general public. With the advent of the current UNESCO project, it became clear that the geological link between the volcanoes and the fault could be exploited, not only to raise the profile of the volcanoes, but to create a greater awareness of the tectonics in the greater public. Not only have the volcanoes, become better known and more clearly understood than previously, but the fault has begun to emerge as a feature in public consciousness. We will demonstrate the many communication techniques at all levels that have been used in the project. We explain the rationale between creating a geological scale model that works on processes as well as landforms to raise the public awareness. The success is that we show how geological features can be made readable by the general public, something highly important for conservation of heritage, but also for risk perception. The increased education efforts of the scientists have also lead to an increase in science. The Chaîne des Puys and Limagne fault project was discussed at the 38th session of the World Heritage UNESCO committee in June 2014 and was acknowledged to have Universal Exceptional Value: the future challenge for this project is to consolidate the outreach, and to work with other sites to increase the public perception of earth sciences. The more informed and participatory the public is the more efficient the communication can be.",

            "abstract": "Drought and heat waves have been linked to forest mortality event across the globe. The underlying physiological processes are still not elucidated but both tree carbon and water relations have been identified as the driving forces. While studies on tree hydraulics are straightforward, studies on the tree carbon balance are not. For example, the use of different carbon compounds for maintenance respiration during drought cannot be assessed with measurements of carbon pools but requires real-time analyses of respiration stoichiometry. However, so far there were no technical solutions for such applications.\nHere we introduce cavity-enhanced Raman spectrometry (CERS) for simultaneous real-time monitoring of O2 and CO2 and rapid and continuous quantification of dark respiration rates and the respiratory quotient (RQ), i.e. the ratio of CO2 produced over O2 consumed during respiration. This ratio indicates the proportions of different substrates (carbohydrates [COH], lipids, proteins) used during respiration and allows fundamental insights into tree physiology. CERS combines high temporal resolution with a high dynamic concentration range for all important gases, ranging from few ppm to 100 vol. % with a single measurement every few seconds. The respiration analysis of tree branches was performed in a closed chamber for two species of different drought tolerance, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies. We applied not only drought but also a shading treatment because both cause reductions in carbon assimilation rates but have different effects on tree hydraulics.\nDeclines in RQ during shading in both species indicate a switch from pure COH metabolism to a mixture of COH, lipids and proteins. During drought such declines occurred only in the drought-tolerant pine but not in spruce and the underlying more dynamic carbon use strategy in pine may provide a physiological basis for its drought tolerance, more detailed investigation still pending.\nOur study highlights the suitability of CERS for applications in plant ecophysiology. This technology can contribute to significant advances in research on the causes and mechanisms of tree and forest mortality.",

When H2O2 was added to the samples much higher concentrations of VOC and VOX were observed.\nFurthermore, when the pH of the soils was changed towards lower values higher emissions of VOC were also observed.\nBased on C-H activation processes we delineate a halide containing iron complex as a provider of anions reacting with previously generated hydrocarbon radicals.\nWe suggest iron sulfate derivatives as those complexes which are generated if the above-mentioned natural H2O2 addition to iron sulfates and sulfides occurs. The origin of these complexes is able to explain the halogenation of chemically unreactive alkanes.",

(2014) recently reported a correlation between an index of lower-tropospheric mixing and equilibrium climate sensitivity in 43 climate models, and presented a physical argument as to why the presence of this type of mixing would cause low cloud amount to have a negative temperature-dependence. Here we explore this mixing, and the vertical spread of convective heights generally, from a variety of angles. First, we present evidence from temperature trends that deep convection in the tropics reaches a broader spread of heights with more dispersion than in climate models, and evidence from satellites that cloud populations in the narrow Pacific and Atlantic ITCZ regions are significantly less deep than those over the warmer Indo-Pacific warm pool oceans. On the other hand lower-tropospheric mixing within midlatitude cyclones may be reasonably well simulated, based on examination of a single GCM. We further present simulations using the WRF regional model of overturning in the Pacific region, showing a dipolar depth structure with both deep and shallow overturning. These simulations show that low-cloud amount is strongly reduced by the invigoration of convective motions on small scales. Finally we present an argument based on dynamical studies of individual convective thermals that may account for why convective dispersion is typically underestimated in convective parameterisations.",

The resolution tests show that the dataset is sufficient to resolve the basic features of the slip distribution and rupture velocity. The near-source seismic data is sensitive to the shape and direction of the slip, while GPS is sensitive to location. Our joint model shows that the slip is primarily updip toward west and downdip toward east with 5 meters of peak slip updip from the hypocenter at 18.7 km. Rupture velocity is close to 1.5 km/s.

The boreal consists of mosaic of forest/wetland landscape elements and stores about 500 Gt\n3\ncarbon (C) with a delicate sink-source C balance. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the main form of C exported from boreal landscapes and is fundamental to global C cycling. This northern ecosystem is vulnerable to global climate change, and increasing demands for forest products threaten its surface water resources. So far, there have been no attempts to assess the combined impacts of climate change and forest management on the future DOC fluxes from boreal surface waters. While differences in model assumptions may have negligible effects on present day simulations, these differences could be amplified when projecting the future climate and land use change conditions. Here we use an ensemble of regional climate models and multi-scale models of biogeochemical processes to gain insights into uncertainties associated with climate change and forest management on C and runoff dynamics in boreal landscape. While there are significant uncertainties associated with model projections, our results show that climate change will be the main driver of long term DOC dynamics in meso- to large boreal catchments in the future. However, forestry intensifies hydrological processes and can lead to large DOC fluxes at the headwater scales.",

The NEWS program builds upon existing NASA-supported basic research in atmospheric physics and dynamics, radiation, climate modeling, and terrestrial hydrology. While these NASA programs fund research activities that address individual aspects of the global energy and water cycles, they are not specifically designed to generate a coordinated result. NEWS developed the first coordinated attempt to describe the complete global energy and water cycle using existing and forthcoming satellite and ground based observations, and laying the foundation for essential NEWS developments in model representations of atmospheric energy and water exchange processes. This comprehensive energy and water data analysis program exploited crucial datasets, some requiring complete re-processing, and new satellite measurements.\nNAWP: Dramatically changing climates has had an indelible impact on North America’s water crisis. To decisively address these challenges, we recommend that NAWP coalesce an interdisciplinary, international and interagency effort to make significant contributions to continental- to decision-scale hydroclimate science and solutions. By entraining, integrating and coordinating the vast array of interdisciplinary observational and prediction resources available, NAWP will significantly advance skill in predicting, assessing and managing variability and changes in North American water resources. We adopt three challenges to organize NAWP efforts. The first deals with developing a scientific basis and tools for mitigating and adapting to changes in the water supply-demand balance. The second challenge is benchmarking; to use incomplete and uncertain observations to assess water storage and quality dynamics, and to characterize the information content of water cycle predictions in a way that allows for model improvement. The final challenge is to establish clear pathways to inform water managers, practitioners and decision makers about newly developed tools, observations and research results.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the large scale dynamic response of the magnetosphere to solar wind driving is central to our understanding of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. Auroral geomagnetic indices provide a comprehensive dataset of substorm and storm events spanning several solar cycles. We can characterize these observations in terms of 'space climate' by quantifying how the statistical properties of ensembles of these observed variables vary between different phases of the solar cycle.\nWe present novel comparative statistical techniques which characterize secular changes in the distribution of geomagnetic indices. We first threshold these timeseries to generate a sequence of 'bursts' or events and find the statistical distributions of event size. The event size distribution is robustly multicomponent, and we find that for all thresholds above 1000nT the mean event size-above-threshold tends to a constant value. This 'tail' in the distribution of large events is found to be present in all phases of the solar cycle but is more populated (there are more, larger events) at solar maximum. Successive solar maxima and minima also show the same 'tail' in the distribution but again it is populated to different extents; some maxima or minima are stronger than others in terms of space weather impact as seen in auroral indices. By plotting the distribution of event sizes normalised to the first two monents we can compare the functional form of one distribution with another. We then find that these large (>1000nT threshold) events all share the same functional form for their probability distribution; it is independent of threshold. Thus, for a given solar cycle, once a sufficient number of events have been observed to determine the first two moments, the likelihood of an event of given size-above-threshold is determined for that solar cycle. This can parameterize the exceedence likelihood of events of a given size and how this is changing, with implications for space weather applications.",

            "abstract": "The permeability structure of the sub-ridge mantle plays an important role in how melt is focused and extracted at mid-ocean ridges. Permeability is controlled by porosity and the grain size of the solid mantle matrix, which is in turn controlled by the deformation conditions. To date, models of grain size evolution and mantle deformation have not been coupled to determine the influence of spatial variations in grain-size on the permeability structure at mid-ocean ridges. Rather, current models typically assume a constant grain size for the whole domain [1]. Here, we use 2-D numerical models to evaluate the influence of grain-size variability on the permeability structure beneath a mid-ocean ridge and use these results to speculate on the consequences for melt focusing and extraction.\nWe construct a two-dimensional, single phase model for the steady-state grain size beneath a mid-ocean ridge. The model employs a composite rheology of diffusion creep, dislocation creep, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding, and a brittle stress limiter. Grain size is calculated using the \"wattmeter\" model of Austin and Evans [2]. We investigate the sensitivity of the model to global variations in grain growth exponent, potential temperature, spreading-rate, and grain boundary sliding parameters [3,4]. Our model predicts that permeability varies by two orders of magnitude due to the spatial variability of grain size within the expected melt region of a mid-ocean ridge. The predicted permeability structure suggests grain size may promote focusing of melt towards the ridge axis. Furthermore, the calculated grain size structure should focus melt from a greater depth than models that exclude grain-size variability.\nFuture work will involve evaluating this hypothesis by implementing grain-size dynamics within a two-phase mid-ocean ridge model. The developments of such a model will be discussed.\n",

            "abstract": "We develop a model of the ionosphere of Jupiter's moon Callisto, where we assume a stationary balance between sources and sinks of electrons and electron energy. Hence, effects of electron transport and electron energy transport are neglected. At Callisto, the production of electrons and electron energy is basically driven by photoionization, which is implemented using the EUVAC model for solar activity. Dissociative recombination is the main electron loss process, whereas electron energy loss is further driven by dissociation, electron impact ionization as well as vibrational and rotational excitations of neutral atmospheric particles. All these effects are incorporated within our model by considering the associated cross sections. The neutral atmosphere is assumed to be stationary and consists of molecular oxygen with a column density of 3 to 4 x 1020 m-2 (e.g. Kliore et al. (2002), Liang et al. (2005)). Our results can be compared to radio occultation observations of four Galileo spacecraft flybys reported by Kliore et al. (2002), which shows that this simple model can explain the general pattern of the observational data. Indeed, our results indicate that the detection of enhanced electron densities is very sensitive to the exact position of the tangential point of the radio occultation method. Our model shows that photoionization produces a strong asymmetry of the electron density distribution between day and night-side of the moon. Further, model results for the electron energy allow for an estimation of the day glow of Callisto's atmosphere. This can be compared to HST observations (Strobel et al. (2002)) in order to evaluate the density of the neutral oxygen atmosphere. Future studies imply the modeling of the modification of the ionospheric structure through interaction with upstreaming jovian magnetospheric plasma.",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of the discharge of river during extreme flood is of prime importance for the scientific and the research community. Unfortunately, measuring discharge using conventional methods is impossible because the high velocities and the floating debris endanger the operators and the equipment. The typical time-scale for gauging does not match up to the time scale of the dynamic of extreme flood. Finally, floods are mesoscale events that affect generally several watersheds at the same time, and gauging teams do not have the capabilities for covering the whole region of interest.\nRecently, non intrusive method for measuring discharge have been developed and tested in flood conditions. Doppler surface velocity radar and Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) showed their efficiency for measuring discharge during extreme events, but those methods need to be deployed by operators and the problems of time-scale and space-scale covering aforementioned are not solved.\nIn this study, authors present how flood discharge measurement can benefits from the huge development, the last 10 years, of internet and of the on-line sharing of files. Floods are impressive phenomena, and hundreds of witnesses movies can be found on the internet after every important event. The different steps in order to apply LSPIV analysis to witness movie are detailed: (i) selection of the video of interest; (ii) contact with the author of the video; (iii) preparing the video for the LSPIV analysis : stabilization of the images, field campaigns; (iv) LSPIV analysis, providing surface velocity field; and (v)discharge computation.\nA case study on the major flash flood of 18 June 2013 of the Gave River at Cauterets, French Pyrennees, is presented. Results show that witnesses movies can bring useful information and allow estimating discharges values. Capabilities and limitations of LSPIV applied to witnesses movies are detailed. Finally, the paper presents an approach conducted within the framework of the FloodScale project in order to involve population in the recording of LSPIV compatible video during flood. A video recording protocol was given to town councils of villages located close to the Ardèche River, France, itemizing different conditions required to get quantitative information from movies.",

            "abstract": "Root-zone soil moisture information is a valuable diagnostic for detecting the onset and severity of agricultural drought. Current attempts to globally monitor root-zone soil moisture are generally based on the application of soil water balance models driven by observed meteorological variables. Such systems, however, are prone to random error associated with: incorrect process model physics, poor parameter choices and noisy meteorological inputs. The presentation will describe attempts to remediate these sources of error via the assimilation of remotely-sensed surface soil moisture retrievals from satellite-based passive microwave sensors into a global soil water balance model. Results demonstrate the ability of satellite-based soil moisture retrieval products to significantly improve the global characterization of root-zone soil moisture – particularly in data-poor regions lacking adequate ground-based rain gage instrumentation. This success has lead to an on-going effort to implement an operational land data assimilation system at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA FAS) to globally monitor variations in root-zone soil moisture availability via the integration of satellite-based precipitation and soil moisture information. Prospects for improving the performance of the USDA FAS system via the simultaneous assimilation of both passive and active-based soil moisture retrievals derived from the upcoming NASA Soil Moisture Active/Passive mission will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The legacy to-date of the nuclear disaster at Fukushima Dai-ichi, Japan, has emphasised the fundamental importance of high quality radiation measurements in soils and plant systems. Current-generation radiometers based on coded-aperture collimation are limited in their ability to locate sources of radiation in three dimensions, and require a relatively long measurement time due to the poor efficiency of the collimation system. The quality of data they can provide to support biogeochemical process models in such systems is therefore often compromised.\nIn this work we report proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the potential of an alternative approach in the measurement of environmentally-important radionuclides (in particular 137Cs) in quartz sand and soils from the Fukushima exclusion zone. Compton-geometry imaging radiometers harness the scattering of incident radiation between two detectors to yield significant improvements in detection efficiency, energy resolution and spatial location of radioactive sources in a 180° field of view. To our knowledge we are reporting its first application to environmentally-relevant systems at low activity, dispersed sources, with significant background radiation and, crucially, movement over time.\nWe are using a simple laboratory column setup to conduct one-dimensional transport experiments for 139Ce and 137Cs in quartz sand and in homogenized repacked Fukushima soils. Polypropylene columns 15 cm length with internal diameter 1.6 cm were filled with sand or soil and saturated slowly with tracer-free aqueous solutions. Radionuclides were introduced as 2mL pulses (step-up step-down) at the column inlet. Data were collected continuously throughout the transport experiment and then binned into sequential time intervals to resolve the total activity in the column and its progressive movement through the sand/soil.\nThe objective of this proof-of-concept work is to establish detection limits, optimise image reconstruction algorithms, and develop a novel approach to time-lapse quantification of radionuclide dynamics in the soil-plant system. The aim is to underpin the development of a new generation of Compton radiometers equipped to provide high resolution, dynamic measurements of radionuclides in terrestrial biogeochemical environments.",

In this paper, two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed to investigate the characteristics of these electron holes in anti-parallel magnetic reconnection. The electron holes with the bipolar structures of the parallel electric field are formed in the border between the electron inflow channel (where electrons move toward the X line) and outflow channel (where electrons flow away from the X line), where the electrons satisfy the bump-on-tail distribution. Quasi-monochromatic electrostatic waves are firstly excited by the electron bump-on-tail instability, which propagate with a speed near the bulk velocity of the fast electron beam. These waves then coalesce with each other, and at last electron holes (EHs) propagating away from the X line along the magnetic field lines are formed in the separatrix region.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that subduction zone magmatism involves hydraulic fractures propagating from the oceanic crust to the mantle wedge source region (Davies, 1999). We aim to test this hypothesis by developing a numerical model of the process, and then comparing model outputs with observations. The hypothesis proposes that the water interconnects in the slab following an earthquake. If sufficient pressure develops a hydrofracture occurs. The hydrofracture will expand in the direction of the least compressive stress and propagate in the direction of the most compressive stress, which is out into the wedge. Therefore we can calculate the hydrofracture path and end-point, given the start location on the slab and the propagation distance. We can therefore predict where water is added to the mantle wedge.\nTo take this further we have developed a thermal model of a subduction zone. The model uses a finite difference, marker-in-cell method to solve the heat equation (Gerya, 2010). The velocity field was prescribed using the analytical expression of cornerflow (Batchelor, 1967). The markers contained within the fixed grid are used to track the different compositions and their properties. The subduction zone thermal model was benchmarked (Van Keken, 2008). We used the hydrous melting parameterization of Katz et.al., (2003) to calculate the degree of melting caused by the addition of water to the wedge. We investigate models where the hydrofractures, with properties constrained by estimated water fluxes, have random end points. The model predicts degree of melting, magma productivity, temperature of the melt and water content in the melt for different initial water fluxes. Future models will also include the buoyancy effect of the melt and residue.\nBatchelor, Cambridge UP, 1967.\nDavies, Nature, 398: 142-145, 1999.\nGerya, Cambridge UP, 2010.\nKatz, Geochem. Geophys.

            "abstract": "One of the most disruptive energy system technological developments of the past few decades is the rapid expansion of shale gas production in the United States. Because the changes have been so rapid there are great uncertainties as to the impacts of shale production for medium- and long-term energy and climate change mitigation policies. A necessary starting point for incorporating shale resources into modeling efforts is to understand the size of the resource, how much is technically recoverable (TRR), and finally, how much is economically recoverable (ERR) at a given cost.\nTo assess production costs of shale gas, we combine top-down data with detailed bottom-up information. Studies solely based on top-down approaches do not adequately account for the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits and are unlikely to appropriately estimate extraction costs. We design an expedient bottom-up method based on publicly available US data to compute the levelized costs of shale gas extraction. Our results indicate the existence of economically attractive areas but also reveal a dramatic cost increase as lower-quality reservoirs are exploited.\nExtrapolating results for the US to the global level, our best estimate suggests that, at a cost of 6 US$/GJ, only 39% of the technically recoverable resources reported in top-down studies should be considered economically recoverable. This estimate increases to about 77% when considering optimistic TRR and estimated ultimate recovery parameters but could be lower than 12% for more pessimistic parameters. The current lack of information on the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits as well as on the development of future production technologies leads to significant uncertainties regarding recovery rates and production costs. Much of this uncertainty may be inherent, but for energy system planning purposes, with or without climate change mitigation policies, it is crucial to recognize the full ranges of recoverable quantities and costs.",

These are “exotic” states of matter like the Warm Dense Matter (WDM) [1] where most of the approximations used in condensed matter physics or in plasma physics break down.\nWe report here the first laser shocked Fe K-edge XAFS data measured on a synchrotron beamline using a single X-ray pulse. Generally such experiments are carried out on a much bigger scale using high power kJ lasers where two orders of magnitude more energy is needed [2].\nLinking a portable 40J laser to one of the ESRF’s recently upgraded beamline ID24, solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions of iron under extreme pressure and temperature could be observed using single shot XANES and EXAFS. The extremely small x-ray beam available at ID24 (5x5 µm) allows focusing the laser so that the power on the sample can reach the 1013 W/cm2 range. The evolution of the thermodynamical conditions during the shock could be probed by varying the laser – X-ray delay. The shock lifetime in the iron target was confined for a few ns using a pair of diamonds windows, providing a time window sufficiently large for the 100 ps synchrotron pulse to probe thermodynamically stable states reaching 370 GPa and 10000 K, as estimated by hydrodynamic simulations.\nThe quality of the data collected on shocked Fe using a single X-ray pulse is similar to that obtainable at ambient conditions. This first experiment demonstrates the feasibility of these studies at a synchrotron beamline, and opens many exciting opportunities for probing the local and electronic structure in very dense states of matter. Dynamic compression experiments thus will in the future become more accessible and profit from the extremely stable X-ray diagnostics of synchrotron beamlines.\n1. e.g. V. E. Fortov and Igor T.

            "abstract": "Ferrofluid is a stable dispersion of paramagnetic nanosize particles in a liquid carrier which are magnetized in the presence of magnetic field. Functionalized coating and small size of nanoparticles allows them to flow through porous media without significantly compromising permeability and with little retention. We numerically and experimentally investigate the potential of ferrofluid in mobilizing trapped non-wetting phase. Numerical method is based on a coupled level set model for two-phase flow and an immersed interface method for finding magnetic field strength, and provides the equilibrium configuration of an oleic (non-wetting) phase inside some pore geometry in the presence of dispersed excitable nanoparticles in surrounding water phase. The magnetic pressures near fluid-fluid interface depend locally on the magnetic field intensity and direction, which in turn depend on the fluid configuration. Interfaces represent magnetic permeability discontinuities and hence cause disturbances in the spatial distribution of the magnetic field. Experiments are conducted in micromodels with high pore-to-throat aspect size ratio. Both numerical and experimental results show that stresses produced by the magnetization of ferrofluids can help overcome strong capillary pressures and displace trapped ganglia in the presence of additional mobilizing force such as increased fluid flux or surfactant injection.",

            "abstract": "For many years, experiments are being developed for performing deformation experiments under lower mantle conditions. They include methods such as the Deformation-DIA (Wang et al, 2003) or radial x-ray diffraction in the diamond anvil cell (Merkel et al, 2002). However, the strain applied to the sample is typically limited to about 40%. This can be an issue for studying effects of large deformation or, for the case of diamond anvil cells, applying actual plastic strain at megabar pressures. The issue can be solved using apparatus such as the Rotational-Drickamer (RDA) (e.g. Yamazaki and Karato, 2001). However, the RDA offers limited diffraction access to the sample and operating pressures do not reach those of the lower mantle.\nIn this abstract, we investigate the potential applications of the rotational diamond anvil cell (Rot-DAC) for such studies. 300 K experiments in the Rot-DAC have been performed up to pressures exceeding 50 GPa (e.g. Serebryanaya et al, 1995) with studies focusing on the effect of shear on solid-solid phase transformation pressures. The authors did not investigate the possibility of using the Rot-DAC for studying rheological properties.\nHere, a sample of polycrystalline Fe is submitted to shear deformation in the Rot-DAC at pressures up to 20 GPa. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements are then used to study the texture and stress state at multiple locations in the sample. The study shows that the Rot-DAC is efficient at producing deformation textures in a polycrystalline aggregate but that care should be taken in ensuring that the sample is actually undergoing plastic deformation and not solid rotation. Stresses, on the other hand, are difficult to extract from the x-ray diffraction data because of lack of understanding of stress distributions in the deforming aggregate.\nS. Merkel, H. R. Wenk, J.

            "abstract": "The important role of floodplains in providing temporary storage for a large fraction of the annual sediment load of rivers is well established, but this understanding is largely based on observations of the long-term average behavior of the catchment. Here we combine measurements of the fallout radionuclides Be-7 and Pb-210 and the stable isotopes of water to quantify fine sediment mobilization and storage in a stream and its floodplain during individual intermediate-sized storm events. We demonstrate this method using five intermediate-sized storm events in a small (~15 square km), undeveloped, gravel-bedded tributary of the Connecticut River (USA). We find that in each storm, the mass of sediment deposited onto the margins accounts for almost 90% of the sediment mobilized from the bed, with the remainder of the mobilized bed sediment carried downstream as suspended load. The result that the bed is a net source of sediment to the stream and the margins a net sink is robust, but estimates of the mass of material eroded from the bed and deposited on the margins are less certain. The source of sediment to the bed remains unclear as, consistent with earlier studies, we observe only limited deposition of sediment to the bed during the storm events. The suspended sediment is organic rich and thus its source may be associated with organic decay between storm events. The understanding of the coupled interactions between discharge magnitude and frequency and sediment resupply at the event time scale has important implications for the successful restoration design of discharges that connect channel and floodplain, and for the development of accurate sediment budgets and predictions of sediment flux from a watershed.",

            "abstract": "Addition of easily available C substrates to soil can increase or decrease decomposition rates of native soil organic matter, releasing more or less CO­2 − a phenomenon known as the priming effect. However, the relationship between the amount of substrate addition and direction of priming remains unclear. In order to disentangle this relationship, an experiment was designed to analyze the effect of amounts of substrate additions on soil priming. We added substrates at concentrations corresponding to 3% to 410% of microbial biomass C pool in soils from five distinctive ecosystems along an elevation gradient. We found that 1) Each ecosystem had a different trigger value of substrate addition controlling the direction of priming. 2) Across ecosystems, however, a threshold value of substrate addition at 50% of microbial biomass C (150 μg C g-1 week-1) governed the direction of priming (negative or positive). 3) Priming was negative at low substrate addition rates, and increased linearly with the rate of substrate addition and became positive when the rate was greater than 50% of the microbial biomass carbon pool, and increasing thereafter. 4) The absolute amount of added substrate-C was a better predictor for priming compared to the amount added as a percentage of the microbial biomass carbon pool (r2 = 0.72 vs. r2 = 0.52). Our results demonstrate that the relationship between substrate addition and priming of soil organic matter was positive and linear. This relationship supports for exploring mechanisms of microbial communities shifts between r and K strategies, and stresses the significance of incorporating priming and amounts of substrate inputs as parameters to build more accurate ecosystem C models.",

            "abstract": "Geological storage of CO2 is still a recent technology and many questions remain open, particularly for saline formations. Geological storage in accessible saline formations is, in fact, expected to become over time more important than that in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.\nThe Maguelone shallow experimental site, located near Montpellier (Languedoc, France) has been used over the past few years to perform CO2 injection experiments. The geology, petrophysics and hydrology of this site are well known from previous studies. The presence of small saline coastal reservoirs bounded above and below by clay-rich layers provides an opportunity to study a saline formation for geological storage at field laboratory scale with a set of hydrogeophysical (seismic, electrical, sonic, pressure) and geochemical (pH, minor and major ion concentrations) methods, either downhole or at surface. Series of experiments can be run at moderate costs from the shallow depth of one of these reservoirs (13-16 m), offering flexibility for testing different monitoring configurations, performing repeated injection releases with variable injection parameters and type of gas (e.g., N2, CO2), and cross-calibrating the monitoring methods. Moreover, additional methods/boreholes can be easily implemented at this experimental site.\nThree N2 injections were thus undertaken at Maguelone in 2012 to measure the site response to neutral gas injection. An experiment involving the release of CO2 was successively conducted in January 2013. A volume of 111 m3 of CO2 was injected during 3.5 hours. Both the N2 and CO2 gas plumes were detected by all monitoring techniques, and the response to gas propagation was instantaneous. Integrating the lesson learned from past injection experiments, the next stage of the project will allow to establish the best guidelines for CO2 injection and post-injection monitoring and, in perspective, not only to detect the CO2 plume but to quantify CO2 migration in the subsurface.",

The CSIRO Mk3L general circulation model is employed in simulations with observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and historical time-evolving carbon dioxide concentrations to investigate the interdecadal changes found observationally in the jet streams, temperature, Hadley circulation, mean sea level pressure and precipitation. The model simulations are compared with the corresponding observations (NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis V2) for the austral winter between the periods 1949-68 and 1975-94. The results show that model is quite skilful in reproducing the broad features of the important interdecadal changes that occurred in the mid-1970s. The model simulations and the NCEP/NCAR and 20th Century reanalyses agree in the eastern hemisphere; whereas in the western hemisphere the reanalyses show differences, and the simulations combine aspects of these two dataset. The role of the time-varying external radiative forcing is clearly demonstrated, especially for the mean sea level pressure and precipitation fields.",

            "abstract": "Accurate hydrodynamic forecasting of tides and storm surges on a regional scale near coasts is receiving increased attention in the 21st century. For this purpose, regional models are typically used where open-boundary conditions are prescribed. However, if a tide or storm-surge model covers a much larger area than the local coastal region, some additional physical processes become relevant. This is most clear on a global scale, where there are no open boundary conditions to force the model anymore; instead the tides are forced by the gravitational potential within the model.\nWe present a new global 2D hydrodynamic model to simulate tide and storm surges. The main goal of this model is to zoom in from global to regional scale and to study the impact of various assumptions in regional models. To enable this, the model uses an unstructured grid shallow-water solver capable of representing coastal areas in more detail than the open oceans. This is of importance as much of the tidal energy is dissipated on the shelf, even on a global scale.\nThe solver used here is D-Flow FM, capable of computing 2D and 3D shallow-water flow on unstructured meshes and developed for applications in e.g. regional seas, coastal areas and estuaries. Here we apply D-Flow FM on a global scale for the first time.\nThe global tide model was calibrated using the OpenDA toolbox for automated parameter estimation and FES2012 tidal solution. Depth, bed friction and linear friction parameterizing dissipation by internal tides were optimized to improve overall tidal characteristics. Calibration was performed using a coarser version of the global model to reduce computational time, which is then input for a limited number of calibration runs with the original model.\nFor the purpose of developing an operational version of the model for storm-surge forecasting, we investigate the performance of the parallel version of D-Flow FM for this global model on supercomputers. Here we show some initial results.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of the mechanism which triggers unrests at active calderas is one of the most problematic issues of modern volcanology. In particular, magmatic intrusion vs. hydrothermal dynamics is one of the central questions to understand the signals of several restless calderas of the Earth, including, for example, Yellowstone, Long Valley, and Campi Flegrei. Here we focus on Campi Flegrei caldera, sited in the densely inhabited metropolitan area of Napoli, where an inflation stage showing an accelerating trend started in 2005 and reached a maximum vertical displacement of about 24 cm in July 2014.\nFumarolic compositions compared with ground deformation data suggests that this ten year’s accelerating uplift is mainly caused by the overlapping of two processes: (i) short time pulses caused by injection of magmatic fluids into the hydrothermal system, and (ii) a long time process of heating of the rocks.\nThe short pulses are highlighted by comparing the residuals of ground deformation, fitted with an accelerating curve, with the fumarolic CO2/CH4 and He/CH4 ratios which are good indicators of the arrival of magmatic gases into the hydrothermal system. These two independent datasets show an impressive temporal correlation, with the same sequence of five peaks with a delay of ~ 200 days of the geochemical signal with respect to the geodetic one. The heating of the hydrothermal system is inferred by an evident increase in the fumarolic activity and by temperature-pressure gas-geoindicators. The accelerating ground deformation is paralleled in fact by an increase in the fumarolic CO/CO2 ratio and by a general decrease of the CH4/CO2ratio, both being sign of increased equilibration temperatures. Comparing the observed fumarolic compositions with the thermodynamically derived equilibrium values we infer that the heating is caused by the condensation of increasing amounts of steam.\nAccording to a recent interpretation of fumarolic inert gas species, which relates their relative variation to open system magma degassing, we infer that the heating process reflects both an enrichment in the water content of the magmatic fluids and an increment in their flux. Heating of the rocks caused by magmatic fluids can be a central factor in triggering unrest at calderas.\nThis work has been done in the frame of the EC project MED_SUV.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere and ocean are coupled by the exchange of fluxes across the ocean surface. Air–sea fluxes vary partly on scales that are too small and fast to be resolved explicitly in numerical models of weather and climate, making them a candidate for stochastic parameterization. This presentation proposes a nonlinear physical mechanism by which stochastic fluctuations in the air–sea buoyancy flux may modify the mean climate, even though the mean fluctuation is zero. The mechanism relies on a fundamental asymmetry in the physics of the ocean mixed layer: positive surface buoyancy fluctuations cannot undo the vertical mixing caused by negative fluctuations. The mechanism has much in common with Stommel’s mixed-layer demon. The presentation demonstrates the mechanism in climate simulations with a comprehensive coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (SINTEX-G).\nIn the SINTEX-G simulations with stochastic air–sea buoyancy fluxes, significant changes are detected in the time-mean oceanic mixed-layer depth, sea-surface temperature, atmospheric Hadley circulation, and net upward water flux at the sea surface. Also, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability is significantly increased. The findings demonstrate that noise-induced drift and noise-enhanced variability, which are familiar concepts from simple climate models, continue to apply in comprehensive climate models with millions of degrees of freedom. The findings also suggest that the lack of representation of sub-grid variability in air–sea fluxes may contribute to some of the biases exhibited by contemporary climate models.",

            "abstract": "During geomagnetic storms a large volume of ions are transported from the magnetotail deep into the inner magnetosphere leading to ion acceleration to the energies of tens to hundreds keV. Energized ions become the dominant source of plasma pressure in the inner magnetosphere. Hot plasma pressure drives large electrical currents which determine global electrodynamics and coupling of the inner magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Recent analysis of ion measurements from the RBSPICE experiment of the Van Allen Probes mission showed that the buildup of plasma pressure in the inner magnetosphere largely occurs in the form of localized discrete injections similar to dipolarization fronts observed in the magnetotail. According to previous studies, in the magnetotail ions can be rapidly energized to ~100 keV in the process of nonlinear trapping enabled by magnetic field reconnection and/or an electrostatic field ahead of dipolarization fronts. It is not clear whether similar processes can operate in the inner magnetosphere where the ambient magnetic field is much higher and the propagation speeds of injection fronts are much lower. The goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of ion energization at injection fronts in the inner magnetosphere with the use three-dimensional test-particle simulations and the comparison with ion measurements at RBSPICE. For this purpose we construct an analytical model of the electric and magnetic field perturbations associated with the injection fronts which are superimposed onto the ambient magnetic field. The model reproduces characteristic properties of injection fronts derived from spacecraft measurements and particle-in-cell kinetic simulations.",

            "abstract": "Complex feedbacks between katabatic winds and the cryosphere may lead to the development of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, spectroscopic data and radar soundings, acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. They have similarities with Antarctic megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Based on this analogy, we are currently developing a model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of ice sheets. In Antarctica the accumulation processes on megadunes fields is generally attributed to the wind-blown snow transport while on sedimentation waves of the North Polar Cap of Mars the accumulation seems to be dominated by sublimation/condensation processes at the surface. The model is designed to explore the implication of the water vapor mass transfer and heat transfer on the development of sedimentation waves both on Mars and Earth.",

            "abstract": "Studying the melting properties of the mantle is fundamental to understand the global dynamics of our planet. Already in the early stages of its history, Earth experienced extensive melting events leading to the formation of a magma ocean, due to the massive energy released by large-scale meteoritic impacts, radiogenic decay and core-mantle gravitational segregation. Partial melting however still plays a key role in today’s mantle’s dynamics. Seismic observations have in fact highlighted the presence of anomalies in the upper mantle, atop the 410 km discontinuity. These regions, called ultra-low velocity zones, show a significant reduction in shear wave velocity, compatible with the presence of partial melting. We studied the melting properties of the mantle using in situ X-ray diffraction experiments and electrical conductivity measurements at high pressure and high temperature. Both technics are very sensitive to the presence of liquid in the sample. They provide accurate information not only on the evolution with pressure of the solidus temperature, but also on the degree of partial melting with increasing temperature. Our samples consisted of a synthetic CI chondrite glass, a “proxy” composition for the primitive mantle after core segregation. Pressures up to 25 GPa (upper/lower mantle limit, at 670 km depth) were generated by the multi-anvil press. Our results suggest that previous studies overestimated by ~300 K the solidus temperature, probably due to a lack of resolution in determining low degrees of partial melting in their experimental procedure, compared to the in situexperiments presented here. Our results imply that partial melting could happen more frequently than initially expected, particularly in mantle regions where incompatible elements and volatiles are concentrated.",

            "abstract": "The accurate retrieval of plant water use, health and function together with soil state and condition, represent key objectives in the management and monitoring of large-scale agricultural production. In regions of water shortage or stress, understanding the sustainable use of available water supplies is critical. Unfortunately, this need is all too often limited by a lack of reliable observations. Techniques that balance the demand for reliable ground-based data with the rapid retrieval of spatially distributed crop characteristics represent a needed line of research. Data from in-situ monitoring coupled with advances in satellite retrievals of key land surface variables, provide the information necessary to characterize many crop health and water use features, including evaporation, leaf-chlorophyll and other common vegetation indices. With developments in UAV and quadcopter solutions, the opportunity to bridge the spatio-temporal gap between satellite and ground based sensing now exists, along with the capacity for customized retrievals of crop information. While there remain challenges in the routine application of autonomous airborne systems, the state of current technology and sensor developments provide the capacity to explore the operational potential. While this presentation will focus on the multi-scale estimation of crop-water use and crop-health characteristics from satellite-based sensors, the retrieval of high resolution spatially distributed information from near-surface airborne and ground-based systems will also be examined.",

These soil microbial communities are highly dependent on filamentous cyanobacteria such as Microcoleus vaginatusto stabilize the soil and to act as primary producers for the community through the release carbon sources to feed a diversity of heterotrophs.\nExometabolomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry on biological soil crust pore water and spent media of key soil bacterial isolates. Comparison of spent vs. fresh media was used to determine uptake or release of metabolites by specific microbes. To link pore water experiments with isolate studies, metabolite extracts of authentic soil were used as supplements for isolate exometabolomic profiling. Our soil metabolomics methods detected hundreds of metabolites from soils including may novel compounds. Only a small set of which being targeted by all isolates. Beyond these few metabolites, the individual bacteria examined showed specialization towards specific metabolites. Surprisingly, many of the most abundant oligosaccharides and other metabolites were ignored by these isolates.

            "abstract": "Shallow geothermal energy resources are of interest worldwide for the development of strategies against climate change. The current regulative framework for the sustainable implementation of the technologies exploiting this resources is facing several barriers. In the case of groundwater heat pumps, the thermal interference between exploitations may be endangering their feasibility in urban environments. Uncertainty in prediction of the sustainability of shallow geothermal energy development in urban groundwater bodies stems from the absence of a scientific-based legal regulatory framework which protects stakeholders from thermal interferences between existent exploitations systems. The present work consists of a numerical study aimed at understanding and predicting the thermal interference between groundwater heat pumps where several induced heat plumes in an urban ground water body coalesce, thus generating a heat island effect.\nA transient groundwater flow and heat transport model was developed to reproduce complex high-resolution data obtained from local monitoring specifically designed to control the aquifer respond to geothermal exploitation. The model aims to reproduce the groundwater flow and heat transport processes in a shallow alluvial aquifer exploited by 27 groundwater heat pumps and influenced by a river-aquifer relationship dominated by flood events mainly occurring in winter when the surface temperature is between 3 and 10 ºC.\nThe results from the simulations have quantified the time-space thermal interference between exploitation systems and the consequences of river-aquifer thermal exchange. The results obtained showed the complexity of thermal management of the aquifer due to the transient activity of exploitations over space and time. With the actual exploitation regime of shallow geothermal resources in the investigated area the model predicts a temperature rising tendency in the production wells until 2019 which can compromise the coefficient of performance of heat pumps. This situation can be interpreted as a warning, highlighting the need for an appropriate thermal management of the aquifer resources to ensure their long term sustainability.",

            "abstract": "We present a technique for modelling the lithospheric magnetic field based on estimation of equivalent potential field sources. As a first demonstration we present an application to magnetic field measurements made by the CHAMP satellite during the period 2009-2010. Three component vector field data are utilized at all latitudes. Estimates of core and large-scale magnetospheric sources are removed from the satellite measurements using the CHAOS-4 model. Quiet-time and night-side data selection criteria are also employed to minimize the influence of the ionospheric field. The model for the remaining lithospheric magnetic field consists of magnetic point sources (monopoles) arranged in an icosahedron grid with an increasing grid resolution towards the airborne survey area. The corresponding source values are estimated using an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm that includes model regularization (either quadratic or maximum entropy) and Huber weighting. Data error covariance matrices are implemented, accounting for the dependence of data error variances on quasi-dipole latitudes. Results show good consistency with the CM5 and MF7 models for spherical harmonic degrees up to n = 95. Advantages of the equivalent source method include its local nature and the ease of transforming to spherical harmonics when needed. The method can also be applied in local, high resolution, investigations of the lithospheric magnetic field, for example where suitable aeromagnetic data is available. To illustrate this possibility, we present preliminary results from a case study combining satellite measurements and local airborne scalar magnetic measurements of the Norwegian coastline.",

Roklanský/Javoří brooks are observed in a 10 km long segment on the flat area of the Šumava Plateau, the Losenice R. was followed on a 7 km segment in a deeply incised, steep-sloped valley.\n First, the hydromorphological mapping of the floodplain and channel landforms took place to collect information on position of the fluvial landforms. The mapping was performed using the HEM methodics, developed by the authors. The Electric Resistivity Tomography was used in 20 profiles across the valleys. These cross-sections formed a backbone of the research aiming to observe the depth and distribution of the coarse sediment valley fill (above bedrock) both across the valleys and along. Next we employed digital optical granulometry using Sedimetrics software on the mapped gravel bodies, classic sieve granulometry on sandy accumulations, and on-site, in-channel boulder granulometry. Finally, magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on suitable sediment profiles along the courses to assess the provenience of the material.\n There are several notions, indicated by the results of the abovementioned analyses. First, the valley floor sedimentary infill is surprisingly shallow (10-15 m), notably in the case of Javoří and Roklanský brook where the valley floor often exceeds 200 - 300 m. Also, the MS points to rather fast changes in the main sediment sources. Observations of the sediment character in the Losenice valley indicate significant role of the slope/channel coupling, namely persisting influence of large, slope-based sources of angular material (rockslides, debris flows), as well as strong impact of flood events on the valley floor morphology.",

Understanding the magnitude and timing of pollutant export, as well as the pathways by which different constituents are delivered to a water course, is paramount. One approach to gaining this type of knowledge is to observe pollutant fluxes at the watershed outlet.\nThe River Eden Demonstration Test Catchments programme uses in-situ monitoring equipment to provide high-resolution (30 minute) data for three mixed-agriculture watersheds (ca. 10km2) in north western England. Determinands measured include turbidity, phosphorus, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature, along with river discharge and rainfall. Provided with these data, and an awareness of significant agricultural activities carried out in the watershed on an annual basis, this study demonstrates how it is possible to identify different pollutant transfer pathways, along with their spatio-temporal nature, and their relative importance. This information is then used to inform appropriate mitigation design. In relation to this purpose, the pros and cons of the different hydrochemical and hydrophysical data are described, and recommendations made for other determinands that should be considered for measurement in future similar studies.",

To do this I will summarize a decade of inter-disciplinary research from the Krycklan Catchment Study in northern Sweden, and use a few contrasting biochemical constituents to illustrate the role of hotspots, landscape structure, and catchment scale as determinants of stream water quality. I will include several diverse functions related to the quality and quantity of DOC, ranging from how the bioavailability of DOC varies depending on catchment characteristics and seasons to how various natural and anthropogenic-derived elements are transformed, mobilized, and transported through the terrestrial environment to adjacent headwater streams and downstream to larger rivers.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow uncertainty estimation has recently received a large attention in the literature. A dynamic rating curve assessment method has been introduced (Morlot et al., 2014). This dynamic method allows to compute a rating curve for each gauging and a continuous streamflow time-series, while calculating streamflow uncertainties. Streamflow uncertainty takes into account many sources of uncertainty (water level, rating curve interpolation and extrapolation, gauging aging, etc.) and produces an estimated distribution of streamflow for each days.\nIn order to caracterise streamflow uncertainty, a probabilistic framework has been applied on a large sample of hydrometric stations of the Division Technique Générale (DTG) of Électricité de France (EDF) hydrometric network (>250 stations) in France. A reliability diagram (Wilks, 1995) has been constructed for some stations, based on the streamflow distribution estimated for a given day and compared to a real streamflow observation estimated via a gauging. To build a reliability diagram, we computed the probability of an observed streamflow (gauging), given the streamflow distribution. Then, the reliability diagram allows to check that the distribution of probabilities of non-exceedance of the gaugings follows a uniform law (i.e., quantiles should be equipropables). Given the shape of the reliability diagram, the probabilistic calibration is caracterised (underdispersion, overdispersion, bias) (Thyer et al., 2009).\nIn this paper, we present case studies where reliability diagrams have different statistical properties for different periods. Compared to our knowledge of river bed morphology dynamic of these hydrometric stations, we show how reliability diagram gives us invaluable information on river bed movements, like a continuous digging or backfilling of the hydraulic control due to erosion or sedimentation processes. Hence, the careful analysis of reliability diagrams allows to reconcile statistics and long-term river bed morphology processes. This knowledge improves our real-time management of hydrometric stations, given a better caracterisation of erosion/sedimentation processes and the stability of hydrometric station hydraulic control.",

            "abstract": "Smith and Marks (Eos Trans. AGU, 95(21), 27 May 2014) illustrated a map of the seafloor in the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 search area. This map showed a bathymetric model that is constructed from a combination of available ship soundings and depths estimated from satellite altimetry. They noted that available depth measurements covered only 5% of their study region, and that very few of these measurements were collected using modern multibeam and navigation systems.\nRecently the MH370 search has been expanded along the “7th Arc” to encompass newly prioritized underwater search areas identified in an Australian Transport Safety Bureau report (AE-2014-054, 26 June 2014). While the new “Priority” search area is within the Eos article Fig. 1, the new “Wide” search area extends beyond the region evaluated in Eos. Additionally, multibeam data that were not incorporated in the bathymetric model have been made available to us after the Eos article was published.\nThis presentation will update and extend the study published in Eos. We will present illustrations of the expanded region, sounding coverage, and tectonic features that are associated with steep topographic slopes. Our results include comparisons of multibeam survey depths and bathymetric model depths. The standard deviation of the differences is 182 m, with the greatest differences (exceeding 1000 m) over steep topographic slopes, and the smallest over low-relief ocean floor. This is consistent with differences found by Smith and Sandwell (JGR, 99(B11), 1994) between soundings and bathymetric predictions from altimetry. Such depth differences are common where bathymetric model constraints are sparse, which is typical of many of the world’s oceans.",

Neither local measurements in boreholes nor analysis at the spring can take into account the variability of the water storage. Since 10 years, ground-based gravity measurements (absolute FG5 and relative CG5) allow the monitoring of the water storage in heterogeneous hydrosystems at intermediate scale between boreholes (local scale) and spring (global scale).\nSince threeyears, a geophysical observatory has been setup in the Mediterranean area (on the Durzon karstic basinin the south of France). Water level in boreholes and rainfall from rain gaugesare classical hydrological observations. They arecompleted by evapotranspiration measurements from a flux tower and continuous gravity measurements from the GWR iGrav#002 superconducting gravimeter. The main objective of thisstudy is to modelthe wholedata sets withexplicit numericalmodels.\nHydrus-1D software allows explicit modeling of water storage and 1D-flow in variably saturated media. With a stochastic sampling, we find the underground parameters (porosity, permeability) that reproduce the most the different observations (gravity, water level, evapotranspiration and rainfall). From the results of the modeling, we discuss the size of the area observed by each type of measurements. Furthermore, water storage and transfer variability may be inferred from the synergy of local (boreholes) and more integrative (gravity) measurements. This study shows the potential of gravity measurements at aquifer scale.",

The atmospheric CO2 estimates above clouds and for entire columns are retrieved from the data obtained during the summer 2011 and spring 2013 ASCENDS flight campaigns. The lidar returns from clouds and surfaces are discriminated by the range-encoded IM signals transmitted by the airborne LAS system. Under thin cloud conditions, lidar systems generally have strong enough return signals from the surface for CO2 retrieval. For optically thick clouds, CO2 columns above the clouds are estimated with lidar returns from the cloud tops, and neighboring clear sky areas are used to measure the total CO2 columns to the surface. Case studies show that the full-column atmospheric CO2 measurements are very similar in adjacent clear and thin-cloud regions, while the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of the CO2 columns are very different due to differences in the transmissions from aircraft to surface over cloudy and clear regions. For example, the measured CO2 columns to land surfaces were found to be about 398 ppm with an average SNR values for 0.1-s averages of about 140 and 38 in clear and thin-cloud conditions, respectively. Under thick clouds conditions, considerable variations in lidar returns for the extended targets are found. Also, their CO2 differential absorption optical depth values are normally smaller than those to the surface. These effects significantly reduce the precisions of CO2 column measurements both above clouds and to the surface under cloudy conditions compared to those to the surface in clear skies. Still, column-averaged CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) estimates above clouds for daytime observations are expected to be slightly higher than those for the entire atmospheric column due to CO2 uptake by vegetation at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Observed precipitation in the monsoon regions underwent substantial changes during the second half of the 20th century, with drying from the 1950s to the mid-1980s and increasing precipitation in recent decades. Globally, anthropogenic forcing has been shown to have influenced changes in zonal mean and Northern Hemisphere precipitation. Modelling studies suggest human activity, in the form of anthropogenic aerosols, has been a key factor driving changes in tropical and monsoon precipitation. Here we use climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 to investigate the influence of individual climate forcings (i.e. greenhouse gas, anthropogenic aerosol and natural) on monsoon precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere and apply a robust statistical analysis to determine whether observed changes are driven by these external forcings or whether they could be explained by internal climate variability alone. Four observational datasets were used to calculate the mean May-September (encompassing the whole monsoon season) precipitation anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon (NHSM) region. Multi-model ensembles of climate model simulations were used to derive response patterns to various forcings including all external forcings, which combines anthropogenic (greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use and ozone) and natural forcing (volcanic and solar), greenhouse gas forcing, anthropogenic aerosol forcing, natural forcing and all anthropogenic forcings. The results of a detection and attribution analysis show that the observed temporal changes can only be explained when including the influence of anthropogenic aerosols, even after accounting for internal climate variability. Anthropogenic aerosol, not greenhouse gas or natural forcing, has been the dominant influence on monsoon precipitation over the second half of the 20th century. Future monsoon precipitation will therefore depend on how aerosol emissions change in the coming decades.",

We describe optimal sample preparation methods for cleaning external organic matter and separating frustules into various size classes while reducing significance of opal from radiolaria and silicoflagellates. Analysis of discrete separated fractions of diatom opal from each sediment sample is facilitated by our new method for analysis of very small sample sizes using NanoEA with cryotrapping of evolved CO2. We evaluate the fidelity with which frustule-bound organic matter captures the variation in εp by comparing δ13C of frustule-bound organic matter with that of total cellular carbon in diatoms grown in culture, and by comparing the δ13C of frustule-bound organic matter in core tops with that of δ13C of diatom-produced biomarkers in the overlying water column. In core-top transects, frustule-bound δ13C is consistent with strong growth rate control over fractionation during photosynthesis (εp). Finally, we evaluate the temporal trends in carbon isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis since the Late Miocene in samples from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific.",

Nevertheless, at geostationary orbit, the normalized response (ΔBz/ΔP1/2) of the vertical component (whose jump is often accompanied by a variation of the radial component, Bx, as well) reveals, in each local time sector, a large variability which may depend on several factors, such as the external solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions, the state of the magnetosphere, the position of the impact point of the solar wind front on the magnetosphere boundaries, the magnetopause motion, etc. We analyze these aspects, considering also the seasonal effects which modulate the orientation of the Earth’s dipole with respect to the Sun-Earth direction. Following our previous investigations, we also compare the magnetospheric response with model predictions, as evaluated in terms of the concurring contribution of the magnetospheric current systems (from the magnetopause, the ring current, the cross-tail current) in order to ascertain the role and the onset time of each current. A careful identification of these aspects is also useful to discriminate between magnetospheric and ionospheric contributions in the ground manifestation of such events.",

Since few years, ground-based gravity measurements allow the monitoring of the water storage in heterogeneous hydrosystems at intermediate scale between boreholes (local scale) and spring (global scale).From many experiments in the Durzon karstic system in the south of France, we studied the seasonal water storage at different spatial scales. Firstly, all gravity experiments, carried out witha well suited methodology,show significant signals. Surface and depth measurements at small scale (20-50 m in depth and 20-50 m in surface) shows significant gravity variations. The equivalent water storage variations are interpreted in relation with the subsurface observations: topography, geomorphology and lithology. At larger scale (100m – 5000m), equivalent water storage variations is linked with alteration and karstification.\nThe main results are the importance of the seasonal water storage in the epikarst and the spatial coherence of the gravity measurements. These experimental studies show the potential impact of the spatially distributed gravity measurements for further hydrological numerical models.",

            "abstract": "We review the published results on the Congo Basin hydrology and find that there are historic data, ongoing measurement recording efforts, and important model results. Annual rainfall is ~2000 mm/yr along an east-west trend, decreasing northward and southward to ~1100 mm/yr. While some studies show rain gauges at specific locations with declines in P greater than 10% from 1960 to 1990, other studies suggest that basin wide decreases from 1951 to 1993 are modest at 4.5% or that the trend is minimal. Studies during the 1950s using lysimeters, pans, and models suggest that the annual potential ET varies little across the basin at a 1100 mm/yr to 1200 mm/yr. Over the past century, river discharge data has been collected at 100s of stream gauges with historic and recent data at 96 locations now publicly available. Discharge of the Congo River at Kinshasa-Brazzaville experienced an increase of 21% during 1960-1970 in comparison to background values of the previous decades and of today. There does not appear to be a long-term discharge trend over the century of record. Satellite altimetry measurements collected during high and low flows show that the Cuvette Centrale wetland water levels are consistently 0.5m to 3m higher in elevation than the immediately adjacent Congo River levels. Wetland water depths are shallow at about 1m whereas the Congo is typically less than 15m deep everywhere upstream of Kinshasa. The wetlands do not appear to be marked by sizable channels such that the flows are diffusive. CO2 and CH4 evasion from the Congo waters directly to the atmosphere are estimated at 1.6 to 3.2 Tg/yr for CH4 from the Cuvette wetland waters and 105 to 204 g C/m2/yr for CO2 from waters of the Oubangui River. Using these published results, we suggest seven hypotheses that may lead to important water and carbon cycle discoveries. These hypotheses focus on the source of the Cuvette waters and how those waters leave the wetland; on river discharge generated by historic rainfall; on the connection between climate change and the rainfall-runoff generated by the ITCZ; on deforestation and hydroelectric power generation; and on the amount of carbon emitted from Congo waters. To address these hypotheses, the Congo research community will need to work together to host meetings, share ideas, access data, ensure funding, and provide infrastructural support.",

            "abstract": "Most Earth sand deserts experience multidirectional winds that shape long, regularly spaced and parallel linear dunes. These dunes often exhibit complex and compound patterns with different length scales and orientations, which seem difficult to relate to a single wind cycle. This complexity is commonly ascribed to changes in wind regimes since many dunes date back to Last Glacial Maximum. We present results of underwater experiments where a single wind regime can lead to two different dune orientation depending on sediment availability. Sediment availability selects the overriding mechanism for the formation of dunes: increasing in height from the destabilization of a sand bed or elongating in a finger on a nonerodible ground from a localized sand source. These mechanisms drive the dune orientation. Therefore, dune alignment maximizes dunes orthogonality to sand fluxes (or gross bedform-normal transport) in the bed instability mode, while dunes are aligned with the sand transport direction in the fingering mode. The corresponding orientations can almost be orthogonal to each other so that a dune field can rapidly switch its orientation in reaction to a change in sand supply. Then, we derive a model for dune orientation, which explains the coexistence of bedforms with different alignments, and the spreading of sand seas through arid regions. Applied to Earth deserts, the model quantitatively predicts both the orientation of rectilinear dunes, and of their superimposed patterns in agreement with the wind data of the last decades. These results suggest that most linear dunes on Earth sand seas are elongating and simply aligned with the integrated sand transport direction.",

            "abstract": "The light element composition of the Earth's core remains mysterious despite decades' of research. Without any direct samples, our knowledge of the core composition has relied on a diversity of constraints including the density and velocity profiles derived from seismic and geophysical observations, the composition models proposed on the basis of geochemical and cosmochemical measurements, the material properties determined by mineral physics investigations, and the thermal and dynamo requirements coming out of dynamic modeling. The leading candidates for the principal light element include hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur and silicon, in the order of increasing atomic number. While each candidate stands out in some aspects and raises questions in others, none has been universally accepted as the dominant light element in the core. The controversy arises partly because the properties and behavior of various iron-alloys at extreme pressure and temperature conditions have not been fully constrained. It is also conceivable that existing approaches will not produce unique solution, and therefore requires new strategies.\nNeutrino oscillation tomography has recently emerged as a promising technique to probe the composition of Earth's interior. Neutrinos are produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray interactions. Atmospheric neutrinos pass through the Earth's mantle and core, with flavor oscillations being affected by the electron density of the medium along the trajectories. The unique sensitivity of the atmospheric neutrinos to electron density introduces a contrast between hydrogen, which has a higher electron density, and carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and silicon, which have lower and similar electron densities. With sufficient exposure to an appropriate energy range, atmospheric neutrino measurements may allow us to detect the presence of the core and measure its radius. Here we compare electron densities of candidate model compositions of Earth's core and estimate the exposure requirements for identifying the dominant light element thorough neutrino oscillation tomography for both neutrino mass hierarchies. In particular, we will evaluate if any of the on-going and next-generation projects IceCube, PINGU, MICA, and HyperK can tell us about the light elements in Earth's core.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, long-period long-duration (LPLD) events have been observed during hydraulic fracturing of hydrocarbon reservoirs (Das & Zoback, 2013). LPLDs are low-amplitude signals lasting from tens of seconds to minutes. Their source mechanisms are not fully understood. However, as they are remarkably similar in character to tectonic tremors it has been suggested that they may also have comparable source models. Current models suggest that a tectonic tremor consists of numerous slow-slip earthquakes superposed on each other to form continuous waveforms (Shelley et al., 2007). These slow-slip earthquakes are thought to be a result of shear slip on faults close to failure with low confining pressure, most likely due to the presence of fluid with pore pressures close to lithostatic pressures (Peng & Gomberg, 2010).\nThis study aims to further understand the source mechanism of LPLDs. A hydraulic fracturing dataset containing thousands of located microseismic earthquakes (MEQs) and numerous LPLDs is presented. The MEQs are located around the injection stages whereas the LPLDs are clustered in a limited region within the reservoir. This clustering suggests that LPLDs can only be generated where the conditions in the reservoir are favorable. These results correspond with the possibility that LPLDs are manifestations of slow-slip, with the source locations confined by variations in the mechanical properties of the reservoir. To test this hypothesis a further understanding of the mechanisms of LPLDs and the stress field in which they occur is needed. However, calculating focal mechanisms for LPLDs is difficult due to their emergent onset and lack of clear phases. Consequently, LPLDs must be put into context with the observed MEQs. We will present the spatial distribution of the focal mechanisms of the MEQs and analyze our findings with respect to the occurrence of the LPLD events.",

            "abstract": "Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) is a standardized control method that has been developed by the Monitoring Agriculture Resources (MARS Unit) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). It relies on remote sensing time series data and is officially recognized by the EU as equivalent to actual farm visits. Member states agencies use CwRS to carry out part or all of their on-the-spot controls of EU farms to monitor Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) subsidies. The main component of CwRS is Computer-Aided Photo-Interpretation (CAPI), whose goal is determining the crop occupation of agricultural parcels listed in farmers' subsidies applications. In 2012, the CAP CwRS program enabled the oversight of 349,000 farmers for their area-aid applications, representing 89% of the total EU27 required controls.\nThe goal of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible method to automatize the CAPI process. The main feature of this method is that it allows choosing a confidence level on the automatic classification of farmer’s parcels. While higher confidence levels reduce the risk of misclassifications, lower levels increase the number of automatic control decisions that do not require the intervention of a photo interpreter, reducing the overall CwRS costs.\nWe used extensive 2005 validated control data from the Portuguese Control and Paying Agency for Agriculture (IFAP) and a multi-temporal Landsat 7 time series to train and test our methodology. Our overall results indicate that for 95% confidence level, approximately 20% of decisions can be taken automatically and for 80% confidence level the percentage of automatic decisions increases to 55%. For each studied land cover class, the adjacent figure shows the effect of the confidence level on the percentage of parcels that can be classified automatically. Since our approach holds for multiple sensors, we believe that the current results will be further improved with additional data. Our results compare favorably with standard pixel-based classifications since we take advantage of the available farmer's declarations, which are by nature object-based. IFAP is currently interested in implementing this procedure in order to reduce CAPI costs.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the processes that give rise to complex acoustic signals during volcanic blasts by monitoring buried chemical explosions with infrasound and audio range microphones, strong motion sensors, and high speed imagery. Acoustic waveforms vary with scaled depth of burial (SDOB, units in meters per cube root of joules), ranging from high amplitude, impulsive, gas expansion dominated signals at low SDOB to low amplitude, longer duration, ground motion dominated signals at high SDOB. Typically, the sudden upward acceleration of the substrate above the blast produces the first acoustic arrival, followed by a second pulse due to the eruption of pressurized gas at the surface. Occasionally, a third overpressure occurs when displaced material decelerates upon impact with the ground. The transition between ground motion dominated and gas release dominated acoustics ranges between 0.0038-0.0018 SDOB, respectively. For example, one explosion registering an SDOB=0.0031 produced two overpressure pulses of approximately equal amplitude, one due to ground motion, the other to gas release. Recorded volcano infrasound has also identified distinct ground motion and gas release components during explosions at Sakurajima, Santiaguito, and Karymsky volcanoes. Our results indicate that infrasound records may provide a proxy for the depth and energy of these explosions. Furthermore, while magma fragmentation models indicate the possibility of several explosions during a single vulcanian eruption (Alidibirov, Bull Volc., 1994), our results suggest that a single explosion can also produce complex acoustic signals. Thus acoustic records alone cannot be used to distinguish between single explosions and multiple closely-spaced blasts at volcanoes. Results from a series of lateral blasts during the 2014 field experiment further indicates whether vent geometry can produce directional acoustic radiation patterns like those observed at Tungarahua volcano (Kim et al., GJI, 2012). Beside infrasonic radiation, our multiparametric dataset also allowed us to investigate other acoustic processes relevant for explosive eruptions, including shock-wave generation and audible sound radiation, and to link them to the starting conditions and evolution of the blasts.",

A Tsallis distribution describes the distribution of increments of daily averages of the magnetic field strength B observed by Voyager 2 (V2) in the heliosheath during 2010 in association with exceptionally low solar activity. A parameter q derived from this distribution is qstat = 1.75. The correlation function of B(t) is a power law on scales from 1 to 16 days, and from the exponent one obtains the parameter qrel = 3.9. The fluctuations of B are described by a multifractal spectrum f(α) on scales from 1 to 8 days, from which one obtains qsen = 1.75. The “q-triplet” (qsen, qrel, qstat) defines basic observable properties of an open, driven system in a meta-equilibrium state, which strongly constrains physical models of the system. The distribution of B is Gaussian, probably related to the unipolar region in which V2 was located. A 1/f spectrum of B was observed on scales from 1 to 100 days. The Tsallis distribution also describes the “turbulence” observed on very small scales, from 48 sec to several hours, observed by V2 behind the termination shock from day 245 - 301, 2007.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have identified a lengthening of the dry season over the southern Amazon during the last three decades. This work suggests that this lengthening is correlated with an earlier demise of the North American monsoon, mainly observed after the mid 1990’s. In addition, changes in both systems appear to be induced by common forcing factors at different time scales, like the shifting patterns of El Niño-Southern Oscillation anomalies, the westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and the global warming influence. However, whether the observed changes of dry season rainfall deficit over the Amazonia could influence the retreat of the North American monsoon is not clear. This work aims to identify the processes that could enable a possible influence of a longer and stronger dry season in the Amazon forests on the cross-equatorial flow and the demise of the North American monsoon. To address this possible inter-hemispheric link may be important in understanding the future climate variability of the American monsoons when the effects of anthropogenic forced change and conversion from Amazon forests to savannah become more dominant. The latter would be particularly relevant in order to understand the role of ecosystem changes on modulating climate over the Americas.",

            "abstract": "A comparative study has been made on the three dimensional structure, distribution of the rain top and precipitation profiles of two precipitation system caused by Southwest vortex（SWV） which happened in Sichuan and Chongqing on 17 July, 2007 and Tibetan Plateau vortex （TPV） which happened in the west part of Sichuan on 21 July, 2008 respectively based on TRMM data, combined with the NCEP reanalysis data. Results indicate that: (1) The two precipitation processes were occurred in the southwest-northeast direction of the moisture convergence zone, clouds located in the southeast of SWV. (2) In horizontal, the two precipitations processes are all consisted of a main precipitation rain band and several scattered precipitation clouds, and the rainfall intensity and scope of TPV are much large than those of SWV. The common feature of the two mesoscale precipitation systems detected by precipitation radar (PR) is that most of precipitation are stratiform precipitation which is characterized by large scope and weak intensity in precipitation, but the contribution of convective rains to the total rainfall is much large, the ratio and the contribution to the total rainfall of convective precipitation in SWV is larger than it in TPV. (3) In vertical, the rain top of the two heavy precipitation systems is increased with the increase of surface precipitation rate, and the maximum rain top is close to 16km, but rain top of SWV is higher than TPV, which indicate that the convective than that of TPV. (4) The progress of collision and growth of rain drop and the latent heat release were mainly occurred blow the height of 8km. But the change of precipitation of SWV is greater than that of TPV, and the former is greater than the later for the contribution of rainfall at 8-12km height to total precipitation.\nKey words Southwest vortex, Tibetan Plateau vortex, TRMM satellite, precipitation structure",

            "abstract": "The Pantanal is one of the largest wetlands in the world, with an area of 150,000 km2. It extends over three countries (Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia) with 80% located in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Ecosystems in the Northern Pantanal rely on a seasonal flood pulse in phase with the wet season, which inundates grasslands and forests between January and May. This pulse results in an important change in local biogeochemistry. Inundation saturates the Pantanal’s soils with changes in the balance of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This study summarize the main CO2 effluxes measured from a variety of landscape in the Northern Pantanal during dry and wet seasons, fully or partially inundated soils, as part of Project 2.01 of the Brazilian Institute for Science and Technology in Wetlands (Monitoring aquatic carbon fluxes and water quality). Using a network of dataloggers installed in 4 environments, we have been modeling soil CO2 efflux on a half hourly basis through a combination of infrared gas analyzers measurements and laboratory soil physical parameter estimates. The selected environments presented unique biogeochemical behavior as they relate to inundation and soil type. So far, we have estimated average CO2 efflux in 3 environments with mean values of 3.53 µmol m-2 s-1 (soil CO2 efflux for the “Carrapatal” tree island), 3.41 µmol m-2 s-1 (soil CO2 efflux for the “Baia das Pedras” tree island), and 1.79 µmol m-2 s-1 (aquatic CO2 evasion from the water surface of the “Cambarazal” flooded forest). More measurements are currently underway to complete the landscape variability in CO2 effluxes in the Northern Pantanal.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon is the third largest carbon reservoir and is composed of both organic and inorganic constituents. However, the storage and flux of soil carbon within the global carbon cycle are not fully understood. While organic carbon is often the focus of research, the factors controlling the formation and dissolution of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) are complex.\nClimate is largely accepted as the primary control on SIC, but the effects of soil parent material are less clear. We hypothesize that effects of parent material are significant and that SIC accumulation will be greater in soils formed from basalts than granites due to the finer textured soils and more abundant calcium and magnesium cations.\nThis research is being conducted in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho. The watershed is an ideal location because it has a range of gradients in precipitation (250 mm to 1200 mm), ecology (sagebrush steppe to juniper), and parent materials (a wide array of igneous and sedimentary rock types) over a relatively small area. Approximately 20 soil profiles will be excavated throughout the watershed and will capture the effects of differing precipitation amounts and parent material on soil characteristics. Several samples at each site will be collected for analysis of SIC content and grain size distribution using a pressure calcimeter and hydrometers, respectively.\nInitial field data suggests that soils formed over basalts have a higher concentration of SIC than those on granitic material. If precipitation is the only control on SIC, we would expect to see comparable amounts in soils formed on both rock types within the same precipitation zone. However, field observations suggest that for all but the driest sites, soils formed over granite had no SIC detected while basalt soils with comparable precipitation had measurable amounts of SIC. Grain size distribution appears to be a large control on SIC as the sandier, granitic soils promote deeper percolation.\nThis ongoing research will clarify the processes involved in SIC formation and identify the situations where it is an atmospheric source or sink.",

            "abstract": "When confronted with the challenge of selecting one out of several competing conceptual models for a specific modeling task, Bayesian model averaging is a rigorous choice. It ranks the plausibility of models based on Bayes’ theorem, which yields an optimal trade-off between performance and complexity. With the resulting posterior model probabilities, their individual predictions are combined into a robust weighted average and the overall predictive uncertainty (including conceptual uncertainty) can be quantified. This rigorous framework does, however, not yet explicitly consider statistical significance of measurement noise in the calibration data set. This is a major drawback, because model weights might be instable due to the uncertainty in noisy data, which may compromise the reliability of model ranking.\nWe present a new extension to the Bayesian model averaging framework that explicitly accounts for measurement noise as a source of uncertainty for the weights. This enables modelers to assess the reliability of model ranking for a specific application and a given calibration data set. Also, the impact of measurement noise on the overall prediction uncertainty can be determined.\nTechnically, our extension is built within a Monte Carlo framework. We repeatedly perturb the observed data with random realizations of measurement error. Then, we determine the robustness of the resulting model weights against measurement noise. We quantify the variability of posterior model weights as weighting variance. We add this new variance term to the overall prediction uncertainty analysis within the Bayesian model averaging framework to make uncertainty quantification more realistic and “complete”.\nWe illustrate the importance of our suggested extension with an application to soil-plant model selection, based on studies by Wöhling et al. (2013, 2014). Results confirm that noise in leaf area index or evaporation rate observations produces a significant amount of weighting uncertainty and compromises the reliability of model ranking. Without our suggested extension, this additional contribution to prediction uncertainty could not be detected and model ranking results would be misinterpreted. We therefore advise modelers to include our suggested upgrade in the Bayesian model averaging routine.",

BARREL flew in association with the much larger Van Allen Probes mission and BARREL payloads made a simple niche measurement that has contributed substantially to that larger mission. BARREL payloads also made a massively multipoint measurement in order to observe phenomena that cannot be understood from a single or even limited number of points of view. Many low cost access platforms hope to ultimately achieve niche measurements that fill gaps in data or understanding, other programs hope to achieve swarms of small satellites. Will the niche measurement be definitive? What do we need to do to assimilate substantial numbers of data views.

            "abstract": "Radiative feedback is normally discussed in terms of the change of broadband flux. Yet it has an intrinsic dimension of spectrum. A set of all-sky and clear-sky longwave (LW) spectral radiative kernels (SRK) are constructed using a recently developed spectral flux simulator which is based on the PCRTM (Principal-Component-based Radiative Transfer Model). The LW spectral radiative kernels are validated against the partial radiative perturbation method. The LW broadband feedbacks derived using this SRK method are also consistent with the published results using the broadband radiative kernels.\nThe SRK is then applied to 12 GCMs in CMIP3 archives and 12 GCMs in CMIP5 archives to derive the spectrally resolved Planck, lapse rate, and LW water vapor feedbacks. The inter-model spreads of the spectral lapse-rate feedbacks among the CMIP3 models are noticeably different than those among the CMIP5 models. In contrast, the inter-model spread of spectral LW water vapor feedbacks changes little from the CMIP3 to CMIP5 simulations, when the specific humidity is used as the state variable. Spatially the far-IR band is more responsible for the changes in lapse-rate feedbacks from the CMIP3 to CMIP5 than the window band. When relative humidity (RH) is used as state variable, virtually all GCMs have little broadband RH feedbacks as shown in Held & Shell (2012). However, the RH feedbacks can be significantly non-zero over different LW spectral regions and the spectral details of such RH feedbacks vary significantly from one GCM to the other. Finally an interpretation based on a one-layer atmospheric model is presented to illustrate under what statistical circumstances the linear technique can be applied to spectral flux heavily averaged over the spatial and temporal dimensions in spite of the fact that the radiative transfer of each individual case is highly nonlinear.",

The rocks were first observed on Sol 634 from ~110m distance and subsequently imaged on Sol 637 using Mastcam and the Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) on ChemCam. The rock “Lebanon” was observed from ~43m, and the rock “Littleton” from ~63m, revealing lustrous blue-gray color and small surface pits consistent with regmaglypts. On Sol 640, Lebanon (at ~12m distance), a nearby fragment, and Littleton (~36m) were imaged with Mastcam at 3 times of day. This included multispectral images of Lebanon along with a 6-frame RMI mosaic and a single position on Littleton. After a ~1.5 m drive closer to the rocks, additional Mastcam images were obtained prior to departure.\nAt high resolution the surfaces were smooth with mm-scale, intermittent pockmarks. Collections of sand within regmaglypts suggested previous episodes of at least partial burial and exhumation. Mastcam reflectance spectra were red-sloped, with variations <550nm related to specular reflections, similar to laboratory spectra of iron meteorites (and MER spectra of similar rocks). The rocks did not exhibit the cavernous weathering or purple-hued, patchy coatings associated with meteorites observed by MER. The lack of such physio-chemical weathering may be consistent with the less acidic environments postulated for Gale Crater rocks.\nThe close proximity of these rocks suggests they were part of the same fall. The lack of an associated impact crater suggests the event was either unable to create an impact crater (e.g., low angle entry through a thicker atmosphere), or the rocks survived after erosion of associated impact structure(s). Iron meteorites such as these may therefore provide “witness plates” to processes and environments experienced in this region since their arrival.",

First, do droughts and their associated environmental impacts affect rates of violent conflict? Second, what differences exist for individuals’ personal insecurity between the effects of perceived changes in drought patterns and the actual observed fluctuations in rainfall? Using data from a mid-2014 nationwide survey of 1400 Kenyans that asked respondents nuanced questions about the frequency, severity, and timing of rainfall, droughts, and flooding events, we significantly change the nature of existing studies in the climate change and conflict literature. This survey also asked respondents about their personal exposure to violence, as well as conflict in their general area. Our interdisciplinary team employed cutting edge field experimental questions to elicit truthful responses about the willingness of respondents to support violent activities. Our statistical analysis investigates how the self-reported exposure to violence and conflict-supporting attitudes vary with perceived changes in rainfall. We systematically control for other explanations of violence support in all of our modeling. To answer our second question, we match survey respondents’ locations to observed remote sensing and station-location records of precipitation, temperature, and vegetation health. We present differences between the perceived and actual precipitation trends with implications for the respondents’ self-reported levels of violence exposure and explain these differences using other respondent and contextual characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Variations in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) have been connected in numerical models and paleo-climate records with changes in surface air temperature, precipitation patterns, and changes in hurricane intensification, but observations and models also suggest that the MOC is not an in-phase monolithic system driving simultaneous (or even identical lagged) variations at all latitudes and in all ocean basins. Prediction and understanding of MOC variability will require better comprehension of the latitudinal and temporal scales associated with MOC changes across the Atlantic. Continuous basin-wide MOC volume transport time series observations are available at 26.5°N from the RAPID-MOC/MOCHA/WBTS array for nearly a decade, and a 20-month continuous basin-wide MOC time series is available at 34.5°S based on the pilot arrays of the developing SAMBA array. At 26.5°N the longer record indicates that the bulk (nearly 50%) of the time variability in the record is at sub-annual periods – this energetic ‘high frequency noise’ illustrates the need for continuous-in-time (daily) measurements. The MOC at 34.5°S is similarly ‘noisy’ at sub-annual periods, and based on this short record there is no indication of coherence between the MOC time series at the two latitudes. Structure and variability comparisons between the two latitudes will be presented and discussed in the context of recent numerical model results, illustrating not only the veracity but also the limitations of the model results.",

The dataset contains three-dimensional hourly analyses in netCDF format for the global atmospheric state from 1985 to 2005 on a 40km horizontal grid (0.4°grid increment) with 28 vertical levels, providing good representation of local forcing and diurnal variation of processes in the planetary boundary layer. This project aimed to make the dataset publicly available, accessible, and usable in order to provide a unique resource to allow and promote studies of new climate characteristics.\nWhen the curation project started, it had been five years since the data files were generated. Also, although the Principal Investigator (PI) had generated a user document at the end of the project in 2009, the document had not been maintained. Furthermore, the PI had moved to a new institution, and the remaining team members were reassigned to other projects. These factors made data curation in the areas of verifying data quality, harvest metadata descriptions, documenting provenance information especially challenging. As a result, the project’s curation process found that:\nData curator’s skill and knowledge helped make decisions, such as file format and structure and workflow documentation, that had significant, positive impact on the ease of the dataset’s management and long term preservation. \nUse of data curation tools, such as the Data Curation Profiles Toolkit’s guidelines, revealed important information for promoting the data’s usability and enhancing preservation planning.\nInvolving data curators during each stage of the data curation life cycle instead of at the end could improve the curation process’ efficiency.\nOverall, the project showed that proper resources invested in the curation process would give datasets the best chance to fulfill their potential to help with new climate pattern discovery.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the environmental factors controlling the origin and shifting abundance of C4 grasses in Earth’s history is useful for projecting the response of C4-grass dominated grasslands to future environmental change. Unfortunately, grass pollen is typically morphologically indistinct, making palynological analysis a blunt tool for studying C4-grasses in the paleorecord. δ13C of individual grass-pollen grains using a spooling wire microcombustion device interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Single Pollen Isotope Ratio AnaLysis, SPIRAL) overcomes this challenge and the potential biases of δ13C data from other substrates (e.g. leaf waxes). To assess the presence and relative abundance of C3- and C4-grass pollen in samples of unknown composition, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model, trained with ~1,900 δ13C values from pollen grains of 31 grass species. Surface-sediment data from Africa, Australia, and North America demonstrate the reliability of this technique for quantifying C4-grass abundance on the landscape. To investigate the timing and control of the origin of C4-grasses we analyzed samples from the Oligocene-Miocene from Europe and from the Eocene from North America. Results indicate that C4 grasses appeared on the landscape of southwest Europe no later than the early Oligocene, implying that low atmospheric pCO2 may not have been the main driver and/or precondition for the development of C4 photosynthesis in the grass family. In contrast, we found no evidence for C4 grasses in the southeast United States before pCO2 fell. In application of SPIRAL to the late Quaternary, we found that shifts in pCO2 and moisture balance exerted key controls on the relative abundance of C3 and C4 grasses in Africa and Australia. Overall, our results imply that as in the past, future changes in the C3/C4 composition of grass-dominated ecosystems will likely exhibit striking spatiotemporal variability as a result of differing combinations of environmental controls.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow and long regions in the atmosphere that transport large quantities of water vapor across the mid-latitudes. ARs have been linked to large flood events over different regions of the globe. Over the central United States, ARs play a major role in causing extreme precipitation and flooding, including the 1993 and 2008 flood events. The goal of this work is to characterize rainfall associated with AR events over the central United States.\nHere we focus on the rainfall events during the Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) campaign, which took place through a partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Iowa Flood Center at the University of Iowa during April–June 2013. This field campaign focused on improving the understanding of strengths and weaknesses of satellite-based rainfall estimates, resulting in the collection of a large amount of both ground based and remotely-sensed data.\nThe accumulated precipitation during IFloodS was some of the largest since the middle of the 20th century over most of the central United States. Many of the heavy rainfall events during the campaign were associated with ARs, with large regions experiencing more than 70% of their rainfall during the occurrence of these events. As a preliminary step, we evaluate how well different satellite- and radar-based precipitation products captured the rainfall associated with the ARs. More specifically, we focus on rainfall estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA; both real-time and research version), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV. We use gridded rainfall provided by CPC (Daily US Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Precipitation) as reference. Stage IV is the product that shows the closest agreement with the reference data, and is the one that we use to characterize the rainfall distribution in AR events during the IFloodS campaign.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the impact of lateral variations of absorption and scattering properties on the energy envelopes of coda waves. To model the spatio-temporal distribution of seismic energy, we employ a scalar version of the radiative transfer equation with spatially-dependent absorption and scattering quality factor. The scattering pattern which describes the angular distribution of energy upon scattering is assumed to be statistically isotropic, independent of position, but otherwise arbitrary. Further assuming that the lateral variations of the governing parameters are sufficiently weak, we employ perturbation theory to derive linearized relations between the absorption/scattering properties of the medium and the intensity detected in the coda. These relations take the form of weighted integrals where so-called scattering/absorption sensitivity kernels play the role of weighting function. The kernels depend on the type of perturbation (scattering or absorption), the lapse time in the coda, and require the knowledge of the complete angular dependence of the specific intensity describing the flow of energy in a given direction at a given location. In the long lapse-time limit, we establish simplified formulas which depend on the first two angular moments of the specific intensity only. As an illustration of the theory, we calculate the absorption and scattering sensitivity kernels in a 2-D isotropically scattering medium at different lapse times in the coda, and discuss their singularities in detail. The sensitivity kernels are then employed to calculate the relative intensity variations of the coda caused by a localized Gaussian absorption/scattering anomaly. We find that the dominant effect of absorption anomalies is to modify the decay rate of the coda, while scattering anomalies have a more complex signature, causing either positive or negative deflection of the energy envelope, depending on their location and on the lapse time. Our results suggest the possibility to locate and discriminate between scattering and absorption anomalies from the energy envelope of coda waves.",

The sections are taught by different instructors, each of whom has flexibility to employ a variety of instructional strategies and choose specific topics to cover while meeting the requirement that general education courses in the natural sciences help students understand the importance of the science for appreciating the world around them. Students enrolled have been approximately 6-10% returning adult students, some of whom were veterans or active duty military, and about 10% members of racial or ethnic groups. Their majors are mostly in the humanities (theater, photography) and social sciences (education, English, journalism, sociology), with some natural science majors (psychology, aviation).\nFor the past two years, Section 001 has been designed with adult and active learning concepts in mind, using deliberate connections between course content and students’ lives and careers to motivate meaningful learning. Students were grouped in teams according to similar majors and assigned group presentations connecting course content to topics that should interest them, such as economic impacts of weather, societal and personal impacts of severe weather, risks to aviation, media coverage of weather, and psychological and sociological responses to weather risks. Students learn about the peer review process for scientific papers while also exploring a connection of course content to their future career or life interests through papers that are run through a mock peer review process. Public policy is discussed in several sections of the course, such as hurricane building codes, wind-resistant construction in tornado alley, and the disproportionate impacts of weather and climate on certain socioeconomic groups. Most students deeply appreciate the opportunity to explore how course content intersects with their lives. Several examples of these connections will be described.",

            "abstract": "C-O-H-S-N volatile elements sequestration in and release from silicate and metallic melts are key in controlling the planet scale distribution of these elements and thus are critical for thermo-chemical and dynamic evolution of terrestrial planets. To understand the distribution of carbon during accretion, core formation, magma ocean crystallization, and ongoing evolution of reduced mantles domains such as those of Mars, the Moon, and deep Earth, carbon chemistry in reduced silicates and alloys must be constrained, but currently are poorly known.\nHere we summarize recent experimental efforts to (1) constrain the speciation and solubility of carbon in graphite-saturated natural mafic melts at fO2 below IW buffer and (2) C solubility in Fe-Ni-rich alloy melts. Quenched glasses and alloys generated to 8 GPa and 2200 °C are analyzed using a combination of electron and ion microprobe, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy.\nDissolved carbonates and bulk C solubility (<200 ppm) of graphite-saturated silicate glasses are observed to increase with decreasing pressure and increasing temperature, melt depolymerization index (e.g., NBO/T), and fO2 from ~IW-1.5 to IW [1,2]. Over the range in fO2, melt H2O content also mildly enhances carbonate dissolution, likely in part owing to the depolymerizing effect of H2O in the melt. At fO2>IW-1.5, dissolved C is a mixture of carbonates and other species, but below ~IW-1.5 the carbonate doublet is undetectable in IR spectra, with Raman spectra indicating the dominant species being methane or other methyl groups. In addition, with diminishing fO2 from IW-2 to IW-5, C solubility trend reverses, i.e., it increases with decreasing fO2 and also shows a much stronger dependence on melt H content [3], consistent with the enhanced solubility of methane in silicate melt with decreasing fO2 and increasing with square of fH2. However, Fe-Ni-rich alloy melts have high C solubility (~0.7-7 wt.%) that diminishes mostly with increasing Ni, Si, and S contents.\nThese results have important implications for origin, distribution, and storage of carbon in the planetary interiors as well as chemistry of early atmosphere and will be discussed.\n[1] Dasgupta et al.

            "abstract": "A jet is a considerable amount of plasma being ejected from the chromosphere or lower corona into the higher corona and is a common phenomenon. Usually, a jet is triggered by a brightening or a flare, which provides the first driving force to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection is thought to be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, nonthermal, and kinetic energies. However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and end much later than the end of its associated flare. This fact implies that there is another way to continuously transfer magnetic energy into kinetic energy even after the reconnection. The picture described above is well known in the community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through a way other than reconnection is still unclear. By studying a prominence-like jet observed by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI, we find that the continuous relaxation of the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an important process for a jet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnection. The kinetic energy of the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times that gained from the reconnection. The resultant energy flux is hundreds of times larger than the flux required for the local coronal heating, suggesting that such jets are a possible source to keep the corona hot. Furthermore, rotational motions appear all the time during the jet. Our analysis suggests that torsional Alfvén waves induced during reconnection could not be the only mechanism to release magnetic energy and drive jets.",

            "abstract": "Although constraints on the history of mantle flow are difficult to obtain, tectonic reconstructions contain information about the longest wavelength patterns of mantle flow that drove plate motions in the past. To examine the influence of this long-wavelength flow on global geodynamics, we computed the dipole and quadrupole moments (harmonic degrees 1 and 2) of the spherical vector fields associated with tectonic reconstructions of plate motions back to 250 Ma. Areas of dipole or quadrupole divergence lie above regions of major mantle upwelling, and convergence regions reside atop major mantle downwellings. To constrain the time-dependence of dynamic topography associated with these upwellings and downwellings, we used a numerical model of present-day mantle flow to relate degree-1 and degree-2 patterns of dynamic topography to the orientations and amplitudes of the dipole and quadrupole moments of present-day plate motions. We then apply this relationship to the dipole and quadrupole moments of past plate motions to compute the long-wavelength components of dynamic topography for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Continental motions over this time-evolving dynamic topography predict patterns of continental uplift and subsidence that can be related to geological observations of continental surfaces relative to sea level. Net uplift or subsidence of the global seafloor can also induce eustatic sea level changes. We infer that dispersal of the Pangean supercontinent away from upwelling beneath Africa may have exposed the seafloor to an increasingly larger area of positive dynamic topography since the early Mesozoic that has caused up to 100 m of sea level rise during this time period. This component of sea level change helps to balance observations of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sea level change with an estimated total sea level budget that includes concurrent tectonic and climatic influences that produce sea level drop of up to ~250 m.",

            "abstract": "The high northern latitudes have experienced rapid warming in recent decades with projections of larger increases likely by the end of this century. Warming permafrost and an acceleration of the arctic freshwater cycle are among the myriad interconnected changes taking place that have the potential to impact ecosystems throughout the pan-Arctic. The Arctic Ocean receives a disproportionately large amount of global freshwater runoff and as such near-shore coastal margins along the arctic land-sea boundary are strongly influenced by riverine freshwater discharge. Alterations in hydrological flows driven by a changing climate and other perturbations, therefore, are likely to impact the biology and biogeochemistry of arctic coastal margins. Advances have been made in the quantification of water, carbon, and materials transports with recent studies documenting significant changes in exports of quantities such as dissolved organic carbon from large rivers, linked in turn to changes in landscape characteristics and hydrological flow rates. Here key measured data sets, derived empirical relationships, and the resulting pan-Arctic estimates for several constituents are described for the major arctic rivers and full pan-Arctic basin. Complementary estimates from a process-based model are presented, illustrating the potential for leveraging measured data to derive more accurate flows at basin and continental scales. A series of retrospective model simulations point to an increasing influence of river-borne heat transport on ice melt in coastal margins. Case studies of large freshwater anomalies provide a framework for understanding connections between river discharge and the biology and biogeochemistry of arctic coastal margins.",

            "abstract": "The USDA-Agricultural Research Service has led, or been integrally involved in, a myriad of interdisciplinary field campaigns in a wide range of locations both nationally and internationally. Many of the shorter campaigns were anchored over the existing national network of ARS Experimental Watersheds and Rangelands. These long-term outdoor laboratories provided a critical knowledge base for designing the campaigns as well as historical data, hydrologic and meteorological infrastructure coupled with shop, laboratory, and visiting scientist facilities. This strong outdoor laboratory base enabled cost-efficient campaigns informed by historical context, local knowledge, and detailed existing watershed characterization. These long-term experimental facilities have also enabled much longer term lower intensity experiments, observing and building an understanding of both seasonal and inter-annual biosphere-hydrosphere-atmosphere interactions across a wide range of conditions. A sampling of these experiments include MONSOON’90, SGP97, SGP99, Washita’92, Washita’94, SMEX02-05 and JORNEX series of experiments, SALSA, CLASIC and longer-term efforts over the ARS Little Washita, Walnut Gulch, Little River, Reynolds Creek, and OPE3 Experimental Watersheds. This presentation will review some of the highlights and key findings of these campaigns and long-term efforts including the inclusion of many of the experimental watersheds and ranges in the Long-Term Agro-ecosystems Research (LTAR) network. The LTAR network also contains several locations that are also part of other observational networks including the CZO, LTER, and NEON networks. Lessons learned will also be provided for scientists initiating their participation in large-scale, multi-site interdisciplinary science.",

            "abstract": "Many have called for climate engineering research because the growing risks of climate change and the geopolitical and national security risks of climate remediation technologies are real. As the topic of climate engineering remains highly controversial, national funding agencies should evaluate even modest outdoor climate engineering research proposals with respect to societal, legal, and risk considerations in making a decision to fund or not to fund. These concerns will be extremely difficult to coordinate internationally if they are not first considered successfully on a national basis. Assessment of a suite of proposed research projects with respect to these considerations indicates we would learn valuable lessons about how to govern research by initiating a few exemplar projects. The first time an issue arrives it can be very helpful if it there are specific cases, not a broad class of projects. A good first case should be defensible and understandable, fit within the general mandate of existing research programs, have negligible physical risk, small physical scale and short duration. By focusing on a specific case, the discussion can be held with limits and help to establish some track record in dealing with a controversial subject and developing a process for assigning appropriate scrutiny and outreach. Even at an early stage, with low risk, small-scale experiments, obtaining broad-based advice will aid in dealing with the controversies. An independent advisory body can provide guidance about a wide spectrum of physical and social risks of funding the experiment compared to societal benefit of gaining understanding. Clearly identifying the research as climate engineering research avoids sending research down a path that might violate public trust and provide an important opportunity to grow governance and public engagement at an early stage. Climate engineering research should be seen in the context of all approaches to dealing with the climate problem. Much of climate-engineering research will inspire investigators to address significant and difficult problems in climate science. US research programs should use this fact for societal benefit. Agencies should assess the early research and use the assessment to make decisions about how to, or not to, proceed.",

            "abstract": "Inland water sensor data acquisition is dominated by a fixed station reference frame, where water passes over a stationary sensor. These single point measurements are useful in understanding temporal patterns, but the assumptions needed to apply them to entire ecosystems are rarely tested. No single location within a stream reach or on a lake’s surface appropriately represents the inherent spatial variability, and extrapolations from these single points should be used with caution. In this context, we illustrate the approach of “taking the sensor to the water,” in either a quasi-Lagrangian or spatially explicit view. We present a sensor platform capable of rapid and dynamic (0-60 km hr-1) spatial sampling in navigable waters using multiple flow-through systems and a unique intake manifold connected to a small boat. We highlight data collected on medium-sized lakes (1.6 to 39 km2), and a heterogeneous reach of the upper Mississippi River (35 km). We use these datasets to infer hypolimnetic upwelling sensed from temperature and dissolved oxygen in a eutrophic lake and estimate the relative contributions of riverine and littoral methane production and epilimnetic transport. In addition to mapping the mixing dynamics of surface waters, we can estimate biogeochemical transformations by comparing multiple sensor outputs and applying conservative mixing models. We present apparent loss of riverine fDOM entering a eutrophic lake, effects of a constructed fringing wetland on solutes and nitrate cycling in a large river reach. This relatively simple platform uses sensors designed for the traditional fixed reference framework and will contribute to a new understanding of the spatial heterogeneity inherent in aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Few studies have examined long-term variations in the nutrients that cause lake eutrophication, namely total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP). As a result, little is known about the peaks/troughs and trends in TN and TP in lakes known to be vulnerable to eutrophication such as Lake Dongting, Lake Poyang, Lake Chao, and Lake Tai, all of which are located in the Yangtze River basin of China. The objectives of this study were therefore to: 1) detect possible step changes in nutrient time series data; and 2) elucidate TN and TP temporal trends at multiple (annual, seasonal, and monthly) time scales, as influenced by factors such as river-lake connectivity and lake hydrologic conditions (water depth and inflow source). The distribution-free cumulative sum technique and modified Mann-Kendall approach were applied to the long-term nutrient data measured for these four typical lakes and revealed that both TN and TP in Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang exhibited an upward trend at annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales, although they are oligotrophic lakes. The nutrient concentrations in Lake Dongting underwent a step change around 2003, which can be attributed to point and non-point source pollution, overexploitation, and dam construction. The TN values for Lake Chao and Lake Tai experienced step changes in 1999 and 2002, respectively. Before the step-change years, a significant (p-value < 0.05) upward trend in both TN and TP was detected for Lake Chao at the annual scale as well as in summer and May, but for Lake Tai this was manifested at the annual scale only. In contrast, after the step-change years, a significant downward trend was detected for both lakes at the corresponding time scales. As expected, the TN and TP concentrations in Lake Chao and Lake Tai, which are located in the lower basin of the Yangtze River, were noticeably higher than those in Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang, which are located in the middle basin.",

            "abstract": "Teachers provide foundational science experiences that spark interest in some students to pursue science and serve as an endpoint for others. For both groups, getting a glimpse into the culture of science is important to their futures as citizens, but this glimpse is not something all teachers are equipped to offer. Explicit instruction in the culture of science is generally not part of college-level science courses; to reach future teachers, it should be incorporated into the curriculum for pre-service teachers.\nI have incorporated readings from Visionlearning’s peer-reviewed, freely available, web-based Process of Science series (http://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/Process-of-Science/49) into my class for pre-service middle-level and secondary science teachers. The readings describe the development of the culture and process of science using deeply embedded examples of scientists and their work. Students reflected on each reading by describing what they learned and something they will use in their future teaching. Responses were graded for thoughtfulness and completeness and later compiled.\nIn general, students with more science courses had a better initial understanding of the culture of science and found the readings engaging stories that explained in more depth what they already knew. However, all students reported learning some fundamental aspects of the culture and nature of science. Most commonly, they learned scientific language, often words with both colloquial and scientific definitions: theory, hypothesis, law, uncertainty, error, confidence. Other learning gains were reported in defining the difference between scientific controversy and social controversy over science, interactions between historical events and the scientific enterprise, how much scientists work in groups and interact at meetings, and the role that funding plays in guiding research. On their own, students struggled to describe explicit ways to incorporate these concepts into their teaching, though many felt it was very important to do so. In follow-up discussions and activities, we developed strategies to promote bringing the culture of science explicitly into the middle-level and secondary science classroom. The readings gave them ideas and are a resource they and their students can continue to access.",

            "abstract": "The development of consistent, high quality time series of biogeochemical products from a single ocean color sensor is a difficult task that involves many aspects related to pre- and post-launch instrument calibration and characterization, stability monitoring and the removal of the contribution of the atmosphere which represents most of the signal measured at the sensor. It is even more challenging to build Climate Data Records (CDRs) or Earth Science Data Records (ESDRs) from multiple sensors as design, technology and methodologies (bands, spectral/spatial resolution, Cal/Val, algorithms) differ from sensor to sensor.\nNASA MEaSUREs, ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and IOCCG Virtual Constellation are some of the underway efforts that investigate or produce ocean color CDRs or ESDRs from the recent and current global missions (SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS). These studies look at key aspects of the development of unified data records from multiple sensors, e.g. the concatenation of the “best” individual records vs. the merging of multiple records or band homogenization vs. spectral diversity. The pros and cons of the different approaches are closely dependent upon the overall science purpose of the data record and its temporal resolution. While monthly data are generally adequate for biogeochemical modeling or to assess decadal trends, higher temporal resolution data records are required to look into changes in phenology or the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms. Similarly, short temporal resolution (daily to weekly) time series may benefit more from being built through the merging of data from multiple sensors while a simple concatenation of data from individual sensors might be better suited for longer temporal resolution (e.g. monthly time series).\nSeveral Ocean Color ESDRs were developed as part of the NASA MEaSUREs project. Some of these time series are built by merging the reflectance data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and Envisat-MERIS in a semi-analytical ocean color model that generates both merged reflectance and merged biogeochemical products. The benefits and limitations of this merging approach to develop ESDRs will be presented and discussed along with those of alternative approaches.",

First, idealized simulations with the Coupled Shallow Water model (CSW) are used to assess the sensitivity of internal-tide generation to horizontal resolution and vertical resolution (i.e., the number of vertical modes). Next, the dynamical effects of background conditions on internal-tide propagation and scattering are analyzed in realistic data-assimilating simulations of the Middle Atlantic Bight, which were conducted with the MSEAS primitive equation model. Lastly, we include linearized advection terms in CSW and simulate large-scale internal-tide interactions with the Gulf Stream in the western North Atlantic.

            "abstract": "The mechanics of partially molten regions of the mantle are not well understood--in part due to the inaccessibility of these regions to observation. However it is widely agreed that experiments performed on synthetic mantle rocks [e.g KZK10] act as a reasonable test of theoretical models of magma dynamics. One robust feature of experiments on partially molten mantle rocks deformed under strain is the emergence of high-porosity bands at an angle of between 15° and 20° to the shear plane.\nA number of theoretical approaches have been made to reproduce the formation of these low angle bands in models. The most recent approaches, for example by Takei and Katz [TK13], have involved the inclusion of anisotropic viscosity in diffusion creep arising from the grain-scale redistribution of melt as formulated in a theoretical model by Takei and Holtzman [TH09]. It is reasonable to assume that this melt-preferred orientation (MPO) that leads to anisotropy in viscosity may also lead to anisotropy in permeability. However, the effect of anisotropic permeability remains unexplored. We investigate its impact on the dynamics of partially molten rock, and specifically on its role in low-angle band formation in deformation under simple shear.\nWe work with the continuum model of two-phase-flow as formulated by McKenzie [M84] with the addition of anisotropic permeability. There are some apparent inconsistencies in this model. Firstly, the model predicts continued segregation of melt into bands of 100% porosity, while experiments report maximum porosities in the region of 30%. Secondly, linear stability analyses find maximal growth-rates for porosity perturbations that vary on arbitrarily small length-scales. We study how the inclusion of surface forces into the model could regulate these effects.\nREFERENCES:\nKZK10 = King, Zimmerman, & Kohlstedt (2010), J Pet, 10.1093/petrology/egp062.

            "abstract": "The Arctic region is composed of unique ecosystems that provide a range of goods and services to local and global populations. However, Arctic sea-ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, threatening many of these ecosystems and the services they provide. Yet as the ice melts and certain goods and services are lost, other resources such as oil and minerals will become accessible. The question is: how do the losses compare with the opportunities? And how are the losses and potential gains likely to be distributed?\nTo address these questions, this study provides a preliminary assessment of the quantity, distribution and economic value of the ecosystem services (ES) provided by Arctic ecosystems, both now and in the future given a scenario of sure climate change. Using biophysical and economic data from existing studies (and some primary data), preliminary estimates indicate that the Arctic currently provides $357m/yr (in 2014 US$) in subsistence hunting value to local communities, of which reindeer/caribou comprise 83%. Reindeer herding provides $110m/yr to Arctic communities. Interestingly, ‘non-use (existence/cultural) values’ associated with Arctic species are very high at ~$11bn/yr to members of Arctic states.\nThe Arctic also provides ES that accrue to the global community: oil resources (North Slope; ~$5bn profits in 2013), commercial fisheries (~$515mn/yr) and most importantly, climate regulation services. Recent models (Whiteman; Euskirchen) estimate that the loss of climate regulation services provided by Arctic ice will cost ~$200 - $500bn/yr, a value which dwarfs all others.\nAssuming no change in atmospheric temperature compared to 2014, the net present value of the Arctic by 2050 (1.4% discount rate) comes to over $9 trillion. However, given Wang and Overland (2009) predictions of ice-free summers by 2037, we expect many of these benefits will be lost. For example, it is fairly well-established that endemic species, such as polar bears, will decline with sea-ice melt. Estimation of such losses is ongoing for the present study.\nIncreased opportunities include oil and mineral extraction, and increased shipping. The economic values associated with these potential opportunities (including environmental and social costs) are currently being assessed for the present study.",

            "abstract": "The northern Sub-Saharan African region (NSSA) is an area of intense study due to the recent severe droughts that have dire consequences on the population, which relies mostly on rainfed agriculture for its food supply. This region’s weather and hydrologic cycle are very complex and are dependent on the West African Monsoon. Different regional processes affect the West African Monsoon cycle and variability. One of the areas of current investigation is the water cycle response to the variability of land surface characteristics. Land surface characteristics are often altered in NSSA due to agricultural practices, grazing, and the fires that occur during the dry season. To better understand the effects of biomass burning on the hydrologic cycle of the sub-Saharan environment, an interdisciplinary team sponsored by NASA is analyzing potential feedback mechanisms due to the fires. As part of this research, this study focuses on the effects of land surface changes, particularly albedo and skin temperature, that are influenced by biomass burning. Surface temperature anomalies can influence the initiation of convective rainfall and surface albedo is linked to the absorption of solar radiation. To capture the effects of fire perturbations on the land surface, NASA’s Unified Weather and Research Forecasting (NU-WRF) model coupled with NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) is being used to simulate some of the fire-induced surface temperature anomalies and other environmental processes. In this presentation, we will report the strategy for these simulations, and show some preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Land-use change (LUC) is known to impact local climate conditions through modifications of land-atmosphere interactions. Large-scale LUC, such as Amazon deforestation, could have a significant effect on the local and regional climates. The question remains as to what the global impact of large-scale LUC could be, as previous modeling studies have shown non-local responses due to Amazon deforestation. A common shortcoming in many previous modeling studies is the use of prescribed ocean conditions, which can act as a boundary condition to dampen the global response with respect to changes in the mean and variability.\nUsing fully coupled modeling simulations with the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.0, the Amazon rainforest has been replaced with a distribution of representative tropical crops. Through the modifications of local land-atmosphere interactions, a significant change in the region, both at the surface and throughout the atmosphere, can be quantified. Accompanying these local changes are significant changes to the atmospheric circulation across all scales, thus modifying regional climates in other locales. Notable impacts include significant changes in precipitation, surface fluxes, basin-wide sea surface temperatures and ENSO behavior.",

            "abstract": "Reversals and excursions of the geomagnetic field are recorded globally by sedimentary and volcanic rocks. These geodynamo instabilities provide a rich set of chronostratigraphic tie points for the Quaternary period that can provide tests of age models central to paleoclimate studies. Radioisotopic dating of volcanic rocks, mainly 40Ar/39Ar dating of lava flows, coupled with astronomically-dated deep sea sediments, reveals 10 polarity reversals and 27 field excursions during the Quaternary (Singer, 2014). A key question concerns the uncertainties associated with radioisotopic dates of those geodynamo instabilities that have been identified both in terrestrial volcanic rocks and in deep sea sediments. These particular features offer the highest confidence in linking 40Ar/39Ar dates to the global marine climate record. Geological issues aside, for rocks in which the build-up of 40Ar by decay of 40K may be overwhelmed by atmospheric 40Ar at the time of eruption, the uncertainty in 40Ar/39Ar dates derives from three sources: (1) analytical uncertainty associated with measurement of the isotopes; this is straightforward to estimate; (2) systematic uncertainties stemming from the age of standard minerals, such as the Fish Canyon sanidine, and in the 40K decay constant; and (3) systematic uncertainty introduced during analysis, mainly the size and reproducibility of procedural blanks. Whereas 1 and 2 control the precision of an age determination, 2 and 3 also control accuracy. In parallel with an astronomical calibration of 28.201 Ma for the Fish Canyon sanidine standard, awareness of the importance of procedural blanks, and a new generation multi-collector mass spectrometer capable of exceptionally low-blank and isobar-free analysis, are improving both accuracy and precision of 40Ar/39Ar dates. Results from lavas recording the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal, the Santa Rosa excursion, and the reversal at the top of the Cobb Mtn subchron demonstrate these advances. Current best ages for these instabilities are 777 ± 2, 932 ± 3, and 1189 ± 1 ka (±1σ), respectively. These ages, likely accurate and precise to better than ±0.3%, are identical to those determined from deep sea sediment cores for which high-resolution magnetostratigraphy and O isotope-based age models have been developed (Channell et al., 2010).",

            "abstract": "InSAR is a radar remote sensing technique that retrieves crustal deformation to mm/cm accuracies at m-scale resolution over 100 km wide regions. Here we address the imaging and characterization of transient events that are too subtle to be easily detected in interferogram time series. We show that it is possible to attain mm-level accuracy in temporal histories using small baseline subset analysis (SBAS) with certain constraints on spatial continuity and temporal variation.\nRadar interferogram accuracy is limited by changes in atmospheric phase delay due to variability in water vapor, leading to roughly 2 cm rms noise signals in the image. If a deformation source is continuous and produces the same signal over time, then we can “stack” many interferograms to visualize the signal. Since the atmospheric water vapor distribution changes over time, its noise averages out and the steady signal remains. The same approach will not work for transient events because a transient deformation is not steady with time and will not be reinforced when interferograms are averaged.\nWe illustrate our approach by studying the signature of a small earthquake and a slow slip event (SSE) that occurred over Kilauea volcano in Hawaii in 2010. We analyze data from the TerraSAR-X and Cosmo Skymed X-band radar systems, and show that we can image small events even when the size of the signal is smaller that the atmospheric noise. Our SBAS InSAR algorithm with constraints is suitable for extracting both transient and secular ground deformation on the order of millimeters in the presence of atmospheric noise on the order of centimeters. The small earthquake is readily imaged in both space and time, while for the 2010 SSE we obtain high spatial resolution displacement estimates as well as secular motion at Kilauea. We also develop an L1-norm based sparse reconstruction algorithm to detect transient events in very noisy InSAR time series for cases when the time of a possible transient event is not known. We apply the L1 algorithm to the 2010 Kilauea SSE and solve for the time of occurrence, confirming that the largest jump detected in the TerraSAR-X InSAR time series is temporally and spatially correlated with GPS observations.",

            "abstract": "We suggest a novel approach to asynchronous magnetic-variation profiling (MVP) data interpretation.\nStandard method in MVP is based on the interpretation of the coefficients of linear relation between vertical and horizontal components of the measured magnetic field.\nFrom mathematical point of view this pair of linear coefficients is not a vector which leads to significant difficulties in asynchronous data interpretation. Our approach allows us to actually treat such a pair of complex numbers as a special vector called an ellipse-vector (EV). By choosing the particular definitions of complex length and direction, the basic relation of MVP can be considered as the dot product. This considerably simplifies the interpretation of asynchronous data.\nThe EV is described by four real numbers: the values of major and minor semiaxes, the angular direction of the major semiaxis and the phase. The notation choice is motivated by historical reasons.\nIt is important that different EV's components have different sensitivity with respect to the field sources and the local heterogeneities. Namely, the value of major semiaxis and the angular direction are mostly determined by the field source and the normal cross-section. On the other hand, the value of minor semiaxis and the phase are responsive to local heterogeneities.\nSince the EV is the general form of complex vector, the traditional Schmucker vectors can be explicitly expressed through its components.\nThe proposed approach was successfully applied to interpretation the results of asynchronous measurements that had been obtained in the Arctic Ocean at the drift stations “North Pole” in 1962-1976.",

Erosion and matter transfer from the continent have been documented by different approaches, which include radiogenic isotopes and mineralogy of bulk samples and clay fraction. The Sr-Nd fingerprint of detrital sediments is an effective tool for discriminating between sediment sources. Mineralogical composition also depends on lithology of the source area and can provide insight on the environmental conditions at the time of deposition.\nεNd and 87Sr/86Sr from the detrital fraction in both cores show large changes linked to the Glacial-Interglacial transition, following the foraminifera δ18O data. The isotopic values evolved towards a lower volcanic contribution from the last glaciation to the Holocene with a more pronounced change in the Gulf of Aden and more volcanic values for the Red Sea.\nThe sediment mineralogy includes quartz, feldspar, muscovite, biotite, amphibole and pyroxene. Clay mineralogy is dominated by smectite and lesser amounts of illite and palygorskite. Correlation of percentage of smectite and Nd-Sr isotope composition agrees with a volcanic origin of smectite and shows a 2-pole mixture of sediment sources. The first end member is characterized by a large amount of smectite, positive values of εNd and a low 87Sr/86Sr ratio and was identified as Afar volcanic rocks. The second one with more negative values of εNd and a higher 87Sr/86Sr ratio is enriched in illite and palygorskite and was defined as originating from the Central Arabian region. Changes in sediment composition during the Glacial-Interglacial transition denote a variation in the relative proportions of both sources. They may be linked to a larger contribution of the Northwesterly winds during the Holocene than during the last glacial period, which affected the Gulf of Aden basin more than the Red Sea.",

In this paper, we present an overview of the RFProp on-orbit research and analysis effort with particular focus on an equatorial scintillation experiment called ESCINT. The 3-year ESCINT project is designed to characterize equatorial ionospheric scintillation in the upper HF and lower VHF portions of the radio spectrum (20 – 150 MHz). Both a 40 MHz continuous wave (CW) signal and 30 – 42 MHz swept frequency signal are transmitted to the satellite receiver suite from the Reagan Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands (8.7° N, 167.7° E) in four separate campaigns centered on the 2014 and 2015 equinoxes. Results from the first campaign conducted from April 22 – May 15, 2014 will be presented including (a) coherence bandwidth measurements over a full range of transmission frequencies and scintillation activity levels, (b) spread-Doppler clutter effects arising from preferential ray paths to the satellite due to refraction off of isolated density irregularities, and (c) supporting ray-trace simulations. The broadband nature of the measurements is found to offer unique insight into both the structure of ionospheric irregularities and their impact on HF/VHF trans-ionospheric radio wave propagation.",

However, the consequential sediment yield, due to altered precipitation and flow patterns into the reservoir has not been addressed in literature. Thus, this study answers the following question: “What is the combined impact of a modified PMP on PMF and sediment yield for an artificial reservoir? The Owyhee dam of Owyhee River watershed (ORW) in Oregon is selected as a case study area for understanding the impact of LULC change on PMF and sedimentation rates. Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) is used for simulating stream flow (PMF) and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate sediment yield over ORW as a result of change in precipitation intensity and LULC. Scenarios that represent pre-Owyhee dam (Pre-Dam) and post Owyhee dam (Non-Irrigation, Control, 1992, 2001, 2006) are used to simulate PMF’s and consequential sediment yield. Peak PMF result for Pre-Dam scenarios is found to increase by 26m3s-1 (1%) and 81m3s-1 (3%) from Non-Irrigation and Control scenario, respectively. Considering only LULC change, sediment yield decreased over ORW due to the transformation of LULC from grassland to shrubland (from Pre-Dam period to the post-Dam years). However, increase in precipitation intensity caused a significant (0.1% storage loss over 21days storm period) increase in sediment yield resulting in largely reservoir sedimentation. This study underscores the need to consider future impact of LULC change on IDF calculation as well as sedimentation rates for more robust reservoir operations and planning.",

One of the goals of IODP Expedition 352 is to test the supra-subduction zone ophiolite model by drilling forearc crust at the northern Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) system. IBM forearc drilling is expected to sample sediment, lavas, and dikes. We will compare seismic velocities and other physical properties with lava and dike composition and stratigraphy at the Expedition 352 sites, particularly focusing on changes across the lava-dike transition. The IBM forearc results will be compared with observations of intermediate-spreading and fast-spreading rate oceanic crust drilled at Sites 504B and 1256D. Specific questions that will be addressed include: 1) At Site 504B the seismic layer 2/3 boundary is located near the top of the dike unit, while at Site 1256D it is located near the top of the gabbro unit. Is the lava-dike boundary at Expedition 352 associated with a seismic boundary, and if so, is it equivalent to the seismic layer 2/3 boundary? 2) At Sites 504B and 1256D there is a correlation between seismic velocities, porosities, and the presence of hydrothermal minerals. Is there a similar correlation at the Expedition 352 sites?",

The first approach emphasizes the importance of magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail and has become the main stream. In the second approach, substorms are studied explicitly in terms of the power supply (dynamo), currents/circuits and dissipation (substorms). It is shown that as Alfven emphasized in as early as 1967, the second approach gives a much better understanding of substorms than the first one based on moving magnetic field lines. It is suggested also that the expansion phase onset occurs within 10 Re by other than magnetic reconnection. Substorm research provides many hints in dealing with rarefied plasmas, which are applicable in the solar corona and nebula.",

We present a novel coupled modeling approach for assessing the stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic, the controls on their growth and demise, and the downstream impact of leakage of water from these substantial water reservoirs. Our method utilizes GlaDS, a 2-D finite element hydrology model, with the capability for development of a coexisting distributed and efficient drainage system. To better constrain lake growth and drainage, along with the dynamic impact of the water reservoir, we locally couple the hydrology model to an ice flexure model. We are interested in constraining the change in local ice stresses due to the growth of lakes and assessing the triggers of rapid or slow lake drainage. These lake dynamic analyses contribute to our assessment of the role of lakes in basal hydrology, with a focus on ice streams, where we examine whether the drainage mechanisms have an impact on regional ice dynamics.

These measurements were taken as part of NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ campaign in July/August 2014. Measurements were made during simultaneous aircraft spirals over the lidar site as well as collocated ozonesonde launches. Ozone enhancement from local sources typically occurred in the mid-afternoon convection period, especially when there was light winds and low cloud cover. Interesting ozone profiles and time series data will be shown.\nCurrent atmospheric satellite instruments cannot peer through the optically thick stratospheric ozone layer to remotely sense boundary layer tropospheric ozone. In order to monitor this lower ozone more effectively, the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) has been developed, which currently consists of five stations across the US. Three of these lidars, including the GSFC TROPOZ DIAL, recorded measurements during the DISCOVER-AQ campaign.\n\nThe GSFC TROPOZ DIAL is based on the Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) technique, which currently detects two wavelengths, 289 and 299 nm. Ozone is absorbed more strongly at 289 nm than at 299 nm. The DIAL technique exploits this difference between the returned backscatter signals to obtain the ozone number density as a function of altitude. The transmitted wavelengths are generated by focusing the output of a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser beam (266 nm) into a pair of Raman cells, filled with high pressure hydrogen and deuterium. Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) within the focus generates a significant fraction of the pump energy at the first Stokes shift. With the knowledge of the ozone absorption coefficient at these two wavelengths, the range resolved number density can be derived.",

            "abstract": "Life in the Universe is dominated by microbes: they are numerically the most abundant cells in our bodies and in Earth’s biosphere, and they are the only life that might be present elsewhere in our solar system. Life beyond our solar system could include macroscopic organisms, but everything we understand about the origin of life suggests it must start with microbes. Thus, understanding microbial ecosystems, in the absence of macroscopic organisms, is critical to understanding early life on Earth and life elsewhere in the Universe – if it exists. But what are the general principles of microbial ecology in the absence of predation? What happens when each cell is a chemical factory that can swap among metabolic processes in response to environmental and emergent cues? Geobiologists and astrobiologists are addressing these questions in diverse ways using both Earth’s modern biosphere and its fossil record. Modern microbial communities in shallow, ice-covered lakes, Antarctica (Fig.), provide a model for high productivity microbial ecosystems with no to low predation. In these lakes, photosynthetic communities create macroscopic pinnacles and domes, sometime lithified into stromatolites. They provide an ecological, geochemical and morphological model for Precambrian microbial communities in low sedimentation, low current environments. Insights from these communities include new growth processes for ancient mats, especially some that grew prior to the oxidation of Earth’s atmosphere. The diversity of biosignatures created in these communities also provides context for models of life under ice elsewhere in our solar system such as paleolakes on Mars and on icy moons. Results from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) team document formerly habitable fluvial and lacustrine environments. Lacustrine environments, in particular, are favorable for preserving biosignatures, and continued investigations by MSL will provide a deeper understanding of the duration of habitable environments and the preservation potential of biosignatures in those environments. A specific search for evidence of microbial ecosystems is warranted, but investigation of old sedimentary rocks on Earth demonstrates that biosignature preservation is rare.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind interaction with earths’s magnetosphere begins well ahead of the magnetopause when the solar wind encounters the foreshock, bow shock and magnetosheath. In these regions a variety of waves and magnetic structures exist and modify the solar wind. The foreshock is permeated by a variety of ultra low frequency (ULF) waves and magnetic transient structures such as shocklets, SLAMs, and cavitons. These structures are very compressive and are generated by the solar wind interaction with backstreaming particles plus non linear processes. Other structures such as hot flow anomalies (HFA), and spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFA) can also exist in the foreshock. HFAs are generated by discontinuities that arrive to the bow shock. Recent studies show that SHFA have the same profiles as HFA, but form by the interaction of foreshock cavitons with the bowshock. Foreshock bubbles can form when energetic ions upstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock interact with rotational discontinuities in the solar wind. All these structures can merge with the bow shock and be convected into the magnetosheath. The magnetosheath is both a place for rich plasma physical processes and a filter between solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma and magnetic field environments. It is permeated by the superposition of upstream convected structures plus locally generated waves (ion cyclotron and mirror mode). Recent studies have shown that jets and magnetosheath filamentary structures (MFS) can be observed downstream from the bow shock. Jets are associated to shock rippling efects and MFS to acceleration of particles at and near the shock. Due to the presence of the foreshock, bow shock and magnetosheath transients, the solar wind arriving to the magnetopause is very different to the pristine solar wind. In this talk we will address the main characteristics of these transients, discuss their origin, and how they can modify the solar wind, the bow shock, the magnetosheath and the magnetopause.",

For all types of BB, progress has been limited by a lack of information on the emissions of semi-volatile organic gases that are precursors for secondary aerosol and ozone. During the Fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4), the BB emissions from 158 laboratory fires were quantified by ~40 scientists for an assortment of globally relevant fuels including rarely sampled sources such as US and Asian crop residue; Indonesian and extratropical peat; and cooking fires in traditional and advanced stoves. In this work, we present the primary emissions of gas-phase non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) measured using an advanced Proton-Transfer-Reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) in tandem with measurements of other major emissions by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We developed a composition and mass dependent sensitivity and best assignments for many observed peaks. The known and tentatively assigned peaks together account for ~80-96% of total observed NMOC mass. Much of the NMOC mass is rarely measured or previously unmeasured high molecular mass compounds including ringed aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds, and furans, which are all secondary organic aerosol precursors. Large air quality benefits are demonstrated for more advanced cooking technologies. This work produced globally relevant emission ratios and emission factors to better represent biomass burning in current atmospheric models.",

The combination of high velocities, high bulk densities (due to particles in the current) and high temperatures make PDCs the most dangerous and deadly hazard associated with explosive volcanism. Secondary explosive phenomenon associated with PDCs, such as inland-directed surges (e.g., Montserrat, 2003) and phreatic explosions (e.g., Mt St Helens 1980) can increase the area affected and duration of the hazard. However, little work has been done on distinguishing the deposits of secondary explosive phenomenon from primary phenomenon. Samples have been acquired from the 1980 Mt St Helens phreatic explosion crater deposits and the 2003 eruptive event at Montserrat where a PDC flowed into the ocean, causing an inland-directed surge (Edmonds and Herd, 2005. Geology 33.4:245-248). The samples will be analyzed via depositional characteristics, granulometry, componentry, microscopic analysis and scanning electron microscope imaging. We hypothesize that thermal cracking or vesicle distortion (e.g., compression or hindered expansion) may occur in hot pyroclasts that enter a body of water, leading to a difference between the ash textures of primary PDCs, phreatic surges and inland-directed surge deposits. Analyzing granulometry and componentry from parent flows and secondary flows may also reveal distinguishing characteristics that will allow us to constrain differences in segregation mechanisms of particles for each phenomenon. Determining distinguishing depositional characteristics of these secondary phenomena is important for assessing their occurrence during past eruptions and identifying conditions conducive to the formation of secondary explosions. This will result in the ability to make more accurate hazard maps for volcanoes prone to explosive activity.",

Even a simple classification of the concepts using the parent-child hierarchies enables analyses by association, thus bringing a greater insight in the data.\nOntology specifications have been put to many uses in space physics, primarily to harmonize data analysis across multiple data resources and thus facilitate interoperability. Among the multitude of ontology writeups, the SPASE data model stands out as a prominent, highly detailed collection of keywords for heliophysics. We will present an ontology design that draws its strengths from SPASE and further enhances it with a greater structural organization of the keyword vocabularies, in particular related to wave phenomena, as well as describes a variety of events and activities in the Sun-Earth system beyond the quiet-time behaviour.\nThe new ontology is being developed for the Near Earth Space Data Infrastructure for e-Science (ESPAS) project funded by the 7th European Framework, whose data model is based on a suite of ISO 19156 standards for Observations and Measurements (O&M). The O&M structure and language have driven the ESPAS ontology organization, with the Observed Property vocabulary as its cornerstone. The ontology development has progressed beyond the O&M framework to include domain-specific components required to describe the space physics concepts in a dictionary-controlled, unambiguous manner. Not surprisingly, wave phenomena and events presented the greatest challenge to the ESPAS ontology team as they demanded characterization of processes involved in the wave generation, propagation, modification, and reception, as well as the propagation medium itself. One of the notable outcomes of this effort is the ability of the new ontology schema to accommodate and categorize, for example, the URSI standard ionospheric characteristics such as the O-wave critical frequency of the F2 layer, foF2.\n\nThe efforts are underway to interface new ontology definitions with similar designs in other e-Science projects.",

Addressing this problem with present day models through improvements in computing power via Moore's law (giving a doubling of resolution in each direction every six years for three-dimensional problems) will produce slow advances at best. Advances may also occur through new model development and associated simulations utilizing extreme parameter values in an asymptotic manner. Such an approach will require a body of knowledge gained from large-scale direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments that explore the nature of extreme values in controlled settings.\nIn this talk I will present and discuss results obtained from simulations of the asymptotic PDEs relevant for rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection. A particular strength of the reduced model PDE's is that they filter fast inertial waves and relax the need to resolve thin viscous (Ekman) boundary layers. This approach identifies four distinct flow morphologies (cellular convection, convective Taylor columns, plume convection and geostrophic turbulence) that remain challenging for laboratory experiments and DNS to capture in its entirety. Despite this challenge experiments and DNS offer an important benchmark for validation of the asymptotic theory. In comparison with laboratory experiments and DNS we show that the asymptotic model provides a good description of the fluid interior. However, in the presence of no-slip boundaries it is demonstrated that Ekman boundary layers can destabilize thermal boundary layers and result in significant enhancement in heat transport throughout the layer. We argue that this always occurs at some point on the rotationally constrained branch of thermal convection and thus of potential importance to geophysical and astrophysical scenarios. We show that the effect of Ekman pumping may be captured by classical pumping boundary conditions and again eliminates the need to resolve the Ekman boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was organized to encourage countries to take action to address issues of declining biodiversity. In2010, the CBD identified specific goals for 2011-2020 (the “Aichi Targets”) and a tiered system of indicators necessary to achieve those targets. Essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) are the standardized measurements and observations at the base of this system; they are the basic level of information that is necessary to calculate these indicators. By providing a list of pre-defined EBVs, existing research and research planned for the future can align measurements to address common questions.\nWe assessed the applicability of phenology EBVs for standardizing measurements across observation networks within the US as a test case for use of the standardized used of EBVs. Phenology products from the USA National Phenology Network, a citizen science observer based program, NEON, a multi-scale ecological observatory, and remotely sensed data from USGS EROS were considered for this purpose.\nEssential Biodiversity Variables currently defined for phenology are insufficient to support consistent measurement across monitoring networks. Specifically, phenology which is a field of study, is currently listed as a single EBV within the general category of ‘species traits’. With the only guidance provided to future observation networks being that of measuring ‘phenology,’ there would likely be as many approaches to achieving this goal as networks participating. We propose more narrowly defined variables which may be more appropriate for standardization and demonstrate how these measurements satisfy the basic characteristics of an EBV in that they are relevant, sensitive to change, biological and generalizable, scalable, feasible, stable and, represent state variables. We map these variables to the tiered indicators identified by the CBD and, finally, to Aichi Targets to which they contribute.\nEBVs may be used not only to align measurements from different research projects but also to facilitate coordination between projects working at different scales; our framework provides a model that may be applied at a global scale.",

SPTW is characterized by a vertical salinity maximum exceeding 36.2 psu centered at 20°S and 120°W and lying in the upper thermocline between 24.0 and 25.0 σθ. Subduction rates for SPTW for two different periods are calculated using two methods. Monthly one degree by one degree Argo data covering the South Pacific are used to calculate subduction rates from September 2005 to August 2013, also lateral induction and vertical pumping are calculated. There are two spatial subduction maxima, and the lateral induction process dominates in both maxima. Subduction rates from Argo data vary from 15 to 26 m/yr +/- 7.5% during the 8 year period. Subduction rates are shown to be positively and highly correlated with Southern Oscillation Index. Additionally, using CFC-12 data from the 1990s World Ocean Circulation Experiment, average subduction rate is calculated to be 35 +/- 16.5 m/yr. Some of the difference between Argo and tracer rates is due to a difference in the methods, and some difference may be due to decadal variability. Thus, SPTW subduction rates are shown to vary on interannual and possible decadal time scales.",

            "abstract": "Water uptake and retention by trees affects their ability to cope with drought, as well as influences ground water recharge and stream flow. Historically, water has not often been limiting in Eastern U.S. forests. As a result, very little work has been done to understand the basics of timing of water use by vegetation in these systems. As droughts are projected to increase in length and severity in future decades, this focus is increasingly important, particularly for informing hydrologic models.\nWe used deuterium tracer and sap flux techniques to study tree water transport on a forested ridge top with shallow soil in central Pennsylvania. Three trees of each of the species, Acer saccharum, Carya tomentosa, Quercus prinus, and Quercus rubrum were accessed by tree climbing and scaffolding towers. We hypothesized that contrasting vessel size of the tree species would affect the efficiency of water transport (tracer velocity) and contrasting tree size would affect tracer storage as estimated by tracer residence times.\nTrees were injected with deuterated water in July 2012. Leaves were sampled 15 times over 35 days, initially daily for the first week, then at regular intervals afterwards. The tracer arrived in the canopy of the study trees between 1 and 7 days after injection, traveling at a velocity of 2 to 19 m d-1. The tracer residence time was between 7 and 33 days. Although there was variation in tracer velocity and residence time in individual trees, there were no significant differences among wood types or species (P>0.05). The general patterns in timing of water use were similar to other studies on angiosperm trees in tropical and arid ecosystems. There was no evidence of longer residence times in the larger trees. Sap flux-based estimates of sap velocity were much lower than tracer estimates, which was consistent with other studies. Levels of sap flux and midday water potential measurements suggested that the trees were water-stressed.\nWe observed relatively rapid water uptake and tree water storage limited to about a month in duration. These findings are necessary for modeling of hydrologic parameters that are influenced by tree water age. They also indicate that trees on shallow soil in this catchment may be at risk if droughts lasting over a month occur more frequently in future years.",

This study presents a detailed climatological analysis of the optical, microphysical aerosol properties and absorption aerosol characteristics over four different regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using satellite and ground stations data including MODIS/Terra and Aqua, OMI, MISR/Terra, AERONET and CALIPSO for the period April 2003 – January 2013. Analysis shows an increase in the aerosol concentration during March 2009 which could be attributed to a Major dust storm during that time. Comparing the AOD time series over regions 1-3 and region 4 (desert) we observe monthly and annual variability with no recurrence pattern over the years. The results also show minimum precipitation rates during the summer and maximum during the winter over region 3. The Aqua deep blue AOD550 data over region 4 shows a single peak pattern that occurs during the spring season around the dust season. Aeronet observations at 440 nm show maxima of 0.71 in July and a minimum of 0.27 in March from MASDAR and maxima of 0.08 in November and a minimum of 0.05 in August from Solar Village. The non-spherical particles are significantly higher in the spring than the rest of the year based on MISR data. The AOD of non-spherical particles reaches a maximum in June with a value of ~ 0.3517±0.01. The maximum of the spherical fraction AOD occurs in July with a value of ~ 0.4867±0.01.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), for funding this work through project no.

The 1,100-km coastline of the Pacific coast of North America has tectonic and geological settings similar to Sumatra and Japan. The geological records unambiguously show that the Cascadia fault had caused devastating tsunamis in the past and this geological process will cause tsunamis in the future.\nExisting observational instruments along the Cascadia Subduction Zone are capable of providing tsunami data within minutes of tsunami generation. However, this strategy requires separation of the tsunami signals from the overwhelming high-frequency seismic waves produced during a strong earthquake- a real technical challenge for existing operational tsunami observational network. A new-generation of nano-resolution pressure sensors can provide high temporal resolution of the earthquake and tsunami signals without loosing precision. The nano-resolution pressure sensor offers a state-of the-science ability to separate earthquake vibrations and other oceanic noise from tsunami waveforms, paving the way for accurate, early warnings of local tsunamis. This breakthrough underwater technology has been tested and verified for a couple of micro-tsunami events (Paros et al., 2011).\nReal-time forecast of Cascadia tsunamis is becoming a possibility with the development of nano-tsunameter technology. The present study provides an investigation on optimizing the placement of these new sensors so that the forecast time can be shortened..\nThe presentation will cover the optimization of an observational array to quickly detect and forecast a tsunami generated by a strong Cascadia earthquake, including short and long rupture scenarios. Lessons learned from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami will be examined to demonstrate how we can improve the local forecast using the new technology\nWe expect this study to provide useful guideline for future siting and deployment of the new-generation tsunameters. Driven by the new technology, we demonstrate scenarios of real-time forecast of Cascadia tsunami impact along the Pacific Northwest, as well as in the Puget Sound.",

The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects Subcommittee is completing a chapter for the 2016 edition of ASCE/SEI 7 Standard. Chapter 6, Tsunami Loads and Effects, would become the first national tsunami design provisions. These provisions will apply to essential facilities and critical infrastructure. This standard for tsunami loads and effects will apply to designs as part of the tsunami preparedness. The provisions will have significance as the post-tsunami recovery tool, to plan and evaluate for reconstruction.\nMaps of 2,500-year probabilistic tsunami inundation for Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii need to be developed for use with the ASCE design provisions. These new tsunami design zone maps will define the coastal zones where structures of greater importance would be designed for tsunami resistance and community resilience.\nThe NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) has developed 75 tsunami inundation models as part of the operational tsunami model forecast capability for the U.S. coastline. NCTR, UW, and URS are collaborating with ASCE to develop the 2,500-year tsunami design maps for the Pacific states using these tsunami models. This ensures the probabilistic criteria are established in ASCE’s tsunami design maps.\nURS established a Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment approach consisting of a large amount of tsunami scenarios that include both epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability (Thio et al., 2010). Their study provides 2,500-year offshore tsunami heights at the 100-m water depth, along with the disaggregated earthquake sources. NOAA’s tsunami models are used to identify a group of sources that produce these 2,500-year tsunami heights. The tsunami inundation limits and runup heights derived from these sources establish the tsunami design map for the study site. ASCE’s Energy Grad Line Analysis then uses these modeling constraints to derive hydrodynamic forces for structures within the tsunami design zone.\nThe probabilistic tsunami design maps will be validated by comparison to state inundation maps under the coordination of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.",

AIRS Version-6 monthly mean level-3 products have been generated on a one degree by one degree spatial scale for the 12 year period September 2002 through August 2014. AIRS Version-6 products are significantly improved over those obtained previously. Among the products retrieved from AIRS radiance observations are: surface skin temperature and atmospheric temperature profile; atmospheric water vapor profile; cloud top pressure; and longwave radiative effective cloud fraction. Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) is subsequently generated via radiative transfer calculations so as to be consistent with the other products retrieved from AIRS.\nIn this presentation, we will show AIRS Version-6 area weighted anomaly time series over the time period September 2002 through August 2014 of atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles as a function of height. These anomaly time series show very different behaviors in the stratosphere and in the troposphere. Tropical mean stratospheric temperature anomaly time series are very strongly influenced by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) with large anomalies that propagate downward from 1 mb to 100 mb with a period of about two years. AIRS stratospheric temperature anomalies are in good agreement with those obtained by MLS over a common period. Tropical mean tropospheric temperature profile anomalies appear to be totally disconnected from those of the stratosphere and closely follow El Niño/ La Niña activity.\nMost of this presentation will concentrate on the spatial distributions of short term 12 year “trends” of the anomaly time series of tropospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, cloud cover, and OLR, and the correlations of these anomaly time series with the El Niño Index, which we call ENCs. The spatial distributions of these ENCs explain the close connection between anomalies of global mean, and especially tropical mean, mid-tropospheric temperature and water vapor concentrations with the El Niño Index. They also explain why global mean, and especially tropical mean, values of OLR, as depicted by both AIRS and CERES, also are closely related to El Niño activity.",

The RRSM significantly differs from traditional earthquake strong motion dissemination in Europe, which has focused on providing reviewed, processed strong motion parameters, typically with significant delays. As the RRSM provides rapid open access to raw waveform data and metadata and does not rely on external manual waveform processing, RRSM information is tailored to seismologists and strong-motion data analysts, earthquake and geotechnical engineers, international earthquake response agencies and the educated general public. Access to the RRSM database is via a portal at\nhttp://www.orfeus-eu.org/rrsm/\nthat allows users to query earthquake information, peak ground motion parameters and amplitudes of spectral response; and to select and download earthquake waveforms. All information is available within minutes of any earthquake with magnitude ≥ 3.5 occurring in the Euro-Mediterranean region. Waveform processing and database population are performed using the waveform processing module scwfparam, which is integrated in SeisComP3 (SC3;\nhttp://www.seiscomp3.org/\n). Earthquake information is provided by the EMSC (http://www.emsc-csem.org/) and all the seismic waveform data is accessed at the European Integrated waveform Data Archive (EIDA) at ORFEUS (\nhttp://www.orfeus-eu.org/index.html\n), where all on-scale data is used in the fully automated processing. As the EIDA community is continually growing, the already significant number of strong motion stations is also increasing and the importance of this product is expected to also increase. Real-time RRSM processing started in June 2014, while past events have been processed in order to provide a complete database back to 2005.",

In this talk, we discuss two numerical models under development that will simulate the evolution of active regions and the buildup of magnetic energy that leads to filament eruptions and CMEs. The first model, the so called regional model simulates the area of an active region in a domain that extends from just above the photosphere at its base to a height of 100 Mm in the low corona. The physics of this model is extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which includes such physical processes as field aligned heat conduction, radiative losses, and tabular equation of state that allow for a self-consistent treatment of the atmosphere including the transition region. For this model, boundary conditions for the magnetic field fields are specified directly from HMI vector magnetogram observations. The second model addresses the buoyant rise of magnetic flux from the convection zone through the photosphere to allow for the self consistent formation and evolution of active regions that leads to the buildup of magnetic free energy. We compare results from this second model to SDO/HMI observations of the 7 January 2014 events to show that the simulation has captured the basic physics of magnetic field evolution an energy build up necessary for large-scale eruptions.",

Tomographic inversion shows a well resolved,\nnear vertical, high Vp/Vs anomaly directly beneath Uturuncu that correlates well with a\ndisruption in the receiver function results; which is inferred to be a magmatic intrusion causing a\nlocal thickening of the APMB. Preliminary results at Lazufre show the top of a low velocity\nzone around 5-10 km b.s.l with a thickness of 15-30 km.",

            "abstract": "Glacierized basins in high-altitude and mountainous areas, such as the Himalayas, have seen an increase in the number of glacial lakes over the years as a result of a changing climate. As the meltwater becomes more prevalent, the runoff can accumulate in a depression left behind by the receding glacier and can be bound by the walls of frontal and lateral moraines. These moraines, however, often are comprised of loose, unconsolidated sediment and can prove to be unstable dam structures for proglacial lakes. The factor of instability associated with the moraines poses a serious threat for failure and severe flooding. If the moraines were to be breached by the lake water, a phenomenon known as a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) can occur, potentially putting lives and infrastructure in harm’s way. Consequently, this study examines the likelihood of a GLOF occurrence by analyzing potential trigger mechanisms associated with three proglacial lakes in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Using ASTER satellite imagery, one lake from Nepal, India, and Bhutan have each been assessed for possible trigger mechanisms. Our results suggest that steep-sided moraines, rugged topography, unstable masses on the upper reaches of steep slopes, and smaller lakes perched high above can all be classified as possible trigger mechanisms for the areas of study. It is imperative to be able to successfully identify potential trigger mechanisms using satellite data so that further ground observations can be made and mitigation efforts can be incorporated where needed. As lakes continue to grow, so does the cause for concern for possible GLOFs. Glacial lake outburst floods are being studied more extensively now due to the greater number of glacial lakes in high-mountainous areas. It is vitally important to understand the dynamics of a GLOF, especially the potential trigger mechanisms associated with it.",

            "abstract": "A widely used runoff generation model is the simple linear model (SLM), which is built on the concept of converting the precipitation to storm runoff by a convolution integral with response function involving a memory span. SLM and its various modifications use rainfall as a sole driver. In this study, we propose to incorporate potential evapotranspiration (PET) as a secondary factor with a separate response function in addition to the main precipitation driver, which we called two-variable linear model (TVLM). The performance of the TVLM is evaluated against the observed data from several catchments in the Poyang Lake Basin in China. In addition, we also estimate the impact of climate variability on the catchment runoff by the TVLM. We demonstrated that incorporating PET improves model performance with the same memory span in the precipitation response function. The precipitation response function is not affected by the addition of PET memory, which indicates that the PET term is indeed a secondary correction factor. The response function of precipitation is always positive, while the response function of PET is mostly negative. The annual runoff results from the SLM are always slightly higher than those from the TVLM, which is attributed to the negative effects of PET on runoff. Similar to the SLM, the proposed TVLM is also based on the linear response concept and can be considered as an extended and improved representation of runoff generation mechanism.",

Here we consider numerical studies to track the propagation of the internal tide onto this slope and its dissipation. We find a strong interference patterns sets up, as expected from a reflecting tide. The pattern is complicated by the ``Tasman Rise'' positioned near the center of the incoming internal tide beam, causing a diffraction pattern to focus and defocus the tide along the slope.

However, arbitrary truncations in the Galerkin method commonly used to derive LOMs can lead to systems that lack fundamental physical properties, such as energy conservation in the dissipationless limit. The presentation will address this problem by constructing efficient LOMs as coupled 3-mode nonlinear dynamical systems known in mechanics as Volterra gyrostats. Such systems guarantee energy conservation in the dissipationless limit, and their modular nature allows the creation of new LOMs through the addition or removal of gyrostats in existing models (resulting in, for example, Hamiltonian LOMs). In fact, all physically sound models that have appeared in recent publications can be written as coupled gyrostats. These and new LOMs developed by the authors will be discussed in the talk, suggesting that coupled gyrostats may offer a general framework for developing efficient LOMs for atmospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "A long-standing goal in snow hydrology has been to map snow cover in detail, either mapping snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) with sub-meter resolution. Airborne LiDAR and air photogrammetry have been used successfully for this purpose, but both require significant investments in equipment and substantial processing effort. Here we detail a relatively inexpensive and simple airborne photogrammetric technique that can be used to measure snow depth. The main airborne hardware consists of a consumer-grade digital camera attached to a survey-quality, dual-frequency GPS. Photogrammetric processing is done using commercially available Structure from Motion (SfM) software that does not require ground control points. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are made from snow-free acquisitions in the summer and snow-covered acquisitions in winter, and the maps are then differenced to arrive at snow thickness. We tested the accuracy and precision of snow depths measured using this system through 1) a comparison with airborne scanning LiDAR, 2) a comparison of results from two independent and slightly different photogrameteric systems, and 3) comparison to extensive on-the-ground measured snow depths. Vertical accuracy and precision are on the order of +/-30 cm and +/- 8 cm, respectively. The accuracy can be made to approach that of the precision if suitable snow-free ground control points exists and are used to co-register summer to winter DEM maps. Final snow depth accuracy from our series of tests was on the order of ±15 cm. This photogrammetric method substantially lowers the economic and expertise barriers to entry for mapping snow.",

            "abstract": "Tundra snow (exclusive of drifts) tends to be a thin veneer (<1 m) modified by extensive aeolian features like dunes and barchans. These features are on the order of 0.2 to 1.0 m high, and the substrate beneath the veneer snow (often various types of tundra) can have similar local relief. Consequently, veneer snow depths exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Lateral variations of depth as high as 50% or more can be observed over a few meters. Even greater depth variations occur where the topography creates traps that hold drifts as thick as 5 m. We have been measuring and modeling the tundra snow in a nested series of basins ranging from 1 to 200 km in northern Alaska for 30 years. These efforts show that while modeling can produce reasonably accurate simulations of the deeper drifts, in many cases it does not do a good job in capturing the more subtle aspects of the snow distribution, being hampered by limited precipitation and wind data. More accurate and detailed patterns of snow distribution can be revealed through direct measurement or through melt period sequential imagery. These can improve the accuracy of weather-driven model depth distributions, but producing pattern maps remains labor- and time-intensive. Both approaches tend to do poorly at scales of 100-m or less where surface features like sastrugi and dunes alter the snow depth. These small-scale variations in depth and snow water equivalent might not seem important, but comparison of point values of snow depth from observing stations with spatial maps of the snow surrounding the stations suggests that significant differences can exist. A more comprehensive understanding of drifting and drift features is needed in order to improve our ability to model and understand this dynamic and fascinating class of snow.",

            "abstract": "Formation of aerosol from organic compounds is under investigation in order to better predict the overall radiative forcing from atmospheric aerosols and their influence on global climate. One possible formation pathway for secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which is now becoming more widely accepted, is from bulk aqueous photoreactions in atmospheric particles that create low volatility compounds. These products may remain particulate upon droplet evaporation, increasing SOA mass in the atmosphere. SOA formed in this manner may account for some of the discrepancy between measured and predicted amounts of SOA.\nThis presentation will describe the photochemistry of pyruvic acid, an α-keto acid found in the atmosphere, in aqueous solutions representative of solutes in fogs, clouds, and wet aerosols. Solvation of pyruvic acid in water changes the photodissociation mechanism and products from that of the gas phase. The photoproducts from the aqueous phase are higher in molecular weight and therefore possible SOA precursors. Further, these polymers partition to the surface of water and are expected to modify the the surface properties of atmospheric aerosols that determine the kinetics of water uptake. The reaction mechanism of pyruvic acid as a function of its environment and concentration will be presented along with the kinetics obtained for the photochemistry in aqueous solution. These results are used as input in an atmospheric model to evaluate the atmospheric consequences of solvation of pyruvic acid on its atmospheric reactivity and its role as a global sink.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire can have profound effects on the hydrologic response of a watershed, and debris-flow activity is among the most destructive consequences of these effects. The continued high likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in the western U. S. and the encroachment of development into fire-prone areas have created the need to develop tools to identify and quantify the potential hazards posed by debris flows generated from burned watersheds. These tools are critically needed by Federal, State, and local agencies to mitigate the impacts of debris flows on people, their property, infrastructure and natural resources. Applied research at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landslide Hazards Program is focused on providing timely, science-based assessments of post-fire debris-flow hazard.\nFormerly, post-fire debris-flow hazard assessments were disseminated by means of the USGS Open-File Report publication series, which included poster-sized maps that predicted the probability, volume, and combined hazard for given watersheds. Feedback from collaborators suggested that 1) the reports were not sufficiently timely for immediate post-fire use, 2) the static maps were difficult to use for site-specific assessments, and 3) individual assessments were often cost-prohibitive. Beginning in January 2014, the USGS has transitioned to a web-based method for disseminating post-fire debris-flow hazard assessments. This new platform addresses the primary concerns of our stakeholders in three ways. First, the turnaround time has been reduced from 1-2 months for a map and written report, to 3-4 days for a web-based map assessment. This allows response teams to incorporate the assessment results into their reports, which are urgently needed immediately after fires. Second, the new website is interactive and accompanied by downloadable geospatial data of predictions for several storm scenarios. These features permit casual (local residents) and power-users (GIS experts) to evaluate site-specific debris-flow hazards. Finally, the new web-based assessments are completely free and publicly available online. This new method for assessment dissemination permits the Landslide Hazards Program to focus energies on improving existing predictive models of post-fire debris-flow probability, magnitude and timing.",

These differences arise from differences in the simulation of multiple factors, including differences in emissions of aerosols and precursor gases, the efficiency of the production of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) from the emissions, the sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration to increases in CCN concentration, the sensitivity of cloud optical depth to increases in droplet number concentration, and the sensitivity of the planetary energy balance to changes in the cloud optical depth. The relative contributions of each of these factors to uncertainty in the estimated ERFaci have not been quantified. We have decomposed the ERFaci simulated by a variety of global aerosol models into these factors. We find that much of the uncertainty ERFaci is due to uncertainty in the response of droplet number to anthropogenic changes in CCN concentration and in the response of cloud liquid water path to changes in droplet number concentration. We will show examples of how observations can be used to constrain simulated values of each of the factors.",

            "abstract": "Several studies indicate that sea level oscillated during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, but the details of these scenarios, including the number of sea level oscillations, are still debated. We lack a detailed understanding of the sensitivity of the large polar ice sheets to changes in temperature that could result in eustatic sea level oscillations. Because the Seychelles are located far from the margins of the Last Glacial Maximum northern hemisphere ice sheets, they have not been subjected to glacial isostatic adjustment, and have been tectonically stable since the Last Interglacial period; therefore, they provide a robust record of eustatic sea level during MIS 5e. All of the outcrops we examined contain unconformities and/or sharp transitions between facies, though the nature of these boundaries varies between sites. In some outcrops we observed a hardground comprising fine-grained, mollusc-rich sediment layer between distinct generations of in situ coralgal framework. In one outcrop, this succession was observed twice, where two generations of reef growth were each capped by a strongly indurated fine-grained, mollusc-rich sediment layer. At the site with the greatest vertical extent of outcrop, there is a marked difference in the taxonomic composition of the coral community above and below an unconformable surface, but the indurated fine-grained, sediment layer observed elsewhere was absent. Most of the other outcrops we studied contained a common succession of facies from in situ reef units overlain by cemented coral rubble. In two dated outcrops, the age of corals above and below the rubble layer are the same age. The hardgrounds and rubble layers may represent ephemeral exposure of the reef units during two drops in sea level. The inference of multiple meter-scale oscillations during the MIS 5e highstand indicates a more dynamic cryosphere than the present interglacial, although the climatic threshold for more volatile polar ice sheets is not yet clear.",

            "abstract": "Faced with increasing anthropogenic stressors and diverse stakeholders, local managers are adopting a ridge-to-reef and multi-objective management approach to restore declining coral reef health state. An ecosystem services framework, which integrates ecological indicators and stakeholder values, can foster more applied and integrated research, data collection, and modeling, and thus better inform the decision-making process and realize decision outcomes grounded in stakeholders’ values. Here, we describe a research program that (i) leverages remotely sensed and empirical data to build an ecosystem services-based decision-support tool geared towards ridge-to-reef management; and (ii) applies it as part of a structured, value-based decision-making process to inform management in west Maui, a NOAA coral reef conservation priority site. The tool links terrestrial and marine biophysical models in a spatially explicit manner to quantify and map changes in ecosystem services delivery resulting from management actions, projected climate change impacts, and adaptive responses. We couple model outputs with localized valuation studies to translate ecosystem service outcomes into benefits and their associated socio-cultural and/or economic values. Managers can use this tool to run scenarios during their deliberations to evaluate trade-offs, cost-effectiveness, and equity implications of proposed policies. Ultimately, this research program aims at improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity outcomes of ecosystem-based management. This presentation will describe our approach, summarize initial results from the terrestrial modeling and economic valuations for west Maui, and highlight how this decision support tool benefits managers in west Maui.",

            "abstract": "Human societies have become a geologic agent of change, and with this is an increasing awareness of the environment risks that confront human activities and values. More frequent and extreme hydroclimate events, anomalous tropical cyclone seasons, heat waves and droughts have all been documented, and many rigorously attributed to fossil fuel emissions (e.g. DeGaetano 2009; Hoyos et al. 2006). These extremes, however, do not register themselves in the abstract – they occur in particular places, affecting particular populations and ecosystems (Turner et al. 2003). This can be considered to present a policy window to decrease vulnerability and enhance emergency management. However, the asymmetrical character of these events may lead some to treat remote areas or disenfranchised populations as capable of absorbing the environmental damage attributable to the collective behavior of those residing in wealthy, populous, industrialized societies (Young 1989).\nSound policies for adaptation to changing extremes must take into account the multiple interests and resource constraints for the populations affected and their broader contexts. Minimizing vulnerability to weather extremes is only one of many interests in human societies, and as noted, this interest competes with the others for limited time, attention, funds and other resources. Progress in reducing vulnerability also depends on policy that integrates the best available local and scientific knowledge and experience elsewhere. This improves the chance that each policy will succeed, but there are no guarantees. Each policy must be recognized as a matter of trial and error to some extent; surprises are inevitable. Thus each policy should be designed to fail gracefully if it fails, to learn from the experience, and to leave resources sufficient to implement the lessons learned. Overall policy processes must be quasi-evolutionary, avoiding replication without modification of failed policies and building on the successes.\nDeGaetano A.T. 2009 J.APP.METEOROL.CLIMATOL.\nHoyos C.D et al. 2006 SCIENCE\nTurner B.L. et al. 2003 PROC.NAT.ACAD.SCI.\nYoung, O.R. 1989 CURR.

            "abstract": "The ecosystems in Northern Eurasia (NE) play an important role in the global climate system due to their vast land coverage, higher-than-global average rate of warming, and the potential feedbacks to the global climate. Water and carbon fluxes interact with each other and vary with climate change and land cover change (LUC). To understand the coupled effects of climate change and LUC on water and carbon dynamics in NE, we modified the algorithms for evapotranspiration (ET), incorporated the effects of forest stand age and fires on these dynamics, and assimilated forest inventory data and eddy covariance observations into the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) to better estimate water and carbon fluxes. With consideration of ET from uplands and wetlands, evaporation from water bodies, and snow sublimation, TEM substantially improves its estimation of ET and runoff. Estimated regional ET varies between 263.5–369.3 mm yr-1 during 1979-2008 depending on the choice of forcing data. With the most accurate available forcing data, modification to TEM results in a decrease of root mean square error from 527.74 km3 yr-1 to 126.23 km3 yr-1 for the total discharge estimates of the six largest watersheds in NE. Site-level experiments show that with/without consideration of forest stand age and fires leads to 12.8-53.5% differences in ET estimates, and shifts NE ecosystems between carbon sink and source activities depending on fire severities. Consequently, consideration of these impacts at regional scales may result in large differences in estimates of water and carbon fluxes across NE. Our study highlights the role of snow in the hydrometeorology of NE, and suggests that the quality of forcing data remains a major challenge for accurate quantification of regional water balance, and urges consideration of forest stand age and fires in estimation of water and carbon fluxes in NE.",

            "abstract": "We use a 10-year record of MODIS Terra and Aqua Level-3 joint histograms of cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER) to derive so-called cloud microphysical regimes by means of clustering analysis. The regimes reveal the dominant modes of COT and CER co-variations around the globe for both liquid and ice phases. The clustering analysis is capable of separating regimes so that each is dominated by one of the two water phases and can be associated with previously derived \"dynamical\" regimes. The microphysical regimes serve as an appropriate basis to study possible effects of aerosols on cloud microphysical changes and precipitation. To this end, we employ MODIS aerosol loading measurements either in terms of aerosol index or aerosol optical depth and spatiotemporally matched precipitation (from either GPCP, TRMM or CloudSat) to examine intra-regime variability, regime transitions from morning (Terra) to afternoon (Aqua), and regime precipitation characteristics for locally low, average, and high aerosol loadings. Breakdowns by ocean/land and geographical zone (e.g., tropics vs. midlatitudes) are essential for physical interpretation of the results. The analysis conducted so far reveals notable differences in apparent characteristics of low- and high-cloud dominated microphysical regimes when in different aerosol environments. The presentation will attempt to examine whether the picture painted by our work is consistent with prevailing expectations, rooted to either modeling or prior observational studies, on how clouds and precipitation respond to distinct aerosol environments.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is an iron limited, high nitrate, low chlorophyll region that draws considerable attention as a potential site for carbon drawdown through iron fertilization. However, there are no prolonged in-situ observations of the mechanisms driving naturally occurring blooms in this region. Here we present results from an APEX biofloat that continuously profiled the Drake Passage from ~ 2,000 m to the surface every two days. The biofloat measured the development and export of a naturally occurring phytoplankton bloom in the Drake Passage. Our analysis indicates that low levels of mesoscale kinetic energy coincided with the observed phytoplankton bloom. We postulate that low KE level are a precondition for bloom onset in the Drake Passage, which is confirmed by satellite observations. High levels of mesoscale kinetic energy immediately followed the phytoplankton bloom and appear to have facilitated organic carbon export to the deep ocean by changing the neutral density depths of aggregated cells. Furthermore, satellite observations in Drake Passage suggest that high levels of mesoscale kinetic energy limit bloom formation. We suggest that low mesoscale kinetic energy is a precondition for bloom formation in the Drake Passage before other potentially limiting factors become significant (e.g. grazing relation, macronutrients, micronutrients). If mesoscale kinetic energy were to impose a limitation on phytoplankton concentrations across the entire Southern Ocean, there may be regions unsuitable for geoengineered draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide through large scale iron additions.",

A remote region's influence depends on that region's (1) convection characteristics relative to Sahelian convection and (2) proximity to the Sahel.

Potential updates to the VIIRS aerosol algorithm include more stringent internal tests for detecting unfavorable retrieval conditions, extending the spatial and measurement range of retrieved AOT, updating aerosol models to account for the non-spherical shape of dust, and introducing the scene dependent land surface spectral reflectance relationship. As a proof of concept, implementation of the updated algorithm is performed over an extended time period to evaluate its performance against the AERONET measurements, current operational VIIRS retrievals, and latest MODIS Collection 6 aerosol products.

            "abstract": "This presentation reviews conceptual advances in the emerging field of socio-hydrology that focuses on coupled human and water systems. An important current challenge is how to better couple the bidirectional influences between human and water systems, which lead to emergent dynamics. The interactions among (1) the structure and dynamics of systems with (2) human values and norms lead to (3) outcomes, which in turn influence subsequent interactions. Human influences on hydrological systems are relatively well understood, chiefly resulting from developments in the field of water resources. The ecosystem-service concept of cultural value has expanded understanding of decision-making beyond economic rationality criteria. Hydrological impacts on social processes are less well developed conceptually, but this is changing with growing attention to vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience, particularly in the face of climate change. Methodological limitations, especially in characterizing the range of human responses to hydrological events and drivers, still pose challenges to modeling bidirectional human-water influences. Evidence from multiple case studies, synthesized in more broadly generic syndromes, helps surmount these methodological limitations and offers the potential to improve characterization and quantification of socio-hydrological systems.",

Various causes are thought to contribute the additional volume including subduction related volcanism and compression and the curvature of the Arica Bend, but the sum of these appears to fall short of accounting for the needed volume. In a recent detailed seismic survey in southern Peru (PeruSE), we have been able to image the suduction zone, including the overriding continent and the slab in the regions of both flat and normal subduction in southern Peru. One surprising aspect of the image is the presence of a mid-crustal layer boundary that is pervasive in the back-arc of both the normal and flat subduction regimes. Our interpretation of this feature is an extension of an older model in which the Brazilian Shield is underthrusting the Andes, with the difference that this process (according to our image) extends under the Western Cordillera, almost to the current subduction arc. This would explain the missing crustal thickness.",

            "abstract": "Research surveys suggest that students are demanding more applied field experiences from their undergraduate environmental science programs. For geoscience educators at liberal arts colleges without field camps, university vehicles, or even geology departments, getting students into the field is especially rewarding – and especially challenging. Here, we present strategies that we have used in courses ranging from introductory environmental science for non-majors, to upper level environmental methods and geology classes. Urban locations provide an opportunity for a different type of local \"field-work\" than would otherwise be available. In the upper-level undergraduate Environmental Methods class, we relied on a National Park area located a 10-minute walk from campus for most field exercises. Activities included soil analysis, measuring stream flow and water quality parameters, dendrochronology, and aquatic microbe metabolism. In the non-majors class, we make use of our urban location to contrast water quality in parks and highly channelized urban streams. Here we share detailed lesson plans and budgets for field activities that can be completed during a class period of 2.5 hours with a $75 course fee, show how these activities help students gain quantitative competency, and provide student feedback about the classes and activities.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic observations of interseismic deformation provide constraints on miroplate rotations, earthquake cycle processes, slip partitioning, and the geometric complexity of the Pacific-North America plate boundary. Paleoseismological observations in the western United States provide a complimentary dataset of Quaternary fault slip rate estimates. These measurements may be integrated and interpreted using block models, in which the upper crust is divided into microplates bounded by mapped faults, with slip rates defined by the differential relative motions of adjacent microplates. The number and geometry of microplates are typically defined with boundaries representing a limited sub-set of the large number of potentially seismogenic faults. An alternative approach is to include large number of potentially active faults in a dense array of microplates, and then deterministically estimate the boundaries at which strain is localized, while simultaneously satisfying interseismic geodetic and geologic observations. This approach is possible through the application of total variation regularization (TVR) which simultaneously minimizes the L2 norm of data residuals and the L1 norm of the variation in the estimated state vector. Applied to three-dimensional spherical block models, TVR reduces the total variation between estimated rotation vectors, creating groups of microplates that rotate together as larger blocks, and localizing fault slip on the boundaries of these larger blocks. Here we consider a suite of block models containing 3-137 microplates, where active block boundaries have been determined by TVR optimization constrained by both interseismic GPS velocities and geologic slip rate estimates.",

            "abstract": "Evidence suggests that river discharge has been increasing (+10%) over the last 30 years (1977-2007) for most arctic rivers. The peak melt month occurs earlier in the season in 66% of the studied rivers. Cold season flow is also increasing. Satellite discharge estimates, daily, based on microwave radiometry, are now possible from 1998 onwards. Daily river discharge hindcasts over the last 60 years using the water balance model WBMsed at a 10km spatial resolution are now available. The WBMsed model can be used in forecast mode assuming valid input climatology. The challenge here has been the accuracy of sub-polar precipitation grids. While each of these three methods (gauging, orbital sensing, modeling) has temporal and spatial coverage limitations, the combination of all three methods provides for a realistic way forward for estimating local discharge across the pan arctic. Flood inundation products are routinely produced for the pan-arctic using automated mapping algorithms developed by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. The determination of artic river sediment loads is less than ideal. Some rivers have only been monitored for a short number of years, and many have not been monitored at all. The WBMsed model is perhaps the best method of estimating the daily sediment flux to the Arctic Ocean, at least for rivers where the mean discharge is greater than 30 m3/s. Additionally there is limited-duration field monitoring by national surveys. New methods are being explored, including back calculating the delivery of sediment to the coastal ocean by plume dimensions observed from space (MODIS, LandSat). These methods have had moderate success when applied to plumes extending in the Greenland fjords. Canada maintains an active circa 7-y satellite program (ArcticNet) to track the Mackenzie discharge during the spring-summer runoff period when turbid river water is apt to flow under and over marginal sea ice in the Beaufort Sea.",

            "abstract": "Summertime anomalous high temperatures leading to enormous damages to public health and society are increasing continuously since late 20th century. However, the rise of global surface air temperature (SAT) has apparently been slowed in these 15 years. It is not clear why hot summers become more frequent despite the recent global-warming hiatus. Here we present, using ensembles of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), that the continuous increase of hot summers over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) was largely due to direct effect of radiative forcing by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to natural decadal climate variability. The 10-member AGCM ensemble, when forced by 63-year histories of observed sea surface temperature (SST), aerosols, land cover and GHGs, reproduced well the increasing hot summers, but another ensemble without changes in anthropogenic forcings and ocean surface warming still showed a small increase. Decadal SST variations in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean contributed to the recent increase of hot summers over North America through atmospheric teleconnections. Analyses of the two and an additional ensembles show that local radiative heating over land due to increasing GHGs contributed by 39% to continuous increase over the mid- and high-latitude land areas. The contribution of the direct effect of anthropogenic forcing is independent of the global SST hiatus, suggesting a continuous increase in heat extremes over the land due to this effect even if the climate hiatus persist for the coming decades.\n",

Even louder at times is the noise from intense ship traffic in the North Bay. This study aims to determine if noise from ships disrupts the mating behavior of the plainfin midshipman.\nWe have recorded sound continuously for several years from the Romberg Tiburon Center research pier, close to the North Bay shipping channel. Here passenger ferries pass in front of the site some 36 times a day on weekdays, and tankers and other heavy vessels also frequent this channel. A bottom-mounted hydrophone and computer-based data acquisition system digitize the sound at a sample rate of 2000 Hz. The attached figure shows the spectrogram from one 15-minute data file, starting on July 10, 2013 at 14:36:05 UT (7:36:05 local time). The horizontal lines represent a 111-Hz fundamental frequency and its overtones, and the two broad vertical patterns represent the sounds of two passing ferries. Our study involves analyzing about 30,000 such spectrograms.\nThe first phase of our study involves a search for ship signals, giving the central time and the half-width for each ship. Then two bands, two standard deviations on either side of the ship position, are searched for a peak in the frequency spectrum between 70Hz and 180Hz, recording the power in the peak. Using these values we have searched for evidence of a change in humming power during or after the ship's passage.\nResults from this search will be presented, and implications for successful location of nesting females will be discussed.\nFigure 1. 15-minute-long plot of frequency versus time (a spectrogram).

            "abstract": "Triple oxygen isotope ratios (18O/16O and 17O/16O) are a powerful tool to tease out interconnections within the Surface Earth System, both today and throughout Earth’s history. This ability comes from the fact that stratospheric photochemistry imparts a negative ∆17O anomaly (∆17O = δ17O – 0.52×δ18O) to atmospheric oxygen whose magnitude is proportional to pCO2 levels and photosynthetic oxygen production. Atmospheric oxygen readily weathers continental sulfides and, as a result, the secular variations in atmospheric ∆17O values may be recorded in marine sulfate minerals (barite, gypsum and anhydrite).\nThe largest ∆17O anomalies found in the rock record are from peculiar barite layers that immediately post-date the 635 Ma Marinoan Snowball Event. While these anomalies have been interpreted to result from a weak post-glacial photosynthetic O2 flux, the balance of other evidence (e.g., Zn isotope records of near-modern post-glacial productivity) suggests that they instead reflect the elevated CO2 levels thought to be required to exit a snowball state. As this situation illustrates, the ∆17O record by itself does not provide a unique solution between production of the anomaly by stratospheric reactions and its destruction by global biospheric productivity. In the context of additional geological and geochemical constraints, however, a marine sulfate ∆17O record has the potential to provide new insights into paleoatmospheres, paleoclimates, and paleoproductivity.\nWe have produced new data (n ≈ 200) for Proterozoic evaporites that extend the sulfate ∆17O record from the Neoproterozoic to ~2.3 Ga. This data will be interpreted within our current understanding of Proterozoic Earth System Evolution on basinal to global scales and will address key questions that include: Were Paleoproterozoic glacial episodes terminated by elevated pCO2? Was the Great Oxidation Event accompanied by enhanced productivity? Does the lack of C isotope variability throughout the mid-Proterozoic “Boring Billion” reflect constant primary productivity? Did a balance between CO2 levels and solar luminosity maintain the temperate mid-Proterozoic climate?",

            "abstract": "There is a rich set of aftershock data available from portable seismic instruments that were deployed following the August 23, 2011 Mw 5.8 Mineral, VA earthquake. Amplitudes of the P and S waveforms for recorded aftershocks can be used to invert for the moment tensors of the individual aftershocks, allowing for determinations of their focal mechanisms and seismic moments. In testing the moment-tensor inversion method with some of the aftershocks, some problems were noted with the data. The most serious problem is the discovery of acausal filter responses of the instruments, which act to obscure the first arrivals of the P and S waves. An allpass filter to correct for this acausal response helps clarify the direction of the first P and S arrivals but at the expense of distorting the subsequent P and S pulse shape. Thus, a hybrid method where the first arrival is read from filtered waveforms but the amplitude is read from unfiltered waveforms must be employed. A second problem is that some stations appear to have anomalously high or low amplitudes for all events that were tested. This likely due to amplification of the ground motions by the surficial materials beneath the station. Average station corrections are computed to account for this site bias. A third problem appears when focal mechanisms computed using P and SH amplitudes are compared to those computed with only P wave amplitudes. The discrepancies between the two different solutions may reflect improper instrument orientations, scattered energy affecting the SH waveforms, or the use of an improper velocity model. This problem is addressed for each event analyzed by initially computing a moment tensor inversion using only P amplitudes and then later testing how the solution is affected by including SH amplitude data.",

            "abstract": "Extremely low frequency seismic noise, known as earth’s “seismic hum”, is generated by the very long wavelength, low frequency infragravity waves of the ocean which transfer their energy to the solid earth. Infragravity waves are generated along coastlines by the non-linear interaction of incoming ocean swells and can travel long distances across ocean basins with relatively little attenuation. They have been implicated in the break-up of ice shelves (Bromirski et al, Geophys. Res. Lett. 2010) and are important for coupling processes between the ocean, atmosphere, and earth (Rhie and Romanowicz, Nature 2004), but their spatial and temporal variably remains poorly studied.\nWe investigate the characteristics of the infragravity wave band in the north-east Pacific using co-located ocean bottom seismometers and differential pressure gauges deployed in deep water as part of the Cascadia Initiative array. Using cross correlation techniques and backprojection of the noise correlation function (Harmon et al, Geophys. Res. Lett. 2012) we have found that infragravity wave energy propagates offshore for the majority of the year, indicating that the Oregon coastline is a net producer of infragravity waves. On rare occasions, infragravity wave energy is observed to propagate onshore. In January 2013, a particularly strong event occurred where energy propagated onshore with normal incidence to the coastline. We use this event to investigate the feasibility of estimating coastline reflection coefficients from cross correlation of differential pressure gauge records. ",

            "abstract": "The trace element composition of clastic sedimentary rocks has frequently been used to characterize sediment provenance. To test the efficacy of whole-rock chemical composition as a provenance indicator, researchers examined alluvium solely derived from the 74 Ma Stepladder pluton (SP), in the Mojave Desert of SE California. Despite the low degree of chemical alteration and minimal transport distance neither trace element concentration or immobile elements ratios accurately reflected that of the source pluton. Furthermore, there is a considerable discrepancy between the frequency of zircon U-Pb ages from the SP and its derived alluvium. The majority (~ 75%) of the zircon grains from the SP are ~ 74 Ma and the remaining 25% are ~ 1.65 Ga. In contrast, ~ 50 to 85% of the detrital zircon, of varying grain sizes, yielded Proterozoic ages. Both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Likeness tests were used to compare all 120 possible samples pairs; the KS test rejected the null hypothesis that the zircon are derived from the same population, and the likeness test showed that most sediments are not like the source. These results, which we refer to as the “Stepladder effect”, led us to consider Sr isotopic composition as a potentially more robust metric of provenance. Several of the sediment samples have similar present-day 87Sr/86Sr to that determined for four SP samples which range from 0.71055 to 0.71129. However, three sediment samples are distinctly different, suggesting a sedimentary sorting effect (e.g. concentration of biotite in finer sediments). To minimize this confounding effect we will determine the Sr isotopic composition of detrital apatite and biotite to compare with the same minerals of SP source. Using these specific minerals, which represent end-members of Rb-Sr spectrum, may help to constrain the degree of mixing with an externally sourced material (e.g. aeolian-derived grains) that have been added to the alluvium shedding further light on the Stepladder Effect.",

However, most current dynamic vegetation models do not explicitly simulate competition among Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Here we use the coupled CLASS-CTEM model (Canadian Land Surface Scheme coupled to Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model) to explicitly simulate competition between nine PFTs for available space using a modified version of Lotka – Volterra (LV) predator-prey equations. The nine PFTs include evergreen and deciduous needleleaf trees, evergreen and cold and drought deciduous broadleaf trees and C3 and C4 crops and grasses. The CLASS-CTEM model can be configured either in the composite (single tile) or the mosaic (multiple tiles) mode. Our results show that the model is sensitive to the chosen mode. The simulated fractional coverage of PFTs are similar between two approaches at some locations whereas at the other locations the two approaches yield different results. The simulated fractional coverage of PFTs are also compared with the available observations-based estimates. Simulated results at selected locations across the globe show that the model is able to realistically simulate the fractional coverage of tree and grass PFTs and the bare fraction, as well as the fractional coverage of individual tree and grass PFTs. Along with the observed patterns of vegetation distribution the CLASS-CTEM modelling framework is also able to simulate realistic succession patterns. Some differences remain and these are attributed to the coarse spatial resolution of the model (~3.75°) and the limited number of PFTs represented in the model.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s terrestrial subsurface environment can be divided into a relatively porous layer of unconsolidated material (herein termed regolith) above consolidated saprock/bedrock. Variations in the thickness of this layer control water-storage capacity and runoff potential. Currently, Earth System Models assume a constant thickness (e.g. 2-5 m) for this layer globally despite the fact that regolith is absent in some regions and tens of meters thick in other regions. We report on the development of a high-resolution global raster dataset of regolith thickness in uplands (eroding landscapes of relatively thin (<5 m) regolith over bedrock) and lowlands (depositional landscapes with regolith often more than 10 m thick). The data products are 1 km/pixel resolution but they utilize topographic data at 30 m/pixel resolution using the ASTER V2 GDEM as input. Uplands and lowlands are distinguished at the 30 m/pixel scale using a valley network extraction algorithm and geologic age criteria. Regolith thickness on uplands is predicted using geomorphic/pedogenic models dependent on topography, rock type, and climate. Regolith thickness on lowlands is a function of topography (with narrower valleys having thinner regolith) and geologic map unit age. The predictive models are calibrated using the CONUS-Soil database (for uplands) and available data on the thickness of unconsolidated sediments from groundwater wells in U.S. states where digital well data are available (for lowlands). Data from the European Soils Database (for uplands) and a subset of U.S. well data (for lowlands) are used for validation. As a byproduct of our work, we developed a global drainage network/wetland map and other useful hydrologic data at 30 m/pixel resolution. These datasets will be made available to the research community and should prove useful in improving the accuracy of ecohydrological processes in regional and global land-surface models.",

Synthesis of such molecules and their subsequent self-assembly into ordered structures requires a favorable source of energy as well as a favorable entropic environment. Our approach couples two such auspicious conditions, using sunlight as the energetic driver and air-water interfaces as the reaction medium. The Sun provides a large, prebiotically relevant source of energy to fuel synthetic photochemistry. Air-water interfaces are widely prevalent on oceans, lakes, and atmospheric aerosols and provide unique reaction environments that ameliorate some of the thermodynamic challenges of the aqueous bulk. Using these experimental principles, we demonstrate the ability to generate chemical complexity via in situ observation of non-enzymatic peptide bond synthesis at the surface of water. Additionally, we will discuss the photochemical formation of a double-tailed membrane component in aqueous solution, which subsequently self-assembles into ordered, three-dimensional structures.",

            "abstract": "Many of the most dramatic and surprising effects of global change occur across large spatial extents, from regions to continents, that impact multiple ecosystem types across a range of interacting spatial and temporal scales. The ability of ecologists and inter-disciplinary scientists to understand and predict these dynamics depend, in large part, on existing site-based research infrastructures that developed in response to historic events. Integrating these diverse sources of data is critical to addressing these broad-scale questions. A conceptual approach is presented to synthesize and integrate diverse sources and types of data from different networks of research sites. This approach focuses on developing derived data products through spatial and temporal aggregation that allow datasets collected with different methods to be compared. The approach is illustrated through the integration, analysis, and comparison of hundreds of long-term datasets from 50 ecological sites in the US that represent ecosystem types commonly found globally. New insights were found by comparing multiple sites using common derived data. In addition to “bringing to light” many dark data in a standardized, open access, easy-to-use format, a suite of lessons were learned that can be applied to up and coming research networks in the US and internationally. These lessons will be described along with the challenges, including cyber-infrastructure, cultural, and behavioral constraints associated with the use of big and little data, that may keep ecologists and inter-disciplinary scientists from taking full advantage of the vast amounts of existing and yet-to-be exposed data.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect cruise (GEOTRACES GP06) examined the water-column distribution of trace elements between Peru and Tahiti, crossing the southern East Pacific Rise (EPR) midway along the cruise track. Shipboard measurements made along this ocean section reveal the mid-depth lateral transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron (dFe), manganese (dMn) and aluminum (dAl) over a distance of more than 4,000 km, from the EPR westward into the deep South Pacific basin. Post-cruise measurements of the conservative hydrothermal tracer helium-3 indicate the loss of at least 85% of the hydrothermal dFe over a distance of ~80 km west from the ridge axis, presumably as a result of oxidation, scavenging and precipitation. Further west of the ridge axis, dFe and excess helium-3 (3Hexs) are linearly correlated (r2 = 0.99), showing a more than 4-fold conservative dilution of hydrothermal dFe over a distance of ~4000 km. This behavior may reflect the lateral transport of iron as relatively unreactive, colloidal oxyhydroxides; ongoing analyses of cruise samples by other groups will provide data to test this hypothesis. The loss of hydrothermal dMn relative to 3Hexs extends over a greater distance than for dFe, as far as ~250 km to the west of the ridge axis, beyond which dMn exhibits nearly conservative behavior. The hydrothermal dAl anomaly appears to extend over 3,000 km west of the EPR, and is not readily explained based on the known composition of ridge-axis vent fluids. The linear dFe versus 3Hexs relationship in the off-axis hydrothermal plume has a slope of 5.6 x 106 mol/mol, which falls roughly between values estimated for the western South Pacific and the South Atlantic basins. If we assume that our dFe and 3He data are generally representative of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal emissions, then the estimated global hydrothermal 3He efflux of 530 mol/y yields an effective hydrothermal dFe input of 2.9 Gmol/y to the ocean interior.",

            "abstract": "In January of 2010, ocean waves generated by an unusually large storm caused major erosion damage to the San Francisco coastline, with an erosion \"hot spot\" partially collapsing a four-lane throughway and threatening important infrastructure. Every winter, swells from the northwest approach San Francisco's Ocean Beach by passing over the southern limb of the San Francisco Bar, an ebb-tidal delta seaward of the Golden Gate Bridge. Refraction of approaching wave-fronts causes focusing of wave energy at the southern end of Ocean Beach where the S.F. Bar meets the coast, possibly explaining the location of the 2010 hot spot.\nIn 2011 an x-band radar system was installed on a site near the erosion hot spot, at an elevation of 13 m above low tide, about 40 m back from the high-tide line. The radar system collects images of wave crests out to 3 km from the scanner. Study of these images when offshore buoys report a single NW swell shows two swell patterns arriving at Ocean Beach, separated in direction by about 30 degrees, and producing a quilted interference pattern, as seen in the accompanying figure. We interpret these swells as following two different paths around the Bar. Preliminary ray-tracing studies tend to confirm this interpretation.\nTo enhance these images we have employed two techniques. The first technique, which is concerned with identification and visualization of swells in the region of interest, involves iteration over possible swell periods: scans taken at integral multiples of a given period are added together, with the sharpest image determining the swell period (see figure) and providing an enhanced image for further analysis. The second technique involves displacement of images in time by phase incrementation in k-space, with subsequent addition of images.\nWe will present results concerning the stability of the relative phase of the two swells, and the applicability to models for propagation of waves. Establishment of a tested propagation model would permit prediction of erosion hazards for hypothetical enhanced storms and rising sea level due to global climate change.",

The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) is a new (proposed) satellite-MIP within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) that is designed to address the following main science questions: (1) What are the effects of land use and land-use change on climate (past-future)? (2) What are the effects of climate change on land-use and land-use change? (3) Are there regional land management strategies with promise to help mitigate and adapt to climate change? LUMIP will coordinate across existing land use change projects such as LUCID, AgMIP, GSWP3, Trendy, and LUC4C. LUMIP encompasses three major activities: (1) input and output data harmonization and standardization, (2) development of model metrics to assess ESM performance with respect to the impact of land use on climate and carbon cycling, and (3) design and execution of a concise set of land model and ESM experiments for assessment of the impacts of historic and projected land use on the climate system and to separate effects of fossil fuel vs. land use, biogeochemical vs biogeophysical processes, and land cover vs land management.

            "abstract": "Molybdenum isotopic composition has been shown to be a powerful tool in studies of planetary processes, e.g. estimating core formation temperatures [1,2]. However, Mo isotope compositions of terrestrial reservoirs are not well constrained. In order to better constrain the Mo isotopic composition of the early Earth’s mantle, komatiites from four locations were analyzed for their Mo concentrations and isotopic compositions. Komatiites are particularly appropriate for this type of study because they formed by high degrees of partial melting of the mantle leading to a complete base metal sulfide removal from the residual mantle and the production of sulfur-undersaturated melts and thus a quantitative removal of Mo from the source into the melt. All samples, except for two strongly altered specimens specifically chosen to study the effects of secondary alteration, are very fresh having preserved most of their primary mineralogy.\nThe Mo concentrations in komatiites range from 10 to 120 ng/g. Fresh komatiites have lighter δ98Mo (NIST SRM 3134 = 0.25‰, [3]) than altered samples. The estimated primary Mo isotope compositions of the studied komatiite melts range from 0.02 ± 0.16‰ to 0.19 ± 0.14‰ and are therefore indistinguishable within analytical uncertainty (2SD) from published values for chondritic meteorites (0.09 ± 0.04 ‰; 2SD; [2]) and lighter than the proposed average for Earth’s continental crust (0.3 to 0.4‰ [4]). All data combined, although overlapping in errors, show a consistent trend of lighter δ98Mo and lower Mo concentrations in more melt-depleted mantle sources, indicating incompatible behaviour of Mo and preferential mobilization of heavy Mo isotopes during mantle melting.\n[1] Hin et al.

            "abstract": "Sounding signals at frequencies higher than the ionospheric peak plasma frequency are not reflected by the ionosphere. Instead they make it to the ground where they are reflected by the planetary surface. We analyze the intensity of the surface reflections measured by the MARSIS ionospheric radar sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Apart from the surface reflectivity, the intensity of the surface reflection is controlled primarily by the signal attenuation during ionospheric propagation. We focus on the nightside region, where the ionospheric densities in the main layer are too low to cause a significant attenuation and allow sampling of the surface reflection at frequencies down to 3 MHz. The attenuation is then expected to occur mainly at lower altitudes (<100 km), where electron-neutral collision frequency is a maximum. The intensity of surface reflections can thus serve as a proxy for the electron density at low altitudes not accessible by the direct MARSIS ionospheric radar sounding. We derive the intensity of surface reflections from all available MARSIS nightside ionograms, and we analyze its variability as a function of relevant controlling factors such as SZA, solar activity, magnetic field magnitude and inclination, and simultaneously observed electron density in the main ionospheric layer. The results obtained are discussed in terms of possible processes affecting the electron densities at low altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Benthic habitats rely on relatively stable environmental conditions for survival. The introduction of algal mats into an ecosystem can have a notable effect on the livelihood of organisms such as coral reefs by causing changes in the biogeochemistry of the surrounding water. Increasing levels of acidity and new competition for sunlight caused by congregations of cyanobacteria essentially starve coral reefs of natural resources. These changes are particularly prevalent in waters near quickly developing population centers, such as the ecologically diverse Arabian Gulf. While ground-truthing studies to determine the extensiveness of coral death proves useful on a microcosmic level, new ventures in remote sensing research allow scientists to utilize satellite data to track these changes on a broader scale. Satellite images acquired from Landsat 5, 1987, Landsat 7, 2000, and Landsat 8, 2013 along with higher resolution IKONOS data are digitally analyzed in order to create spectral libraries for relevant benthic types, which in turn can be used to perform supervised classifications and change detection analyses over a larger area. The supervised classifications performed over the three scenes show five significant marine-related classes, namely coral, mangroves, macro-algae, and seagrass, in different degrees of abundance, yet here we focus only on the algal mats impact on corals bleaching. The change detection analysis is introduced to study see the degree of algal mats impact on coral bleaching over the course of time with possible connection to the local meteorology and current climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Refraction microtermor routinely assesses 1D and 2D velocity-depth profiles to shallow depths of approximately 100 m primarily for engineering applications. Estimation of both shallow and deep (>100 m) shear-velocity structure are key elements in the assessment of urban areas for potential earthquake ground shaking, damage, and the calibration of recorded ground motions. Three independent studies investigated the ability of the refraction microtremor technology to image deep velocity structure, to depths exceeding 1 km (Deep ReMi). In the first study, we were able to delineate basin thicknesses of up to 900 m and the deep-basin velocity structure beneath the Reno-area basin. Constraints on lateral velocity changes in 3D as well as on velocity profiles extended down to 1500 m, and show a possible fault offset. This deployment used 30 stand-alone wireless instruments mated to 4.5 Hz geophones, along each of five arrays 2.9 to 5.8 km long. Rayleigh-wave dispersion was clear at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz using 120 sec ambient urban noise records. The results allowed construction of a 3D velocity model, vetted by agreement with gravity studies. In a second test, a 5.8 km array delimited the southern edge of the Tahoe Basin, with constraints from gravity. There, bedrock depth increased by 250 m in thickness over a distance of 1600 m, with definition of the velocity of the deeper basin sediments. The third study delineated the collapse region of an underground nuclear explosion within a thick sequence of volcanic extrusives, using a shear-wave minivibe in a radial direction, and horizontal geophones. Analysis showed the cavity extends to 620 m depth, with a width of 180 m and a height of 220 m. Our results demonstrate that deep velocity structure can be recovered using ambient noise. This technique offers the ability to define 2D and 3D structural representations essential for seismic hazard evaluation.",

The passive microwave sensors have been providing soil moisture of various spatial resolutions and are available for all-weather conditions. However, restricted by the antenna diameter of microwave radiometer, the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture product is at tens of kilometers and needs to be improved for many applications. The SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) is set to be launched in late 2014 and will be the first mission to provide L-band radar/radiometer soil moisture retrievals at three resolutions. The SMAPVEX12 is a pre-launch field validation experiment for evaluating and testing the soil moisture retrievals acquired from SMAP satellite. Airborne data using PALS (Passive/Active L-band Sensor) at two along-track resolutions (650 m and 1590 m) and UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) at 5 m spatial resolution as well as in-situ measurements were collected during the campaign. The study will implement a Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) to retrieve soil moisture from high/low altitude PALS L-band radiometer observations, as well as produce downscaled soil moisture change by combining low spatial resolution soil moisture retrievals and high spatial resolution PALS L-band radar observations through a change-detection algorithm, which models the relationship between change in radar backscatter and the change in soil moisture.",

We address this issue for the United States warm season via high-resolution simulations, continental-scale radar observations, and dynamical analogs. The bias is argued to stem from the absence in climate models of orogenic propagating convective systems that provide over 50% of warm-season rainfall because: i) convective parameterizations fail to represent key dynamical processes; ii) climate model spatial resolution does not permit explicit organized convection. Particularly important are mesoscale downdrafts (Earth’s natural air-conditioners) that, on regional scales, bring air of lower thermodynamic energy above the boundary layer to the land surface. On a broader note, organized convection is central to the water-cycle, diurnal-cycle, energy and momentum fluxes, hydrology, and albedo, all of which affect the distribution and variability of surface temperature and moisture.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid economic development and urbanization, severe and widespread PM2.5 pollution in China has attracted nationwide attention. Study of the health impact of PM2.5 exposure has been hindered, however, by the limited coverage of ground measurements from recently established regulatory monitoring networks. Estimating ground-level PM2.5 from satellite remote sensing is a promising new method to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of PM2.5 exposure. We developed a two-stage spatial statistical model to estimate daily mean PM2.5 concentrations at 10 km resolution in 2013 in China using MODIS Collection 6 AOD, assimilated meteorology, population density, and land use parameters. A custom inverse variance weighting approach was developed to combine MODIS Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) AOD to optimize coverage. Compared with the AERONET AOD measurements, our combined AOD (R2=0.80, mean bias = 0.07) performs similarly to MODIS’ combined AOD (R2=0.81, mean bias =0.07), but has 90% greater coverage. We used the first-stage linear mixed effect model to represent the temporal variability of PM2.5 and the second-stage generalized additive model to represent its spatial contrast. The overall model cross-validation R2 and relative prediction error are 0.80 and 30%, respectively. PM2.5 levels exhibit strong seasonal patterns, with the highest national mean concentrations in winter (75 µg/m3) and the lowest in summer (30 µg/m3). Elevated annual mean PM2.5 levels are predicted in North China Plain and Sichuan Basin, with the maximum annual PM2.5 concentrations higher than 130 µg/m3 and 110 µg/m3, respectively. Our results also indicates that over 94% of the Chinese population lives in areas that exceed the WHO Air Quality Interim Target-1 standard (35 μg/m3). The exceptions include Taiwan, Hainan, Yunnan, Tibet, and North Inner Mongolia.",

Ionization of Pluto’s escaping atmosphere suggests the interaction with the solar wind will be similar to that of a comet. In contrast to cometary interactions that have been measured relatively close to the Sun, the weak magnetic field and tenuous density of the solar wind in the outer heliosphere imply that the interaction with Pluto’s atmosphere will include significant kinetic effects and be highly asymmetric. Understanding these interactions will expand our knowledge of the astrophysical processes affecting these bodies and that part of the solar system. The SWAP instrument on New Horizons will make measurements of the solar wind deceleration and deflection due to the interaction with Pluto. The PEPPSI instrument will measure energetic particles produced in the interaction region. SWAP will also measure solar wind conditions at large distances from the Sun and measure the effects of pickup protons from the interstellar medium in the distant heliosphere.",

Furthermore, aerosols and their propellants are suspected contributors to marine habitat degradation. Although several studies reveal that the Arabian Gulf habitats have suffered deleterious impacts after the Gulf War and the following six month off-shore oil spill, limited research exists to track the changes in benthic habitats over the past three decades using remote sensing. Document changes in costal habitats over the past thirty years were better observed with the use of multispectral remote sensors such as Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat8 (OLI). Change detection analysis was performed on the three Landsat images (Landsat-5 for the 1987 image, Landsat-7 for the 2000, and Landsat-8 for the 2013 image). The images were then modified, masked off from open water and land. An unsupervised classification was performed which cluster similar classes together. The supervised classification displayed the seven following classes: coral reefs, macro algae, sea grass, salt marshes, mangroves, water, and land. Compared to 1987 image to 2000 scene, there was a noticeable increase in the extensiveness of salt marsh and macro algae habitats. However, a significant decrease in salt marsh habitats were apparent in the 2013 scene.",

            "abstract": "Although the Himalayan range is commonly presented as cylindrical along-strike, geological structures, topography, precipitation, and exhumation rates as recorded by low-temperature thermochronology data all vary significantly from west to east. In particular, segments of the belt that are characterized by a clear topographic step between the Lesser and Higher Himalaya, associated with a peak in precipitation and focused exhumation (e.g. central Nepal, Himachal Pradesh) alternate with segments where the topography increases more linearly to the north, precipitation peaks at lower elevations and exhumation rates appear to be lower (e.g. western Nepal, Bhutan). The potential climatic or tectonic controls on these spatially variable topographic, precipitation and exhumational patterns have been widely discussed in recent years but remain unclear.\nThermo-kinematic modelling predicts that the geometry of the main Himalayan detachment (in particular the presence or absence of a major mid-crustal ramp) strongly controls the kinematics, exhumation and topography of the orogen. Where a major crustal ramp is present, the topography shows a steep gradient that focuses exhumation and orographic precipitation whereas the topography is gentler and exhumation less focused in the absence of a ramp. We test this prediction by comparing the pattern of topography, river incision and long-term exhumation in central Nepal, where a major crustal ramp has been imaged by geophysical methods, with new results from the remote Karnali River transect in far western Nepal, where a ramp is predicted to be absent or minor. Our results therefore imply that along-strike climatic variations in the Himalaya respond to tectonics rather than driving it. The presence or absence of a mid-crustal ramp may be due to inherited structures on the underthrusting Indian Plate or, alternatively, may reflect transient behaviour of the accreting Lesser Himalayan thrust stack, which may oscillate between frontal accretion (without a ramp) or basal accretion in the presence of a ramp.",

Tens of theoretical coronal heating mechanisms have been suggested, but only a few have been able to be ruled out. In this talk, we will explore the reasons for the slow progress and discuss the measurements that will be needed for potential breakthrough, including imaging the solar corona at small spatial scales, measuring the chromospheric magnetic fields, and detecting the presence of high temperature, low-emission measure plasma. We will discuss three sounding rocket instruments developed to make these measurements: the High-resolution Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C), the Chromospheric Lyman-Alpha Spectropolarimeter (CLASP), and the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS).",

            "abstract": "Tree-ring based climate reconstructions are typically derived from either (1) a single species from one or multiple locations, or (2) multiple species from multiple locations. Here, we investigate the ability of using multiple co-occurring canopy-dominant species for climate reconstructions based in the eastern United States (US). Using a variety of techniques, we first compare the climate signals of canopy-dominant species at three old-growth forests in southern Indiana. We then determine if a composite time series of these co-occurring species increases or decreases the reconstruction model skill. In all cases, climate-growth correlation analyses of the species reveal strong relationships with summer (June–August) Palmer Drought Severity Index during the period 1895–2013 CE. We first use a split-sample reconstruction technique to compare the performance of species reconstruction models. We then use a nested technique to build a composite chronology for each site against which to compare the individual species chronologies. The composite chronologies consistently outperformed each individual species model, indicating that using multiple co-occurring species increases reconstruction skill. Furthermore, the stability of the climate signal increases with the inclusion of more species, even those that are rarely used in dendroclimatic work (i.e. Juglans nigra). These results indicate that sampling co-occurring species captures greater drought variance and more accurately explains how drought is experienced within a forest. Further, sampling co-occurring species at multiple sites in the Eastern US can improve broader scale regional drought reconstructions over the Common Era.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinite is a common rock type in oceanic transform faults. Our ability to understand and predict seismicity generated along these faults depends on models for the frictional behavior of serpentinite at conditions spanning the seismogenic zone. To investigate differences in the frictional behavior between serpentinite bare-rock surfaces and powdered serpentinite (‘gouge’) at sub-seismic to seismic-slip rates, we conducted rotary shear experiments on an antigorite-rich and lizardite-rich serpentinite at slip rates (V) from 0.003 m/s to 6.5 m/s, sliding displacements up to 1.6 m, and normal stresses (σn) up to 22 MPa for gouge and 97 MPa for bare surfaces. Nominal steady-state friction values (μnss) in gouge at V= 1 m/s are larger than in bare surfaces for all σn tested and demonstrate a strong σn dependence; μnss decreased from 0.51 at 4.0 MPa to 0.39 at 22.4 MPa. Conversely, μnss values for bare surfaces remained ~0.1 with increasing σn and V. Additionally, the velocity at the onset of frictional weakening and the amount of slip prior to weakening were orders of magnitude larger in gouge than in bare surfaces. Extrapolation of the normal stress dependence for μnss suggests that the behavior of antigorite gouge approaches that of bare surfaces at σn ≥ 60 MPa. X-ray diffraction revealed dehydration reaction products in samples that frictionally weakened. Microstructural analysis revealed highly localized slip zones with melt-like textures in some cases gouge experiments and in all bare-surfaces experiments for V ≥ 1 m/s. 1-D thermal modeling indicates that flash heating is the primary process causing initial weakening in bare surfaces. Flash heating also occurs in gouge, however because strain is more distributed, dynamic weakening occurs at higher velocities and after larger displacements. Our findings suggest that at shallower depths (<5 km) the frictional behavior of faults will be strongly affected by the presence of unconsolidated gouge.",

            "abstract": "Environmental parameters associated with cholera are well documented. However, cholera continues to be a global public health threat. Uncertainty in defining environmental processes affecting growth and multiplication of the cholera bacteria can be affected significantly by changing climate at different temporal and spatial scales, either through amplification of the hydroclimatic cycle or by enhanced variability of large scale geophysical processes. Endemic cholera in the Bengal Delta region of South Asia has a unique pattern of two seasonal peaks and there are associated with asymmetric and episodic variability in river discharge. The first cholera outbreak in spring is related with intrusion of bacteria laden coastal seawater during low river discharge. Cholera occurring during the fall season is hypothesized to be associated with high river discharge related to a cross-contamination of water resources and, therefore, a second wave of disease, a phenomenon characteristic primarily in the inland regions. Because of difficulties in establishing linkage between coarse resolutions of the Global Climate Model (GCM) output and localized disease outbreaks, the impact of climate change on diarrheal disease has not been explored. Here using the downscaling method of Support Vector Machines from HADCM3 and ECHAM models, we show how cholera outbreak patterns are changing in the Bengal Delta. Our preliminary results indicate statistically significant changes in both seasonality and magnitude in the occurrence of cholera over the next century. Endemic cholera is likely to transform into epidemic forms and new geographical areas will be at risk for cholera outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "Source locations of mantle plumes such as Hawai’i, Kerguelen, and Louisville reside to different degrees within the Large Low Shear Velocity Province, thought to be associated with a layer of anomalously dense, viscous material along the core-mantle boundary. Therefore, these mantle plumes may entrain different quantities of this material as they rise toward the upper mantle. Entrainment of denser, more viscous material into a plume may affect its geometry, excess temperature, upwelling rate, and long-term stability, all factors that can alter surface expressions such as volcanic flux and chemistry along hotspot chains. Previous models examined plume dynamics in the presence of a dense material blanketing the source region. Here, we use numerical simulations to quantify how different geometries of denser, more viscous material alter plume dynamics and the surface expressions of hotspots (e.g., melting rate and chemistry). The simulations are run using the finite-difference, marker-in-cell code HiPStER (Highly Parallel Stokes with Exotic Rheologies). Numerically, the mantle obeys a non-Newtonian viscous rheology that is strongly temperature dependent. Initial temperatures are adiabatic through the interior of the mantle, and a thermal perturbation is introduced along the bottom of the domain to initiate a hot, upwelling plume. The effect of different geometries of dense, more viscous fluid on plume upwelling rate and surface expressions are evaluated by varying several parameters including: the plume excess temperature, and the geometry, density, and viscosity of the anomalous material. Melting and chemistry are calculated using a hydrous batch-melting model. Results are compared to geochemical and physical data from the Hawaiian, Kerguelen (Ninetyeast Ridge), and Louisville hotspot tracks.",

            "abstract": "The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) is a catalog of documents and datasets that provide information about geothermal resources located primarily within the United States. The goal of NGDS is to make large quantities of geothermal-relevant geoscience data available to the public by creating a national, sustainable, distributed, and interoperable network of data providers. The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) has been a data provider in the initial phase of NGDS.\nOne method by which NGDS facilitates interoperability is through the use of content models. Content models provide a schema (structure) for submitted data. Schemas dictate where and how data should be entered. Content models use templates that simplify data formatting to expedite use by data providers. These methodologies implemented by NGDS can extend beyond geothermal data to all geoscience data.\nThe GSA, using the NGDS physical samples content model, has tested and refined a content model for thin sections and thin section photos. Countless thin sections have been taken from oil and gas well cores housed at the GSA, and many of those thin sections have related photomicrographs. Record keeping for these thin sections has been scattered at best, and it is critical to capture their metadata while the content creators are still available. A next step will be to register the GSA’s thin sections with SESAR (System for Earth Sample Registration) and assign an IGSN (International Geo Sample Number) to each thin section. Additionally, the thin section records will be linked to the GSA’s online record database. When complete, the GSA’s thin sections will be more readily discoverable and have greater interoperability. Moving forward, the GSA is implementing use of NGDS-like content models and registration with SESAR and IGSN to improve collection maintenance and management of additional physical samples.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests provide a range of valuable ecosystem services including sequestering large quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their soils at rates higher than other forests. Whether or not mangrove soils continue to be a sink for OC will be determined by the mangrove ecosystems’ response to climate change-induced stressors. The threats of rising sea level outpacing mangrove forest soil accretion and increased wave energy associated with this rise may become the primary climate change-induced stressors on mangrove ecosystems. The threat from wave energy is amplified during storm events, which could increasingly damage mangrove forests along the coastline. However, storms may enhance accretion rates at some sites due to delivery of storm surge material, which could increase the system’s ability to keep pace with sea-level rise (SLR). To investigate these processes we measure soil accretion rates over the last 100 years (via 210Pb dating) within the mangrove forests of Everglades National Park, which are situated within the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America. Accretion rates range from 2 to 2.8 mm per year for sites within 10 km of the Gulf of Mexico. These rates match (within error) or exceed SLR over the last 100 years. Sites farther inland than 10 km have slightly lower accretion rates. Throughout the system organic matter accumulation is the most important source material contributing to accretion. The more seaward sites also show an important contribution from carbonate material. Soil cores from the most seaward sites exhibited visual laminations and Ca peaks (determined via x-ray fluorescence). These are indicators of storm surge deposits. While higher sea level might produce more damage and loss of mangrove forest along open water (e.g., Gulf of Mexico), our findings suggest some sites will have enhanced accretion rates due to supplementation with storm surge material.",

Simulations with synthetic data show that the operator-splitting Kalman filtering technique proposed in this study can successfully reconstruct the underlying dynamic evolution of the radiation belts. The method is further verified by the comparison with the conventional Kalman filtering. We applied the new approach to 3-D data assimilation of multiple satellite measurements for two time intervals in 1990-1991 and for 2012-2014. At μ = 700 MeV/G, the cross section of the global reanalysis showed a clear peak in the phase space density, while at a lower energy of 70 MeV/G, the profiles are monotonic. Since the radial profiles are obtained from the global reanalysis, the differences in the profiles reflect the differences in the underlying physical processes responsible for the dynamic evolution of the radiation belt’s energetic and relativistic electrons. Automated identification of the errors and smoothing are also discussed. Our results demonstrate that 3D data assimilation in the radiation belt can be used for understanding the dynamics of the radiation belts, improving the specification models, and developing the new generation forecasting models.",

NCOM incorporates the Oregon State University Tide Model, which should allow the ocean model to accurately reflect the transitional tides in the Bab el Mandeb Strait.

            "abstract": "This talk will introduce notions of culture into the discussion of collaborative communities for the Earth sciences. One often hears that the problems of cyberinfrastructure, or of science in general are “half technical and half social.” While this acknowledges that a purely technical solution is not possible, the reality is that nearly all of the funding for, and the attention and discussion about new collaborative communities is focused on technology. Recent attention to the need for governance (as opposed to management) has opened up some welcome conversations about the role of engagement in the success of collaborative communities.\nThe talk will present the notion that the “half-social” side of the problem is also at least half again a cultural side. After clearing up some common misperceptions on the term “culture,” the talk will explore the work of culture within science from its beginning and the availability of cultural tools to advance the vision and goals for collaborative communities in the Earth science. The emergence of organizational culture as the primary organizing feature of start-up companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere presents new opportunities to reflect on the intentional use of cultural tools to sustain engagement in support of active, open science.\nNumerous critiques are now available for the cultural shortcomings of current scientific institutions, from universities, to agencies, to publishing houses. Indeed, institutional cultural factors are often seen as refractory to any intervention. The talk will present arguments that new models for intentional cultural work within emerging collaborative communities can serve to displace aspects of institutional culture that now work against the expansion of open science and shared data. Indeed, it may be that somewhat more than half of the remaining problems for open science can be solved through the use of reflexively applied intentional culture.",

            "abstract": "TEMPEST addresses key science needs related to cloud and precipitation processes using a constellation of five CubeSats with identical five-frequency millimeter-wave radiometers spaced 5-10 minutes apart in orbit. The deployment of CubeSat constellations on satellite launches of opportunity allows Earth system observations to be accomplished with greater robustness, shorter repeat times and at a small fraction of the cost of typical Earth Science missions. The current suite of Earth-observing satellites is capable of measuring precipitation parameters using radar or radiometric observations. However, these low Earth-orbiting satellites provide only a snapshot of each storm, due to their repeat-pass times of many hours to days. With typical convective events lasting 1-2 hours, it is highly unlikely that the time evolution of clouds through the onset of precipitation will be observed with current assets.\nThe TEMPEST CubeSat constellation directly observes the time evolution of clouds and identifies changes in time to detect the moment of the onset of precipitation. The TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers penetrate into the cloud to directly observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The evolution of ice formation in clouds is important for climate prediction because it largely drives Earth’s radiation budget. TEMPEST improves understanding of cloud processes and helps to constrain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models.\nTEMPEST provides observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 90 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for a 6U CubeSat architecture and fits well within the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) capabilities. Five identical CubeSats deployed in the same orbital plane with 5-10 minute spacing at 390-450 km altitude and 50-65 degree inclination capture 3 million observations of precipitation, including 100,000 deep convective events in a one-year mission. TEMPEST provides critical information on the time evolution of cloud and precipitation microphysics, thereby yielding a first-order understanding of how assumptions in current cloud-model parameterizations behave in diverse climate regimes.",

            "abstract": "The change in the Arctic climate is fast and broad. Among many changes that have been observed, the reduction of sea ice coverage has been one of the most significant factors. Continued reduction in sea ice cover will probably result in longer open water duration, which is important for the shipping industry, marine mammals as well as other component of the local ecosystem. In this study we are to assess future sea ice conditions, particularly the length of open water duration in the Alaskan Arctic over the next few decades using the latest coupled climate models (CMIP5). The Alaskan Arctic, including the Chukchi and the Beaufort Sea, has been a major region of summer sea ice retreat since 2007. Based on the mean of 12 climate models, for the region north of the Bering Strait (70° N), future open-water duration may extend from a current 3-4 months to around five months by 2050. It is about one month shorter along the same latitude over the Beaufort Sea. The difference in the length of ice-free season between the north and the south will remain, but will be smaller in the 21st century compared with current condition. Open-water duration in the Alaskan Arctic expands quickly in these models over the next decades, in contrast to model under-predictions of sea ice loss for the summer minimum over the Arctic wide domain. Uncertainty is generally ±one month estimated from the range of model results. Continued increases in open-water duration over the next two decades will impact regional economic access and potentially alter ecosystems, yet we need to keep in mind that from December through May most of the northern Alaskan Arctic will remain sea ice covered into the second half of the century.",

            "abstract": "The difficulty in defining the timing of plate collision is in part because it can be diachronous, but the main issue is what geological data are used to determine when collision occurred. Many consider India-Asia collision is marked by (1) a change from marine to continental sedimentation in the Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone (ITSZ); (2) the end of I-type granite production in the Trans-Himalayan Batholith and (3) the first development of south-facing folds and thrusts in the ITSZ. Yet there are two possible periods when sedimentation changed from marine to continental in the ITSZ, multiple switches of I- and S-type granite genesis occurred at different times along the orogen and it is difficult to precisely date episodes of shortening. Metamorphic ages are also interpreted to mark collision, yet such rocks often form due to extension.\nOthers propose that collision can be identified by deceleration of the Indian plate at ~65-50 Ma. However, as India was situated thousands of kilometres south of Eurasia at this time, this scenario is only possible if one extends the northern margin of India or the southern margin of Eurasia to arbitrarily “fill the gap”. It is more likely that India’s rapid deceleration was caused by collision with an intraoceanic island arc and death of one of the subduction zones that existed between India and Eurasia during the late Cretaceous.\nStudies of much younger collision zones in SE Asia show that uplift is rapid and commonly associated with phases of extension rather than crustal shortening, meaning that a change from marine to continental sedimentation does not require plate collision. Pulses of rapid uplift also mean rapid erosion will occur, so key evidence is often removed. It is also important to consider the geometry of colliding continental margins. SE Asia provides some insight into the complexity of collision, extension and margin geometries. For example, continued northward motion of Australia has already resulted in collision between different parts of the former Australian continent. Such complexities are rarely considered in tectonic models of the India-Eurasia system. Arguments concerned with the timing of India and Asia collision will continue unless we reconsider the criteria used to define collision.",

            "abstract": "This decade has seen a surge of interest in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) as a means of generating high-resolution topography and coregistered texture maps from stereo digital photographs. Using an unstructured set of overlapping photographs captured from multiple viewpoints and minimal GPS ground control, SfM solves simultaneously for scene topography and camera positions, orientations and lens parameters. The use of cheap unmanned aerial vehicles or tethered helium balloons as camera platforms expedites data collection and overcomes many of the cost, time and logistical limitations of LiDAR surveying, making it a potentially valuable tool for rapid response mapping and repeat monitoring applications. We begin this presentation by assessing what data resolutions and precisions are achievable using a simple aerial camera platform and commercial SfM software (we use the popular Agisoft Photoscan package). SfM point clouds generated at two small (~0.1 km2), sparsely-vegetated field sites in California compare favorably with overlapping airborne and terrestrial LiDAR surveys, with closest point distances of a few centimeters between the independent datasets. Next, we go on to explore the method in more challenging conditions, in response to a major landslide in Mesa County, Colorado, on 25th May 2014. Photographs collected from a small UAV were used to generate a high-resolution model of the 4.5 x 1 km landslide several days before an airborne LiDAR survey could be organized and flown. An initial estimate of the mass balance of the landslide could quickly be made by differencing this model against pre-event topography generated using stereo photographs collected in 2009 as part of the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). This case study therefore demonstrates the rich potential offered by this technique, as well as some of the challenges, particularly with respect to the treatment of vegetation.",

The experiments were performed with ModelE2, a new version of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences coupled general circulation model that includes three different versions for the atmospheric composition components: a non-interactive version (NINT) with prescribed composition and a tuned aerosol indirect effect (AIE), the TCAD version with fully interactive aerosols, whole-atmosphere chemistry and the tuned AIE , and the TCADI version which further includes a parameterized first indirect aerosol effect on clouds. Each atmospheric version is coupled to two different ocean general circulation models: the Russell ocean model (GISS-E2-R) and HYCOM (GISS-E2-H).\nBy 2100, global mean warming in the RCP scenarios ranges from 1.0ºC to 4.5ºC relative to 1850-1860 mean temperature in the historical simulations. In the RCP2.6 scenario, the surface warming in all simulations stays below a 2°C threshold at the end of the twenty-first century. For RCP8.5, the range is 3.5-4.5ºC at 2100. Decadally averaged sea ice area changes are highly correlated to global mean surface air temperature anomalies and show steep declines in both hemispheres, with a larger sensitivity during winter months.\nBy the year 2500, there are complete recoveries of the globally averaged surface air temperature for all versions of the GISS climate model in the low forcing scenario RCP2.6. TCADI simulations show enhanced warming due to greater sensitivity to CO2, aerosol effects and greater methane feedbacks. Both coupled models have decreases in the Atlantic overturning streamfunction by 2100. In RCP2.6 there is a complete recovery of the Atlantic overturning stream function by the year 2500 while with scenario RCP8.5. E2-R climate model produces a complete shutdown of the Atlantic overturning in the RCP8.5 while it reaches the equilibrium state of 35-40% of the control simulation in the E2-H model by the end of 25th century.",

            "abstract": "Sub-meter resolution airborne LiDAR topography comprises a critical part of the research infastructure along several major active faults in western North America, where it provides a topographic baseline against which future, post-earthquake LiDAR surveys can be differenced. Here, we describe two differencing methods - one based on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm, the other on cross-correlation techniques - that enable the 3-D surface deformation field to be determined. This contrasts with conventional InSAR and pixel-tracking techniques which measure line-of-sight and horizontal displacement components only. An additional advantage is that LiDAR differencing retains coherence in the presence of steep displacement gradients, such as close to surface ruptures, and it is therefore well-suited for probing the slip distribution and mechanical properties of the shallow part of the fault zone. We illustrate using two recent Mw ~7 earthquakes in Mexico and Japan which are the first near-complete ruptures to be captured in this way. For the 4 April 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah (Mexico) earthquake, the 3-D displacements are used to explore whether significant slip occurred on low-angle detachment faults, as has been postulated by some field geologists. For the 11 April 2011 Fukushima-Hamadori (Japan) earthquake, coherent LiDAR displacements from the interior part of the fault zone are used to help bridge a critical observational gap between surface faulting offsets (measured in the field) and slip occurring at depths of a few kilometers (inferred from InSAR). Challenges include the treatment of vegetation and the dependence on older, \"legacy\" LiDAR datasets - third party surveys which were not optimized for earthquake studies and for which important data acquisition and processing metrics are unavailable.",

A large amount of effort has been dedicated to studies in the polar regions, and more generally the full view of the atmospheric and geospace environment is only possible through international collaborations. Incoherent scatter (IS) radar systems are important research tools in the studies of the upper atmosphere and the ionosphere. The standard high-level data from these systems contain electron density, electron and ion temperatures, and line-of-sight plasma flow as functions of time and altitude.\nThere are about a dozen active ISR systems in the world at the present. Three of these systems are operated in Europe by the EISCAT Scientific Association. These are located in the northernmost region of the Scandinavian peninsula and on Svalbard. EISCAT is also currently preparing for construction of the new multi-static phased array radar EISCAT_3D. MIT Haystack Observatory, Cornell University and SRI International operate the major US incoherent scatter radars, several of which are also located at high latitudes. The European and American IS radar communities are already relatively well integrated and carry out coordinated observations, common workshops and meetings. They all use the Madrigal distributed database system for data archiving and distribution.\nIn order to achieve greater interoperability, shared data structures, practices and standards are developed within the COOPEUS project. Three common levels of IS data exist (raw samples, intermediate correlated data, and analysed data) and the intermediate level has been initially selected for further harmonization. Intermediate level data represent a convenient form for exchange and storage, because the data volume has already been decreased to a more manageable level through temporal and spatial averaging while still retaining sufficient information for further analysis.\nGoals for future collaborations are to reach further harmonization at higher data levels between different radars, combined with other databases used for space weather research and with databases of other environmental research infrastructures.",

Using recent modifications to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) IPCC AR5 General Circulation Model (GCM) we have explored the Inner Edge of the habitable zone (HZ) of our Solar System. We find that while Venus is currently outside the HZ, it may have been close to or within it early in Solar System history when the solar luminosity was lower and an ocean may have been present.\nThe GISS GCM maintains habitable equilibrium surface temperatures for a solar constant 40% stronger than present day Earth (comparable to the Faint Young Sun at Venus' orbit) even if Venus rotated as rapidly as Earth early in its history. Stratospheric water vapor concentration is an order of magnitude smaller than the classical water loss limit for this simulation. We have also explored the parameter space in models with slower rotation rates. Our results are based on an atmosphere coupled to two different Earth ocean models, one a 100m mixed layer ocean with no ocean heat transport, and a second with a fully coupled dynamic ocean. Negative cloud feedbacks due to increasing high, thick clouds in the tropics as the planet warms appear to be the stabilizing mechanism, along with maintenance of subsaturated water vapor by the general circulation.",

All data are matched in time and space at the native instrument pixel resolution and MERRA gridding in order to retain the statistical variance and co-variance of geophysical data that is often lost in analyses with gridded Level-3 data. The cloud organization is defined by the mean, variance, and skewness of visible reflectance and infrared radiance from the AIRS and MODIS instruments. We show that MBL depth and lower tropospheric humidity increase in a transition from stratocumulus clouds that are characterized by Gaussian reflectances and radiances, to trade cumulus where the reflectances and radiances become highly skewed. Furthermore, shallow precipitation occurrence from CloudSat, wind speed and direction from MERRA, and lower tropospheric MSE and relative humidity are shown to relate to these cloud organizational states. We compare these satellite-derived observations against published results from the Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) field campaign and large eddy simulation (LES) modeling experiments that provide testable relationships among cloud organization, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed and direction.",

            "abstract": "In the digital era, the Sunda arc has been the site of sixteen large and great (MW>7.0) earthquakes that generated oftimes devastating tsunamis. In contrast, the largest tsunami earthquakes along the Aleutian arc occurred in the pre-digital era. Given the tectonic and geological commonalities between the two arcs, such as oblique plate convergence and long sediment-rich sections of trench, it is natural to ask whether the numerous and well-recorded Sunda events can serve as analogs to the more sparse Aleutian events for insight into seismic and tsunami potential. The large earthquakes are examined in the context of moderate-sized earthquakes (5.5<Me <7.0, where Me is energy magnitude) that occurred from 1987 to 2013. Using broadband hypocenters and radiated energies, we delineate fine details of the subduction zone and assess maturity of the faults. In the Sunda arc, energy release for moderate events was predominantly along the peripheries of the rupture zones of large events. Rather than on the slab interface, they often occurred on splay faults in the overriding plate, on perturbations of the slab interface under the outer-arc high or alongside obliquely subducted ridges and fracture zones. High strength regions (identified by high energy-release faults) resisted rupture during large earthquakes. Other splays seemed tsunami-capable. The greatest tsunamis came from earthquakes with rupture confined to the shallow forearc seaward of the outer-arc high, while greater seismic damage came from earthquakes confined to the deep forearc behind the outer-arc high. For the Aleutians, only two large events occurred during the same time period. But, like Sunda, the numerous moderate-sized events tended to demarcate the periphery of the rupture zone of past large events. Some splays with tsunami potential were observed, but the majority of events occurred at slab bends and around subducting fracture zones and seamounts, rather than about the subdued outer-arc high.",

            "abstract": "Over the past century, the geology curriculum at Oregon State University has remained constant in some areas and changed in others in response to internal (faculty and university) and external (economic, and intellectual) drivers. A decadal summary of 100 years of the geology curriculum at Oregon State University reveals socio-economic patterns. From 1913, when the School of Mines was established, to 1932, when it was dismembered, the geology curriculum was designed in support mining engineering. In that time, the geology department (est. 1914) moved from the School of Mines to the School of Science. Several decades of paleontology-intensive curriculum followed under the leadership of noted paleontologist Earl Packard, as dean and chair. The curriculum transitioned from support of the oil industry in the 60s and 70s, with a strong field emphasis engendered by “Doc” Wilkinson, to increased structure and tectonics emphasis in response to the tectonic revolution under the leadership of structural geologist Robert Yeats. In the last few decades the program has grown diverse in environmental and climatic interests.\n The early curriculum required a three-course series in determinative mineralogy plus petrography and 3 courses in petrology (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic), making a core of seven; we require 3 courses today. Like all students in the School of Mines, those with the geology specialization were required to take a field course in surveying and to spend several summer months working in the mining industry. This strong field tradition persisted through time with an introductory field methods class coupled with a summer field camp. The total number of weeks dedicated to field classes, excluding the work experience requirement, has varied from as high as 12 credit-hours to the present 6 (quarters basis). On the other hand, increased short field experiences are reflected by incorporation of more field trips in nearly all courses since the 80’s, fostered by accessible transportation.\n General education courses delivered by geology faculty have mimicked these changes, from early service courses in basic geology for engineering, mining and agriculture to a diverse slate of courses from basic geology to natural hazards and climate.",

            "abstract": "Selenite-contaminated groundwater can be biologically remediated in-situ by supplying an electron donor to promote the growth of selenite-reducing bacteria. We studied the fate of selenite during in-situ bioremediation using a microfluidic flow cell containing a homogeneous distribution of pores. The flow cell had two inlets: one for selenite supply, and the other for propionate (electron donor) supply. The media contained sulfate, which is common in groundwater and can affect selenite reduction. During the 5-month operation, biomass and selenite reduction products were periodically imaged using a phase contrast microscope and an environmental scanning electron microscope. Selenite reduction products were further characterized using Raman spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Three types of crystals were detected in the mixing zone between selenite and propionate, and they occurred in different locations of the mixing zone. On the selenite side, selenite was biologically reduced to elemental selenium in the monoclinic form. Along the centerline, sulfate was biologically reduced to sulfide, which chemically reacted with selenite to form the second type of crystal (selenium sulfide). On the propionate side, selenium sulfide was biologically reduced to elemental selenium in the trigonal form. A mathematical model was developed to explain the segregation of the three crystals. On the selenite side, bacteria preferred selenite to sulfate since selenite can provide more energy for bacteria growth according to thermodynamics. On the propionate side, selenite was limiting; thus bacteria used selenium sulfide as their electron acceptor. Understanding this segregation can help to predict in-situ bioremediation of selenite-contaminated groundwater. Conventional prediction models consider the reaction on the selenite side as the only path of selenite removal, while a model considering the three paths of selenite removal would increase the prediction accuracy.",

We will review a range of experiment results that illustrate large-scale ionospheric effects when the HF frequencies used are close to electron gyro-harmoncs and we focus mainly on the 3rd and 4th harmonics. The data are primarily from the UHF diagnosticc radar and total electron content (TEC) observations through the heated topside ionosphere. Radar data for HF frequencies just above and just below gyro harmoncs show significant differences in radar scatter cross-section that suggest differing plasma processes, and this effect is HF power dependent with some effects only observable with full HF power. For the production of artificial ionization in the E-region when the HF frequency is near gyro-harmoncs the results differ significantly for relatively small (50 kHz) variations in the HF frequency. We show how slow FM scans in conjunction with gyro-harmonic effects are effective in producing artificial ionization in the lower ionosphere.\nIn the topside ionosphere enhanced density and upward fluxes have been observed and these may act as effective ducts for the propagation of VLF waves upward into the magneosphere. Experimental techniques have been developed that may be used to continuously maintain these effects in the topside ionossphere.",

            "abstract": "Assessing potential climate effects of fossil-fuel electricity generations, especially natural gas versus coal electricity generation is complicated by the large number of factors reported in life cycle assessment studies, compounded by the large number of proposed climate metrics. Thus, there is a need to identify the key factors affecting the climate effects of fossil-fuel electricity generations (especially natural gas and coal based electricity production), and to present these climate effects in as clear and transparent a way as possible. Here, we identify power plant efficiencies and methane emission rates as the factors that explain most of the variance in greenhouse gas emissions by natural gas and coal power plants. Thus, we focus on the roles of these factors in determining the relative merit of natural gas and coal power plants. We develop a simple model with estimating CH4 and CO2 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants and resulting climate effects. Simple underlying physical changes can be obscured by abstract evaluation metrics, thus we base our discussion on temperature changes over time. We find that, during the period of plant operation, if there is substantial natural gas leakage, natural gas plants can produce greater near-term warming than a coal plant with the same power output. However, if leakage rates can be made to be low and efficiency high, natural gas plants can produce some reduction in near-term warming. After several centuries of continuous use, natural gas power plants produce substantial warming, but in most cases substantially less warming than would occur with coal plants.",

            "abstract": "When transionospheric radio waves propagate through an irregular ionosphere with plasma depletions or “bubbles”, they are subject to sporadic enhancement and fading which is referred to as scintillation. Communication and navigation systems may be subject to these detrimental effects if the scintillation is strong enough. It is critical to have knowledge of the current ionospheric conditions so that system operators can distinguish between the natural radio environment and system-induced failures. In this paper, we present and describe a proven technique for forecasting UHF scintillation activity in the equatorial region after sunset and compare these forecasts with observed Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) on a night-to-night basis. The UHF scintillation forecasting technique described in Redmon et al. (Space Weather, Vol 8, 2010) utilizes the observed characteristic h’F from a ground-based, ionospheric sounder near the magnetic equator. This paper demonstrated that there exists an excellent correlation (R2 ~ 0.91) between h’F (1930LT) and the pre-reversal enhancement in vertical ExB drift velocity after sunset which is the prime driver for creating plasma depletions and bubbles. In addition, there exists a “threshold” in the h’F value at 1930 LT, h’Fthr, which can be used to predict post-sunset scintillation activity. A digital sounder near the magnetic equator provides the h’F values and the observations of ESF. The digital sounders are located at Jicamarca, Peru; Sao Luis, Brazil; Ilorin, Nigeria; Guam and the Kwajalein Atoll. The years that are covered are in 2010, 2011 and 2013. A previous study carried out at Jicamarca for 2013 which correlated the forecast of scintillation activity and the occurrence or non-occurrence of ESF achieved an overall forecasting success of 90%. The important aspect of this study is to determine if this high success rate can be achieved in different longitude sectors.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial vegetation influences hydrologic cycling. In water-limited, dryland ecosystems, altered ecohydrology as a consequence of vegetation change can impact vegetation structure, ecological functioning and ecosystem services. Shrub steppe ecosystems dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) are widespread across western North America but have been altered over the past century, and changes are likely to continue. The ecohydrological consequences of sagebrush removal and reestablishment remains unclear. To characterize the immediate and medium-term patterns of water cycling and availability following sagebrush plant community alteration, we applied the SOILWAT ecosystem water balance model to 898 sites across the distribution of sagebrush ecosystems, representing the three primary big sagebrush ecosystem types: sagebrush shrublands, sagebrush steppe and montane sagebrush. At each site we examined three vegetation conditions representing intact sagebrush, recently disturbed sagebrush and recovered but grass-dominated vegetation. Transition from shrub to grass dominance decreased precipitation interception and transpiration and increased soil evaporation and deep drainage. Relative to intact big sagebrush vegetation, simulated soils in the herbaceous vegetation phases typically had drier surface layers and wetter deep layers. Our simulations suggested that alterations in ecosystem water balance may be most pronounced in vegetation representing recently disturbed conditions (herbaceous vegetation with low biomass) and modest in conditions representing recovered, but still grass-dominated, vegetation. The ecohydrological impact of simulated big sagebrush removal depended on climate; while short-term changes in water balance were greatest in wet areas represented by the montane sagebrush ecosystem type, medium-term impacts were greatest in dry areas of sagebrush shrublands and sagebrush steppe.",

This has significant implications for global climate, hydrology, water resources, and global sea level. Physical evidences of changes observed in the cryosphere are: (a) Duration of ice cover of rivers and lakes in high latitudes of N. H. decreased by about two weeks over the 20th Century; (b) Significant retreat of glaciers world wide during the 20th Century; (c) Thinning of Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness by about 40% in late summer in recent decades, with the minimum sea ice concentration mapped by the SSM/I sensor of NASA in 2007; (d) Snow cover decreased in area by about 10% since global observations by satellites began in the late 1960s, in various places of the Northern Hemisphere; (e) In North America, snow water equivalent decreased by about 10mm since observations by passive microwave sensors began in the late 1970s; (f) Degradations of permafrost have been detected in some parts of the polar and sub-polar regions, and (g) The total 20th Century global average sea level rise was about 0.17m, likely due to decline in glaciers, snow, ice sheets, and losses from Greenland and Antarctica ice.

            "abstract": "Emissions from large point sources (electricity generation and large-scale industry) of fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) emissions are currently determined from self-reported “bottom-up” inventory data, with an uncertainty of about 20% for individual power plants. As the world moves towards a regulatory environment, there is a need for independent, objective measurements of these emissions both to improve the accuracy of and to verify the reported amounts.\n“Top-down” atmospheric methods have the potential to independently constrain point source emissions, combining observations with atmospheric transport modeling to derive emission estimates. We use the Kapuni Gas Treatment Plant to examine methodologies and model sensitivities for atmospheric monitoring of point source fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) emissions. The Kapuni plant, located in rural New Zealand, removes and vents CO2 from locally extracted natural gas at a rate of ~0.1 Tg carbon per year. We measured the CO2ff content in three different types of observations: air samples collected in flasks over a period of a few minutes, sodium hydroxide solution exposed the atmosphere, and grass samples from the surrounding farmland, the latter two representing ~1 week integrated averages. We use the WindTrax Lagrangian plume dispersion model to compare these atmospheric observations with “expected” values given the emissions reported by the Kapuni plant. The model has difficulty accurately capturing the short-term variability in the flask samples but does well in representing the longer-term averages from grass samples, suggesting that passive integrated-sampling methods have the potential to monitor long-term emissions. Our results indicate that using this method, point source emissions can be verified to within about 30%.\nFurther improvements in atmospheric transport modelling are needed to reduce uncertainties. In view of this, we discuss model strengths and weaknesses and explore model sensitivity to meteorological conditions. In particular, we look at how much of the variation in our observations can be attributed to changing emissions levels and how much is a result of natural climate and atmospheric transport variations that remain unconstrained by our model and input data.",

            "abstract": "Coral reefs provide an increasingly important archive of palaeoclimate data that can be used to constrain climate model simulations. Reconstructing past environments may also provide insights into the potential of reef systems to survive changes in the Earth’s climate. Geochemically based climate reconstructions are predominately acquired from massive Porites colonies, yet there remain significant spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding of climate evolution where no suitable coralla have been recovered. Branching corals are commonly the dominant species in modern reef facies and their abundance suggests an untapped source for this missing information. The potential of ‘inter-branch skeleton’ in corymbose Acropora to act as a new palaeoclimate archive is significant. Scanning Electron Microscopy of inter-branch skeleton in Acropora from Heron Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef, reveals a lack of secondary thickening deposits that typically characterize Acropora branches and renders them unsuitable for geochemical archives. Annual density banding, similar to that used for chronological determination of geochemical sampling in massive corals, is also observed within Acropora inter-branch skeleton. Clear seasonal signals in Sr/Ca within the skeletal structure will be correlated against the network of in situ temperature recorders in Heron lagoon and on the southern reef slope to provide a new palaeotemperature transfer equation.",

Iron cycling is inherently linked to EET, as both reduced iron (electron donors), and oxidized iron (electron acceptors) can be found as insoluble minerals, and require specialized molecular machines to accomplish these extracellular geobiological reactions. Bacteria in the group Shewanella are able to catalyze EET in both directions, and are involved with a number of different iron conversions, but are not good role models for extreme conditions – to our knowledge there are no shewanellae that are tolerant to extremes of temperature or pH, the two usual. This being said, when cells are energy starved via limitation for electron acceptors, they respond by turning on the system(s) for EET. Thus, in this presentation the known mechanism(s) of EET will be discussed, along with recent findings and reports of EET-capable organisms from a variety of extreme environments. From these data, I put forward the hypothesis that there are many microbes (many of them from extreme environments) that will be resistant to cultivation by “standard microbiological methods”, yet lend themselves well to cultivation via electrochemical methods.",

We briefly review Taylor’s classic work and then apply these same principles to a case of sea fog formation and dissipation off the coast of California. The resources used in this study consist of: 1) land-based surface and upper-air observations, 2) NDBC (National Data Buoy Center) observations from moored buoys equipped to measure dew point temperature as well as the standard surface observations at sea (wind, sea surface temperature, pressure, and air temperature), 3) satellite observations of cloud, and 4) a one-dimensional (vertically directed) boundary layer model that tracks with the surface air motion and makes use of sophisticated turbulence-radiation parameterizations. Results of the investigation indicate that delicate interplay and interaction between the radiation and turbulence processes makes accurate forecasts of sea fog onset unlikely in the near future. This pessimistic attitude stems from inadequacy of the existing network of observations and uncertainties in modeling dynamical processes within the boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary means to assess the numerical and physics modeling accuracy, respectively, in computational simulation. Code verification assesses the reliability of the software coding and the numerical algorithms used in obtaining a solution, while solution verification addresses numerical error estimation of the computational solution of a mathematical model for a specified set of initial and boundary conditions. Validation assesses the accuracy of the mathematical model as compared to experimentally measured response quantities of the system being modeled. As these experimental data are typically available only for simplified subsystems or components of the system, model validation commonly provides limited ability to assess model accuracy directly. Uncertainty quantification (UQ), specifically in regard to predictive capability of a mathematical model, attempts to characterize and estimate the total uncertainty for conditions where no experimental data are available. Specific sources of uncertainty that can impact the total predictive uncertainty are: the assumptions and approximations in the formulation of the mathematical model, the error incurred in the numerical solution of the discretized model, the information available for stochastic input data for the system, and the extrapolation of the mathematical model to conditions where no experimental data are available. This presentation will briefly discuss the principles and practices of VVUQ from both the perspective of computational modeling and simulation, as well as the difficult issue of estimating predictive capability. Contrasts will be drawn between weak and strong code verification testing, and model validation as opposed to model calibration. Closing remarks will address what needs to be done to improve the value of information generated by computational simulation for improved decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Interflow can occur in any slope where higher conductivity topsoils are underlain by a low conductivity impeding layer which could include B horizons, till layers, hardpans, C horizons and bedrock of various permeabilities. Impeding layers of essentially impermeable bedrock seem to be a rarity, as studies that have evaluated interflow on slopes underlain by apparently solid crystalline rock have still found leakage into the rock. Hewlett’s concrete soil trough studies thus comprise an endpoint of interflow boundary conditions. In many hillslope environments, downslope interflow necessarily includes a normal flow component into the leaky impeding layer. By making a simplifying assumption of zero pressure at the base of the impeding layer (for perched conditions), the downslope travel distance as interflow of a parcel of water can be estimated from the ratio of the hydraulic conductivities, the ratio of the downslope and normal hydraulic gradients, and the thickness of the saturated zone above the impeding layer. For many hillslopes, downslope travel distances imply that only the slope segments adjacent to the riparian valley can be expected to deliver interflow to the valley during a storm. Over most of the hillslope, interflow acts only to redistribute recharge downslope from the point of infiltration. Therefore, continuous perching of water moving as interflow from the ridge to the valley does not imply continuous connectivity. In terms of stormflow contributions, only the lower slopes within the range of the downslope travel distance may be connected to stream valleys.",

            "abstract": "Where substorm onset occurs in the plasma sheet is one of the central questions to substorm research but remains undetermined. Current magnetic field models are not developed specifically for the substorm growth phase, and thus are not reliable for determining the equatorial mapping location of the auroral onset. Recently, we have established empirical modeling of 3D force-balanced pressure and magnetic field configurations for the substorm growth phase. Our model first predicts pressure corresponding to time integrated solar wind loading and AE, solar wind dynamic pressure, and sunspot number. It then computes 3D magnetic field in force balance with the modeled pressure. In this study, we empirically modeled the growth phase of one substorm event on March 5, 2008 at 06:04 UT, during which three THEMIS probes were at the duskside plasma sheet with large radial separations and two GOES satellites were near midnight. There was also good aurora coverage showing onset occurring at ~67° near midnight. As the substorm growth phase develops, the overall pressure increases in response mainly to the increasing solar wind energy loading, while field lines become more stretched with Bz decreasing in the near Earth region but increasing in the tail. The modeled pressure and magnetic field and their evolutions match reasonably well with the observations at all THEMIS and GOES locations. In addition, the latitude of computed proton isotropic boundary, an indicator of the equatorial boundary of proton precipitation due to current sheet scattering, also matches well with the equatorward edge of observed proton aurora and its equatorward motion. These comparisons clearly show that our model realistically represents the overall magnetic field configuration during this event. The equatorial mapping of the auroral onset thus reliably indicates that the onset of this substorm should have occurred at r = ~13 RE in the tail plasma sheet. More events will be modeled to statistically determine the equatorial onset location.",

            "abstract": "Shallow cumulus clouds are intimately tied to the turbulence in the boundary layer and transport momentum and enthalpy upwards from the surface. These clouds have a significant impact on the Earth’s radiation budget as they reflect more incoming solar radiation back to space compared to the underlying surface. They form when water vapor is transported upwards from the surface above the lifting condensation level at which point the water vapor condenses to form cloud droplets. These clouds typically have a life-time of less than an hour after which they evaporate, with the active cumuli venting the boundary layer moisture into the free troposphere.\nWe use data collected during a 24-hour period at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) observing facility at Darwin, Australia to study the turbulent transport of mass and water vapor associated with shallow cumulus clouds. The instruments at the site include a vertically pointing Doppler cloud radar, Doppler Lidar, ceilometer among others. Three balloon borne radiosondes were also launched during the study period. Data from the cloud radar and Doppler Lidar were combined to retrieve the vertical velocity structure of the entire boundary layer at a high resolution (2 sec; 30 m). Additionally, high resolution (10 s; 37 m) retrievals of water vapor mixing ratio were also performed using the data collected by the collocated Raman Lidar.\nWe will use the high resolution observations of vertical velocity and water vapor to characterize the second order turbulent transport terms of water vapor and vertical velocity. These turbulent transport terms will then be used together with a parcel model to calculate entrainment rates of individual cloud elements. The contrast in the entrainment rates of forced, active and passive cumuli will be presented together with the moisture and dynamic structure of surrounding environmental air.",

            "abstract": "The auroral sounding rocket mission MICA provides an observational case study of nightside auroral ionospheric conductivity and field structuring, and the relationship of this structure to small-scale downward (return) currents. A large-scale current sheet is observed within an auroral arc, with a scale size comparable to that of the arc. Fine-scale return current structures are seen poleward of the visible arc, with scale sizes comparable to the structuring seen at the boundary of the visible arc. Interpretation of the field signatures as indicators of curl B and div E requires careful consideration of the arc geometry and the obliqueness of the measurement trajectory. Ground imaging data and collocated PFISR observations provide context for the in situ observations. The in situ observations starkly illustrate the inability of the radar to capture the small-scale structuring involved in the ionospheric feedback as indicated by the in situ observations. Upgoing Poynting flux and downward currents in the return current region have scale sizes of kilometers or less in the perpendicular-to-B direction, compared to a PFISR resolution of tens of km (limited by beam spacing for our experiment.) We present comparisons of the observed field-aligned current strengths to terms of the current continuity equation involving gradients of the Pedersen conductivity and the divergence of E, and discuss ionospheric sourcing of return currents. We compare the observations to the calculations of an ionospheric electrostatic model, and discuss the requirements for capturing the ionospheric responses to auroral drivers.",

            "abstract": "Higher nickel, vanadium, and lead concentrations measured in sea bottom sediment of the eastern OCS can be explained by the presence of a new source for these metals from the damaged Mconco Well which resulted in the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill during the spring of 2010. Sixty-five sediment samples were collected during the fall months for the years 2008-2011 from the eastern OCS. The Tukey range test was used to compare six metal concentrations between the relict sand deposits of the northern Gulf OCS to the relict carbonate sediments off of western Florida OCS. Tests indicated that nickel, vanadium, and lead were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the seasonal mean concentrations in the relict sand deposits. These higher concentrations are also reflected in the vanadium to nickel ratio being statistically different (p < 0.005) for carbonate sediment (1.70 ± 0.24) when compared to relict sand (0.96 ± 0.12) in the north, which is closer to the damaged well. This difference indicates a new source of nickel that accumulated through time in the north. In the carbonate sediment there appears a zonation of the ratios with a dependency on water depth. The V/Ni ratio is 0.80 ± 0.10 for samples taken in water depths at or deeper than 200 m; and ratios are 2.06 ±0.42 for samples taken in water depths shallower than 200 m.",

            "abstract": "While most general circulation models assume spectrally independent surface emissivity and non-scattering clouds in their longwave radiation treatment, spectral variation of the index of refraction of ice indicates that, in the far-IR, snow surface emissivity can vary considerably and ice clouds can cause non-negligible scattering. These effects are more important for high-elevation polar continents where the dry and cold atmosphere is not opaque in the far-IR. We carry out two sensitivity studies to show that in a winter month over the Antarctic Plateau, including snow surface spectral emissivity and ice cloud scattering in radiative transfer calculation reduce net upward far-IR flux at both top of atmosphere and surface. The magnitudes of such reduction in monthly-mean all-sky far-IR flux range from 0.72 to 1.47 Wm-2, with comparable contributions from the cloud scattering and the surface spectral emissivity. The reduction is also sensitive to sizes of both snow grains and cloud particles. We hope that this study can raise enough attention in both modeling and observational communities to further look into these issues and improve the representations of these far-IR radiative properties and processes in GCMs.",

            "abstract": "We develop numerical schemes for solving global scale Stokes flow systems employing the “sticky air” (approximate free surface) boundary condition. Our target application considers the dynamics of planetary growth involving long time-scale global core formation process, for which the interaction between the surface geometry and interior dynamics play an important role (e.g. Golabek et.al. 2009, Lin et.al. 2009). The solution of Stokes flow problems including a free surface is one of the grand challenges of computational geodynamics due to the numerical instability arising at the deformable surface (e.g. Kaus et.al. 2010, Duretz et.al. 2011, Kramer et.al. 2012).\nHere, we present two strategies for the efficient solution of the Stokes flow system using the “spherical Cartesian” approach (Gerya and Yuen 2007). The first technique addresses the robustness of the Stokes flow with respect to the viscosity jump arising between the sticky air and planetary body (e.g. Furuichi et.al. 2009). For this we employ preconditioned iterative solvers utilising mixed precision arithmetic (Furuich et.al. 2011). Our numerical experiment shows that the mixed precision approach using double-double precision arithmetic improves convergence of the Krylov solver w.r.t to increasing viscosity jump without significantly increasing the calculation time (~20%). The second strategy introduces an implicit advection scheme for the stable time integration for the deformable free surface. The Stokes flow system becomes numerically stiff when the dynamical time scale associated with the surface deformation is very short in comparison to the time scale associated with other physical process, such as thermal convection. In this work, we propose to treat the advection as a coordinate non-linearity coupled to the momentum equation, thereby defining a fully implicit time integration scheme. Such an integrator scheme permits large time step size to be used without introducing spurious numerical oscillations. The non-linear equations defined by the implicit time integration scheme are solved using a JFNK framework (Knoll and Keyes 2004). We have conducted a series of numerical experiments which clarify the trade-off’s between the computational cost associated with solving the non-linear problem and time step size.",

            "abstract": "Pore-scale network modeling has become an effective method for accurate prediction and upscaling of macroscopic properties in porous media. Computational and imaging restrictions generally limit the network size to the order of 1.0 mm3 (few thousand pores). For extremely heterogeneous media these models are not large enough to capture the petrophysical properties of the entire medium and inaccurate results can be obtained when upscaling to the continuum scale. Moreover, the boundary conditions imposed are artificial; a pressure gradient is imposed in one dimension so the influence of flow behavior in the surrounding media is not included. Here we model flow and transport at the pore scale but develop hybrid multiscale techniques to bridge the pore and macro-scales. Novel domain decomposition methods are used for upscaling; finite element mortars are used as a mathematical tool to ensure interfacial pressures and fluxes are matched at the interfaces of the networks boundaries. The results compare favorably to the more computationally intensive (and impractical) approach of upscaling the media as a single model. Moreover, the results are much more accurate than traditional hierarchal upscaling methods. This upscaling technique has important implications for using pore-scale models directly in reservoir simulators in a multiscale setting.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes and ponds that form on thawing permafrost landscapes have long been recognized as biogeochemical reactors that emit significant amounts of CH4 and CO2. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the exact contribution of these water bodies to the global carbon cycle, in large part because of the paucity of observations from different ecosystem types across the circumpolar North, and the incomplete understanding of factors that control the balance between methane production (methanogenesis) and loss (methanotrophy). The aim of our research was to address these gaps by focusing on thermokarst lakes in subarctic Canada (eastern Hudson Bay), primarily at the southern limit of permafrost that is experiencing rapid warming, but where limnological changes have received little attention to date. Thermokarst lakes were sampled at five geographical locations that differed in their degree of permafrost degradation, as well as in carbon content and lability. All sampled lakes were supersaturated with CH4, with epilimnetic concentrations varying from CO2 undersaturation in turbid mineral (lithalsa) lakes of the continuous and discontinuous permafrost landscapes, to oversaturation by several orders of magnitude of both CO2 and CH4 in the organic-rich (palsa) lakes, especially in the areas of highly degraded permafrost at its southern limit. Concentrations and fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in these palsa lakes were at or above the highest values reported for thermokarst waters elsewhere. In addition, methane oxidation experiments showed high rates of methanotrophy that substantially reduced the net emission of CH4 from both lithalsa and palsa lake types. Our results imply that subarctic thermokarst lakes, especially those at the northward migrating permafrost margin, may be a major source of greenhouse gases as the circumpolar North continues to warm.",

            "abstract": "The Alaska Earthquake Center conducts tsunami inundation mapping for coastal communities in Alaska, and is currently focused on the southeastern region and communities of Yakutat, Elfin Cove, Gustavus and Hoonah. This activity provides local emergency officials with tsunami hazard assessment, planning, and mitigation tools. At-risk communities are distributed along several segments of the Alaska coastline, each having a unique seismic history and potential tsunami hazard. Thus, a critical component of our project is accurate identification and characterization of potential tectonic and landslide tsunami sources. The primary tectonic element of Southeast Alaska is the Fairweather - Queen Charlotte fault system, which has ruptured in 5 large strike-slip earthquakes in the past 100 years. The 1958 “Lituya Bay\" earthquake triggered a large landslide into Lituya Bay that generated a 540-m-high wave. The M7.7 Haida Gwaii earthquake of October 28, 2012 occurred along the same fault, but was associated with dominantly vertical motion, generating a local tsunami. Communities in Southeast Alaska are also vulnerable to hazards related to locally generated waves, due to proximity of communities to landslide-prone fjords and frequent earthquakes. The primary mechanisms for local tsunami generation are failure of steep rock slopes due to relaxation of internal stresses after deglaciation, and failure of thick unconsolidated sediments accumulated on underwater delta fronts at river mouths. We numerically model potential tsunami waves and inundation extent that may result from future hypothetical far- and near-field earthquakes and landslides. We perform simulations for each source scenario using the Alaska Tsunami Model, which is validated through a set of analytical benchmarks and tested against laboratory and field data. Results of numerical modeling combined with historical observations are compiled on inundation maps and used for site-specific tsunami hazard assessment by emergency planners.",

            "abstract": "Intensive observations of the ocean and atmosphere were conducted in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region during 2-6 July in 2012, as parts of the research project \"Hot Spot in Climate System\" in Japan. Three research vessels were placed along 143E across the KE and carried out simultaneous observations. For the ocean, they conducted XCTD observations across the KE at about 9 locations every 0.25 degee in latitude once a day for 6 days in a row. The present study analyzes the XCTD observations and also the North Pacific hindcast simulation by OFES (OGCM for the Earth Simulator), to explore how the KE and its accompanying front vary on day-to-day timescales and what relationships there are between the changes in the KE and front.\nThe observations show that the mean axis of the density front deviates to the north from the mean current axis above the main pycnocline by about 20-30 km, due to the KE-carrying warm water, indicating that the surface KE current is basically anchored by the fronts below the main pycnocline. The changes in the current and front axes are characterized by a vertically uniform displacement; they both moved northward from 2nd to 5th by about 35km, and then slightly turned back southward afterwards. The front considerably deviated to the north of the current axis in the upper 200m depth from 5th to 6th when the KE started turning to the south, with warm Kuroshio water spread to the north across the current axis. The OFES shows the similar northward displacements of the front, which occur at the time when the KE veers away to the south. The meridional displacement of the KE is associated with the passing of mesoscale frontal waves propagated from the upstream and has a periodicity of about 7-15 days. The OFES suggests that the KE-carrying warm water overshoots to the north and departs from the current axis at the crest of frontal waves, causing the front to move northward above the main pycnocline.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we summarized the latest research achievements in the Collision belt between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze Plates based on the integration of gravity and magnetic anomaly data, fault characteristics, high resolution seismic profiles, petrology, stratigraphic chronology and paleomagnetic data as well as the data collected from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling program, and then discussed the character of the gravity and magnetic anomaly field, the faults distribution pattern in this area, and the Sulu HP-UHP metamorphism terrane and its extension into the South Yellow Sea. The geochemical and isotope geochronology characteristics of eclogite, gneiss of Chaolian island and Qianliyan island of Qianliyan uplift were studied as well.\nIt is proposed that Collision belt of Sino-Korean and Yangtze Plates was Sulu HP-UHP metamorphic belt - Qianliyan uplift. Qianliyan eclogite protolith was probably formed in the late Proterozoic, and its metamorphism time of coesite eclogite-facies was 222±15Ma. The Qianliyan uplift was caused by the northward subduction of the Yangtze plate beneath the Sino-Korean craton during the Indosinian, as part of Sulu HP-UHP metamorphism terrane. The Southern Qianliyan Fault is the boundary fault of the uplift in the south and the north margin of the uplift might be bounded by the extended part of the Qingdao-Rongcheng Fault in the Yellow Sea. And in the east, the uplift is probably ended at the East Marginal Fault of Yellow Sea. The Qianliyan uplift was eroded after the Indosinian and intruded by granite during Early Cretaceous. The southern Qianliyan Fault was reversed to a normal fault at Late Cretaceous, and it controlled Cenozoic deposition of the Northern South Yellow Sea Basin.",

            "abstract": "There is debate as to whether the process of layer parallel shortening (LPS) occurs only during the initial stages of a deformation sequence or whether occurs throughout that deformation sequence. Secondly, there is no consensus on whether LPS is a continuous, steady-state process, or a pulsed process, occurring before the development of each new set of major structures. Structures such as pressure-solution cleavage, stylolite development, reduction of porosity, and pressure solution changes to grain boundaries, which result from LPS, can be identified in the field and estimates of LPS amount can be obtained. Thus it is crucial to understand how these field-based estimates, taken from the end-point of the deformation sequence, relate to the entire deformation sequence.\nFour analog models, run to different final bulk shortening (BS) amounts between 5% and 20%, were used to investigate the relative amounts of tectonic shortening and LPS, which together comprise the total BS. Once the model had been completed and sliced, representative cross-sections were digitized and restored using Move structural software. The amounts of LPS and tectonic shortening were then calculated from these restorations.\nResults indicate that the proportion of LPS, relative to tectonic shortening, is high in the initial stages of deformation (the models with low BS) but then decreases to a lower proportion of the total BS that does not change even as the total BS is increased. A second result is that LPS is most significant in deeper stratigraphic levels, although the same overall pattern as previously is followed at each level. This suggests that LPS is a significant deformation mechanism in the early stages of deformation but becomes less significant as deformation proceeds. LPS estimates from field data therefore need to be placed in the correct tectonostratigraphic and deformation sequence context in order to be properly understood.",

            "abstract": "The Moon’s surface, without any substantial atmosphere, weather, or tectonic activity, is a genuine time capsule for events taking place in our region of the Solar System. Previously, geological maps and crater counting methods were used for age determination for terrains and individual features, such as large craters and basins; however, those methods are extremely time consuming, are limited by image quality and availability and the need to identify small craters over datable regions, and are subject to systematic errors derived from uncertainty in the cratering function and small number statistics. We have recently shown that the rockiness of large craters’ ejecta, derived from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s Diviner thermal radiometer data, provides a new method for determining the ages of Copernican craters (younger than roughly one billion years old). This method is not subject to the constraints of traditional crater counting methods using visible images. Here, we apply this new method to search for variations in the impact flux over the Copernican period. We investigate the size-frequency distributions and ejecta rock abundances of rocky craters five kilometers and larger, and compare the results to canonical relationships for Copernican craters. Because the lunar impact cratering rate is directly related to interactions among near-Earth objects and main belt asteroids, our results will provide a new platform for testing various dynamical hypotheses about the evolution of the asteroid belt and interactions within it.",

            "abstract": "Anchor technology has been widely used to reinforce slopes, underground caverns, deep excavations and the foundation of dams. It has attracted more and more attention of research worldwide on how to find a comfortable method to test the quality of anchoring systems.\nAccording to the characteristics of anchor systems, we set up the kinetic equations and mathematical models, then solved the models using ANSYS / LS-DYNA program. We found that the simulated mathematical models perfectly match the experimental data. By changing one of the parameters or the input conditions in the model, we were able to understand the characteristic response of excitation energy, excitation length, structural defects, rock quality, and different data acquisition methods.\nFor short anchor systems (<10 m), we developed a method to extract the wave arrival times by obtaining the transient time domains instantaneously. It is well-known that obtaining the accurate wave arrival times from different structural interfaces within the anchor system is very difficult. But using our multi-parameter transient method, we could calculate the anchor length, the location of structural defect, and the grouting density. The obtained values were consistent with the actual experimental data. We also demonstrated that the kinetic energy of the collected waves from the bottom of the anchor had very close relationship with the grouting density and the position of the structural defects. For long anchors (> 60 m), mostly cable anchors, since little research could be followed, we started our research from designing the instrument, writing the program for data acquisition and analysis. We designed and developed novel sensors and preamplifiers. We used vertical stack technology to effectively enhance the weak signals from the deeper interfaces. In data processing, in addition to the traditional filter method, we also explored the current technology of signal processing such as true amplitude recovery and deconvolution, which enabled us to obtain improved signal to noise ratio and sensing precision. Through the above mentioned systematical studies, we developed a reliable nondestructive test method for both short and long anchors based on elastic wave reflection.\nThis research is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41202223)",

Due to the difficulties of preventing landslides or mitigating their impacts, it is vital to know the locations of potential slide areas and their states of activity, especially for those situations where property, infrastructure, and human lives are at risk.\nThis study improves understanding of the rate of movement and the lateral extent of the active domain of a landslide complex within Salmon Falls Creek Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho. The research investigates the feasibility of (i) using high-resolution multitemporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques to detect slow, nonlinear landslide displacement, and (ii) developing a work-flow that maximizes the accuracy of InSAR techniques while minimizing the number of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets.\nThe results provide (i) new insights into landslide displacement and rate of change over two decades; (ii) an assessment of change at a finer spatial resolution with similar or greater accuracy than previous studies that incorporated field and optical-based remote sensing; and (iii) improved geostatistical analysis of two separate landslides within the Salmon Falls Creek Canyon complex. These InSAR results show that the headwall block and transverse scarp had the highest mean annual velocity in the radar line-of-site direction. Line-of-site movement velocity in the toe and body of the landslide was less. Additionally, we interpret that lateral translation may have been greater in the body and toe compared to the headwall region due to the curved shape of the landside detachment surface.",

            "abstract": "We conduct extensive numerical simulations of granular flows down inclines with frictional side walls using a discrete element model (DEM). We obtain a steady state (SDF flow) for all the flow configurations we have investigated, varying extensively the inclination angle and the mass hold-up.\nOur simulations reveal the existence of unexpected SFD regimes which were never reported in the literature. These new regimes emerge from the destabilization of SFD unidirectional flows upon increase of the mass holdup and the slope. They are characterized by complex internal structures including secondary flows, heterogeneous particle volume fraction, symmetry breaking and dynamically maintained order.\nInterestingly, despite their overall diversity, these regimes are shown to obey universal scaling laws. We identify a simple dependency of the limit velocity on the mass hold-up and inclination angle. In steady state, the mass flow rate simply scales as the 5/4 power of the mass holdup, or equivalently, the velocity scales as the 1/4 power of the mass holdup.\nThese results open new perspectives for interpreting the features of geophysical granular flows. The scaling aforementioned could for instance explain, in a very simple and elegant way, the frictional velocity weakening in landslides on Earth and other planetary bodies observed in a recent publication [1].\n",

            "abstract": "Developing reliable methods to estimate stream flow has been a subject of interest due to its importance in planning, design and management of water resources within a basin. Machine learning tools such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) have been widely applied for rainfall-runoff modeling as they require less computational time as compared to physically-based models. As GP is able to generate a function with understandable structure, it may offer advantages over other data driven techniques and therefore has been used in different studies to generate rainfall-runoff functions. However, to date, proposed formulations only contain rainfall and/or streamflow data and consequently are local and cannot be generalized and adopted in other catchments which have different physical characteristics. This study investigated the capability of GP in developing a physically interpretable model with understandable structure to simulate stream flow based on hydrological parameters (e.g. precipitation) and catchment conditions (e.g., initial groundwater table elevation and area of the catchment) by following a modular approach. The modular model resulted in two sub-models where the baseflow was first predicted and the direct runoff was then estimated for a semi-urban catchment in Singapore. The simulated results matched very well with observed data in both the training and the testing of data sets, giving NSEs of 0.97 and 0.96 respectively demonstrated the successful estimation of stream flow using the modular model derived in this study. The results of this study indicate that GP is an effective tool in developing a physically interpretable model with understandable structure to simulate stream flow that can be transferred to other catchments.",

            "abstract": "The main goal of NASA's OCO-2 mission is to perform XCO2 column measurements from space with an unprecedented (~1 ppm) precision and accuracy that will enable modelers to globally map CO2 sources and sinks. To achieve this goal, the mission is critically dependent on XCO2product validation that, in turn, is highly dependent on successful use of OCO-2's \"target mode\" data acquisition. In target mode, OCO-2 rotates in such a way that, as long as it is above the horizon, it looks at a Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) station equipped with a powerful Fourier Transform spectrometer.\nTCCON stations measure, among other things, XCO2by looking straight at the Sun. This translates to a far simpler forward model for TCCON than for OCO-2. In the ideal world, OCO-2's spectroscopic signals result from the cumulative gaseous absorption for one direct transmission of sunlight to the ground (like for TCCON), followed by one diffuse reflection, and one direct transmission to the instrument—at a variety of viewing angles in traget mode. In the real world, all manner of multiple surface reflections and/or scatterings contribute to the signal. See figure. In the idealized world of the OCO-2 operational forward model (used in nadir, glint and target modes), the horizontal variability of the scattering atmosphere and reflecting surface are ignored, leading to the adoption of a 1D vector radiative transfer (vRT) model. This is the source of forward model error that we are investigating, with a focus on target mode.\nIn principle, atmospheric variability in the horizontal plane—largely due to clouds—can be avoided by careful screening. Also, it is straightforward to account for angular variability of the surface reflection model in the 1D vRT framework. But it is not clear how unavoidable horizontal variations of the surface reflectivity affects the OCO-2 signal, even if the reflection was isotropic (Lambertian). To characterize this OCO-2 \"adjacency\" effect, we use a simple surface variability model with a single spatial frequency in each direction, and a single albedo contrast at a time for realistic aerosol and gaseous profiles. This specific 3D RT error is compared with other documented forward model errors and translated into XCO2 error in ppm, for programatic consideration and eventual mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) has highest water temperature in the global ocean, and its spatiotemporal variations have significant impacts on large-scale atmospheric circulation and global hydrology. An environmental magnetic study was conducted on sediment cores of late Pleistocene age taken from the West Caroline Basin (WCB) offshore northern New Guinea in order to constrain hydrological variability over the WPWP on orbital timescales.\nMagnetite dominates magnetic mineral assemblages of the sediments. This is evidenced by that IRM acquisition curves are mostly explained by a low-coercivity component, and that the Verwey transition was obvious in low-temperature measurements. Existence of the sharp central ridges on FORC diagrams and TEM images indicate the occurrence of biogenic magnetite. Compared with pelagic sediments from other regions, however, FORC diagrams show a larger contribution of an interacting PSD and MD component, and the ratios of ARM susceptibility to SIRM (kARM/SIRM) are lower, which suggests a larger proportion of the terrigenous component. This is probably due to a large terrigenous sediment input from nearby land, New Guinea, induced by high precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone.\nMagnetic susceptibility (k) and kARM/SIRM well correlate with northern-hemisphere summer insolation. Maxima in k and minima in kARM/SIRM correspond to insolation minima, which suggests a larger terrigenous input caused by higher precipitation at these times. Interestingly, in the western part of WCB, k variations are dominated by the eccentricity periodicity and mimic δ18O curves, but the precession periodicity prevails in kARM/SIRM. These cores were taken at depths close to the CCD, and thus the k variations cannot be explained by dilution with carbonates. Sedimentation influenced by global sea-level changes may control the k variations; this part of the basin is adjacent to a wider continental shelf compared with the eastern part of WCB.",

            "abstract": "We present preliminary results from the first cross-hole tracer injection experiment in the volcanic ocean crust. The test site is on 3.5 to 3.6 M.y. old seafloor on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Six borehole subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were installed during three scientific ocean drilling expeditions, five arrayed along a 1 km profile aligned with the strike of underlying abyssal hills (Holes 1026B, 1301A/B, and 1362A/B), and one offset 2.4 km to the east (1027C). Before installing the sixth CORK in Hole 1362B, in 2010, we injected a mixture of tracers (dissolved gas, metal salts, particles) during 24 hours into the upper ocean crust. Seafloor samplers connected CORKs, sampling from different locations in the crust, were recovered during servicing expeditions in 2011 and 2013; downhole samplers that contain records from the full four years following tracer injection will be recovered in Summer 2014. Analyses of dissolved gas tracers collected with wellhead samplers through 2013 suggest that the dominant flow direction in upper basement is south to north, as inferred from regional thermal data and the chemistry of geochemical (pore fluid and borehole) samples. The apparent tracer flow rate in upper basement is on the order of meters/day, but calculations are complicated by an incomplete CORK seal in Hole 1301A, which resulted in discharge from this system that also \"pulled\" water and tracer to the south. Samples were collected from the tracer injection borehole, Hole 1362B, and a sampling site 200 m to the north, Hole 1362A, beginning one year after tracer injection, after opening a large-diameter ball valve on the wellhead of Hole 1362B to initiate a long-term free flow experiment. Analyses of these samples suggest that much of the tracer injected in 2010 remained close to Hole 1362B rather than being advected and dispersed into the formation. It also appears that much of the tracer transport to Hole 1362A occurred within one or more relatively thin/isolated zones, because tracer concentrations remain relatively high and there is a long tail of gradually decreasing values during the last two years of sampling. This interpretation is consistent with the highly layered and laterally continuous volcanic stratigraphy observed in basement boreholes drilled at Sites 1301 and 1362.",

            "abstract": "High-relief hummocky moraine is thought by many to form by the non-uniform accumulation of supraglacial debris atop downwasting, stagnant ice during deglaciation. Long-lived supraglacial depressions, when filled with debris transported downslope, become hills in the postglacial landscape, while the surrounding highs on the ice surface become inter-hummock valleys and basins. On debris-covered glaciers, debris transport occurs by gradual, slope-dependent processes as well as discrete mass wasting events. Debris production and surface lowering occur during ablation of underlying ice, which in turn depends on the spatial distribution of debris thickness. The coupled heat and mass transport problem lends itself to study using numerical methods similar to those used in mainstream landscape evolution models. A better understanding of the complex relationships between these processes is essential both for more accurate predictions of future ice mass loss and better reconstruction of former ice margins.\nA one dimensional evolution model has been constructed for investigation of the temporal and spatial relationships between supraglacial processes and postglacial relief. While the heat transfer relationships are well known from field studies on debris-covered glaciers, debris transport relationships are poorly known. Preliminary model analysis suggests that moraine characteristics depend strongly on the ratio of characteristic timescales for surface lowering by ablation and slope degradation by downslope transport. This ratio is therefore sensitive to the form and rate constant of the selected transport relationship, plausibly yielding both high-relief hummocks and nearly-flat plains. Simulations with rapid ablation and relatively slow debris transport yield the greatest initial supraglacial relief, and are most sensitive to the initial configuration of debris sources (e.g., englacial debris bands). However, for such relief to persist as the debris cover thickens, ablation must involve a term proportional to upslope contributing length, and therefore likely requires heat transfer from meltwater.",

Here we examine changes the tropical tropopause in two idealized experiments simulated by GFDL global climate model AM3: (1) 4xCO2 with fixed sea surface temperature; and (2) an uniform 4K increase of the sea surface temperature with fixed greenhouse gases concentrations. The tropical tropopause becomes warmer in both experiments, but a higher tropopause is only seen in the second case. By examining the heat budget of the tropical tropoapuse, we diagnose the physical processes that are responsible for these changes and quantify their contributions. For the 4xCO2 experiment, the direct radiative effect of CO2 increase contributes the most. For the SST warming experiment, the radiative effect of a warmer troposphere and convection-related processes lead to a warming at 100 hPa, while a stronger Brewer-Dobson circulation and associated changes in ozone lead to a cooling at 60 hPa. This warming-cooling pattern results in a significant upward shift of the tropopause.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory sound velocity measurements on the majorite at high pressures and high temperatures provide the significant information in interpreting the seismological models for the mantle transition zone in the Earth’s interior [1]. The majorite at the mantle transition zone can be approximated by the simplified system majorite (Mg4Si4O12) – pyrope (Mg3Al2Si3O12), and its elastic properties will thus contribute significantly to interpreting the seismic models for the mantle transition zone [2-3].\nHere we synthesize the well-sintered, translucent, single-phase and fine-grain sized (<5 μm) polycrystalline Mj80Py20 majorite using a Kaiwai-type multi-anvil apparatus (Orange-3000) at the Geodynamics Research Center, Ehime University, Japan. We perform in situ X-ray and ultrasonic measurements on this well-sintered sample at pressures up to 21 GPa and temperatures up to 2000 K in a Kawai-type multi-anvil apparatus at the beamline BL04B1 in SPring-8. The elastic moduli and their pressure and temperature derivatives are determined from the current experimental data: KS = 161.5(7) GPa, ∂KS/∂P = 4.42(4), ∂KS/∂T = -0.0154(2) GPa/K, G = 86.2(2) GPa, ∂G/∂P = 1.28(1), ∂G/∂T = -0.0096(5) GPa/K. The present results together with those of the earlier studies [4-7] on the majorite-pyrope solid solutions suggest the pressure and temperature derivatives of elastic moduli are insensitive to the majorite content in the majorite-pyrope system. The current study demonstrates that the velocity gradients of the majorite-pyrope solid solutions are 3~6 times lower than those required to account for the high seismic velocity gradients observed in the mantle transition zone.\n[1] Irifune T. et al.

The paper presents the observations of dynamics of charged particle with different energy performed from May 2008 until May 2014. The cross-calibration methodologies of high energetic particle data between FY-3 satellites and NOAA satellites will briefly be described, followed by the presentation of results obtained from the instruments in space. A case study of 2.5~6.9MeV protons and 0.3~1.1MeV electrons between FY-3B and NOAA-17 satellite based on possibly physical conjunctions shows that there are some systematic differences in FY-3B measurements when compared to NOAA-17 data.

            "abstract": "Sulfate geoengineering, made by sustained injection of SO2 in the tropical lower stratosphere, may impact the abundance of tropospheric methane through several photochemical mechanisms affecting the tropospheric OH abundance and hence the methane lifetime. Changes of the stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation also play a role in the upper tropospheric CH4 transport. Three mechanisms lead to lower OH concentrations and a longer CH4 lifetime: (a) solar radiation scattering increases the planetary albedo and cools the surface, with a tropospheric water vapor decrease as a response to this cooling. (b) The tropospheric UV budget is upset by the additional aerosol scattering and stratospheric ozone changes: the net effect is meridionally not uniform, with a net decrease in the tropics, thus producing less tropospheric O(1D). (c) The extra-tropical downwelling motion from the lower stratosphere tends to increase the sulfate aerosol surface area density available for heterogeneous chemical reactions in the mid-upper troposphere, thus reducing the amount of NOx and tropospheric O3 production. On the other hand, the tropical lower stratosphere is warmed by solar and planetary radiation absorption by the aerosols. The heating rates perturbation are strongly latitude dependent, producing a significant change of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient and mean zonal wind distribution, with a net increase of tropical upwelling. A stronger meridional component of the Brewer-Dobson circulation increases the extra-tropical stratosphere to troposphere transport of CH4 poorer air, resulting in less CH4 transported in the UTLS. The net effect on tropospheric OH may be positive or negative depending on the net result of different superimposed species perturbations in the UTLS, i.e. CH4 (negative), NOy and O3 (positive). Three climate-chemistry coupled models are used here to explore the above radiative, chemical and dynamical mechanisms affecting the methane lifetime (ULAQ-CCM, GEOSCCM, CCSM-CAM4). First results show that the CH4 lifetime may become significantly longer (by about 10%) with a sustained injection of 2.5 Tg-S/yr started in year 2020, which implies an increase of tropospheric CH4 (200 ppbv) and a positive indirect radiative forcing of sulfate geoengineering due to CH4 changes (+0.1 W/m2 in the 2045).",

Tides started from the northern Gulf of Mexico propagates up to the Mobile River system which is located in the north of the Mobile Bay. However, the tides started in the south of Mobile Bay were distorted when travelling upstream while affected by river discharge and local winds. The water surface elevation was less/over predicted responding north/south winds, respectively, when winds only at the Dauphin Island station (DPI) were used. However, the model predicted water surface elevation better when using two local winds from DPI and Mobile Downtown Airport (MDA). Wind speeds were greatly reduced (~ 88 %) in about 43 km distance between DPI and MDA, and the canopy effects may be the reason for this. For this reason, the local winds are greatly responsible for local surface elevation setup and setdown especially at the shallow estuary like Mobile Bay.",

In contrast to charged particles, neutrons and gamma rays are generally only measured indirectly, requiring the transfer of kinetic energy from neutral to one or more charged particles. Therefore, the measurement is the result of a complex convolution of the incident particle spectrum with the measurement process. We apply an inversion method to calculate the gamma/neutron spectra from RAD neutral particle measurements. Here we show first measurements of the gamma/neutron spectra during transit and on Mars and compare them to theoretical predictions.\nMeasuring the neutron spectra in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface is an essential step for determining radiation hazard for future human exploration, including shielding designs of potential spacecraft and habitats. The relative contribution of neutrons to the dose equivalent increases considerably with shielding thickness, so our quantitative measurements provide an important baseline to strategies that would mitigate cancer risk.",

Due to its innovative design, OMI combines a high spatial resolution (13x24km2 at nadir) with a wide swath of 2600 km that enables daily global coverage. The OMI science data record started in October 2004 and already spans a decade. The instrument shows very low optical degradation: after 10 years in orbit the throughput at its shortest UV wavelengths has only been reduced by a few percent and at longer wavelengths this degradation is about 1%. This stability makes the instrument extremely valuable for trend analysis, although due to the so-called “row anomaly” part of the swath is no longer providing science-quality data since 2009. Both the optical degradation and the row anomaly are well characterized.\nThe OMI data record shows that in the past decade the emissions of trace gases have changed considerably. Over most of the industrialized countries in Europe, North America and Asia emissions of NOx and SO2 have been reduced, whereas in the developing countries the emissions have generally increased. These changes in emissions directly affect the air quality, including the concentration of secondary aerosol particles. Due to the direct and indirect effect of aerosols, it is expected that the radiation balance is also affected, resulting in changes in shortwave radiance at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere.\nIn this contribution we will present time series analysis of tropospheric NO2 and formaldehyde columns from OMI, in combination with aerosol optical depth time series from MODIS on EOS Aqua. We concentrate on mega-cities in India, China and the U.S.A., because in these densely populated regions the effects of air quality are the largest. To quantify the local effects of aerosols on the radiation balance, we combine the trends in the aerosol optical depth with trends of the reflectance at the top of the atmosphere, as measured by OMI.",

            "abstract": "In a linear ill-posed inverse problem, the regularisation parameter (damping) controls the balance between minimising both the residual data misfit and the model norm. Poor knowledge of data uncertainties often makes the selection of damping rather arbitrary. To go beyond that subjectivity, an objective rationale for the choice of damping is presented, which is based on the coherency of delay-time estimates in different frequency bands. Our method is tailored to the problem of global Multiple-Frequency Tomography, using a data set of 287078 S-wave delay-times measured in five frequency bands (10, 15, 22, 34, 51 s central periods).\nWhereas for each ray path the delay-time estimates should vary coherently from one period to the other, the noise most likely is not coherent. Thus, the lack of coherency of the information in different frequency bands is exploited, using an analogy with the cross-validation method, to identify models dominated by noise.\nIn addition, a sharp change of behaviour of the model infinity-norm, as the damping becomes lower than a threshold value, is interpreted as the signature of data noise starting to significantly pollute at least one model component. Models with damping larger than this threshold are diagnosed as being constructed with poor data exploitation.\nFinally, a preferred model is selected from the remaining range of permitted model solutions. This choice is quasi-objective in terms of model interpretation, as the selected model shows a high degree of similarity with almost all other permitted models.\nThe obtained tomographic model is displayed in mid lower-mantle (660-1910 km depth), and is shown to be mostly compatible with three other recent global shear-velocity models, while significant differences can be noticed. A wider application of the presented rationale should permit us to converge towards more objective seismic imaging of the Earth's mantle, using as much as possible of the relevant structural information in the data.\nThis work was recently published: Zaroli, C., Sambridge, M., Lévêque, J.-J., Debayle, E., and Nolet, G.

            "abstract": "A problem of making education relevant to the workplace tasks is a key problem of higher education in the professional field of environmental sciences. To answer this challenge several new courses for students of “Climatology” and “Meteorology” specialties were developed and implemented at the Tomsk State University, which comprises theoretical knowledge from up-to-date environmental sciences with computational tasks. To organize the educational process we use an open-source course management system Moodle (www.moodle.org). It gave us an opportunity to combine text and multimedia in a theoretical part of educational courses. The hands-on approach is realized through development of innovative trainings which are performed within the information-computational web GIS platform “Climate” (http://climate.scert.ru/). The platform has a set of tools and data bases allowing a researcher to perform climate changes analysis on the selected territory. The tools are also used for students’ trainings, which contain practical tasks on climate modeling and climate changes assessment and analysis.\nLaboratory exercises are covering three topics: “Analysis of regional climate changes”; \"Analysis of climate extreme indices on the regional scale\"; and “Analysis of future climate”. They designed to consolidate students’ knowledge of discipline, to instill in them the skills to work independently with large amounts of geophysical data using modern processing and analysis tools of web-GIS platform “Climate” and to train them to present results obtained on laboratory work as reports with the statement of the problem, the results of calculations and logically justified conclusion. Thus, students are engaged in n the use of modern tools of the geophysical data analysis and it cultivates dynamic of their professional learning. The approach can help us to fill in this gap because it is the only approach that offers experience, increases students involvement, advance the use of modern information and communication tools.\nFinancial support for this research from the RFBR (13-05-12034, 14-05-00502), SB RAS project VIII.80.2.1 and grant of the President of RF (№ 181) is acknowledged.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation would be one of the major sources of uncertainty for hydrological analysis since precipitation is the main input of the hydrological models, in that sense, is one of the first factors controlling the accuracy of Rainfall Run-off (R-R) modeling. However, sparse meteorological data in un-gauged or poorly gauged basins has been a long concerning issue that bottlenecks the quantification of the hydrological budget. In recent decades, remote sensing techniques with their broad spatial coverage and repeat temporal coverage would grasp well the spatial distribution of precipitation over the river basin. However, remote sensing rainfall estimates are not direct measurements of rainfall that are subjects to variety of error sources and exhibit the limitation for rainfall budget accuracy. Therefore, it is appealing to incorporate the precision of point measurements of the local rainfall stations with the fine spatial distribution of satellite-based rainfall estimates to obtain a good quality of precipitation field in space and time to take the advantages of the both two datasets. The aim of my research is blending the remote sensing satellite precipitation, GsMAP-MVK (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation moving vector with Kalman filter) with a very high spatial distribution, with the local rainfall measurements for improvement of quantitative rainfall estimates and run-off predictions capability. Several satellite-gauge merging methods with various complexity degrees: from linear merging, power transformation merging to geo-statistical merging techniques were utilized to provide the precipitation input for conceptual hydrological model HBV for run-off simulation in Da river basin in Vietnam. The Geo-statistical merging methods give the best results for stream-flow simulation.\nKey Words: Remote sensed satellite data, hydrological model, un-gauged basin, bias correction.",

            "abstract": "The Barents and Bering seas are closely linked to the High Arctic and to the THC by marine gateways as well as by land-sea and ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our multi-proxy time series demonstrate that these remote seas exhibited dramatic changes during the deglaciation through a succession of global and regional paleoceanographic events including the beginning of Termination I (BT1), Heinrich-1 or Oldest Dryas (OD), Bølling-Allerød (B/A), Younger Dryas (YD) and early Holocene (EH). In the NW Barents Sea, the increased subsurface-to-bottom Atlantic water inflow via the Kvitøya-Erik Eriksen trough (cores S 2519 and S 2528) is inferred at the late OD, late B/A and late YD/EH transition. These events are generally coupled with the strengthened AMOC. A remarkable sea surface warming and sea ice retreat are documented at ~ 13 ka BP. Surface warming and strong Atlantic water inflow were followed by intense iceberg calving in the Erik Eriksen Trough as indicated by the high IRD content of Core S-2519. The rock fragments are unsorted and mainly angular suggesting their ice-rafted (likely iceberg-rafted) origin. Svalbard glaciers apparently derived the material dominated by black schistous mudstones, hard limestones with coral remains, fine-grained sandstones from nearby islands, and icebergs spread it in the Kvitøya-Erik Eriksen Trough during the early deglaciation. The ice rafted coarse terrigenous material supply during the BT1 is also suggested for the NW Bering Sea. In the NW Pacific, NW Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, surface bioproductivity peaked at B/A and EH mainly due to the global warming, enhanced nutrient supply by surface currents from the flooded northeastern shelf, intensified vertical mixing and water exchange through the opened straits. Oxygen-depleted bottom water at intermediate depths characterized several locations including the NW Bering Sea (Core SO201-2-85KL).",

Four supersites (Jülich ObservatorY for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE), Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory – Richard Assmann Observatory (RAO), and Leipzig Aerosol and Cloud Remote Observations System (LACROS) in Germany, and Cabauw experimental site for atmospheric research (Cesar) in the Netherlands) are finalizing the operational procedures to provide quality controlled (and calibrated if possible) remote-sensing and in-situ observations, retrievals on atmospheric boundary layer state (e.g. winds, mixing layer height, humidity and temperature), and cloud macro and micro physical properties with uncertainty estimations or at least quality flags. During the project new processing and retrieval methods were developed if no commonly agreed or satisfying methods were available. Especially, large progress was made concerning uncertainty estimation and automated quality control. Additionally, the data from JOYCE are used in a radiative closure studies under cloudy conditions to evaluate retrievals of cloud properties. The current status of work progress will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Estimating runout distance is of major importance for the assessment and mitigation of debris-flow hazards. Debris-flow runout distance depends on debris-flow composition and topography, but state-of-the-art runout prediction methods are mainly based on topographical parameters and debris-flow volume, while composition is generally neglected or incorporated in empirical constants. Here we experimentally investigated the effect of debris-flow composition and topography on runout distance. We created the first small-scale experimental debris flows with self-formed levees, distinct lobes and morphology and texture accurately resembling natural debris flows. In general, debris-flow composition had a larger effect on runout distance than topography. Enhancing channel slope and width, outflow plain slope, debris-flow size and water fraction leads to an increase in runout distance. However, runout distance shows an optimum relation with coarse-material and clay fraction. An increase in coarse-material fraction leads to larger runout distances by increased grain collisional forces and more effective levee formation, but too much coarse debris causes a large accumulation of coarse debris at the flow front, enhancing friction and decreasing runout. An increase in clay fraction initially enlarges the volume and viscosity of the interstitial fluid, liquefying the flow and enhancing runout, while a further increase leads to very viscous flows with high yield strength, reducing runout. These results highlight the importance and further need of research on the relation between debris-flow composition and runout distance. Our experiments further provide valuable insight on the effects of debris-flow composition on depositional mechanisms and deposit morphology.",

            "abstract": "The Tien Shan, Central Asia's major mountain range, has recently been the focus of a series of studies targeting changes in meteorological variables, glacier mass and extent, as well as runoff. Reviews have repeatedly highlighted the importance of glacier melt for total runoff on the one hand, but the scarcity of direct glaciological observation on the other. At the regional to global scale, the lack of such direct observations has been tackled by using remotely sensed products such as satellite gravimetry and altimetry, but the covered time frame is typically in the order of one decade, thus hampering robust assessments.\nHere, an ensemble of approaches based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and in-situ glacier mass balance measurements is used for estimating glacier mass changes in the Tien Shan during the last decade, and for validating a glacier mass balance model that we subsequently use for reconstructing a continuous mass balance time series over the last half-century. The model ensemble is designed to take into account a wide range of uncertainty sources including often-neglected differences such as data sources or model structure.\nWe cross-validate our different approaches during the period 2003-2009, and find an average glacier mass change of -6.1±4.4 Gt/a, thus confirming previously published estimates. We use the glaciological modelling approach to extend our estimates over the period 1961-2012, and gain insights in the spatial and temporal evolution of the regional glacier melt. Estimated melt rates are in turn used for assessing the contribution of glacier melt to the total runoff of major hydrological basins, and indicate that the contribution from glaciers has likely been overestimated in a series of previous studies.",

            "abstract": "We report analysis of three solar flares that occur within one degree of limb passage, with the goal to investigate the source height of chromospheric footpoints in white light (WL) and hard X-rays (HXR). The optical observations are from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) around 617.3 nm, providing high precision observations with an absolute positional accuracy in the radial direction below 0.1 arcsec (~70 km), as referred to the adjacent limb. The Reuven Ramaty Higher Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) gives HXR source centroids to a similar accuracy depending on counting statistics. The observed height of the emissions at either wavelength is influenced by the opacity of the atmosphere at that wavelength and the height must correspond to a radial distance from Sun center that is greater than the solar limb at that wavelength (~350 km for WL and ~450 km for HXR). We find the WL and HXR (~30 keV) centroids to be largely co-spatial and from similar heights for all events, with altitudes around 800 km above the height of the photosphere. The observed altitudes are limited by the uncertainty of the precise heliographic locations near the limb and the resulting projection effects. STEREO images reveal that for SOL2012-11-20T12:36 the projection effects are smallest, giving upper limits of the absolute source height of 979+-70 km for the WL emission and 926+-51 km for HXR source. Hence, the peak of the WL and HXR must be below 1000 km. To be compatible with the standard thick target model, these rather low altitudes require low ambient densities within the flare footpoints, in particular if the HXR-producing electrons are only weakly beamed. That the WL and HXR emissions are co-spatial suggests that the observed WL emission mechanism is directly linked to the energy deposition by flare accelerated electrons with energies above ~30 keV. If the WL emission is from low-temperature (~10 000 K) plasma as currently thought, the energy deposition by HXR-producing electrons above ~30 keV seems only to heat chromospheric plasma to such low temperatures. This implies that the energy in flare-accelerated electrons above ~30 keV is lost through radiation in the optical range rather than heating chromospheric plasma to coronal (> MK) temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Most large earthquakes are generated in subduction zones. To study the complexity of these events, teleseismic body waves offer many advantages over other types of data: they allow to study both the temporal and spatial evolution of slip during the rupture, they don't depend on the presence of nearby land and they allow to study earthquakes regardless of their location. Since the development of teleseismic finite-fault inversion in the 1980th, teleseismic body waves have been simulated using 1D velocity models to take into account propagation effects at the source. Yet, subduction zones are known to be highly heterogeneous: they are characterized by curved and dipping structures, strong seismic velocity contrasts, strong variations of topography and height of the water column. The main reason for relying on a 1D approximation is the computational cost of 3D simulations. And while forward simulations of teleseismic waves in a 3D Earth are only starting to be tractable on modern computers at the frequency range of interest (0.1Hz or shorter), finite-fault source studies require a large number of these simulations. In this work, we present a new and efficient approach to compute 3D teleseismic body waves, in which the full 3D propagation is only computed in a regional domain using discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method, while the rest of the seismic wave field is propagated in a background axisymmetric Earth. The regional and global wave fields are matched using the so-called Total-Field/Scattered-Field technique. This new simulation approach allows us to study the waveform complexities resulting from 3D propagation and investigate how they could improve the resolution and reduce the non-uniqueness of finite-fault inversions.",

            "abstract": "Paired catchments analysis provides a robust approach to assess the impact of land use changes on catchment’s hydrological response. This approach is limited by the availability of data for two neighbor catchments with and without land use changes under similar climate conditions. Thus, hydrological modelling approaches are also very popular since they do not depend on data of a reference catchment. In the present study, 70 urbanized and non-urbanized paired catchments were selected in the United States. Unit housing density maps over the 1940-2010 time period were used to reconstruct historic impervious area extents with aproximatly the same resolution as the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) maps. Two approaches were compared to assess the impact of urbanization on catchment-scale hydrology: the classical paired catchments approach using observed flow time series and an alternative paired catchments approach involving hydrological modeling that allows to simulate a virtual control catchment. To this aim, the GR4J model, a conceptual daily 4-parameter hydrological model, was used. The parameters of the model calibrated on the pre urbanization period were used to predict the streamflow that would have occurred in the urban catchment if the urbanization had not taken place.\nThen, classical statistical methods involving ANCOVA were used to detect the significance and to quantify the change on the hydrological responses due to land use changes. Results show that the two approaches lead to similar conclusions on the impact of urbanization on catchment hydrology. Thus, the modelling approach provides a relevant alternative for case studies where data of reference catchments are not available.",

            "abstract": "Global seismic tomography suffers from uncertainties in earthquake parameters routinely published in seismic catalogues. In particular, errors in earthquake location and origin-time may lead to strong biases in measured body-wave delay-times and significantly pollute tomographic models. Common ways of dealing with this issue are to incorporate source parameters as additional unknowns into the linear tomographic equations, or to seek combinations of data to minimise the influence of source mislocations.\nWe propose an alternative, physically-based method to desensitise direct S-wave delay-times to errors in earthquake location and origin-time. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that mislocation delay-time biases depend to first order on the earthquake-receiver azimuth, and to second order on the epicentral distance. Therefore, for every earthquake, we compute S-wave differential delay-times between optimised receiver pairs, such that a large part of their mislocation delay-time biases cancels out (for example origin-time fully subtracts out), while the difference of their sensitivity kernels remains sensitive to the model parameters of interest. Considering realistic, randomly distributed source mislocation vectors, as well as various levels of data noise and different synthetic Earths, we demonstrate that mislocation-related model errors are highly reduced when inverting for such differential delay-times, compared to absolute ones. The reduction is particularly rewarding for imaging the upper-mantle and transition-zone.\nWe conclude that using optimised receiver pairs is a suitable, low cost alternative to get rid of errors on earthquake location and origin-time for teleseismic direct S-wave traveltimes. Moreover, it can partly remove unilateral rupture propagation effects in cross-correlation delay-times, since they are similar to mislocation effects.",

            "abstract": "Planktonic foraminifera (PF) shells preserved in marine sediments are a useful tool to reconstruct productivity conditions at different geological timescales. However, the accuracy of these paleoreconstructions depends on the data set and calibration quality. Several calibration works have been defining and improving the use of proxies for productivity and nutrient cycling parameters. Our contribution is centred on a multi-proxy calibration at a regional coastal upwelling system. To minimize the existing uncertainties affecting the use of trace elements and C stable isotopes as productivity proxy in the high productivity upwelling areas, we investigate the content and distribution of Ba/Ca and δ13C in the water column, its transference into the planktonic foraminifera shells, and, how the living planktonic foraminifera Ba/Ca and δ13C signal is related to the same planktonic foraminiferal species preserved in the sediment record. This study is based on a large data set from two stations (RAIA - 75m water depth, and CALIBERIA - 350m water depth) located off the NW Iberian margin (41.5-42.5ºN; 9-10ºW), and includes: i) two year monthly water column data (temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, Ba/Ca, and δ13C-DIC); ii) seasonal Ba/Ca, δ13C in several living PF species at both stations; and iii) Ba/Ca and δ13C in several PF species from a large set of core-top sediment samples in the study region. Additionally, total organic carbon and total alkenones were also measured in the sediment. Our results showed the link between productivity proxies in the surface sediment foraminifera assemblage and the processes regulating the actual phytoplankton dynamics in an upwelling area. The understanding of this relationship has special relevance since it gives fundamental information related to the past oceanic biogeochemistry and/or climate and improves the prevision of future changes against possible climate variability due to anthropogenic forcing.",

Firstly, the master-subsidiary inheritance relations and configuration characterization of the seismic-scale extensional fault systems are determined by analyzing the structural pattern. Besides, three-dimensional (3D) pattern and characteristics of the seismic-scale extensional structure have been illustrated by 3D structure model built upon seismic sections. Moreover, according to the dilatancy obtained from structural restoration on the basis of inclined shear method, as well as the fracture-flow index, potential SSLD extensional faults or fractures have been quantitatively identified.

            "abstract": "We have investigated azimuthal magnetic field data showing the presence of field-aligned current sheets on 31 similar Cassini passes during the 2008 interval of near polar orbits across Saturn’s southern post-midnight auroral region at radial distances ~3‑5 RS. The currents are found to be strongly modulated in magnitude, form, and position by the phase of the southern planetary period oscillations (PPOs). We separate currents independent of PPO phase from PPO-related currents, by exploiting the expected anti-symmetry of the latter with respect to PPO phase. The PPO-independent current system is thought to be associated mainly with sub-corotation of magnetospheric plasma, and consists of a weak distributed downward current over the whole polar region, enhanced downward currents in a layer mapping to the outer magnetosphere where the ionospheric conductivity is elevated, and a main upward-directed current layer ~2° wide centered at ~18° co-latitude with respect to the southern pole carrying ~2.5 MA per radian of azimuth. The latter current maps to the main region of the hot plasma in Saturn’s magnetosphere and is co-located with Saturn’s main UV oval in this hemisphere and local time sector. No major currents are detected mapping to the inner equatorial magnetosphere ~4-8 RS dominated by cool Enceladus plasma. The PPO-related currents map to the inner part of the hot plasma region at ~18°‑20° co-latitude, and carry rotating upward and downward currents peaking at ~1.7 MA rad‑1. The co-latitude of the current layers is also modulated by 1° amplitude in the PPO cycle, with maximum equatorward and poleward excursions adjacent to maximum upward and downward PPO currents, respectively. It is shown that this phasing requires the current system to be driven upward from the planetary atmosphere rather than downward from the magnetosphere.",

The area of investigation extends from the Rhine Graben in the north, to the northern Apennine Range in the south, and includes the Eastern and Western Alps. Following the classical work of Aki and Chouet (1975), coda wave attenuation has been characterized by measuring the coda quality factor of short-period S waves (Qc). We have selected about 2000 weak to moderate earthquakes, with magnitudes ranging from 3 to 5. Waveform data recorded by permanent seismic networks have been collected at the ORFEUS data center through the ArcLink protocol. Qc has been measured in five frequency bands [1-2], [2-4], [4-8], [8-16], [16-32] Hz, by applying a simple linear regression to the smooth energy envelopes of seismograms in the time domain. Various choices of coda window length (Lw), and coda onset time (tw, as measured from the origin time) have been tested to ensure that our measurements are free from any systematic effects of lapse-time dependence in the range of epicentral distance considered. The optimal choice, which simultaneously maximizes the geographical coverage and minimizes the measurement biases, is obtained for Lw=50s and tw=70s, for epicentral distances smaller than 180 km. The map of Qc is obtained by discretizing the Alpine region into pixels of dimension (20km x 20km). For each source/receiver pair, the estimated value of Qc is distributed along the direct ray path. An average over all paths that cross an individual pixel is performed to obtain the local value of Qc. A spatial smoothing over an area covering a square of 9 pixels is subsequently applied. The maps of Qc display strong lateral variations of attenuation in the Alpine area. At all frequencies, the ratio between the lowest and largest value of Qc is typically larger than 2. The attenuation pattern is complex but relatively independent of frequency. Some geological formations such as the Upper Rhine Graben and the eastern Alps show up clearly on the maps and systematically exhibit lower attenuation than the Po Valley and the Apennines. The typical scale of the spatial variations of the coda quality factor is of the order of 100km, which suggests rapid lateral variation of attenuation properties in the crust.",

            "abstract": "The improving temporal and spatial resolutions of new generation space-borne X-Band SAR sensors such as COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation, and therefore their better monitoring capabilities, will guarantee increasing and more efficient use of multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) in landslide investigations. Thanks to their finer spatial resolution with respect to C-band data, X-band InSAR applications are very promising also for monitoring smaller landslides and single engineering structures sited on potentially unstable slopes. This work is focused on the detection of precursory signals of an impending slope failure from MTI time series of ground deformations obtained by exploiting 3 m resolution CSK data. We show the case of retrospectively captured pre-failure strains related to the landslide which occurred on January 2014 close to the town of Marina di Andora. The landslide caused the derailment of a train and the interruption of the railway line connecting north-western Italy to France. A dataset of 56 images acquired in STRIPMAP HIMAGE mode by CSK constellation from October 2008 to May 2014 was processed through SPINUA algorithm to derive the ground surface deformation map and the time series of displacement rates for each coherent radar target. We show that a cluster of moving targets coincides with the structures (buildings and terraces) affected by the 2014 landslide. The analysis of the MTI time series further shows that the targets had been moving since 2009, and thus could have provided a forewarning signal about ongoing slope or engineering structure instability. Although temporal landslide prediction remains difficult even via in situ monitoring, the presented case study indicates that MTI relying on high resolution radars such as CSK can provide very useful information for slope hazard mapping and possibly for early warning.\nAcknowledgments\nDIF provided contribution to data analysis within the framework of CAR-SLIDE project funded by MIUR (PON01_00536).",

The extensive exposures of the plutonic crust were drilled at 3 sites during ODP Leg 147 (Nov. 1992-Jan. 1993) and IODP Expedition 345 (Dec. 2012-Feb. 2013). We report preliminary results of a bulk rock geochemical study (major and trace elements) carried out on 109 samples representative of the different drilled lithologies.\nThe shallowest gabbroic rocks were sampled at ODP Site 894. They comprise gabbronorite, gabbro, olivine gabbro and gabbronorite. They have evolved compositions with Mg# 39-55, Yb 4-8 x chondrite and Eu/Eu* 1-1.6. Olivine gabbro and troctolite were dominant at IODP Site U1415, with minor gabbro, gabbronorite and clinopyroxene oikocryst-bearing troctolite and gabbro. All U1415 gabbroic rocks have primitive compositions except for one gabbronorite rubble that is similar in composition to the shallow gabbros. Olivine gabbro, gabbro and gabbronorite overlap in composition: they have high Mg# (79-87) and Ni (130-570 ppm), low TiO2 (0.1-0.3 wt.%) and Yb (1.3-2.3 x chondrite) and positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*=1.9-2.7). Troctolite has high Mg# (81-89), Ni (260-1500 ppm) and low TiO2 (<0.1 wt.%) and Yb (~0.5xchondrite) and large Eu/Eu* (>4). ODP Site 895 recovered sequences of highly depleted harzburgite, dunite and troctolite (Yb down to <0.1xchondrite) that are interpreted as a mantle-crust transition zone. Basalts were recovered at Sites 894 and U1415: they have low Yb (0.5-0.9xN6MORB) and are depleted in the most incompatible elements (Ce/Yb=0.6-0.9xN-MORB).\nThe main geochemical characteristics of Site U1415 and 894 gabbroic rocks are consistent with formation as a cumulate sequence from a common parental MORB melt; troctolites are the most primitive end-member of this sequence. They overlap in composition with the most primitive of slow and fast spread crust gabbroic rocks.",

            "abstract": "The granite-hosted mid-crustal complex of Punta Falcone consists of transitional tholeiitic to calc-alkaline high-Al gabbros. Its pervasive vertical structure is the result of injection of at least 6 distinct pulses forming 10 to 60m wide individual cooling units. The complex was built symmetrically by injection of each new pulse in the centre of the system. Contacts between the units are well-defined and present slight chilled margins speaking against a continuous magma flux which would have had a marked thermal impact on the adjacent units.\nAll units have a common magma source (radiogenic isotopes), but show differences as the system evolves. An80-90 plg is the liquidus phase in all units and crystallized in the source region. In the early units it is followed by sub-/euhedral amph of mm-size with a wide range of compositions dominated by the edenite-type substitution, evidencing relatively fast, isobaric cooling at emplacement level. The later units accumulated high-An plg and fractionated Fe-Ti oxides before ascent as indicated by whole-rock chemistry. After emplacement and due to the thermal maturation of the system, they isobarically crystallized big, cm-sized oikocrysts of px enclosing high-An plg, closely followed by amph with the same texture. This led to an An-content jump in the subsequently crystallizing plg rims, whose absence in the mafic phases indicates a strong crystallinity increase over a small T interval.\nThe geometry, size, number of pulses and emplacement chronology of the complex yield constraints on the thermal evolution of the system. Numerical modelling shows that the periodic injection of magma and the latent heat of crystallization of px and amph maintained the latest pulse at high T for several hundreds of years. This induced a slow and regular inward migration of the crystallization front on both sides of the central unit, which allowed the development of a spectacular vertical, cm-scale, rhythmic magmatic layering.",

            "abstract": "Magma differentiation and mixing are generally regarded as taking place in magma chambers, sills or reservoirs, while magma stagnates before continuing to ascent or erupt. Here we consider differentiation to occur during magma rise in vertical dykes, as documented in the PX1 pluton, Fuerteventura, which is part of the root-zone of an eroded ocean island volcano.\nPX1 is a vertically layered cumulative body composed of meter to decameter-wide bands of clinopyroxenites and gabbros, surrounded by a very high-grade contact aureole (ca. 1000°C, Hobson et al., 1998). Many clinopyroxenites are characterized by a coarse-grained texture and complexly zoned clinopyroxene crystals. Resorption features and reverse zoning observed in rims are evidence for successive pulses. Percolation of high temperature basaltic melts through the accumulating crystal-rich mush would generate the complexly zoned clinopyroxenes and lead to crystal coarsening. We interpret these coarse-grained clinopyroxenites as crystal-rich magma channels, through which sustained magma fluxes travelled to the surface over a long period of time, thus generating the contact aureole. On the other hand, gabbro bands are interpreted as sluggish magma pulses emplaced in a cooler environment during the waning stages of magmatic activity.\nWe thus propose a model of magma differentiation by dynamic fractionation in dykes throughout magma ascent in the plumbing system of basaltic volcanoes. This model assumes fractional crystallization of continuously rising magmas in vertical channels all along their way to the surface through phenocryst accumulation and crystal-melt interaction processes.",

            "abstract": "After Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) on 26th December, 2004, attempts are being made to assess the threat of tsunami originating from different sources for different parts of India. The Andaman – Sumatra trench is segmented by transcurrent faults and differences in the rate of subduction which is low in the north and increases southward. Therefore key board model with initial deformation calculated using different strike directions, slip rates, are used. This results in uncertainties in the earthquake parameters. This study is made to identify the location of origin of most destructive tsunami for Southeast coast of India and to infer the influence of the earthquake parameters in tsunami wave height travel time in deep ocean as well as in the shelf and inundation in the coast. Five tsunamigenic sources were considered in the Andaman – Sumatra trench taking into consideration the tectonic characters of the trench described by various authors and the modeling was carried out using TUNAMI N2 code. The model results were validated using the travel time and runup in the coastal areas and comparing the water elevation along Jason – 1’s satellite track. The inundation results are compared from the field data. The assessment of the tsunami threat for the area south of Chennai city the metropolitan city of South India shows that a tsunami originating in Car Nicobar segment of the Andaman – Sumatra subduction zone can generate the most destructive tsunami. Sensitivity analysis in the modelling indicates that fault length influences the results significantly and the tsunami reaches early and with higher amplitude. Strike angle is also modifying the tsunami followed by amount of slip.",

Along the Ecuadorian convergent margin (0°40’N-2°20’S) we interpreted a dense network (one profile every 4 km) of MCS reflection profiles acquired by the Ecuadorian State during the 2009 SCAN cruise with a 8-km-long, 640-channel streamer, and an array of 4000 in3total volume air guns to improve our understanding of the dynamic processes that shape forearc basin stratigraphy and tectonic structures.\nIsopach and structural maps of the acoustic basement show two structural segments on the margin. The northern segment (0°45’S-0°40’N) is characterized by - three sedimentary basins called Pedernales, Bahía-Jama and Caráquez basins, - N30°-50° trending transcurrent faults and -N80°-90° trending normal faults dipping to the south. The southern segment (2°S-0°45’S) is characterized by acoustic basement high, NS-trending until 1°10’S, with small localized sedimentary basins and by N320°-340° trending normal faults dipping to the north. At least five seismic units separated by unconformities are evidenced in the northern basins. Tentative correlations with geological data from the offshore Caraquez-1 well and the on-shore geology, suggest the following Neogene deformation steps: 1) sedimentary basins were initiated along N80°-90° trending normal faults in a regional N30°-50° trending strike slip system during lower Miocene; 2) deformation ended by a regional erosion (underlined by a flat regional unconformity) after the lower Miocene; 3) subsidence began by an undersea regional erosion after the Middle-Upper Miocene (underlined by an irregular regional unconformity), and 4) uplift and locally subsidence of the shelf edge with reactivation of a strike slip fault system from Pliocene (?) to Present. The arrival of the Carnegie ridge and associated seamounts to the trench axis is proposed at the origin of this last stage.",

It is evident that beneath LIPs was not exited magma oceans and adiabatic melting occurred in heads of protuberances on their surface (local, or secondary plumes), which can reach relatively shallow levels.\nThe least known element of magmatic system is area of magma generation and meltedsources. Important information about it is contained in the mantle xenoliths in alkali basalts. They are represented by two series: (1) “green”: spinel peridotite (maily lherzolite) and minor spinel pyroxenite (websterite), and (2) “black” (veins in the peridotite matrix): wehrlite, Al-Ti-augite and hornblende clinopyroxenite, hornblendite, phlogopitite, etc, which crystallized from fluid-saturated melts or high-density fluid. Very likely, that these fluids, enriched in Fe, Ti, alkalis and incompatible elements, were parts of intergranular material of original plume material and were released due to its decompression; evidently, they provided specific composition of plume-related melts. Both types of xenoliths represent material of plume head and accordingly – the melting substratum.\nOne of problem of plume-related magmatism is coexisting of alkali and tholeiitic basalts, which origin often considered with different PT conditions. However, this situation can be explained another way. Because fluid components, acting jointly or separately, impregnated the peridotite matrix nonuniform, it led to heterogeneous composition of smelted magmas, and primary melts can have different composition even though be forming at similar PT conditions. According to Yoder and Tilley (1962), even small differences in SiO2 content lead to different ways in evolution of magmas due to critical plane of silica undersaturation. As a result, one magmas will develop to Ne enrichment (alkali basalts) and another – to silica direction (tholeiite basalts.",

            "abstract": "Ice – ocean interactions of tidewater glaciers remain poorly understood; yet 39% of the global glaciated area drains directly into the ocean via tidewater glaciers. As the Arctic cryosphere continues to lose mass in response to a warming climate, more detailed observations are needed to increase our understanding of ice – ocean processes, enabling improved model predictions of Arctic change. Svalbard hosts a high proportion of tidewater glaciers, including Kronebreen, the fastest flowing glacier on the archipelago. The proglacial meltwater exiting the base of Kronebreen transports fine grained sediment to Kongsfjorden, entrained in a buoyant plume which spreads laterally and is visible at the surface. In-situ measurements of the concentration and spectral reflectance of these surface sediments were used to calibrate spectral data from the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites. Temperature and salinity in front of the calving face, and throughout the meltwater plume, have been measured using a hand held CTD. The spatial surface pattern of total suspended sediment (TSS; g l-1) and plume area, has been quantified for every cloud free day between 1st June – 30th September from 2002 – 2013. High TSS sediment during the early melt season indicates flushing, whilst sediment exhaustion is apparent at the end. We show that the areal extent of these proglacial plumes responds to atmospheric temperature, with a 12 day lag. An underlying seasonal evolution of plume extent is apparent; plume area is small at the beginning and end of the melt season, peaking mid-July. Wind speed and direction also play a role in dictating the length of plume formation, with katabatic winds originating from the glacier, lengthening plumes. However, the overall extent of the sediment plume is dependent on meltwater inputs. As such, this method enables the daily to interannual quantification of proglacial meltwater release from tidewater glaciers, utilizing remote sensing.",

There is considerable uncertainty in the detail of how the surface freshwater forcing of the ocean will change, which may significantly impact ocean heat uptake. Here, we investigate this by adding either freshwater or salt to the Atlantic in global climate model simulations, simultaneously imposing an idealised atmospheric CO2 scenario. Whilst circulation changes are roughly equal and opposite for salt and freshwater perturbations, freshwater perturbations cause a net increase in Atlantic heat content but salt perturbations produce only small changes in heat content compared to the baseline CO2 scenario. Approximately 15% of the increase in Atlantic heat content in our climate change experiments is due to changes in the Atlantic overturning circulation. The processes active in our model appear robust, although their net result depends on model- and experiment-dependent details.",

Subduction of the rifted continental margin is inferred, as recorded in the Saih Hatat high-pressure rocks whose metamorphic age 80-140 Ma is discussed, as well as the vergence of related subduction. Late Cretaceous time 85-70 Ma marks the emplacement of the Oman ophiolite in the Muti Basin, to its present position inland the Permo-Triassic continental margin. These episodes are not similarly recorded in the northern part of the Oman Mountains, that do not expose any HP metamorphic belt, but granulitic crustal rocks and large development of syn-obduction non-MORB magmatism in the ophiolite crustal section. Collision is achieved at the northern tip, the Musandam area, linked to the opening of the Gulf of Aden 25 Ma ago, and northward drift of the Arabian Plate.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor geodesy has been identified as one of the central tools in marine geosciences to monitor seafloor deformation at high resolution. To quantify strain accumulation and assess the resultant hazard potential we urgently need systems to resolve seafloor crustal deformation.\nThe GeoSEA (Geodetic Earthquake Observatory on the Seafloor) array consists of a seafloor transponder network comprising a total of 35 units and a wave glider acting as a surface unit (GeoSURF) to ensure satellite correspondence, data transfer and monitor system health.\nFor horizontal direct path measurements, the system utilizes acoustic ranging techniques with a ranging precision better than 15 mm and long term stability over 2 km distance. Vertical motion is obtained from pressure gauges. Integrated inclinometers monitor station settlement in two horizontal directions. Travel time between instruments and the local water sound velocity will be recorded autonomously subsea without system or human intervention for up to 3.5 years. Data from the autonomous network on the seafloor can be retrieved via the integrated high-speed acoustic telemetry link without recovering the seafloor units.\nIn late 2015 GeoSEA will be installed on the Iquique segment of the South America – Nazca convergent plate boundary to monitor crustal deformation. The Iquique seismic gap experienced the 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake, which apparently occurred within a local locking minimum. It is thus crucial to better resolve resolve strain in the forearc between the mainland and the trench in order to improve our understanding of forearc deformation required for hazard assessment. Mobile autonomous seafloor arrays for continuous measurement of active seafloor deformation in hazard zones have the potential to lead to transformative discoveries of plate boundary/fault zone tectonic processes and address a novel element of marine geophysical research.",

            "abstract": "New time-slice reconstructions of Eurasian Ice Sheet limits during Marine Isotope Stage 2 reveal that the timing of both maximum ice sheet extent and subsequent retreat were spatially variable. Here we present a new reconstruction of the glacial and climate history during the last deglaciation based on 52 cosmogenic nuclide 10Be exposure ages from glacially transported boulders in southern Norway as well as other available data from moraines, lake basins and offshore seafloor sediments. The new ages indicate that the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (NCIS), active during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM ~21 ka), broke up as early as ~20 ka, leaving the islands Utsira and Karmøy (located 250 km up-flow from the LGM ice-margin position) permanently ice free ever since. We postulate that the ice sheet flowed across the Norwegian Channel to Denmark and onto the North Sea Plateau during an early phase of the last glacial, but when the NCIS started to operate this ice supply to the North Sea diminished. The fast flows of the NCIS led to a lowering of the ice surface on the shelf and presumably also a drawdown of the entire ice sheet. We envision a large open bay across the entire northern North Sea by 20 ka, which facilitated rapid calving at the ice front and ice sheet thinning. There is also evidence to suggest that the Eurasian Ice Sheet complex as a whole was in a state of retreat soon after the collapse of the ice stream suggesting a common causal connection. We think the primary forcing mechanism for the early deglaciation was increasing high-northern-latitude insolation. The adjacent coastal areas of the Norwegian mainland remained ice covered for another 4000 years until ~16 ka when the ice margin along the coast started to retreat eastward. This second stage of ice sheet retreat was interrupted by several re-advances. The largest re-advance culminated at the very end of the Younger Dryas stadial period (11.6 ka).",

For example, the 1960 Chile earthquake (M 9.5), the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (M 9.3), and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M 9.0). In this study, we focus on the southernmost Ryukyu Trench offshore northeastern Taiwan where the Philippine Sea Plate subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate at a rate of 80–85 mm/yr. Once a megathrust event hit this area, the ground shaking and tsunami would cause extreme disaster in northern Taiwan, especially the Taipei metropolitan area. Interseismic GPS data in northeast Taiwan shows a pattern of strain accumulation suggests that the maximum likely magnitude of a potential future large earthquake along the southernmost Ryukyu subduction zone is probably about Mw 8.7. In order to evaluate the influence of this potential megathrust event, we analyze the ShakeMap and ShakeMovie from different rupture scenarios based upon spectral-element method. Tsunami simulations based on coseismic deformations of seabed are carried out to evaluate the amplitudes of tsunami along the coastal areas of Taiwan. In addition, we apply the interseismic GPS data to invert the source slip pattern on a 3D subduction zone. We also discuss the influence of dynamic rupture process on the seabed coseismic deformation and tsunami generation. These numerical simulation results can provide physics-based information of megathrust earthquake scenario for the government and emergency response agency to take the appropriate action before the really big one occurs.",

Here we present global climate model simulations and evaluate the associated uncertainties in view of the main meteorological factors that may affect the distribution of the Asian Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which can transmit pathogens that cause Chikungunya, Dengue fever, yellow fever and various encephalitides. Using a general circulation model (GCM) at 50 km horizontal resolution to simulate mosquito survival variables including temperature, precipitation and relative humidity, we present both global and regional projections of the habitat suitability up to the middle of the 21st century. The model resolution of 50 km allows evaluation against previous projections for Europe and provides a basis for comparative analyses with other regions. Model uncertainties and performance are addressed in light of the recent CMIP5 ensemble climate model simulations for the RCP8.5 concentration pathway and using meteorological re-analysis data (ERA-Interim/ECMWF) for the recent past. Uncertainty ranges associated with the thresholds of meteorological variables that may affect the distribution of Ae. albopictus are diagnosed using fuzzy-logic methodology, notably to assess the influence of selected meteorological criteria and combinations of criteria that influence mosquito habitat suitability. From the climate projections for 2050, and adopting a habitat suitability index larger than 70%, we estimate that about 2.4 billion individuals in a land area of nearly 20 million square kilometres will potentially be exposed to Ae. albopictus. The synthesis of fuzzy-logic based on mosquito biology and climate change analysis provides new insights into the regional and global spreading of VBDs to support disease control and policy making.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the computational techniques and resources available to geophysicists have advanced enormously: for many geophysical problems, physically-complete simulations are now feasible. Nevertheless, the computational costs remain daunting, encouraging the development of various hybrid inversion schemes that combine fully-accurate modelling techniques with those based upon various approximations. These are argued to give more accurate results than those based solely on approximate techniques, but at much lower cost than would be required if full simulations were conducted throughout.\nWhile these arguments are superficially attractive, we do not believe that they have yet been fully justified within the framework of inverse theory. It is therefore important to investigate how modelling approximations propagate into the solutions to inverse problems. Understanding this will enable us to develop algorithms that optimally balance accuracy with efficiency, and will aid the interpretation of models produced by hybrid techniques.\nWe present results from mathematical and experimental analysis of geophysical inverse problems, focussing particularly on the framework of the least squares algorithm. We suggest that the efficacy of hybrid approaches depends significantly upon the particular approximations used, and on the character of their manifestation in the data. The interaction between approximations and regularisation is also important for both convergence and accuracy.",

The next-generation UK Earth System Model (UKESM1), which is being developed jointly between NERC and the UK Met Office, will allow ice-sheets to be modelled as an physically consistent, interactive part of the climate. Surface mass balance will be explicitly calculated in the climate model with a multi-layer snowpack model with snow ageing and explicit refreezing processes, deployed on subgrid tiles representing different orographic heights. This will be coupled to the BISICLES adaptive mesh ice-sheet model, whose floating ice-shelves will also be coupled to the NEMO ocean model to allow explicit representation of the sub-shelf circulation and melt.

            "abstract": "In 2050 70% of the global population is expected to live in urban areas. Climate change will render these areas more vulnerable to heat waves, which often are accompanied by severe air pollution problems. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a feature that adds to the general temperature increase that is expected. Decreasing the UHI can impact air quality as well, because heat influences atmospheric dynamics and accelerates air chemical processes and often also increases the emission of primary pollutants due to increased demand of energy.\nThe goal of this study is to investigate the effect of, e.g., high reflective surfaces and urban greening on mitigating the UHI and the related impact on air quality. A multi-layer urban canopy model is coupled to the mesoscale model WRF-Chem and the urban area of Stuttgart (South-West Germany) is taken as one example. Different scenario runs are executed for short time periods and are compared to a control run.\nThe results show that the UHI effect can be substantially reduced when changing the albedo of roof surfaces, whereas the effect of urban greening is minor. Both scenarios have in common, that they evoke changes in secondary circulation patterns.\nThe effects of these mitigation strategies on chemical composition of the urban atmosphere are complex, attributed to both chemical and dynamical features. Increasing the reflectivity of roof surfaces in the model results in a net decrease of the surface ozone concentration, because ozone formation is highly correlated to temperature. With regard to primary pollutants, e.g. NO, CO and PM10 concentrations are increased when increasing reflectivity. This effect primarily can be ascribed to a reduction of turbulent motion, convection and a decrease of the boundary layer height, coming along with lower temperatures in the urban canopy layer due to increased reflectivity. The table below shows the effect on grid cell mean concentrations for different chemical species and scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Considering their crucial role in water and solute transport, enhanced monitoring and modeling of agricultural subsurface tube drain systems is important for adequate water quality management. For example, previous work in lowland agricultural catchments has shown that subsurface tube drain effluent contributed up to 80% of the annual discharge and 90-92% of the annual NO3 loads from agricultural fields towards the surface water. However, existing monitoring techniques for flow and contaminant loads from tube drains are expensive and labor-intensive. Therefore, despite the unambiguous relevance of this transport route, tube drain monitoring data are scarce.\nThe presented study aimed developing a cheap, simple, and robust method to monitor loads from tube drains. We are now ready to introduce the Flowcap that can be attached to the outlet of tube drains and is capable of registering total flow, contaminant loads, and flow-averaged concentrations. The Flowcap builds on the existing SorbiCells, a modern passive sampling technique that measures average concentrations over longer periods of time (days to months) for various substances. By mounting SorbiCells in our Flowcap, a flow-proportional part of the drain effluent is sampled from the main stream. Laboratory testing yielded good linear relations (R-squared of 0.98) between drainage flow rates and sampling rates. The Flowcap was tested in practice for measuring NO3 loads from two agricultural fields and one glasshouse in the Netherlands.\nThe Flowcap registers contaminant loads from tube drains without any need for housing, electricity, or maintenance. This enables large-scale monitoring of non-point contaminant loads via tube drains, which would facilitate the improvement of contaminant transport models and would yield valuable information for the selection and evaluation of mitigation options to improve water quality.",

In the present investigation we put an effort to closely examine the magnetosheath fluctuations dependency on the solar-cycles (solar-maximum and solar minimum) at the magnetized planetary body (Earth) and their comparison with the un-magnetized planetary body (Venus) for the solar minimum. We use the CLUSTER FGM data for the solar-maximum (2001-2002), solar-minimum (2006-2008) and Venus fluxgate magnetometer data for the solar-minimum (2006-2008) to perform a comparative statistical study on the energy spectra and probability density function (PDF) and asses the spectral features of the magnetic fluctuations of the both planetary bodies. In the comparison we study the relation between the inertial ranges of the spectra and the temporal scales of non-Gaussian magnetic fluctuations derived from PDF analyses. The first can refer to turbulent cascade dynamics, while the latter may indicate intermittency. We first transformed the magnetic field data into mean field aligned coordinate system with respect to the large-scale magnetic field direction and then after we compute the power spectral density with the help of Welch algorithm. The computed energy spectra of Earth's magnetosheath show a moderate variability with the solar-cycles and have a broader inertial range. However the estimated energy spectra for the solar-minimum at Venus give the clear evidence of the existence of the break point in the vicinity of the ion gyroradius. After the break-point the energy spectra become steeper and show a distinctive spectral scales which is interpreted as the realization of the begging of the energy cascade. We also briefly address the influence of turbulence on the plasma transport and wave dynamics responsible for the spectral break and predict spectral features of the energy spectra for the solar-maximum at Venus based on the results obtained for the solar-minimum.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013]) under grant agreement number 313038/STORM.",

There exist clear spatiotemporal changes in all eight socioeconomic and natural variables on the Mongolian Plateau. Substantial differences in LSKD, population (POPD), and economic development were found among the biomes and between IM and MG. We developed a simple structural equation model (SEM) for a comprehensive assessment, which includes three latent variables: LSKD, NPP, and land use and land cover change (LULCC). Treating the Mongolian Plateau as a whole, we found that LSKD, POPD, and NPP are all positively correlated, with a weak correlation found between LSKD and NPP (r=0.12) and a strong correlation found between LSKD and LULCC (r=0.75) and NPP and LULCC (r=0.75). POPD showed significant positive effects on LSKD, while NPP had an insignificant or weak negative effect. EVI and precipitation (P) had significant, positive relationships with NPP, but albedo had a significantly negative effect. In addition, precipitation affected EVI positively and albedo negatively. The directions and strengths of the above relationships were not always consistent for IM and MG as independent systems. The addition of policy shifts to our SEM significantly changed the strengths of the above relationships in both IM and MG. The WTO for China and the collapse of the former Soviet Union for MG were two shifts included in our policy-inclusion SEMs. For both IM and MG, policy weakened the relationship between LSKD and LULCC, but strengthened the connections of LSKD~NPP and LULCC~NPP.",

            "abstract": "The vertical columns of formaldehyde retrieved from the spaceborne instruments GOME2 and OMI are used to constrain the biogenic, pyrogenic and anthropogenic emissions of formaldehyde precursors NMVOC at the global scale. To this end, those emissions are varied and optimized in the (updated) IMAGESv2 model. The adjoint model technique is used to minimize the bias of the model with observations from either GOME2 or OMI. The optimisation is performed on a monthly basis at the model resolution (2°x2.5°). The a priori biogenic emissions are provided by the MEGAN-ECMWF-v2 inventory for isoprene and from a previous optimization of methanol emissions based on IASI columns. Biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions are taken from GFEDv3 and from a combination of the RETRO global inventory with the regional inventory REASv2.\nGiven the different local overpass times of GOME2 (9h30 LT) and OMI (13h40 LT), the factors which might affect the diurnal cycle of formaldehyde in the model (chemistry, diurnal profile of emissions, mixing) are examined through sensitivity calculations. The simulated diurnal cycle is evaluated against ground-based measurements obtained by either the MAX-DOAS technique (in Europe, China, and Africa) or by FTIR (in the Indian Ocean). The agreement between simulated and observed normalized columns is found to be generally better in the summer (with a clear afternoon maximum at mid-latitude sites) than in the winter.\nBoth optimizations infer a reduction of the global biogenic emissions of isoprene (by 10-15%), which is largest (up to a factor of 2) over Eastern U.S. according to GOME2 and over Western Amazonia according to OMI. Those reductions and evaluated by comparisons with arcraft observations for different years (ARCTAS and INTEX-A). Northern Australia, Southern China and Northern Africa are also regions where both sensors indicate an overestimation of MEGAN. Biomass burning emissions appear to be likewise overestimated in Central Canada, Centrafrique and Burma. In contrast with these underestimations, the emissions due with agricultural fires in Northeastern China are strongly increased by the inversion (>50% in June according to OMI). Complex, and conflicting responses are found over Siberia and Alaska, possibly due to larger uncertainties associated to retrievals at those latitudes.",

            "abstract": "The first transboundary flow of water for the environment was delivered to the Colorado River Delta in spring of 2014. This engineered mini-spring flood of 130 million cubic meters (105,000 acre-feet) was implemented as part of Minute 319, an addition to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a temporary agreement, expiring in 2017. Teams of scientists from government agencies, universities, and environmental NGOs from both the U.S. and Mexico are measuring the surface flow rates, inundation, ground water recharge, ground water levels and subsurface flows, geomorphic change, recruitment, survival and health of vegetation, and avian response to the environmental flow. Monitoring includes on-the-ground observations and measurements and remote sensing. Surface water from the pulse flow reached restoration sites, prompted germination of both native and non-native vegetation, recharged groundwater and reached the Gulf of California – the first reconnection of the Colorado River and the sea in 16 years. People in local communities joyously welcomed the return of the river; extensive media coverage was overwhelmingly positive – despite widespread drought in the West. After about ten weeks, most of the pulse flow had infiltrated the subsurface, ponded in a few cut-off meanders, or run to the sea. The river no longer flows. Monitoring of seedling survival, groundwater, vegetation and wildlife will continue through 2017. Results of this landscape-scale experiment will play a role in negotiations to renew the agreement, help model and design future flows and guide the efficient use of water for restoration in semi-arid river systems.",

The inner probes (P3-P5) started to observe oscillatory flow braking with plasma sheet dipolarization due to fluxpileup at about 6:04 UT. After 6:16 UT the flux pileup region (FPR) expanded tailward as the outer probes (P1 and P2) moved closer to the neutral sheet and began to observe oscillatory braking also. During the FPR tailward expansion, the flow oscillation period increased from about 3.5 minutes at P3-P5 to about 6.2 minutes at P1 and P2. Meanwhile, as observed by the all-sky camera at Rankin Inlet, auroral activity gradually moved northward indicating that the increasing oscillation period of flows at the tailward retreating FPR is crucial for understanding the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "Pore pressure prediction is vital when drilling a well, as unexpected overpressure can cause drilling challenges and uncontrolled hydrocarbon leakage. One cause of overpressure is when pore fluid is trapped during burial and takes on part of the lithostatic load. Predictions often use porosity-based techniques, such as the Eaton Ratio method and equivalent depth method. These rely on an idealised compaction trend and use a single wireline log as a proxy for porosity. Such methods do not account for the many sources of uncertainty, or for the multivariate nature of the system. We propose a sequential dynamic Bayesian network (SDBN) as a solution to these issues.\nThe SDBN models the quantities in the system (such as pressures, porosity, lithology, wireline logs, fluid properties and so on) using conditional probability distributions to capture their joint behaviour. A compaction model is central to the SDBN, relating porosity to vertical effective stress, with uncertainty in the relationship, so that the logic is similar to that of the equivalent depth method. The probability distribution for porosity depends on VES and lithology, with much more uncertainty in sandstone-like rocks than in shales to reflect a general lack of understanding of sandstone compaction. The distributions of the wireline logs depend on porosity and lithology, along with other quantities, and so when they are observed the SDBN learns about porosity and lithology and in turn VES and pore pressure, using Bayes theorem. The probability distribution for each quantity in the SDBN is updated in light of any data, so that rather than giving a single-valued prediction for pore pressure, the SDBN gives a prediction with uncertainty that takes into account the whole system, knowledge and data. The dynamic nature of the SDBN enables it to use the bulk density to calculate total vertical stress, and to account for the dissipation of pore pressure. The vertical correlation in the SDBN means it is suited to the real-time analysis of logging while drilling data.\nWe show examples using wells from the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. The SDBN's shale pore pressure predictions are aligned with independent direct measurements on pore pressure in thin sandstone beds encountered during drilling, and the estimated lithology from the SDBN is in agreement with experts' analyses.",

            "abstract": "Geosciences have evident repercussions on society. Geoscientists possess knowledge and skills to investigate, manage and intervene on the Geosphere, and this implies ethical obligations. So, the adoption of ethical principles and standards is crucial if geoscientists want to best serve the public. Their ethical responsibility requires a more active role in interacting with society, by giving people valuable contexts that inform the need for sustainable development, and perspectives that reveal essential and delicate balances of natural systems that impact humanity. Geoethics consists of research and reflection on those values upon which to base appropriate behaviour and practices where human activities intersect the Geosphere, and should become an essential point of reference in geoscientists’ curricula. Acting in this direction implies the awareness by the geological community of its ethical commitments and the necessity to train new generations of geoscientists that in the future will be able to transfer to society not only practical aspects of geological knowledge, but also a new way to understand our planet. The IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics (\nwww.iapg.geoethics.org\n) was born to build a new awareness in the scientific community. It aims at joining forces of geoscientists all over the world, through creation of an international, multidisciplinary and scientific platform for discussing ethical problems and dilemmas in Earth Sciences, for strengthening the research base on Geoethics through scientific publications and conferences. Its main goal is to give a new cultural framework of reference, in which to develop effective training tools, in order to sensitize young geoscientists on ethical and social issues related to their future work, starting from the definition of shared values within the scientific community. This work provides an overview on the IAPG goals, activities and ongoing initiatives.",

            "abstract": "One of the most valuable groundwater reserves in Saudi Arabia is the Saq aquifer system (SAS), a thick (400−1200 meters) sandstone unit that extends across 300,000 km2 in Saudi Arabia and neighboring Jordan. Due to its high productivity and high water quality, current pumping and overexploitation of the aquifer has significantly lowered the groundwater level over the years. Understanding the recharge regimes of the SAS is critical for the development of sustainable exploitation of water resources in the region and for the establishment of appropriate management practices. In this study, we investigate the hydrologic setting of the SAS and seek to differentiate the degree of paleo versus modern contributions using a range of geochemical approaches. Multiple groundwater samples were collected from deep production wells tapping the SAS at depths between 375−1800 m and across a range of locations. Samples were analyzed for their chemical concentrations, stable isotopic compositions (δ18O and δ2H), and dissolved noble gas concentrations and isotopic ratios. Examining these data identifies unmixed pools of fossil groundwater at deeper depths as well as mixed shallower systems that indicate contributions from modern precipitation. Through isotopic and noble gas analyses, the relative age and timing of these recharge events was examined and show contributions from both glacial and inter-glacial periods, with some modest contributions from modern meteoric sources.",

            "abstract": "Subduction of aseismic oceanic ridges causes considerable deformation of the forearc region. To identify the crucial parameters for forearc deformation we created 3D finite-element models representing both erosive and accretive forearcs as well as migrating and non-migrating ridges. As natural examples we choose the Cocos ridge subducting stationary beneath the erosive margin of Costa Rica and the Nazca and Gagua Ridges that migrate along the erosive Peruvian margin and the accretive accretive Ryukyu margin, respectively. A series of models show that the deformation of the forearc depends on the ridge shape (height, width), on the frictional coupling along the plate interface and the mechanical strength of the forearc. The forearc is uplifted and moved sideward during ridge subduction. Strain components show domains of both, shortening and extension. Along the ridge axis, extension occurs except at the ridge tip, where shortening prevails. The strain component normal to the ridge axis reveals extension at the ridge tip and contraction above the ridge flanks. Shortening and extension increase with increasing ridge height. Higher friction coefficients lead to less extension and more shortening. Accretive wedges show larger indentation at the model trench. For stationary ridges (Cocos Ridge) the deformation pattern of the forearc is symmetric with respect to the ridge axis whereas for migrating ridges (Nazca Ridge, Gagua Ridge) the oblique convergence direction leads to asymmetric deformation of the forearc. In case of ridge migration, uplift occurs at the leading flank of the ridge and subsidence at the trailing flank, in agreement with field observations and analogue models. For a model with a 200-km-wide and 1500-m-high ridge (i.e. similar to the dimensions of the Nazca Ridge), the modelled uplift rate at the southern ridge flank of the ridge is ~1 mm/a, which agrees well with uplift rates of ~0.7 mm/a derived from the elevation of marine terraces in southern Peru.",

            "abstract": "The soil of asteroids, like that of the Moon, Mars, and other rocky bodies in the Solar System, is made of a layer of pebbles, sand, and dust called regolith.\nPrevious studies suggested that the regolith of asteroids is made from material ejected from impacts and re-accumulated on the surface and from boulders that are comminuted by micrometeoroid impacts. However, this classical scenario of regolith formation has problems to explain the regolith on km-sized and smaller asteroids: laboratory experiments and impact modelling have shown that the impact fragments can reach escape velocities and breaks free from the gravitational pull of these small asteroids, indicating the impact mechanism is not the dominant process for regolith creation. Other studies also reveal that there is too much regolith on small asteroids’ surfaces to have been deposited there solely through impacts over the millions of years of asteroids’ evolution.\nWe discovered that another process is capable of gently breaking rocks at the surface of asteroids: thermal fatigue by temperature cycling. As asteroids spin about their rotation axes, their surfaces plunge in and out of shadow resulting in large surface temperature variations. The rapid heating and cooling creates thermal expansion and contraction in the asteroid material, initiating cracking and propagating existing cracks. As the process is repeated over and over, the crack damage increases with time, leading eventually to rock fragmentation (and production of new regolith).\nTo study this process, in the laboratory, we subjected meteorites, used as asteroid material analogs, to 37 days of thermal cycles similar to those occurring on asteroids. We measured cracks widening at an average rate of 0.5 mm/y. Some fragments were also produced, indicating meteorite fragmentation. To scale our results to asteroid lifetime, we incorporated our measurements into a fracture model and we deduced that thermal cycling is more efficient than micrometeorite bombardment at fragmenting rock over millions of years on asteroids (see Delbo et al. 2014. Nature 508, 233-236).\nWe describe also some of the implications of this discovery: for instance, that production of fresh regolith originating in thermal fatigue fragmentation may be an important process for the rejuvenation of the surfaces of near-Earth asteroids.",

            "abstract": "This study represents the first simultaneous airborne measurements of BrO, BrCl, Br2 and HOBr in the tropics using a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (CIMS). The results suggest that inorganic halogen chemistry has a more significant impact on O3 depletion and oxidising capacity of the troposphere than previously thought. The CIMS instrument was operated on-board the BAe-146 FAAM research aircraft across 20 flights, as part of the CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics) campaign based on Guam, Micronesia and was supported by measurements of O3 and NOx from core instruments and bromocarbons from Whole Air Samples (WAS). The mean tropospheric BrO concentration over 20 flights was calculated to be 0.69 ppt; a factor of 4 times greater than that predicted by GEOS-Chem running with a tropospheric bromine simulation. An underestimation of HOBr, Br2 and BrCl in the model, when compared to the CIMS data, will contribute to this discrepancy, thus increasing the availability of atomic Br through photolysis, however this does not compensate for the bias currently observed. The magnitude of this discrepancy and subsequent effect on O3 depletion in the tropics is assessed and possible mechanisms are proposed. The measurements of these halogenated species are further used to assess their impact on the HOx budget in the tropics via steady state estimations.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate concretions in clastic rocks and their septarian fracture fills act as ‘time capsules’, capturing the signatures of chemical and biological processes during diagenesis. However, many aspects of the formation of concretions and septarian fractures remain poorly understood, for although concretions occur in clastic rocks throughout the geological record, they are rarely documented in recent shallow-burial environments. Consequently, the depth and temperature at which concretion-forming processes occur are often poorly constrained. Carbonate clumped isotopes have recently been applied successfully to concretions and fracture fills that begin to unravel the conditions for the formation of concretions and septarian fractures. Here, we present carbonate clumped isotope results of fracture fills from eight different concretions from various locations, including multiple phases of fill in 4 concretions. Our results suggest that they precipitated over a range of temperatures (22°C - 85°C) from d18Oporewater values between -12‰ to 3‰ and within different d13Ccarbonate zones. The majority of fills precipitated at lower (<50°C) temperatures, although the fluids were not always meteoric. For 3 concretions containing fractures with multiple phases, the d18Oporewater becomes progressively heavier with each later phase and increasing temperature. The one exception to this is in the Barton Clay Formation (UK) where the fractures must have been continuously filled during exhumation as the latest cement phase is the coolest with a d18Oporewater more 18O-depleted than the earliest phase. Therefore, concretion growth must usually initiate early on (<~1 km burial), and subsequent fracturing is also usually early. However, the fracture infilling can occur over a range of depths and can record the diagenetic history of a formation.\nWe gratefully acknowledge a BP and EPSRC Case Studentship for funding this project, and the Natural History Museum London for providing samples.",

            "abstract": "The complex geodynamic evolution of westernmost Mediterranean during Tertiary suggests the occurrence of STEPs (Subduction-Transform Edge Propagators) along the south-east Iberian-Balearic and the west Algerian margins, in relation to the westward roll-back of the Tethyan slab. Conceptual and numerical modelings of STEP predict strike-slip deformation above the deep tear of the slab, which has not been evidenced so far. We present here the first structural evidence of strike-slip deformation offshore Algeria likely associated to a STEP.\nNew deep multichannel seismic lines of the Algerian-French SPIRAL cruise (September 2009, R/V Atalante) and complementary industrial lines from Sonatrach on the westernmost Algerian margin display a narrow and straight asymmetric basin, bounded by two steep conjugate faults parallel to the margin toe. This basin is divided in two main segments following the change in direction of the margin in the Tenes area. The downward offset of the base of the Messinian salt layer in the basin attests of a thick-skin tectonics. The overall geometry of this basin is in favor of a Miocene to Plio-Quaternary crustal strike-slip deformation, with a transtensional component in the eastern segment, and possibly a dextral shear sense. Wide-angle SPIRAL seismic data modeling indicates that the basin is located at the ocean-continent transition (OCT).\nAlthough less clearly expressed in the Khayr-al-Din segment, a comparable basin is also present eastward in the central part of the margin offshore Great Kabylia. Its geometry there is similar to the one observed offshore Tenes, or with a transpressional component at its easternmost end northward of Tigzirt. It is also located at the OCT that is further north in this area.\nWe discuss the interpretation of this more than 400 km-long basin as the surface expression of a STEP offshore Algeria and the implications for the geodynamic evolution of Western Mediterranean.",

Following an overview of the challenges in implementing the CNH concept at the regional level, we used widely available measures of states in the social, economic, and ecological systems, including gross domestic product, population size, net primary productivity, and livestock and their ratios, to examine the CNH dynamics on the Mongolian Plateau during 1981–2010. Our cross-border analysis of the coupled dynamics over the past three decades demonstrated striking contrasts between Inner Mongolia (IM) and Mongolia (MG), with policies playing shifting roles on the above measures. For prioritizing future research on the CNH concept, we propose the hypothesis that while the divergence of IM and MG for 1981–2010 was largely driven by market economic reforms, the importance of socioeconomic forces relative to climate changes will gradually decrease in IM while they remain important in MG.",

            "abstract": "This talk will focus on the changes in communicating science in the last 20 years from the perspective of the same research project. Essentially the rapid innovation in online communication requires the scientist learning and utilizing a new platform of communication each year. To maintain relevant visibility and ongoing research activities requires finding synergy between the two. I will discuss how digital communication has inspired my research efforts. This talk will also examine overall visitation and media impact metrics over this period. From developing a highly visible glacier research web page in 1996, to writing more than 400 blog posts since 2008, and in 2014 utilizing a videographer and illustration artist in the field, this is the story of one scientist’s digital communication-media evolution. The three main observations are that: 1) Overall visitation has not expanded as rapidly in the last decade. 2) Contact and cooperation with colleagues has expanded quite rapidly since 2008. 3) Media impact peaked in 2005, but is nearing that peak again. The key factors in visibility and media impact for a \"small market\" research institution/project has been providing timely and detailed content to collaborative sites, such as RealClimate, BAMS State of the Climate, Climate Denial Crock of the Week, and Skeptical Science that can then be repurposed by the media. A review of the visitor metrics to the digital glacier sites I have maintained from 1996-2014 indicate visibility of each platform has a similar growth curve, transitioning to a plateau, but overall visitation does not increase in kind with the increase in number of platforms. Media metrics is more event driven and does not follow the visitor metric pattern.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 150 years, humans have altered the planet at a rapid pace. In this new era, the Anthropocene, environmental degradation has come to a state where sustainable ecosystem management has developed into an urgent quest for humans to maintain their own life-support system. The ecosystem services (ES) concept, initially introduced as potential facilitator to manage this quest, has been criticized for its vagueness to pose a barrier to the concept’s application in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on this vagueness as potential barrier to successful collaboration in the research community (interdisicplinarity) as a precondition to the concept’s application for sustainable ecosystem management (transdisicplinarity).\nFocusing on the European research project Operational Potential for Ecosystem Research Applications (OPERAs), the objective is to serve the research community with the identification of differences in conceptual perspectives on ES (differentiation), in order to recommend an effective way of handling these differences (clarification) as a basis for interdisciplinary integration (synthesis). With an emphasis on differentiation and clarification, the research process concentrates on the derivation of a typology of perspectives from the literature (RQ 1), on the basis of which perspectives in OPERAs are assessed with the help of Q methodology (RQ 2) in order to derive implications for how to handle the concept in the future (RQ 3).\nThe main findings suggest clear differences between three foundational perspectives but a more nuanced variety of viewpoints in OPERAs that can be summarized under five main perspectives. Whereas the notion of interdisciplinarity has often steered the focus towards disciplinary worldviews as the cause for different perspectives, the results point to the insight that perspectives on the ES concept are influenced by a more complex interplay of paradigmatic assumptions. Therefore, clarification is suggested to encompass more than the standardization of discipline-induced worldviews and to require open dialogue on underlying values and ethical stances. In synthesis, the question is not only how to use the ES concept effectively but also to what extent the concept can suffice sustainable ecosystem management in the long-term.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy provides unique insights into the organization of convective flows in the upper mantle. Its interpretation is however not straightforward and is related to deformation in the flow rather than to the flow itself. Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is mainly due to the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine crystals. Mechanical models of plastic deformation, and/or dynamic recrystallization can be used to calculate the LPO evolution of crystal aggregates, but complete forward modeling is usually numerically highly demanding, especially for 3D and time varying flows. Proxies for the relationship between seismic anisotropy and mantle flow are thus useful to interpret seismic anisotropy at a large scale, or to identify the zones in the flow where a more detailed and complete calculation of anisotropy is required. To determine such a proxy, we study the link between seismic anisotropy and mantle flow using a non-Newtonian rheology consistent with deformation by dislocation creep. Using analytical first-order flow models underneath a ridge and in subduction zones, we find that finite strain ellipsoid (FSE) is a robust proxy of seismic anisotropy, both in terms of orientation and strength, for natural strains smaller than ≈ 1. At larger strains, anisotropy fast axis aligns with the “infinite strain axis” (ISA), defined as the orientation of the long axis of the FSE in the limit of infinite strain, and its percentage reaches a plateau. Once combined these results provide an efficient method to model seismic anisotropy at low computational cost. Anisotropy aligns with the flow direction only when the product of the inverse strain rate with the time scale of ISA rotation within the flow is smaller than 0.1, which will occur in only restrictive parts of the upper mantle, making the use of the previous proxies more relevant.",

            "abstract": "Our study was undertaken at Fabrika Beach on the southeastern shore of Syros which belongs to the Greek Cycladic archipelago in the Aegean Sea. The island is situated within the Attic-Cycladic metamorphic core complex belt and is now located in the back-arc of the active Hellenic subduction zone.\nAt Fabrika Beach, blueschist facies minerals are observed in haloes fringing a shear zone within greenschist facies rocks. The approximately vertical shear zone cuts a near horizontal layer of greenschist facies rocks. The blue haloes are ca. 1 m wide, and are seen on both sides of the shear zone. The haloes consist of a carbonated blueschist facies mineral assemblage.\nBased on petrological, geochemical and thermodynamic evidence we show that these haloes were preserved at greenschist facies conditions in response to fast flowing CO2-bearing fluid. Furthermore, we use a simple mass balance to calculate the fluid flux within the shear zone which would be required to cause the observed preservation of blueschist facies minerals.\nWe constructed a simplified P-T vs. XCO2 pseudosection using PerPlex 6.6.6 to confirm that preservation of carbonated blueschist can occur at greenschist facies conditions in the presence of CO2-bearing fluid. The flux of CO2-bearing fluid along the shear zone was rapid with respect to the fluid flux in the surrounding rocks. Mass balance calculations reveal that the fluid flux within the shear zone was at least 100 – 2000 times larger than the fluid flux within the surrounding rocks. Mineral textures show greenschist facies minerals partially replacing blueschist minerals in the haloes supporting our interpretation that blueschist facies minerals were preserved during greenschist facies retrogression.",

            "abstract": "Exceptionally, the lowermost gabbros in the Oman ophiolite are black and totally fresh, except for minute traces of impregnation by seawater fluids at very high temperature (~1000°C). These black gabbros sharply contrast with normal, whitish gabbros altered down to Low-T~500-350°C. These hydrous alterations are ascribed to an unconventional model of seawater circulation and cooling of the permanent magma chambers of fast spreading ocean ridges. In this model, gabbros issued from the magma chamber cross a ~100 m thick thermal boundary layer (TBL) before reaching a narrow, Low-T high permeability channel where the heated return seawater is flowing towards black smokers and the local gabbros are altered. Uprising mantle diapirs in Oman diverge at ~5 km on each side of the palaeo-ridge axis and feed an overlying magma chamber that closes at this distance from axis. Preservation of black gabbros along the Moho implies that the loop of seawater alteration locally does not reach Moho beyond this ~5km distance (otherwise black gabbros would be altered in whitish gabbros). This defines an internal “thermal sink” within ~5 km to the ridge axis. There, the sink is efficiently cooled by the active hydrothermal convection that is ridge transverse. This has been documented near the Galapagos ridge by marine geophysical data, within the same distance. Beyond this critical distance, the cooling system becomes dominantly conductive and ridge-parallel. The TBL and attached return flow channels must be rising into the overcooled, accreted crust. Beyond the thermal sink, the 500°C isotherm rebounds into the crust. It is only after ~ 1My of crustal drift that this isotherm penetrates into the uppermost mantle in a sustained fashion, developing serpentinites at the expense of peridotites.",

            "abstract": "Mechanical compaction and associated porosity reduction play an important role in the diagenesis of porous rocks. They may also affect reservoir rocks during hydrocarbon production, as the pore pressure field is modified. This inelastic compaction can lead to subsidence, cause casing failure, trigger earthquake, or change the fluid transport properties. In addition, inelastic deformation can be time – dependent. In particular, brittle creep phenomena have been deeply investigated since the 90s, especially in sandstones. However knowledge of carbonates behavior is still insufficient.\nIn this study, we focus on the mechanical behavior of a 14.7% porosity white Tavel (France) carbonate rock (>98% calcite). The samples were deformed in a triaxial cell at effective confining pressures ranging from 0 MPa to 85 MPa at room temperature and 70°C. Experiments were carried under dry and water saturated conditions in order to explore the role played by the pore fluids. Two types of experiments have been carried out: (1) a first series in order to investigate the rupture envelopes, and (2) a second series with creep experiments. During the experiments, elastic wave velocities (P and S) were measured to infer crack density evolution. Permeability was also measured during creep experiments.\nOur results show two different mechanical behaviors: (1) brittle behavior is observed at low confining pressures, whereas (2) ductile behavior is observed at higher confining pressures. During creep experiments, these two behaviors have a different signature in term of elastic wave velocities and permeability changes, due to two different mechanisms: development of micro-cracks at low confining pressures and competition between cracks and microplasticity at high confining pressure.\nThe attached figure is a summary of 20 triaxial experiments performed on Tavel limestone under different conditions. Stress states C',C* and C*' and brittle strength are shown in the P-Q space: (a) 20°C and dry, (b) 20°C and water saturated samples, (c) 70°C dry and (d) summary of all the experiments. Three regimes of inelastic and failure modes are observed: brittle failure, shear-enhanced compaction and dilatant cataclastic flow.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of changes in magnetic transition temperatures in magnetite as a geobarometer for extreme conditions like those observed in a meteorite impact on Earth material or in meteorites. We used the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility along with XANES and X-ray diffraction for monitoring magnetic and structural changes. We will demonstrate that the shocked samples show a shift in the Verwey transition temperature (Fig. 1a and b) compared to the unshocked magnetite. Although the Curie temperature itself is very similar for all investigated samples, the shape as well as the amplitude of the heating and cooling curves are nearly reversible for the unshocked “0 GPa” sample but irreversible for the shocked samples. While the amplitude changes before the Curie temperature and above the Verwey transition temperature (Fig. 1a and c) are related to reduction in magnetic domain sizes due to fragmentation, the shift in the Verwey transition temperature and the irreversibility of Curie temperature cannot be explained by this mechanism and we suspect that chemical (Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in Fe3O4) or structural (lattice distortion) changes occur. These findings help to constrain data for a possible strain memory of magnetic transition temperatures in magnetite and help to explore the potential use of changes in magnetic transition temperatures as a strain memory as earlier suggested by Carporzen and Gilder (2010).\nCarporzen, L., Gilder, S.A., 2010: Strain memory of the Verwey transition, J.

            "abstract": "The leapfrog time-stepping scheme is commonly used in general circulation models of the atmosphere and ocean. The Robert–Asselin filter is used in conjunction with it, to damp the computational mode. Although the leapfrog scheme makes no amplitude errors when integrating linear oscillations, the Robert–Asselin filter introduces first-order amplitude errors. The RAW filter, which was recently proposed as an improvement, eliminates the first-order amplitude errors and yields third-order amplitude accuracy. This development has been shown to significantly increase the skill of medium-range weather forecasts. However, it has not previously been shown how to further improve the accuracy by eliminating the third- and higher-order amplitude errors.\nThis presentation will show that leapfrogging over a suitably weighted blend of the filtered and unfiltered tendencies eliminates the third-order amplitude errors and yields fifth-order amplitude accuracy. It will also show that the use of a more discriminating (1, –4, 6, –4, 1) filter instead of a (1, –2, 1) filter eliminates the fifth-order amplitude errors and yields seventh-order amplitude accuracy. Other related schemes are obtained by varying the values of the filter parameters, and it is found that several combinations offer an appealing compromise of stability and accuracy. The proposed new schemes are shown to yield substantial forecast improvements in a medium-complexity atmospheric general circulation model. They appear to be attractive alternatives to the filtered leapfrog schemes currently used in many weather and climate models.",

The unusual, for a high-pressure phase, layer-like structure of the post-perovskite may be responsible for the observed seismic anisotropy of the D'' layer. However, information about mechanical properties, easier slip systems, dislocations and their behaviour under stress are not well known still. This work represents a theoretical study of the post-perovskite within the semi-empirical approach using the Buckingham interatomic potential parameters previously derived by [3].\nTo describe the energy cost incurred as a result of a shear and to deduce the most favorable slip systems, the GSF excess energies are calculated at 120 GPa. The lowest energy barrier as well as the smallest values of the ideal shear stress (ISS), are related to the slip systems with the smallest [100] Burgers vector (b=2.521 Å) and to the slip system [001](010) with the glide plane cutting only Mg-O bonds. Good agreement with the ab-initio results [4] verifies the accuracy of the chosen inteatomic potential model [3].\nThe C-lattice of the post-perovskite results in four potential Burgers vectors: [100], [010], [001] and ½[011]. Taking into account the estimated GSF energies for different slip systems, we focus on mobility of screw and edge dislocations with Burgers vectors [100], [010] and ½[011]. The evaluated values of lattice friction suggest (010) slip plane parallel to the Si- and Mg-layers in the post-perovskite strucure to be the most probable .\n",

Moreover, we found evidence that a cyclotron-resonant dissipation mechanism must participate into the spectral energy cascade together with other possible kinetic noncyclotron-resonant mechanisms.\nOn the other hand, the spectral slope shows a large variability between -3.75 and -1.75 with an average value around -2.8 and a robust tendency for this parameter to be steeper within the trailing edge of high speed streams and to be flatter within the subsequent slower wind, following a gradual transition between these two states. The value of the spectral index seems to depend firmly on the power associated to the fluctuations within the inertial range, higher the power steeper the slope.\nResearch partially supported by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, contract ASI/INAF I/013/12/0 and by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 313038/STORM",

            "abstract": "Changing climate has the potential to directly and indirectly alter forest carbon dynamics and species composition, particularly in temperature or precipitation limited systems. In light-limited systems, species-specific response to changing climate could result in an indirect effect of climate through altered competitive interactions. Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Washington, contains one of the largest intact forested areas in the Puget Sound. Management priorities include development of late-successional forests and conservation. We sought to quantify how projected changes in climate would affect species diversity and carbon (C) sequestration given management priorities. We used Landis-II to simulate forest dynamics over 100 years using current climate and projected climate under two emission scenarios. Preliminary analyses indicate a decrease in soil C, relative to current climate, beginning mid-century for both emission scenarios. Under the low emission scenario, the decrease is compensated by increased aboveground C, while the high scenario experiences a decline in aboveground C. Total ecosystem C was consistent between baseline and low emission climate throughout the simulation. By late-century, the high scenario had an average decrease of 10 Mg C ha-1. Douglas-fir (DF) accounts for the largest fraction of aboveground biomass (AGB) in the study area. Interestingly, DF AGB was fairly consistent between climate scenarios through mid-century, but diverged during late-century, with the high scenario having the greatest amount of DF AGB (mean 368 Mg ha-1) and current climate having the lowest (mean 341 Mg ha-1). We found the inverse relationship when examining all other species. Given the uncertainty associated with climate projections, future simulations will include a larger suite of climate projections and address the secondary effects of climate change (e.g. increased wildfire, disease or insect outbreaks) that can impact productivity.",

The AUV development (IMGAM-project) is carried out as a cooperation of the company ATLAS Hydrographic and the MARUM at the University of Bremen. The combination of sensor inclination, sonar carrier frequency and pulse characteristics affect the ability of the system to detect bubble streams of different sizes and intensities. These variations in acoustic signal return from gas bubble streams depending on acquisition parameters can affect the detectability and acoustic properties of recorded acoustic flares in various seepage areas in the world’s oceans.

            "abstract": "We challenge the generally accepted view that continent-continent collision results in doubly verging orogenic wedges with well-developed retro-wedges on the overriding plate. In fact we argue that retro-wedge formation is restricted to specific rheological conditions within the lower and upper plates as well as the plate contact; thus being the exception rather than the rule during collision.\nIn this contribution we use a combination of physical analog and numerical experiments to infer favourable rheological conditions for the development of retro-wedges. In both analog and numerical experiments the contact between the colliding and neutrally buoyant continents is weak and represents the inheritance of a former subduction boundary. The degree of plate coupling however is not constant and is together with the rheological structures of the lower and upper plates, in particular the presence of decoupling horizons, key variable in this study. Plate boundaries are in all experiments orthogonal to the convergence direction.\nAnalog and numerical models with strong decoupling at the plate boundary and different levels (at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition) of the incoming plate lead to the evolution of mountain belts, where deformation propagates outward, in the direction of the incoming plate, by successive imbrication of upper crustal thrust sheets. Under these conditions, which are typical for subduction-dominated orogens like the Carpathians, the Dinarides or the Apennines, no significant retro-wedges with large-displacement retro-shears develop.\nTransfer of strain to the upper plate, a pre-requisite for the formation of retro-wedges, is favoured when the degree of plate coupling is high, the crust of the colliding plates is very strong and when the upper plate contains decoupling horizons (e.g. at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition). Under such conditions large-scale retro-shears develop and deformation propagates outward on the upper plate to form a retro-wedge.\nThese experimental results provide insight in past rheological conditions of doubly verging mountain belts, like some parts of the Alps demonstrating that retro-wedge formation is only possible under restricted rheological conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission monitors sea surface salinity over the global ocean for more than 4.5 years.\nThe objective of this presentation is 1) to analyse the signature of rainfall on SMOS salinity and 2) to validate it. This is a challenging task given that SMOS measures the salinity in the first top centimeter (S1cm) while most in situ measurements of salinity (SSS) are made at a few meters depth and that other effects than sea surface salinity may affect the radiometric signal, like sea surface roughness modified by rain drops and rain atmospheric effects.\nWe investigate the signature of rainfall on SMOS S1cm using various methods. First, we compare SMOS S1cm with ARGO SSS measured at about 5m depth in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in the Southern Pacific Convergence Zone. Second, we study the correlation between spatial variability of SMOS S1cm and spatial variability of rainfall. In both cases, we estimate that S1cm decrease associated with rainfall occurring within less than 1hour from salinity measurement is close to -0.2 pss (mm hr-1)-1. Given the multiangular retrieval of SMOS radiometric polarized measurements and given existing atmospheric models, we estimate that rain induced roughness and atmospheric effects are responsible for no more than 20% of this value. We then study the signature of rainfall on sea surface salinity measured by surface drifters at 45cm depth. 22 rain events, as detected by satellite rain measurements, have been sampled by surface drifters. We observe a decrease of the drifters salinity associated with rainfall of ‑0.21 (+/-0.14) pss (mm hr-1)-1, consistent with SMOS observations.\nWhen averaged over one month, the rain associated salinity instantaneous decrease is at most -0.2 in monthly 100x100km2 pixels, and at most 40% of the difference between SMOS S1cm and interpolated in situ SSS in pixels near the ITCZ. This suggests that more than half of this difference could be related to other effects like the in-situ products obtained from optimal interpolation and therefore influenced by smoothing and relaxation to climatology, radio frequency interferences or rain history. The relative importance of each of these effects will be discussed.",

Quantifying the effects of these drivers on species distributions and productivity under future climate-fire interactions is necessary for informing mitigation and adaptation efforts. In this study, we assimilated forest inventory and soil survey data and species life history traits into a landscape model, LANDIS-II, to quantify the response of forest dynamics to the interaction of climate change and large wildfire frequency in the Sierra Nevada. We ran 100-year simulations forced with historical climate and climate projections from three models (GFDL, CNRM and CCSM3) driven by the A2 emission scenario. We found that non-growing season NPP is greatly enhanced by 15%-150%, depending on the specific climate projection. The greatest increase occurs in subalpine forests. Species-specific response varied as a function of life history characteristics. The distribution of drought and fire-tolerant species, such as ponderosa pine, expanded by 7.3-9.6% from initial conditions, while drought and fire-intolerant species, such as white fir, showed little change in the absence of fire. Changes in wildfire size and frequency influence species distributions by altering the successional stage of burned patches. The range of responses to different climate models demonstrates the sensitivity of these forests to climate variability. The scale of climate projections relative to the scale of forest simulations presents a source of uncertainty, particularly at the ecotone between forest types and for identifying topographically mediated climate refugia. Improving simulations will likely require higher resolution climate projections.",

            "abstract": "The MAGIC field campaign, funded and operated by the ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) Climate Research Facility of the US Department of Energy, occurred between September 2012 and October, 2013 aboard the Horizon Lines cargo container ship Spirit making regular trips between Los Angeles, CA and Honolulu, HI. Along this route, which lies very near the GPCI (GCSS Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison) transect, the predominant cloud regime changes from stratocumulus near the California coast to trade-wind cumulus near Hawaii. The transition between these two regimes is poorly understood and not accurately represented in models. The goal of MAGIC was to acquire statistic of this transition and thus improve its representation in models by making repeated transects through this region and measuring properties of clouds and precipitation, aerosols, radiation, and atmospheric structure. To achieve these goals, the Second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2) was deployed on the Horizon Spiritas it ran its regular route between Los Angeles and Honolulu. AMF2 consists of three 20-foot SeaTainers and includes three radars, lidars, a ceilometer, microwave radiometers, a total sky imager, disdrometers, and other instruments to measure properties of clouds and precipitation; and other instruments to measure properties of aerosols, radiation, meteorological quantities, and sea surface temperature. Two technicians accompanied the AMF2, and scientists rode the ship as observers. Radiosondes were routinely launched four times daily, and during one round trip in July, 2013, eight radiosondes were launched each day. In total, more than 550 soundings were made. MAGIC made nearly 20 round trips between Los Angeles and Honolulu (and thus nearly 40 excursions through the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition) and spent 200 days at sea, collecting an unprecedented data set.\nBoundary layer heights calculated from the radiosonde data using several different algorithms, and those from other instruments such as the ceilometer, are compared for the entire deployment, and these values are examined in terms of other meteorological and environmental parameters.",

            "abstract": "Since the Pliocene, global climate history is distinguished by the transition into a colder world, dominated by the onset and intensification of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations which have also changed in their duration and intensity. Potential drivers for these events include falling atmospheric CO2, progressive sub-glacial erosion, tectonic uplift, and associated feedbacks. At present, isolating climate as the driver of evolving continental ice volume since the Pliocene is hindered by the limited long term data sets which directly link climate changes to evidence for ice-sheet advance/retreat, erosion, and tectonic evolution over million year timescales.\nIODP Expedition 341 drilled a cross-margin transect in the Gulf of Alaska from ice-proximal sites on the continental shelf to distal sites in the deep Pacific. This study focuses on the distal site (Site U1417, c.4190 m water depth) which contains variable biogenic and terrigenous contributions, and evidence for deposition through pelagic, mass movement and glacial processes. Our aim is to investigate links between north-east Pacific paleoceanography and the history of the north-west Cordilleran ice sheet, neither of which are fully understood given limited data pre-dating the Last Glacial Maximum.\nWe reconstruct SSTs during the mid-Pliocene, Plio-Pleistocene Transition (PPT) and mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) using the UK37’ index. We consider the interaction between SSTs and primary production by examining the absolute and relative abundances of plankton biomarkers (e.g. for haptophytes, diatoms and dinoflagellates), carbon/nitrogen ratios, stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) and diatom assemblages. Links between these climatic events and the north-west Cordilleran ice-sheet advance/retreat history are initially made using shipboard stratigraphy; emerging data sets on ice-rafting from members of the Expedition 341 Scientific Party will refine these relationships.",

            "abstract": "Liquid H2O covers approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface but it can also be incorporated as OH- groups in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) that constitute the Earth’s mantle, as observed in peridotitic xenoliths. The presence of even trace amounts (ppm wt) of hydrogen in mantle minerals strongly affect the physical, chemical and rheological properties of the mantle. The Earth’s transition zone (410 to 660 km depth) is particularly important in this regard since it can store large amounts of H2O (wt%) as shown by experiments and recently by a natural sample. Addressing the behavior of H2O at high depths and its potential concentration in mantle NAMs is therefore fundamental to fully comprehend global-scale processes such as plate tectonics and magmatism.\nWe developed an innovative technique to measure the H2O content of main transition zone NAMs wadsleyite and ringwoodite by Raman spectroscopy. This technique allows to use a beam of 1-3 µm size to measure small samples that are typical for high pressure natural and synthetic specimens. High pressure polyphasic samples are indeed very challenging to be measured in terms of H2O content by the routinely used Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and ion probe mass spectroscopy analyses, making the Raman approach a valid alternative.\nHigh quality crystals of wadsleyite and ringwoodite were synthesized at high pressure and temperature in a multi-anvil press and analyzed by Raman and FTIR spectroscopy as well as elastic recoil detection analyses (ERDA) which is an absolute, standard-free technique. We will present experimental data that allow to apply Raman spectroscopy to the determination of H2O content of the most abundant minerals in the transition zone. The data gathered in this study will also permit to investigate the absorption coefficients of wadsleyite and ringwoodite that are employed in FTIR quantitative analyses.",

            "abstract": "In a changing climate, future inundation of the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts will depend on the combined effect of storm surges during tropical cyclones and the rising sea levels on which those surges occur. The observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin is too short (AD 1851-present) to allow for accurate assessment of long-term trends in storm activity. In order to overcome the limitations of the short observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, we downscaled four CMIP5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic basin that span from AD 850 to AD 2005. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines these tropical cyclone simulations with storm surge models and local proxy sea-level reconstructions of the last two millennia, we provide insight into the connections between climate change, sea-level rise, tropical cyclones, and coastal flooding events like Hurricane Sandy of 2012. We present a comparison of pre-anthropogenic era (before AD 1800) and anthropogenic era (since AD 1800) storm surge model results from the New York/New Jersey region, exposing links between increased rates of sea-level rise and storm surge heights. An analysis of the characteristics and metrics of the tropical cyclones that create storm surges in this region is also performed. Results of this work will be a step towards improved scientific prediction of coastal inundation as a result of sea-level rise and tropical cyclones in our changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Detection of hydrocarbon shows in marine areas is of primary importance for oil and gas exploration since they confirm hydrocarbon generation and prove the presence of an active petroleum system. The use of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images serves as an ideal technology for the imaging of hydrocarbon seeps as it is cost effective, provides large ground coverage with continuous acquisitions and operates day and night and in all weather conditions. Here, we present results on the interpretation of radar images for seepage detection on the West African margin. Long-term monitoring of 150 SAR scenes during 20 years allowed the recognition of more than 1400 oil seepages.\nSeabed morphologies associated to oil leakage correspond to clusters of small sized pockmarks, 50 to 200 m in diameter, and high-reflectivity mounds. The correlation between the location of the impact point of the oil plume at the sea surface with the seabed features reveals that oceanic drift of the oil is less than 1000 m through a water column of 1800 m, with a rising speed of 10 cm/s.\nIn order to address the question of the seeps lifetime, we set up a short-term monitoring through the acquisition of one radar scene every 12 hours during 10 days in a specific area recognized for active oil leaking. Our main observations are: (i) the number of detected seeps varies spatially and temporally, and (ii) oil seep dissipation is effective in less than 12 hours. The variation of the hydrostatic pressure in the water column associated to the oscillation of the tide has been firstly considered as a possible mechanism controlling the expulsion of oil at the seafloor in relation with the number of seeps detected on each image. However, the correlation between the regional mean wind field and the amount of oil seeps strongly suggests that the wind is a primary factor to be considered for seepage detection. In addition, the age of the seepage on the sea surface is undetermined when the SAR imagery is solely used. As a result, it was not possible to confirm or invalidate the tidal hypothesis with the data collected. Future work towards the assimilation of SAR-based oil contour in a drift model is outlined. It will allow the retrieval of the age of the seepage and hence enable the proper assessment of the tidal hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "In south central Alaska large cryosphere fluctuations occur on a variety of temporal and spatial scales in a region of upper crustal faulting and folding associated with collision and accretion of the Yakutat terrane. Over the last decade (2002-present) the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity measurements from southern Alaska indicate region-specific trends of annual mass loss and large variable seasonal mass fluctuations. Unraveling the various geophysical signals within GRACE and continuous GPS data, as well as earlier campaign GPS data, has required acquiring geodetic constraints on changes in the cryosphere from satellite, aircraft, and in situ data. At broad spatial scales, short-term atmospheric loading corrections are important as well. On a more local scale, we use snow accumulation profiles from Larson’s GPS reflectometry, SNOTEL sites, and MODIS derived melt onset/refreeze timing to estimate the magnitude and timing of seasonal cryosphere loading and unloading. The regional GRACE trends need to be corrected for the rheological response to century time-scale ice mass loss as well. Our numerical modeling of the solid Earth response to cryosphere changes and earthquakes includes use of simple elastic models, regional finite element modeling with PyLith and a global normal model approach. For instance, our calculations predict the region specific GRACE trends due to ongoing mass change associated with viscoelastic relaxation following the 1964 and other earthquakes.",

Four short cores raised from the Alpha Ridge in the 1970s and 1980s from drift stations T-3 and CESAR showed ages between 45 and 76 my. The reason for these old ages became clear when examination of legacy seismic data from T-3 showed that in some places up to 500 m of sediments had been removed within an area of some 200 by 600 km, presumably by an impact of asteroid fragments.\nTo investigate the impact area, the authors conceived an innovative research platform in 2007. Named the R/H SABVABAA, this 12m by 6m hovercraft has been home-based in Svalbard since June 2008. During the following 6 years the craft and its evolving innovative light-weight equipment have made 18 trips to the summer ice pack, traveling some 4410 km over ice during some six months of scientific investigations.\nAn opportunity to get a lift to this area, some 1500 km from Svalbard, came in a 2011 invitation to join AWI's icebreaker POLARSTERN in its ARK-XXVIII/4 expedition departing Tromsö August 5, 2014. The 400 day drift will be the first wintering over, ever, of a mobile research platform with geophysical, geological, and oceanographic capabilities.\nThe Arctic ice pack continually moves due to winds and currents. While at the main camp, observations will consist of marine geophysics (seismic profiling with four element CHIRP, a 20 in³ airgun with single hydrophone, as well as 12 kHz bathymetry and 200 kHz sounding of the deep scattering layer), marine geology (coring with a hydrostatically-boosted 3 or 6 m corer; bottom photography; and two rock dredges), and oceanography. Deployed away from the camp, four sonobuoys will allow 3-D seismic acquisition. Access to the depths below the ice is via a hydraulic capstan winch, with 6500 m of Kevlar aramid fiber rope with 2.8 ton breaking strength. Ice thickness monitoring of the local 100 km² will be made with the craft's EM-31 probe when away from the camp, moving to choice locations for taking cores, and deformation of the ice pack monitored by 5 remote GPS data loggers. A meteorological station including radiation flux measurements will be operated. Several cameras will be used to observe under-ice conditions (ice formation, biology) as well as time-lapse local ice movement.\nThe talk will summarize the operations up to the time of the GEBCO 2014 Science Day at the AGU Fall Meeting.",

            "abstract": "With the increase of computing power and different kinds of geophysical data available for the same area, several joint inversion techniques using different types of seismological data, seismological and gravity data or seismological and electromagnetic data have been suggested for imaging the sub-surface.These approaches have the advantage of reducing the problem of non-uniqueness of inversion modelling, improving the convergence of models,and reducing the uncertainties.\nHere we use a joint inversion of P-Receiver Functions, seismic ambient noise and magnetotellurics for crustal imaging on a passive margin showing topographical anomaly. The Northern Scandinavia Mountains are a good example of a passive margin with high topography (peak above 1,000 m) for applying this approach as several types of geophysical data (seismological, magnetotelluric, gravity) are available in this area. The comparison between the results of magnetotelluric analysis and the results from a seismic study of the crust, shows that the location of the e-Moho and the seismic Moho is close (<5 km). Thus joint inversion has the potential to improve crustal imaging in this area and results in an improved crustal model across the Northern Scandinavian Mountains.",

            "abstract": "Deep interiors of large icy satellites such as Titan and Ganymede probably harbor a buried ocean sandwiched between low pressure ice and high-pressure ice layers. The nature and location of the lower interface of the ocean involves equilibration of heat and melt transfer in the HP ices and is ultimately controlled by the amount heat transferred\nthrough the surface ice Ih layer. Here, we perform 3D simulations of thermal convection, using the OEDIPUS numerical tool (Choblet et al. GJI 2007), to determine the efficiency of heat and mass transfer through these HP ice mantles. In a first series of simulations with no melting, we show that a significant fraction of the HP layer reaches the melting point. Using a simple description of water production and transport, our simulations demonstrate that the melt generation in the outermost part of the HP ice layer and its extraction to the overlying ocean increase the efficiency of heat transfer and reduce strongly the internal temperature. structure and the efficiency of the heat transfer. Scaling relationships are proposed to describe the cooling effect of melt production/extraction and used to investigate the consequences of internal melting on the thermal history of Titan and Ganymede’s interior.",

            "abstract": "The Earth constantly deforms as it undergoes dynamic phenomena, such as earthquakes, post-glacial rebound and water displacement in its fluid envelopes. These processes have different spatial and temporal scales and are accompanied by mass displacements, which create temporal variations of the gravity field. Since 2002, satellite missions such as GOCE and GRACE provide an unprecedented view of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field. Gravity models built from these data are essential to study the Earth’s dynamic processes.\nThe gravity field and its time variations are usually modelled using spatial spherical harmonics functions averaged over a fixed period, as 10 days or 1 month. This approach is well suited for modeling global phenomena. To better estimate gravity variations related to local and/or transient processes, such as earthquakes or floods, and take into account the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution resulting from the satellites sampling, we propose to model the gravity field as a four-dimensional quantity using localized functions in space and time.\nFor that, we first design a four-dimensional multi-scale basis, well localized both in space and time, by combining spatial Poisson wavelets with an orthogonal temporal wavelet basis. In such approach, the temporal resolution can be adjusted to the spatial one. Then, we set-up the inverse problem to model potential differences between the twin GRACE satellites in 4D, and propose a regularization using prior knowledge on the water cycle signal amplitude. We validate our 4D modelling method on a synthetic test over Africa, using synthetic data on potential differences along the orbits constructed from a global hydrological model.\nA perspective of this work is to apply it on real data, in order to better model and understand the non-stationnary gravity field variations and associated processes at regional scales.",

Measurements have been performed on different samples : Fe-10 wt%O ; Fe-10wt% Si ; Fe-5wt%Ni-12wt%S ; Fe-1.5wt% C. Using this dataset, we are able to probe the electronic structure and crystallographic structures of these iron alloys from solid phases up to the liquid state. Comparison between these measurements and ab initio calculations of the local structure of these liquids, allows us to discuss how the different light elements S, Si, O and C affect the properties of liquid iron alloys.",

            "abstract": "The continuous solar wind is typically categorized as either fast or slow wind. Unlike the name implies the constitutive difference between these types of solar wind streams lies not in their respective solar wind velocity but in their elemental compositions. The long-term averages of the dominant ions in the solar wind have been measured with various instruments and are remarkably homogeneous. Here, we are interested in investigating the minor species contained in the solar wind. SOHO/CELIAS/MTOF is a high resolution mass spectrometer which has been continuously operational from 1996 to the present day. The high mass resolution and long life time of MTOF allows to complement the existing observations with the abundances of less abundant species for both typical slow and typical fast solar wind. This allows to further strengthen the characteristics of both types of solar wind. In principle MTOF's time resolution of up to five minutes facilitates to investigate the short-term variability of the solar wind. However, MTOF is a complex instrument that was intended to be in-flight calibrated with its sister instrument SOHO/CELIAS/CTOF. But unfortunately CTOF was only fully operable for about half a year in 1996. Instead we use solar wind data from ACE/SWICS for the calibration of MTOF whenever both instruments are sufficiently close to each other that we can expect them to observe the same solar wind stream.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric ozone has been slightly depleted (2-4 % globally) by emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODSs). The landmark 1987 Montreal Protocol led to the end of most these ODS emissions, and total levels of ODSs have been declining since the late 1990s. The interim replacements for these ODSs were hydroclorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), but these HCFCs have also now been regulated. The period in which stratospheric change has been dominated by CFC-induced ozone loss (the “CFC era”) is now coming to an end, as a period begins when the impacts of stratospheric circulation and chemistry changes induced by Greenhouse Gas increases (the “GHG era”).\nThe stratosphere GHG-era will be characterized by continued decreases of ODSs and increases of CO2, N2O, and CH4. In this talk, we will describe how these factors will modify stratospheric ozone levels and the basic stratospheric climatology: CO2 and CH4 increases will increase stratospheric ozone, while N2O increases will decrease stratospheric ozone. In particular, GHG increases and the associated warming of the troposphere will modify stratospheric transport and cool the upper stratosphere. We will quantitatively show the contributions by various GHGs to these changes and the specifics of the chemical, dynamical, and radiative changes. Further, we will show how the stratosphere evolves under future GHG projections from the various Representative Concentration Pathways, illustrating the different changes in stratospheric ozone caused by the concurrent radiative, chemical and dynamical impacts of GHG changes.",

            "abstract": "To thoroughly verify the actuator disk model recently implemented in WRF for large eddy simulation (LES) of wind turbine wakes, simulations of various types of turbines and atmospheric conditions must be compared to full-scale field measurements of the real atmosphere. Here, numerical simulations are compared to nacelle-based scanning lidar measurements taken in stable atmospheric conditions during a field campaign conducted at a wind farm in the western United States. Using several wake characteristics—such as the velocity deficit, centerline location, and wake width—as metrics for model verification, the simulations show good agreement with the observations. Notably, the average velocity deficit was seen to be quite high in both the experiment and simulation, resulting from a low average wind speed and therefore high average turbine thrust coefficient. Moreover, new features—namely rotor tilt and drag from the nacelle and tower—were added to the existing actuator disk model in WRF-LES. Compared to the rotor, the effect of the tower and nacelle on the flow is relatively small but nevertheless important for an accurate representation of the entire turbine. Adding rotor tilt to the model causes the vertical location of the wake center to shift upward. Continued advancement of the actuator disk model in WRF-LES will help lead to optimized turbine siting and controls at wind farms.",

            "abstract": "This work is dedicated to the study of the lightning-related plumes in terms of origin, quantification of the plumes trace gas, and impact on the budget of ozone in particular in the upper troposphere (critical region regarding the greenhouse effect). Recently, Gressent et al., 2014, demonstrated that the majority (74%) of large scale plumes (>300km) from lightning emissions (LNOx) is related to warm conveyor belts and extra-tropical cyclones originating from North America and entering the intercontinental pathway between North America and Europe, leading to a negative (positive) west to east NOy (O3) zonal gradient with -0.4 (+18) ppb difference during spring and -0.6 (+14) ppb difference in summer. In order to better constraint lightning emissions impact in global models, a plume parameterization has been implemented in the 3D chemistry and transport GEOS-Chem global model (Harvard University). Such parameterization was successfully developed for aircraft exhausts application (Cariolle et al., 2009). It allows reproducing sub-grid processes related to lightning NOx chemistry and the chemical evolution during transport in the atmosphere. The issue is here based on the evaluation of parameters such as the plume lifetime and the effective reaction rate constant within the plume. The Dynamically Simple Model of Atmospheric Chemical Complexity (DSMACC) is used to determine such critical values and to better understand the chemical interactions between NOx and O3 species within the undiluted fraction of the plume. Additionally high-resolved simulations of the French meso-scale Meso-NH model are applied over specific case studies of thunderstorms in order to consider the dynamical conditions necessary to represent the plume dilution to the background atmosphere. Finally, sensitivity tests are carried out with the GEOS-Chem model to evaluate the impact of this plume-in-grid model on the ozone and nitrogen species budget.",

During the commissioning phase of the mission, seven burst mode acquisition campaigns have been run simultaneously for all satellites, obtaining a total of ten days of burs-mode data. These campaigns allowed the identification of issues related to the operations of the piezo-electric motor and the heaters connected to the ASM, that do not impact the nominal 1 Hz scalar data.\nWe analyze the burst mode data to identify high frequency geomagnetic signals, focusing the analysis in two regions: the low latitudes, where we seek signatures of ionospheric irregularities, and the high latitudes, to identify high frequency signals related to polar region currents. Since these campaigns have been conducted during the initial months of the mission, the three satellites where still close to each other, allowing to analyze the spatial coherency of the signals.

In western Argentina, major spatial and temporal variations in the geometry of the subducting Nazca slab since ~15 Ma provide opportunities to evaluate the late Cenozoic response of the Andean fold-thrust belt and foreland basin to subhorizontal subduction. Preliminary results from several structural and sedimentary transects spanning the frontal thrust belt and foreland basin system between 31°S and 35°S reveal Oligocene–middle Miocene hinterland exhumation during normal-slab subduction followed thereafter by progressive slab shallowing with initial rapid cratonward propagation of ramp-flat thrust structures (prior to basement-involved foreland uplifts) and accompanying wholesale exhumation and recycling of the early Andean foreland basin (rather than regional dynamic subsidence). Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic data prove instrumental for revealing shifts in thrust-belt exhumation, defining depositional ages within the foreland basin, and constraining the timing of activity along frontal thrust structures. In both the San Juan (31-32°S) and Malargüe (34-35°S) segments of the fold-thrust belt, geochronological results for volcaniclastic sandstones and syndeformational growth strata are consistent with a major eastward advance in shortening at 12-9 Ma. This episode of rapid thrust propagation precedes the reported timing of Sierras Pampeanas basement-involved foreland uplifts and encompasses modern regions of both normal- and flat-slab subduction, suggesting that processes other than slab dip (such as inherited crustal architecture, critical wedge dynamics, and arc magmatism) are additional regulators of thrust-belt kinematics and foreland basin evolution.",

            "abstract": "The quantification of shape parameters in pyroclasts is fundamental to infer the dominant type of magma fragmentation (magmatic vs. phreatomagmatic), as well as the behavior of volcanic plumes and clouds in the atmosphere.\nIn a case study aiming at reconstructing the fragmentation mechanisms triggering maar eruptions in two geologically and compositionally distinctive volcanic fields (West and East Eifel, Germany), the shapes of a large number of ash particle contours obtained from SEM images were analyzed by a dilation-based fractal method. Volcanic particle contours are pseudo-fractals showing mostly two distinct slopes in Richardson plots related to the fractal dimensions D1 (small-scale “textural” dimension) and D2 (large-scale “morphological” dimension). The validity of the data obtained from 2D sections was tested by analysing SEM micro-CT slices of one particle cut in different orientations and positions. Results for West Eifel maar particles yield large D1 values (> 1.023), resembling typical values of magmatic particles, which are characterized by a complex shape, especially at small scales. In contrast, the D1 values of ash particles from one East Eifel maar deposit are much smaller, coinciding with the fractal dimensions obtained from phreatomagmatic end-member particles. These quantitative morphological analyses suggest that the studied maar eruptions were triggered by two different fragmentation processes: phreatomagmatic in the East Eifel and magmatic in the West Eifel. The application of fractal analysis to quantitatively characterize the shape of pyroclasts and the linking of fractal dimensions to specific fragmentation processes has turned out to be a very promising tool for studying the fragmentation history of any volcanic eruption.\nThe next step is to extend morphological analysis of volcanic particles to 3 dimensions. SEM micro-CT, already applied in this study, offers the required resolution, but is not suitable for the analysis of a large number of particles. Newly released nano CT-scanners, however, allows the simultaneous analysis of a statistically relevant number of particles (in the hundreds range). Preliminary results of a first trial will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Pattern scaling methods have been used since the 1990s to estimate the results of global climate models (GCMs), in particular for emissions scenarios for which GCM simulations are not available. The basic method uses global mean surface temperature as the scaling variable, and relies on the assumption of a constant spatial pattern of change per unit global warming. This presentation will briefly review the status of pattern scaling science, using results from the published literature, and from a recent workshop held at NCAR. Successes and challenges will be illustrated of the use of pattern scaling to provide information on future changes for use by the impacts and integrated assessment modelling communities. This activity reflects anticipation of an enhanced role for emulation methods in a new process underway to produce integrated scenarios of future climate and societal change, which extends the number of scenarios of interest beyond the small set of RCPs used in GCM simulations for CMIP5.\nRelevant challenges include effects of non-linearities caused by: different responses to different levels of greenhouse gas forcing; different timescales of regional response for alternative forcing pathways leading to the same global temperature response; combining the effects of multiple individual forcing agents. Understanding and projecting the responses to forcing agents such as aerosols and land use is likely to be particularly important in emulating changes during the next few decades. Further challenges include how to represent uncertainties and multivariate changes robustly in order to provide a basis for realistic assessments of impacts and risks, and extensions to the basic pattern scaling paradigm. Such extensions include consideration of scaling variables other than global mean temperature, and the recent development of new approaches to emulation using alternative statistical techniques and different physical assumptions.",

The change in seasonal patterns of streamflow, combined with an increasing frequency of extreme precipitation, could further influence future reservoir management decisions regarding irrigation, water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation. To evaluate the sensitivity of seasonal reservoir storage and hydropower generation due to future climate change, a storage-based water balance model is developed for over 100 reservoirs that are used for U.S. federal hydropower generation. Historic hydropower generation, hydrologic observations, and unregulated streamflow simulated by a 4-km resolution Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, are used to estimate the likely monthly reservoir release, as well as the maximum and minimum water storage for various watersheds. The storage-based model is then forced with multiple dynamically-downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections to simulate the change of watershed storage and hydropower generation under different future scenarios. The proposed methodology could help water managers evaluate the vulnerability of existing energy-water systems and the need to adjust water management objectives in the future.",

            "abstract": "Bio-aerosols consist of microorganisms or biological particles that become airborne depending on various environmental factors. Recycling of wastewater (WW) for irrigation can cope with the issues of water availability, and it can also threaten Human health if the pathogens present in WW are aerosolized during sprinkling irrigation or wind events. Among the variety of micro-organisms found in WW, enteric viruses can reach significant amounts, because most of the WW treatments are not completely efficient. These viruses are particularly resistant in the environment and responsibles of numerous digestive diseases (gastroenteritis, hepatitis…). Few quantities are enough to make people sick (102 pfu). Several knowledge gaps exist to better estimate the risks for Human exposure, and on the virus transfer from irrigation up to the respiratory track. A research program funded by the French government (INSU), gathering multi disciplinary teams aims at better understanding virus fate in air and health risks from WW reuse. Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in order to prioritize the main factors impacting virus aerosolization. Irrigation with water loaded with safe surrogates of Hepatitis A virus (Murine Mengo Virus) was applied on small plots covered by channels in which the wind speed varied. Various situations have been investigated (wet/dry surfaces, strong/mild winds, clean/waste water). Air samples were collected above plots using impingers and filters after irrigation for several days. Viruses were quantified by RT-qPCR. The results showed that impingers were more efficient in airborne virus recovering than filters. Among environmental factors, Wind speed was the main factor explaining virus concentration in the air after irrigation. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment approach has been chosen to assess the health effects on the population. The main modeling steps will be presented, including a simplified dispersion model coupled with a dose-response assessment to characterize the risk.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent improvements in networks and data, the global aleatory uncertainty (sigma) in GMPEs is still large. One reason is the ergodic approach, where we combine data in space to make up for lack of data in time. By estimating the systematic site response, we can make site-specific GMPEs and use a lower, site-specific uncertainty: single-station sigma.\nIn this study we use the EUROSEISTEST database (http://euroseisdb.civil.auth.gr), which has two distinct advantages: good existing knowledge of site conditions at all stations, and careful relocation of the recorded events. Constraining the site and source parameters as best we can, we minimise the within- and between-events components of the global, ergodic sigma.\nFollowing that, knowledge of the site response from empirical and theoretical approaches permits us to move on to single-station sigma. The variability per site is not clearly correlated to the site class. We show that in some cases knowledge of Vs30 is not sufficient, and that site-specific data are needed to capture the response, possibly due to 2D/3D effects from complex geometry.\nOur values of single-station sigma are low compared to the literature. This may be due to the good ray coverage we have in all directions for small, nearby records. Indeed, our single-station sigma values are similar to published single-path values, which means that they may correspond to a fully -rather than partially- non-ergodic approach. We find larger ground motion variability for short distances and small magnitudes. This may be related to the uncertainty in the depth affecting nearby records more, or to stress drop and causing trade-offs between the source and site terms for small magnitudes.",

Through this region energy, mass and momentum are transported from the solar wind into the planet’s magnetosphere, playing a crucial role in the solar-planet interactions. Hence, the planets' magnetosheath present a high level of turbulence, with a rich variety of wave and stochastic phenomena. While the magnetic turbulence of the terrestrial magnetosheath has been extensively studied, not so much work has been done regarding the planets magnetosheaths. Therefore, and in order to expand our knowledge on plasma turbulence, we investigate here the main properties of the plasma turbulence in the magnetosheath of Saturn using the Cassini spacecraft data and compare it with the well-explored terrestrial solar wind turbulence. These properties include the magnetic field energy spectra, the magnetic compressibility and intermittency, at both MHD and kinetic scales. The analysis is based on in-situ data provided by the Fluxgate Magnetometer of the MAG instrument, which measures the magnetic field data with 32ms time resolution and the plasma data from the CAPS/IMS (Cassini Plasma Spectrometer) and the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), during 39 shock-crossings between 2004 and 2005. Similarities and differences were found between the different media, in particular about the nature of the turbulence and its scaling laws. These finding will be discussed along with theoretical implications on the modeling of space plasma.",

            "abstract": "An investigation of mercury (Hg) speciation in saltmarsh surface sediment (top 0-2 cm) and porewater (integrated 0-50 cm) was conducted along two monitoring well transects established within North Inlet Estuary (S. Carolina, USA) as part of the NOAA sponsored National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) network. Transects were perpendicular to the shoreline, from the forested uplands to the edge of the tidal channel, and traversed a range of vegetated zones from the high marsh (pickleweed, rush, and salt panne-dominated) to the low marsh (cordgrass dominated), as mediated by elevation and tidal inundation. Sediment grain size and organic content explained 95% of the variability in the distribution of total Hg (THg) in surface sediment. Tin-reducible ‘reactive’ mercury (HgR) concentration was 10X greater in the high marsh, compared to the low marsh, and increased sharply with decreasing sediment pH values below pH=6. The percentage of THg as HgR decreased as sediment redox conditions became more reducing. There were no significant differences in surface sediment methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations between high and low marsh zones. In contrast, porewater MeHg concentrations were 5X greater in the high marsh compared to the low marsh. As a percentage of THg, mean porewater %MeHg was 23% in the low marsh and 51% in the high marsh, reaching levels of 73–89% in a number of high marsh sites. Calculations of partitioning between porewater and the solid phase suggest stronger binding to particles in the low marsh and a shift towards the dissolved phase in the high marsh for both THg and MeHg. These results are consistent with a conceptual model for coastal wetlands where the less frequently inundated high marsh zone may be important in terms of MeHg production and enhanced subsurface mobilization, partially due to the subsurface mixing of saline estuarine water and freshwater draining in from the uplands area.",

            "abstract": "Chlorine concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in two well-characterized metasedimentary suites from the Catalina Schist and the Western Alps to determine Cl behavior during prograde metamorphism. The Catalina Schist is a subduction zone metamorphic complex in California, USA containing lawsonite-albite (LA) to amphibolite grade rocks recording temperatures of 350 to 750°C and depths of 15 to 45 km. Previous work has shown a decrease in N, B, Cs, As, and Sb concentrations from the LA to the epidote-blueschist facies, with relatively little loss at higher metametamorphic grade [1], and limited Li loss across all grades [2]. Metapelitic rocks from the Western Alps (Schistes Lustres and Lago di Cignana) record temperatures of 350 to 550°C and depths up to 90 km. In contrast to Catalina, N, B, Cs, Ba, and Rb concentrations are relatively uniform across grade [3]. In the Catalina Schist, Cl concentration shows a pattern of loss similar to B and N, from ~100-500 ppm Cl in the LA facies to ~100 ppm in the lawsonite-blueschist facies to relatively uniform concentrations of ~10-25 ppm at higher grades. This loss is likely not due to the breakdown of apatite as P2O5 concentrations remain constant across grade. In the Alps, Cl concentrations are overall lower and show moderate loss from ~10 ppm in the lowest grade to <5 ppm in the highest grade. δ37Cl values range from -1 to +1.6‰ and –1.7 to -0.7‰ in Catalina and the Alps, respectively. Both suites show significant isotopic heterogeneities within a single metamorphic grade and no systematic change in δ37Cl value with increasing grade. We interpret these heterogeneities to be inherited from the protolith. Despite large Cl losses, limited Cl isotope fractionation at high temperatures minimizes variations in δ37Cl value with increasing metamorphic grade.\n[1] Bebout et al, 1999, EPSL, 171, 53-81\n[2] Penniston-Dorland et al, 2012, GCA, 77, 530-545\n[3] Bebout et al, 2013, Chem Geol, 342, 1-20",

            "abstract": "Large stores of C in the form of peat are stored in permafrost, particularly in the boreal discontinuous permafrost zone. Ongoing climate change is causing widespread permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands, a trend which is expected to continue this century and thus make large stores of soil C available for microbial processes and mineralization. Permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands is often associated with an ecosystem shift from dry peat plateau to wet bog surfaces, and the net C balance following thaw is determined by the balance between the mineralization of plateau peat and the new accumulation of bog peat on top. In this study we collected soil cores (~3 m deep) from one peat plateaus and four bogs that differed in time since thaw (approximately 10, 50 and 500 years since thaw). In order to assess the potential microbial lability, we incubated 25 soil samples from each core under aerobic conditions at 17.5 deg C. Mineralization rates were 1-2 order of magnitude higher near the surface than at depth, but near surface samples also had high variability among cores.  Variability in peat microbial lability near the surface was related to thaw history and to differences in characteristics between plateau and bog peat. Mineralization rates of peat samples from below 1 m depth and down to the interface with mineral soil at 3 m were consistently low and had no difference among cores. Mineralization rates during the first 3 months of incubation for deep plateau peat samples were equivalent to 1% soil C losses per year. Relatively low microbial lability of deep peat in combination with high rates of new peat accumulation during the initial stages of bog development suggests that there is net C accumulation immediately following thaw but that the sink strength weakens or reverses during later stages when new accumulation rates diminish.",

            "abstract": "Water systems planners have long recognized the need for robust solutions capable of withstanding deviations from the conditions for which they were designed. Faced with a set of alternatives to choose from—for example, resulting from a multi-objective optimization—existing analysis frameworks offer competing definitions of robustness under change. Robustness analyses have moved from expected utility to exploratory “bottom-up” approaches in which vulnerable scenarios are identified prior to assigning likelihoods; examples include Robust Decision Making (RDM), Decision Scaling, Info-Gap, and Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). We propose a taxonomy of robustness frameworks to compare and contrast these approaches, based on their methods of (1) alternative selection, (2) sampling of states of the world, (3) quantification of robustness measures, and (4) identification of key uncertainties using sensitivity analysis. Using model simulations from recent work in multi-objective urban water supply portfolio planning, we illustrate the decision-relevant consequences that emerge from each of these choices. Results indicate that the methodological choices in the taxonomy lead to substantially different planning alternatives, underscoring the importance of an informed definition of robustness. We conclude with a set of recommendations for problem framing: that alternatives should be searched rather than prespecified; dominant uncertainties should be discovered rather than assumed; and that a multivariate satisficing measure of robustness allows stakeholders to achieve their problem-specific performance requirements. This work highlights the importance of careful problem formulation, and provides a common vocabulary to link the robustness frameworks widely used in the field of water systems planning.",

Wave transformation and wave-driven currents over these morphological features could provide an understanding of the hydrodynamic-morphologic coupling mechanism that connects them to the occurrence of erosional hotspots. To investigate this, we use the non-hydrostatic SWASH model that phase-resolves the free surface and fluid motions throughout the water column, allowing for high resolution of wave propagation and breaking processes. In this study we apply a coupled system of nested models including SWAN over a large domain of the North Carolina shelf with smaller nested SWASH domains in areas of interest to determine the hydrodynamic processes occurring over shore oblique bars. In this presentation we focus on a high resolution grid (10 vertical layers, 10 m horizontal resolution) applied to the Duck region with model validation from acoustic wave and current data, and observations from the Coastal Lidar And Radar Imaging System (CLARIS). By altering the bathymetry input for each model run based on bathymetric surveys and comparing the predicted and observed wave heights and current profiles, the effects of subtle bathymetric perturbations have on wave refraction, wave breaking, surf zone currents and vorticity are investigated. The ability to predict wave breaking and hydrodynamics with a non-hydrostatic model may improve our understanding of surf zone dynamics in relation to morphologic conditions.",

Here we present plagioclase chemistry and textural observations lavas erupted from Mutnovsky volcano, Kamchatka, which are consistent with the mixing of basaltic and dacitic components to form intermediate compositions basaltic andesite and andesite. These data are paired with whole rock chemical data, coexisting iron-titanium oxide temperature data, viscosity models, and MELTS modeling, all of which together elucidate magma mixing beneath Mutnovsky.\nMutnovsky is an arc-front volcano consisting of four superimposed eruptive centers, Mutnovsky I-IV, which has erupted lavas ranging in composition from basalt to dacite. Volumetrically, basalt and basaltic andesite dominate with only minor eruptions of andesite and dacite. Previous model results indicate that the chemistry of the Mutnovsky basaltic andesites is consistent with formation by the mixing of a basaltic and dacitic component. The chemistry of the erupted dacites is consistent with formation by partial melting of underplated basaltic material.\nPlagioclase compositions for Mutnovsky basalts, basaltic andesites, and dacites fall into two distinct populations, An80±10 and An50±15. The basaltic samples contain only the anorthite rich plagioclase population while the dacites contain only the more albitic plagioclase population. All erupted basaltic andesites contain both plagioclase populations, with a distinct gap between populations. The chemistry of plagioclase microlites in the basaltic andesites is more calcic than the albitic plagioclase population, whereas the plagioclase microlites in the basalts and dacites are the most sodic plagioclase observed for their respective samples. Sodic plagioclase in the basaltic andesites exhibit dissolution/resorption textures, indicating disequilibrium. These new data are consistent with mixing of a basaltic and dacitic component to generate the erupted intermediate lavas at Mutnovsky.",

            "abstract": "Many outstanding problems in Earth science relate to the geodynamical explanation of geochemical observations. Extensive geochemical databases of surface observations exist, but satisfying explanations of underlying processes are lacking. One way to address these problems is through numerical modeling. Although recently much progress on thermal-chemical convection modeling has been made, analytical solutions remain sparse. This makes testing and benchmarking the ever more complex models challenging.\nWe implemented tracking of chemical information in the mantle convection code TERRA (3D spherical), using particles. One value on each particle represents bulk composition; it can be interpreted as the proportion of basalt component. In our model, chemical separation happens at self-consistent, evolving melting zones. Molten material is transported to the surface, thereby increasing the basalt proportion close to the surface. On melting, we also record the time such that we can track the melting age of each particle. The system is set up to track the abundance of the 7 isotopes of the U-Th-Pb system.\nWe use a simplified setup of incompressible convection, without complexities such as phase changes and elastic/plastic deformation. We will show: 1: The evolution of bulk composition, showing the build up of oceanic crust (via melting induced chemical separation in bulk composition); i.e. a basalt-rich layer at the surface overlying a thin layer of depleted material (Harzburgite), and the transportation of these heterogeneities through the mantle. 2: A fit between the evolution of the pseudo isochron based on relative Pb-isotope abundances along the surface of the model; and the evolution of the isochron age based on the distribution of melting ages throughout the mantle. A good fit to analytical solutions (Rudge, 2006) is obtained which shows that our implementation is operating in a self-consistent way, plus it enables us to compare surface observables to internal dynamics.",

Then, the friction started to increase again at 17 m to 0.78 at ~20 m, and finally dropped rapidly to 0.4. The first weakening stage (< 2.5m) is associated with formation of cohesive gouge flakes made of mixture of partially hydrated and recrystallized fine-grained gouge (20-50 nm). The top of these flakes displayed cylindrical rolls, 1 micron in diameter, oriented normal to slip, and the macroscopic weakening correlates with the presence of abundant rolls. SEM analysis of fault surfaces at the second weakening stage (> 17m) revealed abundant melt features such as stretched melt drops, melt coating of solid grains and abundant voids in the melt matrix, contrasting with the total melt in high velocity experiments. These friction-distance curves in our granite experiments (e.g., Fig. 1a) bears a similar path of gabbro friction curve at high velocity (Hirose and Shimamoto 2005).\nWe propose that this non-monotonous friction evolution can be explained as a phase transition from initial pulverization of the brittle stage (low velocity, low normal stress, small slip distance), that leads to powder lubrication by powder rolling, to partial-to-full melting of the thermally activated stage (high velocity, high normal stress, long slip-distance) that leads to weakening by viscous flow. Further, the energy dissipation associated with partial-melting explains the unexpected strengthening for granite faults slipping at velocities of 0.05-0.2 m/s (Fig. 1b).",

This concept was conceived to allow innovative measurements and unprecedented, early determination of key properties of Earthbound CMEs from the L5 vantage point. Innovative measurements will include magnetic field determination in the corona thanks to Hanle measurement in Lyman-α and polarized heliospheric imaging for accurate determination of CME trajectories. With complementary in situ measurements, it will uniquely permit solar storm science, solar storm surveillance, and synergy with Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus (the ESA-China S2 mission launch is planned in 2021).",

From searching historical weather observations to submitting geologic samples, polar researchers utilize the a2dc to search andcontribute to the wealth of polar scientific and geospatial data.\nThe goals of the Antarctic & Arctic Data Consortium are to increase visibility in the research community of the services provided by resource and support facilities. Closer integration of individual facilities into a “one stop shop” will make it easier for researchers to take advantage of services and products provided by consortium members. The a2dc provides a common web portal where investigators can go to access data and samples needed to build research projects, develop student projects, or to do virtual field reconnaissance without having to utilize expensive logistics to go into the field.\nParticipation by the international community is crucial for the success of a2dc. There are 48 nations that are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty, and 8 sovereign nations in the Arctic. Many of these organizations have unique capabilities and data that would benefit US ­funded polar science and vice versa.\nWe’ll present an overview of the Antarctic & Arctic Data Consortium, current participating organizations, challenges & opportunities, and plans to better coordinate data through a geospatial strategy and infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Microwave links from cellular communication networks have been shown to be able to provide valuable information concerning the space-time variability of rainfall. In particular over urban areas, where network densities are generally high, they have the potential to complement existing dedicated infrastructure to measure rainfall (gauges, radars). In addition, microwave links provide a great opportunity for ground-based rainfall measurement for those land surface areas of the world where gauges and radars are generally lacking, e.g. Africa, Latin America, and large parts of Asia. Such information is not only crucial for water management and agriculture, but also for instance for ground validation of space-borne rainfall estimates such as those provided by the recently launched core satellite of the GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) mission.\nWURex14 is dedicated to address several errors and uncertainties associated with such quantitative precipitation estimates in detail. The core of the experiment is provided by two co-located microwave links installed between two major buildings on the Wageningen University campus, approximately 2 km apart: a 38 GHz commercial microwave link, kindly provided to us by T-Mobile NL, and a 38 GHz dual-polarization research microwave link from RAL. Transmitting and receiving antennas have been attached to masts installed on the roofs of the two buildings, about 30 m above the ground. This setup has been complemented with a Scintec infrared Large-Aperture Scintillometer, installed over the same path, as well as a Parsivel optical disdrometer, located close to the mast on the receiving end of the links. During the course of the experiment, a 26 GHz RAL research microwave link was added to the experimental setup. Temporal sampling of the received signals was performed at a rate of 20 Hz. In addition, two time-lapse cameras have been installed on either side of the path to monitor the wetness of the antennas as well as the state of the atmosphere. Approximately halfway along the link path a rain gauge from the KNMI operational network is located. Finally, data is available from several commercial microwave links in the vicinity of the experimental setup, as well as from the KNMI weather radars.\nWe report on the first results from this experiment, collected during the Summer and Fall of 2014.",

            "abstract": "During the past decade, numerical weather and global non-hydrostatic models have started using more complex microphysical schemes originally developed for high-resolution cloud resolving models (CRMs) with 1-2 km or less horizontal resolutions. These microphysical schemes affect the dynamics through the release of latent heat (buoyancy, loading and pressure gradient), radiation through the cloud coverage (vertical distribution of cloud species), and surface processes through rainfall (both amount and intensity).\nRecently, several major improvements have been made to the ice microphysical schemes that have been developed for cloud-resolving (Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, GCE, model) and regional scale (Weather Research and Forecasting, WRF) models. These include improved single-moment bulk 3-ICE (cloud ice, snow and graupel; Lang et al. 2011) and 4-ICE (cloud ice, snow, graupel and hail; Lang et al. 2014) schemes, a spectral bin microphysics scheme and two different two-moment microphysics schemes.\nThe performance of these schemes has been evaluated using observational data from TRMM and other major field campaigns. In this talk, we will present high-resolution GCE, WRF and MMF model simulations and compare their results with observations (GPM GV, TRMM and CloudSat). In addition, the main issues involving microphysics schemes in high-resolution (i.e., 1-6 km grid spacing) numerical models will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Joint inversion of the observed geoid and seismic velocities has been commonly used to constrain the viscosity profile within the mantle as well as the lateral density variations. Recent satellite measurements of the second-order derivatives of the Earth’s gravity potential give new possibilities to understand these mantle properties.\nWe use lateral density variations in the Earth's mantle based on slab history or deduced from seismic tomography. The main uncertainties are the relationship between seismic velocity and density -the so-called density/velocity scaling factor- and the variation with depth of the density contrast between the cold slabs and the surrounding mantle, introduced here as a scaling factor with respect to a constant value.\nThe geoid, gravity and gravity gradients at the altitude of the GOCE satellite (about 255 km) are derived using geoid kernels for given viscosity depth profiles.\nWe assume a layered mantle model with viscosity and conversion factor constant in each layer, and we fix the viscosity of the lithosphere. We perform a Monte Carlo search for the viscosity and the density/velocity scaling factor profiles within the mantle which allow to fit the observed geoid, gravity and gradients of gravity. We test a 2-layer, a 3-layer and 4-layer mantle. For each model, we compute the posterior probability distribution of the unknown parameters, and we discuss the respective contributions of the geoid, gravity and gravity gradients in the inversion.\nFinally, for the best fit, we present the viscosity and scaling factor profiles obtained for the lateral density variations derived from seismic velocities and for slabs sinking into the mantle.",

The savannahs study area is located into the Kruger National Park area and has 36 sites of lowveld savannas from bare overgrazed sites to medium-dense savannahs. The boreal forest study area has a chronosequence of black spruce ecosystems (recent burns, shrub-dominated regenerating forests , open canopied forests, moderately dense forest cover). Both study areas have a fairly level topography suitable for radar studies. The polSAR images were acquired using the same beam mode (FQ5 (23-25° incidence angle over the boreal sites, FQ15 (34.47–36.05° incidence angle) over the savannahs sites). Over each study area, soil moisture and vegetation structural data were measured in situ concurrently to the acquisition of the SAR imagery. The polSAR images were filtered for speckle noise using a Lee sigma filter and several polarimetric products were computed, such as those directly derived from the images (single linear and polairzed backscatters, polarimetric discriminators) and from target decompositions (Freeman-Durden, new van Zyl, Cloude-Pottier). Because most of these variables have a different unit, a normalized difference (in %) for each variable was calculated using the median values of the dry and wet dates for easier comparison of variable changes between the dates. Over both study areas, the normalized difference between wet and dry conditions was lower when higher tree canopy occurs. Results show utility of C-HH and C-RR polarized backscatters. Several polarimetric discriminators (dmin, Pr max, Pr min, Smax, Smin) were also significantly affected by the soil wetness. The Freeman Durden and van Zyl decomposition parameters outperformed the Cloude-Pottier decomposition parameters.",

The Fe XIX line emission, observed over an area in excess of\n4920 square arcsec (2.58x10^9 square km, more than 60% of the active\nregion), provides strong evidence for the nanoflare heating model of\nthe solar corona. No GOES events occurred in the region less than 2\nhours before the rocket flight, but a microflare was observed north\nand east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS during the flight. The\nabsence of significant upward velocities anywhere in the region,\nparticularly the microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX\nemission is not propelled outward from the microflare site, but is\nmost likely attributed to localized heating (due to reconnection,\nwave dissipation, or some other mechanism) consistent with the\nnanoflare heating model of the solar corona. We measure average Fe\nXIX/Fe XII intensity ratios of 0.070 outside the AR core, 0.22 in\narea of bright coronal emission (the area in which the Fe XII\nintensity exceeds half its maximum observed value), and 0.55 in the\nregion's hot core. Using the CHIANTI atomic physics database and\nassuming ionization equilibrium, we estimate corresponding Fe XIX/Fe\nXII emission measure ratios of about 0.076, 0.23 and 0.59. The\nemission measure ratios must be viewed with caution in light of\nlingering uncertainties in the Fe XII contribution functions.\nEUNIS-13 was supported by the NASA Heliophysics Division through its\nLow Cost Access to Space program.",

The geographical position of stations located near from the edge of the Tropical Stratospheric Reservoir is interesting since they are regularly interested by air–mass filaments originated from TSR or mid-latitudes. During such filamentary events, profiles of chemical species are modified according to the origin and the height of the air mass. These perturbations called \"laminae\" are generally associated to quasi-horizontal transport events.\nMany SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes) stations from all around the southern tropics were selected in order to study the variability of laminae. Profiles from ozonesondes were analyzed to detect laminae using a statistical standard deviation method from the climatology. Time series of laminae were investigated by a multilinear regression model in order to estimate the influence of several proxy on laminae variability from 1998 to 2013. Different forcings such as QBO, ENSO or IOD were applied. The first objective is to better quantify isentropic transport as function of the station location and the influence of the QBO on the laminae occurrences. Finally, cases studies were conducted from high-resolution advection model MIMOSA. These allow us to identify the air mass origin and to highlight privileged roads where meridional transport occurs between tropics and midlatitudes.",

            "abstract": "A Paris-Edinburgh Press (PEP) has been commissioned at the GSECARS beamline 13-ID-C, with a Si (311) high-energy monochromator and a multi-channel collimator (MC) assembly, which consists of two arrays of fine slits (WC blades) arranged in two concentric circular arcs. Both arrays consist of 75 slits with 0.8° separation and are located 50 and 200 mm, respectively, from the center. Slit widths of the inner and outer arrays are 0.05 and 0.20 mm, respectively. By oscillating the silts during data collection, background scattering can be effectively removed. Similar MC assemblies have been used extensively with PEP at ESRF for studying metallic liquids and low-Z materials [1]. The PEP is mounted on a general purpose diffractometer [2], with an area detector (MAR CCD) mounted on the two-theta arm. With unfocused incident monochromatic beam (65keV) collimated at 0.2 mm, 30 min is sufficient to collect weak signals of a 2 mm diameter amorphous silicate sample, with minimal background scatter from the surrounding solid pressure medium. An analysis shows that with a fine incident beam of 0.05 mm, a collimation depth of 0.5 mm can be achieved at two-theta angles above 10°. To increase pressure and temperature range, we have developed a cupped-toroidal Drickamer (CTD) anvil [3]. The anvil design, with a central depression, a toroidal groove and a small tapered angle, combines features of modified Drickamer anvil and the traditional PE anvil. By optimizing the parameters for the CTD anvil design, pressures corresponding to the mantle transition zone can be generated. Cell assemblies with thermally insulating materials have been developed and temperatures up to 2000°C have been maintained steadily over hours. In the future, the large horizontally focusing Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror will be applied to focus the incident beam, thus allowing samples with diameters below 0.5 mm in diameter to be studied. The excellent spatial selectivity provides an exciting opportunity for liquid structure studies in the PEP.

The framework will include ion and electron kinetic species in the ionosphere, plasmasphere and polar wind, and kinetic ion, super-thermal electron and fluid electron species in the magnetosphere. The framework is ideally suited to modeling ion outflow from the ionosphere and plasmasphere, where a wide range for fluid and kinetic processes are important. These include escaping ion interactions with (1) photoelectrons, (2) cusp/auroral waves, double layers, and field-aligned currents, (3) double layers in the polar cap due to the interaction of cold ionospheric and hot magnetospheric electrons, (4) counter-streaming ions, and (5) electromagnetic wave turbulence. The kinetic ion interactions are particularly strong during geomagnetic storms and substorms. The presentation will provide a brief description of the models involved and discuss the effect that kinetic processes have on the ion outflow.",

            "abstract": "The coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine are significantly impacted by the input of fresh water from a distributed river system. In this study, we focus on the four largest watersheds (Androscoggin, Kennebec, Penobscot and St. John) that contribute to the freshwater inputs. In particular, we investigated the input of dissolved organic carbon via PARAFAC analysis of excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. Monthly sampling of over 65 stations for three years has yielded a wealth of information about tributary characteristics. Specifically, we investigated the role of water quality properties and landscape coverage in the mobilization and flux of different components of DOC and how those properties vary spatially across the landscape and temporally over seasons and between years. Across all rivers, humic-like materials were the most prevalent components at the river mouths; accumulating along the rivers due to sequential tributary inputs. The concentration of humic-like materials increased latitudinally from the Androscoggin to St John, a geographic progression in source material also correlated to climate variations, land coverage or bedrock acidity. Dissolved proteins displayed positive relationships with climatological Chlorophyll a and total Nitrogen values. In all rivers, peak fluorescence of dissolved proteins was observed during summer months, with the maximum intensity observed in the Androscoggin River. The magnitude and pattern of seasonal flux of fluorescent materials into the Gulf of Maine was very similar between the Penobscot and the Kennebec rivers. The flux of all DOM components was highest during the spring freshet, with a secondary peak during fall precipitation maxima and lowest during August, likely due to both low mobilization and photo degradation of river borne materials.",

            "abstract": "Repeated high-precision gravity measurements made at Mount St. Helens (WA) have revealed systematic temporal variations in the gravity field several years after the 2004-2008 dome-building eruption. Changes in gravity with respect to a stable reference station 36 km NW of the volcano were measured at 10 sites in the summit region and at 4 sites far afield (10 to 36 km) from the summit in August 2010 and August 2012. After removing the gravity signal associated with changes in mass of the crater glacier and the local (perched) hydrothermal aquifer, the gravity field observed at sites near the volcano’s summit significantly increased with respect to sites far from the summit (maximum change 146 ±7 μgal). The pattern of gravity increase is radially symmetrical, with a half-width around 3 km and a point of maximum change centered 1.5 km NW of the 2004-2008 lava dome. Inversion of residual gravity data using the same source geometry, depth and location inferred from geodetic data (a spheroidal source centered 7.5 km beneath the 2004-2008 dome) indicates a mass increase of about 1012 kg. For a reasonable magma density (~2250 kg/m3), the volume of magma intrusion beneath the summit region inferred from gravity exceeds the volume inferred from inversion of geodetic data, suggesting that magma compressibility and other processes are important aspects of magma storage at Mount St. Helens. A third survey will be completed in August 2014, and we will present results of those measurements in the context of the 2010-2012 gravity changes.",

            "abstract": "Earth's ionosphere presents a threat to human activities such as satellite positioning and timing, radio communications and surveillance. Nowcasts and forecasts of the ionosphere could help mitigate these damaging effects. Recent advances in the field of ionospheric imaging, as well as new storm-time ionospheric forecasting results are presented here. The approach combines globally distributed GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements with an ensemble of coupled thermosphere-ionosphere models in order to produce short-term forecasts during a storm. One-hour forecast accuracy is much better than a climatological model run. Using this ensemble approach, it is possible to infer the neutral O/N2 ratio from TEC measurements so that subsequent TEC forecasts are improved. A review of ionospheric physics and data assimilation will also be given. The term data assimilation refers to a group of techniques designed to estimate atmospheric or oceanic states. In practice, data assimilation techniques seek to improve modeled estimates of the atmospheric state by incorporating observations. The relationship between data assimilation and forecasting is explored with reference to the physics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system. The work presented here uses the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), which is an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation framework. This is combined with a version of the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) that has been modified to accept more detailed solar and geomagnetic driver specifications. Future directions of work include the inference of Solar and geomagnetic drivers from the data assimilation process as well as coupling with lower-atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "As urbanization progresses, microclimate modifications are also aggravated and the increasing environmental concerns call for more sophisticated methods of urban microclimate analysis. Comprehensive numerical simulations for a clear summer day in southern California are performed in a compact low-rise urban environment. The effect of realistic unsteady, non-uniform thermal forcing, that is caused by solar insolation and inter-building shadowing on thermal and flow conditions are analyzed based on Algebraic Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model.\nThe urban thermal field is influenced by urban density, material properties and local weather conditions, as well as urban canyon flow. Urban canyon conditions are translated into vertical and horizontal bulk Richardson numbers indicating atmospheric instability and solar tilt with respect to the momentum forcing of the canyon vortex, respectively. The effect of roof heating is found to be critical on the vortex formation between buildings when the vertical bulk Richardson number is low.\nVariations of Convective Heat Transfer Coefficients (CHTCs) along building walls are studied and the street canyon ventilation performance is characterized by the mean of air exchange rate (ACH). It is found that volumetric air exchange from street canyons, as well as the distribution of heat transfer along the wall depends strongly on the three-dimensional orientation of the heated wall in relation to wind direction. For example, air removal increases by surface heating and is larger when the leeward wall is heated. In summary, we demonstrate the importance of considering complex realistic conditions on 3-dimensional thermal and momentum fields in Urban Environments.",

            "abstract": "During geomagnetic storm, the energy transfer from solar wind to magnetosphere-ionosphere system adversely affects the communication and navigation systems. Quantifying storm impacts on TEC (Total Electron Content) and assessment of modeling capability of reproducing storm impacts on TEC are of importance to specifying and forecasting space weather. In order to quantify storm impacts on TEC, we considered several parameters: TEC changes compared to quiet time (the day before storm), TEC difference between 24-hour intervals, and maximum increase/decrease during the storm. We investigated the spatial and temporal variations of the parameters during the 2006 AGU storm event (14-15 Dec. 2006) using ground-based GPS TEC measurements in the selected 5 degree eight longitude sectors. The latitudinal variations were also studied in two longitude sectors among the eight sectors where data coverage is relatively better. We obtained modeled TEC from various ionosphere/thermosphere (IT) models. The parameters from the models were compared with each other and with the observed values. We quantified performance of the models in reproducing the TEC variations during the storm using skill scores. This study has been supported by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Model outputs and observational data used for the study will be permanently posted at the CCMC website (http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov) for the space science communities to use.",

            "abstract": "Observations by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite have demonstrated the existence of Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) regions populated by particles in the size range between 60 and 100 nm (radii of equivalent volume spheres). It is known from lidar, SOFIE, and CIPS measurements that typical mean PMC particle sizes are of the order of 40-50 nm. Determination of particle sizes by CIPS is accomplished by measuring the scattering of solar radiation at various scattering angles at a spatial resolution of 25 km2. PMC with ice particles principally in this 60-100 nm range are observed in 15 to 20 % of all CIPS measurements. These very large particle (VLP) events occur over spatially coherent areas. They are generally associated with regions of low cloud albedo (brightness) and ice water content. We postulate that at least part of this VLP population exists due to the action of long-period gravity waves in the low-temperature summertime mesopause region. We demonstrate the proposed mechanism through use of the 2D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), which simulates the evolution of ice particles over several cycles of a family of modeled gravity waves. The model results are consistent with a VLP population in the cold troughs of monochromatic gravity waves with horizontal wavelengths of 600 km and periods of 10 hours (Chandran et al., 2013).",

Observing soil erosion of a relatively large field under truly unobstructed runoff conditions has rarely been done and doccumented. Report here is the results of our observation of soil erosion in a 7.3 ha peanut-cotton cropping system in the Mears Farm of Grand Ridge, FL. We used the mesh-pad method to quantify soil loss from the field and soil re-deposition in the field over the cropping season of 2010. The main slope (1-3 %) of the field is about 210 m long. We show that the amount of soil re-deposition was 50-150 times of the soil loss from the slope. The corresponding organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorous and silt and clay contents of the lost soil, however, were 20.9%, 21%, 17.6% and 14.2%, respectively, of the total amounts re-deposited on the slope. The amounts of soil loss predicted by a SWAT model was 10-20 times greater than our observed values. Soil erosion process was quite heterogeneous, as shown by the mesh-pad method, even on a seemingly uniform cultivated field. Soil erosion models need to be verified and calibrated by extensive quality field data in order to improve their performance.",

            "abstract": "We are using airborne lidar and satellite-based radar interferometry (InSAR) to quantify short-term (months to years) and longer-term (decades) subsidence in the area surrounding two large (100- to 200-m diameter) sinkholes that formed above Permian bedded salt in 1980 and 2002 in the Wink area, west Texas. Radar interferograms constructed from synthetic aperture radar data acquired between 2008 and 2011 with the ALOS PALSAR L-band satellite-borne instrument reveal local areas that are subsiding at rates that reach a few cm per month. Subsiding areas identified on radar interferograms enable labor-intensive ground investigations (such as microgravity surveys) to focus on areas where subsidence is occurring and shallow-source mass deficits might exist that could be sites of future subsidence or collapse.\nLonger-term elevation changes are being quantified by comparing digital elevation models (DEMs) constructed from high-resolution airborne lidar data acquired over a 32-km2 area in 2013 with older, lower-resolution DEMs constructed from data acquired during the NASA- and NGA-sponsored Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission in February 2000 and from USGS aerial photogrammetry-derived topographic data from the 1960s. Total subsidence reaches more than 10 m over 45 years in some areas. Maximum rates of subsidence measured on annual (from InSAR) and decadal (from lidar) time scales are about 0.25 m/yr. In addition to showing the extent and magnitude of subsidence at the 1980 and 2002 sinkholes, comparison of the 2013 lidar-derived DEM with the 1960s photogrammetry-derived DEM revealed other locations that have undergone significant (more than 1 m) elevation change since the 1960s, but show no evidence of recent (2008 to 2011) ground motion from satellite radar interferograms. Regional coverage obtained by radar interferometry and local coverage obtained with airborne lidar show that areas of measurable subsidence are all within a few km of the 1980 and 2002 sinkholes.",

            "abstract": "The National Climate Assessment process is developing a system of physical, ecological, and societal indicators that communicate key aspects of the physical climate, climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and preparedness for the purpose of informing both decision makers and the public. Implementing a 14 year record of Gross and Net Primary Productivity (GPP/NPP) derived from the NASA EOS MODIS satellite sensor we demonstrate how these products can serve as Ecosystem Productivity and Vegetation Health National Climate Indicators for implementation in sustained National Climate Assessments. The NPP product combines MODIS vegetation data with daily global meteorology to calculate annual growth of all plant material at 1 sq. km resolution. NPP anomalies identify regions with above or below average plant growth that may result from climate fluctuations and can inform carbon source/sink dynamics, agricultural and forestry yield measures, and response to wildfire or drought conditions. The GPP product provides a high temporal resolution (8-day) metric of vegetation growth which can be used to monitor short-term vegetation response to extreme events and implemented to derive vegetation phenology metrics; growing season start, end, and length, which can elucidate land cover and regionally specific vegetation responses to a changing climate. The high spatial resolution GPP and NPP indicators can also inform and clarify responses seen from other proposed Pilot Indicators such as forest growth/productivity, land cover, crop production, and phenology. The GPP and NPP data are in continuous production and will be sustained into the future with the next generation satellite missions. The long-term Ecosystem Productivity and Vegetation Health Indicators are ideal for use in sustained National Climate Assessments, providing regionally specific responses to a changing climate and complete coverage at the national scale.",

            "abstract": "The eﬀect of clouds on large scale dynamics is represented in climate models through parameterization of various processes, of which the parameterization of shallow and deep convection are particularly uncertain. The atmospheric boundary layer, which controls the coupling to the surface, and which deﬁnes the scale of shallow convection, is typically 1 km in depth. Thus, simulations on a O(100 m) grid largely obviate the need for such parameterizations. By crossing this threshold of O(100m) grid resolution one can begin thinking of large-eddy simulation (LES), wherein the sub-grid scale parameterization have a sounder theoretical foundation. Substantial initiatives have been taken internationally to approach this threshold. For example, Miura et al., 2007 and Mirakawa et al., 2014 approach this threshold by doing global simulations, with (gradually) decreasing grid resolution, to understand the eﬀect of cloud-resolving scales on the general circulation. Our strategy, on the other hand, is to take a big leap forward by ﬁxing the resolution at O(100 m), and gradually increasing the domain size. We believe that breaking this threshold would greatly help in improving the parameterization schemes and reducing the uncertainty in climate predictions.\nTo take this forward, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has initiated a project on HD(CP)2 that aims for a limited area LES at resolution O(100 m) using the new unified modeling system ICON (Zängl et al., 2014). In the talk, results from the HD(CP)2 evaluation simulation will be shown that targets high resolution simulation over a small domain around Jülich, Germany. This site is chosen because high resolution HD(CP)2 Observational Prototype Experiment took place in this region from 1.04.2013 to 31.05.2013, in order to critically evaluate the model. Nesting capabilities of ICON is used to gradually increase the resolution from the outermost domain, which is forced from the COSMO-DE data, to the innermost and ﬁnest resolution domain centered around Jülich (see Fig. 1 top panel). Furthermore, detailed analyses of the simulation results against the observation data will be presented. A reprsentative figure showing time series of column integrated water vapor (IWV) for both model and observation on 24.04.2013 is shown in bottom panel of Fig. 1.",

            "abstract": "Multiple approaches including 210Pb dating, grain-size distribution and heavy metal elements (Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) concentration of sediments from two cores in the intertidal zone of Beibu Bay were used in order to discuss the human impact on sedimentary environment since the last 200 years. The average sedimentation rate of cores YX07 and YX05 is 0.45 cm/a and 0.37 cm/a, respectively. The two cores span the last 231 and 210 years. The downcore concentration of heavy metal elements generally shows a contrary trend as mean grain-size, suggesting that heavy metal elements tend to be rich in finer grain-size materials. The similar values and stable downcore variation of ratio of trace elements (La/Th ) in sediments of the both cores indicate that the sediment sources of the two cores are similar and not changed through time. The sedimentary environment before 1930AD was influenced by nature factors, whereas largely influenced by human activity after the time. The mean grain-size became coarser since about 1930, possibly resulted from strengthened physical erosion of soils by stronger anthropogenic impact. Moreover, the 2-3 times increase of Al-normalized heavy minerals such as As, Pb, and Cu since the time suggests that vast industry and domestic wastewater was poured to the estuarine and coastal area and thus deteriorated the environment of the intertidal zones.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation state of igneous materials on a planet is a critically-important variable in understanding magma evolution on bodies in our solar system. However, direct and indirect methods for quantifying redox states are challenging, especially across the broad spectrum of silicate glass compositions found on airless bodies. On the Moon, early Mössbauer studies of bulk samples suggested the presence of significant Fe3+ (>10%) in lunar glasses (green, orange, brown); lunar analog glasses synthesized at fO2 <10-11 have similar Fe3+. All these Mössbauer spectra are challenging to interpret due to the presence of multiple coordination environments in the glasses.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) allows pico- and nano-scale interrogation of primitive planetary materials using the pre-edge, main edge, and EXAFS regions of absorption edge spectra. Current uses of XAS require availability of standards with compositions similar to those of unknowns and complex procedures for curve-fitting of pre-edge features that produce results with poorly constrained accuracy.\nA new approach to accurate and quantitative redox measurements with XAS is to couple use of spectra from synthetic glass standards covering a broad compositional range with multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques. Mössbauer and XAS spectra from a suite of 33 synthetic glass standards covering a wide range of compositions and fO2(Dyar et al., this meeting) were used to develop a MVA model that utilizes valuable predictive information not only in the major spectral peaks/features, but in all channels of the XAS region. Algorithms for multivariate analysis t were used to \"learn\" the characteristics of a data set as a function of varying spectral characteristics.\nThese models were applied to the study of lunar glasses, which provide a challenging test case for these newly-developed techniques due to their very low fO2. Application of the new XAS calibration model to Apollo 15 green (15426, 15427 and 15425), Apollo 17 orange (74220 ), and other lunar glasses confirms the Fe3+ contents from Mössbauer and shows that higher-Si glasses tend to have slightly elevated Fe3+.",

            "abstract": "During mid-September 2013, approximately 360 mm of precipitation fell in the headwaters of the North St. Vrain drainage basin, Front Range, CO. Debris flows on steep hillslopes and extensive flooding along North St. Vrain Creek resulted in extreme sedimentation within Ralph Price Reservoir, municipal water supply for the City of Longmont. The event allows comparison of historical sedimentation with that of an unusually large flood because 1) no reservoir flushing has been conducted since dam construction, 2) reservoir stratigraphy chronicles uninterrupted delta deposition, and 3) this is the only on-channel reservoir with unimpeded, natural sediment flux from the Continental Divide to the mountain front in a basin with no significant historic flow modifications and land use impacts. Assessing the flood-related sedimentation prior to any dredging activities included coring the reservoir delta, a bathymetric survey of the delta, resistivity and ground penetrating radar surveys of the subaerial inlet deposit, and surveying tributary deposits. Over the 44-year life of the reservoir, two-thirds of the delta sedimentation is attributed to extreme discharges from the September 2013 storm. Total storm-derived reservoir sedimentation is approximately 275,000 m3, with 81% of that within the gravel-dominated inlet and 17% in the delta. Volumes of deposition within reservoir tributary inlets is negatively correlated with contributing area, possibly due to a lack of storage in these small basins (1-5 km2). Flood-related reservoir sedimentation will be compared to other research quantifying volumes from slope failures evident on post-storm lidar. Analysis of delta core samples will quantify organic carbon flux associated with the extreme discharge and develop a chronology of flood and fire disturbances for North St. Vrain basin. Applications of similar techniques are planned for two older Front Range reservoirs affected by the September flooding to fill knowledge gaps about event-based sedimentation and to expand these rates to annual and decadal scales.",

            "abstract": "Cumberland Gap Tunnel was constructed in 1996 to improve highway travel between southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee and to restore Cumberland Gap to its historical appearance. About five years after construction, the concrete pavement in the tunnel began to exhibit noticeable signs of subsidence. Ground penetrating radar surveys detected voids in many areas of the limestone roadbed aggregate beneath the pavement. Field investigations conducted by the Kentucky Geological Survey and Kentucky Transportation Center from 2006 to 2008 discovered that groundwater was flowing from the bedrock invert into the aggregate along many parts of the tunnel. Average groundwater discharge from the tunnel was measured at approximately 1700 m3/d. We analyzed 265 groundwater samples collected from aggregate in different parts of the tunnel roadbed during low and high flow conditions. Calculated calcite saturation indices indicated that the groundwater was geochemically aggressive and capable of continuously dissolving calcite in the limestone aggregate although pH values of these water samples were near neutral. We also conducted an in-situ dissolution experiment by placing eight baskets filled with limestone aggregate beneath the roadbed in different locations in the tunnel for 178 days. At the end of the experiment, the limestone aggregate in contact with groundwater exhibited visual signs of dissolution and lost mass, and the highest mass loss recorded was 3.4 percent. Mass loss calculations based on kinetic models of calcite mineral and water samples taken near the baskets matched well with the actual measured mass losses, confirming that dissolution of calcite by the groundwater was the primary cause of the roadbed subsidence problem. Based on these findings, we suggested the limestone aggregate be replaced with noncarbonate (granite) aggregate to mitigate future road subsidence. The suggestion was adopted, and the repair was completed in early 2014.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is one of the limiting nutrients in coastal environments, especially in river- dominated deltaic regions with large amount of inorganic nitrogen inputs from the river. The principal source of P to coastal waters is suspended particulate matter from river discharge, a large portion of which is deposited on the continental shelves. The bottom sediments thus can be an important source of P to the overlying water column depending on the concentrations and chemical forms of P. This study provides a quantitative determination of the abundance and chemical speciation of P from the shelf, slope and deep sea sediments of coastal Louisiana. A sequential extraction method (SEDEX) was used to operationally separate the P pools into readily available P, Fe/Al-bound P, alkali extractable organic P, Ca/Mg-bound P, and residual/refractory P phases. Samples were analyzed for total metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) and total organic carbon to quantify their association with different forms of P. In general, TP was well correlated to the concentrations of Mg (p<0.05). The concentrations of available P, alkali extractable organic P, and refractory P higher in deep sea sediments, while the shelves sediments had higher concentrations of Fe/Al-bound P. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged between 425 to 1883 mg/kg. Available P was the smallest pool (<1% of TP), while Ca/Mg-bound P was the most abundant (~80% of TP) pool. Phosphorous sedimentary fractions can provide us with the insights into burial, digenesis and residence time of P in the coastal sediments in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The flux of P from bottom sediments provides an additional source of P to the nitrogen-rich water column that can stimulate algal growth, ultimately contributing to hypoxia in coastal Louisiana.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are the primary conduits for delivery of sediments and organic matter to the sea. This is visually evident when sediment-laden rivers enter coastal waters, producing sediment plumes. The sediment and organic material from such plumes may deposit and be preserved in estuarine and deltaic zones, or may be carried and mixed by ocean currents to deposit elsewhere on the shelf. Both of these outcomes are governed in large part by depositional mechanics that are dependent, at least in part, on the settling velocity of the sediment. This is especially true in modeling, where the settling velocity has been noted to be the primary controlling parameter for accurate prediction of depositional patters from river plumes. Settling velocity is largely controlled by grain size, shape, and density, which for mud can be quite dynamic due to the process of flocculation. Flocculation yields mud aggregates of variable size and density that may be dependent on the turbulent energy and salt levels under which they were formed. Since turbulent energy and salinity both change in river mouth jet/plumes, the dynamic flocculation process may exert significant control on the eventual distribution of sediment in these zones. In this study, two different approaches to floc modeling are integrated into a steady-state river mouth plume integral model. The two floc models are (1) a version of the Winterwerp (1998) model, and (2) a condition-dependent equilibrium floc size model similar to what is typically used in large-scale 2 and 3D hydraulic and sediment transport simulations. Inclusion of these two models into the buoyant river-mouth plume equations allows for the settling velocity of the mud to be functionally tied to the turbulent shear rate and suspended sediment concentration. The concentration and deposition rates are then compared through the plume both without and with the inclusion of the two different floc treatments. The role that entrainment of ambient fluid plays in the flocculation predictions is explored, and the broad change in deposit patters due to inclusion of flocs is also examined.",

Long tail scientific research tends to be conducted by small research teams with limited budgets, affecting the team’s ability to properly curate their data for reuse and preservation. The data set that was curated in this project is a small data set of global soil properties that was processed for use with the Community Land Model (CLM). The Data Curation Profile Toolkit was utilized to work with the scientist in order to determine his needs with respect to curation of the data set. Through a number of formal interviews, it was established that the scientist required assistance in documenting the data workflow, updating the metadata, and eventually archiving the data with an appropriate repository. The data curator worked with the scientist to document the data workflow both as a visual diagram and in a README file for the scientist’s future reference. The existing metadata content was verified for accuracy against original data set documentation and additional metadata was added to include provenance and detailed data descriptions. The authors determined that the most appropriate repository for the data was the Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). The authors appraised, selected, and submitted the data to the ORNL DAAC. The project’s final results and lessons learned will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Coal-tar-based (CT) sealcoat is used to protect and beautify the asphalt pavement of driveways and parking lots primarily in the central, southern, and northeastern U.S. and in Canada. CT sealcoat typically is 20 to 35 percent crude coal tar or coal-tar pitch and contains from 50,000 to 100,000 mg/kg PAHs, about 1,000 times more than asphalt-based (AS) sealcoat or asphalt itself. Tires and snowplows abrade the friable sealcoat surface into fine particles—PAH concentrations in fine particles (dust) from CT-sealcoated pavement are about 1,000 times higher than in dust from AS-sealcoated pavement (median total PAH concentrations 2,200 and 2.1 mg/kg, respectively). Use of CT sealcoat has several implications for urban streams and lakes. Source apportionment modeling has indicated that, in regions where CT sealcoat is prevalent, particles from sealcoated pavement are contributing the majority of the PAHs to recently deposited lake sediment, with implications for ecological health. Acute 2-d toxicity of runoff from CT-sealcoated pavement to stream biota, demonstrated for a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), continues for samples collected as long as weeks or months following sealcoat application. Using the fish-liver cell line RGL-W1, runoff collected as much as 36 days following CT-sealcoat application has been demonstrated to cause DNA damage and impair DNA repair capacity. These results demonstrate that CT runoff is a potential hazard to aquatic ecosystems for at least several weeks after sealant application, and that exposure to sunlight can enhance toxicity and genetic damage. Recent research has provided direct evidence that restricting use of CT sealcoat in a watershed can lead to a substantial reduction in PAH concentrations in receiving water bodies.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring wells installed near surface water commonly are used to provide hydraulic gradients and estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh) for simulating exchange between groundwater and surface water. Measurement scale depends on the distances that monitoring wells are situated from the surface-water bodies of interest, commonly ranging from several to hundreds of meters. Determining Kh with a single-well slug test implies that hydrogeologic properties at the well are representative of the porous media between the well and the surface-water body; usually a poor assumption. Measurements of hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction (Kv) also can be accomplished with shallow piezometers installed in the bed of a stream or lake or wetland. The scale of these measurements is generally on the order of centimeters to a meter or two. Estimates of anisotropy can be obtained when data from in-water piezometers are combined with data from near-shore monitoring wells although, once again, Kv determined at the screened interval of the piezometer may not adequately represent the interval between the screen and the sediment-water interface. However, combining measurements of flow across the sediment-water interface with hydraulic gradients determined from in-water piezometers and near-shore monitoring wells provides the ability to calculate spatially integrated values for both Kh and Kv. These values are scaled based on the locations of the wells and are usually more appropriate as calibration parameters for groundwater-flow models that simulate groundwater-surface-water exchange.",

            "abstract": "Some landslides move slowly or intermittently downslope, whereas others accelerate catastrophically and run out long distances across flat or gently sloping terrain. Seldom does landsliding of one type transition abruptly into the other, however, and seldom are the consequences more severe than at a site near Oso, Washington, where more than 40 fatalities resulted from a high-speed, long-runout landslide on 22 March 2014. Our interpretations of seismic data inversions and eyewitness accounts indicate that the Oso event began gradually, with remobilization of old landslide deposits that were unusually wet due to months of exceptional precipitation. For about 50 s, relatively slow downslope motion of these deposits withdrew support from a bluff above them, and then the bluff collapsed abruptly. This collapse radiated strong broadband seismic energy and rapidly loaded the old landslide material downslope. We infer that this rapid loading of previously dilated landslide debris caused contractive deformation, widespread liquefaction, and runaway acceleration. The resulting debris avalanche flow (DAF) had a volume of 8 ×106 m3and a fahrböschung (H/L ratio) of 0.106, making it exceptionally mobile for a landslide of its size. The leading edge of the Oso DAF may have gained mobility by entraining water as it displaced the adjacent Stillaguamish River and by liquefying wet floodplain sediments as it overran them, and it formed distal deposits that resembled those of many wood-freighted debris flows. The transition from relatively slow landslide motion (which had occurred intermittently for decades at the Oso site) to high-speed motion and long runout appears to have been very sensitive to contingencies. Our simulations of the Oso event using a new numerical model (D-Claw) show that small differences in water-saturated porosity (n) were sufficient to cause divergent landslide behaviors. In a case with n = 0.38, D-Claw predicts runaway liquefaction and high-speed runout much like that observed at Oso, and in a case with n = 0.36, it predicts much slower landsliding that ceases after only about 100 m of motion. This behavioral bifurcation has fundamental physical importance as well as large ramifications for assessment of landslide hazards.",

During this past decade, there have been a number of long-term simulations that used lower energy boundary condition observations around geosynchronous orbit. In this study, we set up observations at around 15 RE and study how the combined convective-diffusive transport can result in the acceleration of keV to relativistic and ultra-relativistic energies. We show that while lower energy radial transport is dominated by the convection, higher energy transport is dominated by the diffusive radial transport. MLT dependent diffusion confidents allow us to study how difference in wave properties at different MLT can influence the dynamics of the particles. Inclusion of adiabatic changes also allows us to study the radial transport that results from pitch-angle scattering and adiabatic changes. We also show that there exists an intermediate range of energies for electrons for which both processes work simultaneously. We show the comparison of the 4D VERB simulations with the Van Allen Probes measurements.",

            "abstract": "The US Geological Survey \"Did You Feel It?\" (DYFI) system is a highly successful example of citizen seismology. Users around the world now routinely report felt earthquakes via the Web; this information is used to determine Community Decimal Intensity values. These data can be enormously valuable for helping address a key issue that has arisen recently: quantifying the shaking/hazard associated with injection-induced earthquakes. I consider the shaking from 11 moderate (Mw3.9-5.7) earthquakes in the central and eastern United States that are believed to be induced by fluid injection. The distance decay of intensities for all events is consistent with that observed for regional tectonic earthquakes, but for all of the events intensities are lower than values predicted from an intensity prediction equation derived using data from tectonic events. I introduce an effective intensity magnitude, MIE, defined as the magnitude that on average would generate a given intensity distribution. For all 11 events, MIE is lower than the event magnitude by 0.4-1.3 units, with an average difference of 0.8 units. This suggests that stress drops of injection-induced earthquakes are lower than tectonic earthquakes by a factor of 2-10. However, relatively limited data suggest that intensities for epicentral distances less than 10 km are more commensurate with expectations for the event magnitude, which can be explained by the shallow focal depth of the events. The results suggest that damage from injection-induced earthquakes will be especially concentrated in the immediate epicentral region. These results further suggest a potential new discriminant for the identification of induced events. For ecample, while systematic analysis of California earthquakes remains to be done, DYFI data from the 2014 Mw5.1 La Habra, California, earthquake reveal no evidence for unusually low intensities, adding to a growing volume of evidence that this was a natural tectonic event.",

Point-interpolated depth surveys (2010/2012) by Thompson and others have revealed deepening hotspots in multiple locations within the lake. The current study reports University of Colorado surveys in 2013 and 2014 that quantify a) vertical water temperature variations in areas of deepening and shallowing; b) physical and chemical characteristics of dredged sediment samples from the lake floor; c) lake water chemistry; d) lake floor bathymetry imaged using high-resolution side-scan sonar and e) lake bottom hardness and roughness. These parameters are analyzed with a view to assessing their role in controlling lake floor deepening and growth.",

            "abstract": "Indiscriminate fisheries target multiple species with multiple gear types. In contrast to well-studied, industrialized single-species, single-gear fisheries, little theory and little but growing literature on practice exists for indiscriminate fisheries. Indiscriminate fisheries are disproportionately important in low-income countries, providing most of the animal protein intake in countries such as Cambodia and Bangladesh. Indiscriminate fisheries may be either freshwater or marine, but here we focus on what may be the largest freshwater indiscriminate fishery in the world.\nCambodia’s freshwater fishery stands out because it provides the majority of animal protein to over 3 million people living in poverty. The fishery of the Tonle Sap lake is one of the largest, if not the largest contributor to this freshwater fish take, and is perhaps the largest freshwater fishery in the world. In contrast to its importance, very little is known about the foodweb ecology of this system, or how community management which now governs the entire fishery, interacts with biological and physical factors such as climate change.\nThe foodweb of the Tonle Sap has changed dramatically due to high fishing pressure. A system that once harbored giant catfish, barbs and stingrays is now dominated by fish under 20cm in length. The simplification of the system may not have reduced its productivity. Theory of indiscriminate fisheries suggests that r-selected species may be favored and that biomass available for harvest may be maximized, while being more sensitive to environmental fluctuations such as climate change due to food web simplification. The r-selection and size predictions of theory have been confirmed by observations of the Tonle Sap. Early model results suggest sensitivity to environmental stochasticity.\nThe interaction of these ecological changes with social systems will be tested in the Tonle Sap. Fisheries management across the lake has been transferred to community management units. The capacity of the community management units to control illegal activities or set economically beneficial management objectives is unknown. Our social survey suggests that strengthening community management units could have strong benefits for incomes and biodiversity on the lake.",

Because of these large repercussions, it is of paramount importance to examine whether the magnitude and/or frequency of flood events have been changing over the most recent decades.\nHere we address this research question using annual and seasonal maximum daily streamflow records from 774 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stations over the central United States (the study area includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan). The focus is on “long” records (i.e., at least 50 years of data) ending no earlier than 2011. Analyses are performed using block-maximum and peak-over-threshold approaches.\nWe find limited evidence suggesting increasing or decreasing trends in the magnitude of flood peaks over this area. On the other hand, there is much stronger evidence of increasing frequency of flood events. Therefore, our results support the notion that it is not so much that the largest flood peaks are getting larger, but rather that we have been experiencing a larger number of flood events every year. By examining the rainfall records, we are able to link these increasing trends to similar patterns in heavy rainfall over the region.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 300 years, each of the three surge-type outlet glaciers of the Drangajökull ice cap in north-west Iceland has surged 2-4 times. There is valuable historical information available on the surge frequencies since the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum because of the proximity of the surging outlets, Reykjarfjarðarjökull, Leirufjarðarjökull and Kaldalónsjökull to farms and pastures. We have reconstructed the surge history of the Drangajökull ice cap, based on geomorphological mapping, sedimentary studies and review of historical records. Geomorphological mapping of the glacier forefields revealed twice as many end-moraines than previously recognized. This indicates a higher surge frequency than previously perceived. A clear relationship between the surge frequency and climate cannot be established, however, surges were more frequent during the 19th century and the earliest 20th century compared to the cool 18th century and the warmer late part of the 20th century.\nWe have estimated the magnitude of the LIA maximum surge events by reconstruction of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that can be compared with modern DEMs. As reference points for the digital elevation modelling we used the recently mapped lateral moraines and historical information on the exposure timing of nunataks. During the LIA maximum surge events the outlet glaciers extended 3-3.5 km further down-valley than at present. Their ice volumes were at least 2-2.5 km3 greater than after their most recent surges in the beginning of the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Chromium, a naturally occurring contaminant, poses a significant threat to California groundwater quality when ultramafic rocks weather leaving Cr-enriched serpentine soils. Benign and of limited solubility, Cr(III) can oxidize into soluble and carcinogenic Cr(VI). Under most environmental conditions, Mn-oxides are the principal oxidant of Cr(III). Here we investigate Cr(III) oxidation by both abiotically synthesized birnessite and biogenically produced Mn-oxides. Further, we explore chromium dynamics within artificial soil aggregates composed of Cr(OH)3- and Cr0.25Fe0.75(OH)3-coated quartz grains surrounded by aerated solute flow. Abiotic aggregates contained synthetic birnessite, while biotic aggregates were inoculated with Leptothrix cholodnii, a manganese-oxidizing bacterium, and Shewanella putrefaciens, an iron-reducing bacterium. Results show aqueous Cr(VI) concentrations scaling with Cr-mineral solubility. When Leptothrix sp.-inoculated Cr(III),Fe(III)-aggregates are supplied with aqueous Mn(II), Mn-oxides precipitate in the aerobic aggregate. Cr(VI) production occurs similar to that via synthetic birnessite. With the addition of Shewanella sp., coupled biotic and abiotic processes occur causing the reduction, and subsequent immobilization, of chromium by microbial metabolites (e.g., Fe(II)). This study shows the importance of microbial community composition on chromium dynamics within diffusion-limited zones, and suggests the potential for biological immobilization of Cr even in the presence of Mn-oxidizing bacteria.",

            "abstract": "Accurate magnetospheric wave models are key to understanding the dynamic variability of the radiation belts. Statistical wave models are commonly used in diffusion codes to evaluate the effects of the wave parameters on the radiation belt dynamics. Statistical wave models, however, may not accurately reproduce the real, instantaneous global wave distribution. The ability of the diffusion simulations to accurately reproduce the changes in the radiation environment ultimately depends on the accuracy of the available global wave models. The specification of a global model of plasmaspheric hiss waves is the purpose of this investigation. \nPlasmaspheric hiss is an incoherent emission in the whistler band confined within the dense plasmasphere and dayside plasmaspheric plumes. Hiss is responsible for the formation of the slot region, and can also contribute to the scattering of outer belt electrons particularly during active geomagnetic periods. Additionally, following storm time enhancements, the slow decay of the outer radiation belt is also attributed to pitch angle scattering by hiss waves.\nThe methodology used to build a global model of plasmaspheric hiss waves is not based on in-situ wave observations but on low-altitude electron measurements from the POES spacecraft. The advantage of inferring hiss wave amplitudes from POES electron measurements is that multiple POES satellites provide extensive coverage in the inner magnetosphere, while in-situ wave observations in a particular storm are limited to a certain range in L-shell and MLT. More specifically, we use the ratio between precipitating and trapped electrons provided by the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) instrument onboard the POES spacecraft to infer the global dynamic amplitude of plasmaspheric hiss waves. The performance of the technique is evaluated by comparing its results with EMFISIS observations during conjunction events with the Van Allen Probes, as well as with the predictions from the most recent statistical models of plasmaspheric hiss. The sensitivity of the methodology to the input parameters (hiss frequency spectrum, cold plasma density, and electron energy spectrum) is also analyzed in the present study.",

            "abstract": "Red maple (Acer rubrum L.) is becoming the most dominating tree in North American eastern deciduous forests. Concurrently, human activities have altered the chemical climate of terrestrial ecosystems via acidic deposition, which increases the available of nitrogen (N), while decreasing phosphorus (P) availability. Once a minor forest component prior to European settlement, the abundance of red maple may be a symptom of the modern age. The current paradigm explaining red maple’s rise to prominence concerns fire suppression that excludes competitors. However, this still does not explain why red maple is unique compared to other functionally similar trees. The objective of this study was to investigate the interactive influence of acid rain mitigation on the fecundity of red maple. Objectives were achieved by measuring flowering, seed production, germination, and growth from red maple on plots that have been experimentally manipulated to increase soil pH, P, or both in three unglaciated eastern deciduous hardwood forests.\nAt least 50% of the red maple population is seed bearing in our control soils, however the median percent of seed-bearing trees declined to zero when mitigating soils from acidic deposition. This can be explained by the curious fact that red maple is polygamodioecious, or has labile sex-expression, in which an individual tree can change its sex-expression in response to the environment. Furthermore, seed-bearing trees in the mitigated plots grew less, produced less seeds, and germinated at lower rates than their counterparts in control soils. Our results provide evidence that chemical climate change could be the primary contributing factor accelerating the dominance of red maple in eastern North American forests. Our observations can provide a boarder conceptual framework for understanding how nutrient limitations can be applied beyond plant productivity towards explaining distribution changes in vegetation.",

Given the rich information contained in the spectral radiances, such impressive instrument performances make AIRS radiances a valuable data set in the study of stratospheric climate. We compile 11 years (Sep 2002- Aug 2013) of AIRS radiances at channels in the CO2 v2 band with weighting functions peaked in the stratosphere. Using a state-of-the-art fast and accurate radiance simulator based on the PCRTM (Principle Component-based Radiative Transfer Model), we also simulate synthetic AIRS radiances at these channels based on two types of inputs: one is simulations by a free-running GFDL AM3 model and the other is ECMWF ERA-interim reanalysis. AIRS lower-stratospheric channels indicate a cooling trend of no more than 0.23 K/decade while its middle-stratospheric channels show a statistically significant cooling trend as large as 0.58 K/decade. Compared with AIRS observations, GFDL AM3 simulations underestimate the cooling trends in the middle-stratospheric channels while overestimate in the lower-stratospheric channels. Further simulations with separately varying CO2 and SST suggest that the change of CO2 alone is responsible for majority of the cooling trend in the middle-stratospheric channels, but the contributions of time-varying CO2 and SST are comparable in the lower-stratospheric channels. In contrast, the synthetic radiances based on ERA-interim reanalysis show statistically significant positive trends in virtually all stratospheric channels. We also compare the zonal-mean trends estimated from observed and synthetic AIRS spectral radiances and climate data records based on multi-decade SSU (Stratospheric Sounding Unit) measurements. Though discrepancies exist in terms of magnitude and seasonality of the cooling, they all show that most cooling occurs in the tropics instead of the extra-tropics. This work also highlights the challenges to GCM modeling, reanalysis community and satellite measurements for stratospheric trend detection and attribution.",

Model structural error is a key source of uncertainty in hydrologic predictions, but is not often taken into account during the model development process. We propose a sequential approach, whereby many plausible structural models are generated according to geophysical model uncertainty and available borehole data, and are subsequently calibrated to hydrologic observations. In the first step, geophysical model uncertainty is quantified using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis that estimates the posterior probability distribution of electrical resistivity at multiple depths for each of the thousands of densely spaced AEM sounding locations. Next, geophysical probabilities at each location are translated into probabilistic estimates of structure by calculating the area under each geophysical probability distribution associated with the resistivity distribution that is assumed or empirically estimated for different geological units (e.g. sand, silt, or clay). Many plausible structural models are then generated using a sequential indicator simulation algorithm, with sparse borehole data as hard constraints and the dense geophysically-derived structural probabilities as soft data. Finally, hydrologic observations are being used to calibrate each of the simulated structural models to determine the best-fitting hydraulic parameters. We will discuss the implementation of this sequential modeling approach, and also the ability to estimate uncertainty of both model parameters and hydrologic response.",

Large-scale perturbations over the pole may formally be represented only with zonal wavenumbers 0 or 1. Only the latter may support winds and the only migrating tide that can exist over the pole is the diurnal westward DW1. Other tidal periods projecting on the permitted wavenumbers inevitably correspond to nonmigrating waves such as the well documented semidiurnal westward SW1. Migrating tides make a noticeable contribution over the edges of the continent posing an identification problem for stations on the ground. Free-running WAM simulations show good agreement in amplitude, phase, seasonal and day-to-day variability of prominent tides with observations by some ground-based instruments but less so with others. Because the model dynamics is self-consistent, this implies that estimates of tidal variations of different parameters, e.g., temperature and winds, or from different instruments cannot be all correct. More cross-validation and detailed analyses of estimate errors and biases are needed.",

            "abstract": "The records for 18O in benthic foraminifera, 34S in marine barite, 13C in amber, 7Li in planktic foraminifera, and Mg to Ca in sea salt tell us that the collision of India with Asia 51 million years ago set the Earth’s environment on a new course. The relative quiescence of the previous 50 million years gave way to a drift in conditions which continues even now. The new regime is heralded by abrupt changes in the δ13C in amber and the δ34S in barite. I would like to think that the former is the result of a sharp drop in atmohpheric O2 and the latter as the result of an increase in sulfide deposition. These abrupt changes are followed by downward drifts in the δ13C of amber and in the Ca to Mg ratio in sea salt and upward drifts in the δ7Li in planktics and in the δ18O in benthics. As indicated by the δ13C in marine organic matter the CO2 content of the atmosphere decreased over this time interval. The likeliest cause for the changes are sea level lowering and mountain building.",

            "abstract": "The Land Product Evaluation and Algorithm Testing Element (PEATE) is an important element of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The primary goals of NASA’s Land PEATE are to assess the quality of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land operational products made by the Interface Data Processing System (IDPS), and to recommend improvements to the operational algorithms to meet NASA’s Land science needs. The Land PEATE uses a version of the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS), NPPDAPS, which has been modified to run the IDPS operational algorithms, as well as software provided by the NASA SNPP Land Science Team. Since the early pre-launch period (c. 2009) the Land PEATE has used the MODIS Land Data Operational Product Evaluation (LDOPE) team for evaluation of the data records generated by NPPDAPS.\nIn June 2014, Land PEATE completed Collection V1.1 reprocessing of the SNPP VIIRS Land products from the beginning (Jan 19, 2012) of the SNPP mission to current day using the best of the IDPS operational and NASA Land science team provided algorithms. The processing used the refined LUTs provided by the NASA VIIRS Calibration Support Team (VCST) for the L1B Sensor Data Records (SDR), including LUTs for calibration and stray light correction of the VIIRS Day/Night Band. In addition to generating the operational SDRs, Intermediate Products (IPs), and Environmental Data Records (EDRs) this reprocessing also produced Diagnostics Data Records, MODIS heritage L3 gridded products using the VIIRS observations. This paper describes approaches used to assess the quality of the products from operational processing and reprocessing of VIIRS records at Land PEATE. The paper also presents results from inter-comparison of records from this reprocessing with the MODIS heritage products. Our analysis verified that MODIS quality data records can be produced using the VIIRS observations, however with additional refinement to the quality flags.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) imposes changes to regional climates across the globe, with significant physical, biological, and socio-economic impacts. Previous evidence suggests that extratropical North Pacific sea-level pressure (SLP) variations--associated with the southern lobe of the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO)--and accompanying central Pacific trade wind changes can drive ENSO variability by inducing subsurface heat content changes across the equatorial Pacific. Here we present the first process-based confirmation of this \"trade wind charging\" (TWC) hypothesis for initiating changes in the state of the equatorial Pacific. Both observationally-constrained ocean data and high-resolution numerical model simulations corroborate that NPO-related trade wind variations modify the subsurface equatorial Pacific heat content in a manner that is consistent with wind-stress induced vertically-integrated, meridional mass transport into and out of the equatorial Pacific—i.e. a trade wind charging (and discharging) of the equatorial Pacific. Further, analysis of the numerical and observational results indicates that these NPO-induced trade wind variations and related heat content changes are not part of the ENSO cycle itself but instead represent a separate forcing mechanism of that cycle, initiating the onset of ENSO events which reach maturity approximately 12 months later.",

The effect is to make SST 0.1°C-0.2°C lower north of 30°S but 0.1°C-0.2°C higher south of 30°S in ERSST.v4 than in ERSST.v3b before 1940. In comparison with the UK Met Office SST product (HadSST3), the ship SST bias adjustment in ERSST.v4 is 0.1°C-0.2°C lower in the tropics but 0.1°C-0.2°C higher in the mid-latitude oceans both before 1940 and from 1945 to 1970. The 1901-2013 global SST trend changed from 0.71°C/century in v3b to 0.73°C/century in ERSST.v4. The tests also showed that, when compared with v3b, SSTAs in ERSST.v4 can substantially better represent the El Niño/La Niña behavior when observations are sparse before 1940.",

These network jets occur in both the quiet Sun and coronal holes. Their widths are often ~300 km or less. Many of these jets show up as elongated features with enhanced line width in maps obtained with transition region (TR) lines, suggesting that these jets reach at least TR temperatures and they constitute an important element of TR structures. The ubiquitous presence of these high-reaching (often >10 Mm) jets also suggests that they may play a crucial role in the mass and energy budgets of the corona and solar wind. The generation of these jets in the network and the accompanying Alfven waves is also consistent with the \"magnetic furnace model\" of solar wind proposed by Axford & McKenzie (1992). The large speeds (greater than sound speed) suggest that the Lorentz force (perhaps related to reconnection) must play an important role in the generation and propagation of the network jets. We believe that many network jets are the on-disk counterparts and TR manifestation of type-II spicules. ",

            "abstract": "Ice-surface temperature (IST) is used in many studies, for example for validation of model output and for detection of leads and thin ice in sea ice. The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites are useful for mapping IST of sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet (Hall et al., 2012), and validation of the ISTs derived from MODIS has been an ongoing effort (e.g., Koenig & Hall, 2010; Shuman et al., 2014). Recent results call into question the calibration of the MODIS-derived ISTs at very cold temperatures that are characteristic of the Greenland ice sheet high interior during winter (Shuman et al., 2014). In the present work, we investigate the calibration of MODIS IR bands 31 (10.780 – 11.280 µm) and 32 (11.770 – 12.270 µm) under very cold conditions.\nMODIS IR bands are calibrated using a quadratic algorithm. In Collection 6 (C6), the offset and nonlinear calibration coefficients are computed from data collected during the blackbody cool-down vs the warm-up data used in Collection 5 (C5). To improve the calibration accuracy for low-temperature scenes, the offset terms are set to 0. In general, Aqua MODIS bands 31 and 32 perform better than Terra MODIS bands 31 and 32. One of the reasons is that the Aqua bands have a lower saturation temperature (~340 K) than the Terra (~380 K) bands, and lower saturation or smaller dynamic range means better resolution.\nAs compared to ~2-m NOAA air temperatures (TA) at Summit, Greenland, Shuman et al. (2014) show a small (~0.5°C) offset in Terra MODIS-derived IST vs TA near 0°C, and an increasingly larger offset (up to ~5°C) as TA drops to -60°C. To investigate this further, we compare Terra and Aqua C5 and C6 ISTs with TA data from Summit. This work will document the calibration of bands 31 and 32 at very low temperatures in C5 and C6.\nHall, D.K., et al., 2012: Satellite-Derived Climate-Quality Data Record of the Clear-Sky Surface Temperature of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Jour.

            "abstract": "Apollo missions collected lunar data from orbit and the surface, including returns from long-lived Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) stations that operated autonomously until shut-down in September, 1977. All of the early data were analyzed and reported over the duration of the Apollo missions, and some were archived, but due to several factors much of the later data were never examined or archived. In some cases, we had to search additional information sources to obtain missing critical metadata needed to understand the structure and formats. The data typically were archived on media such as microfilm or microfiche, which are not easily readable or amenable to numerical analysis, or stored on 7-track (since moved to 9-track) magnetic tape in older formats that are now complicated to process. In some cases the data did not have the necessary information to translate their output into scientifically useful numbers. In many cases where this information was available it was still necessary to reformat the numbers and describe them in a more accessible form.\nThe Lunar Data Project was started at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) National Space Science Data Center (now the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive (NSSDCA)) in 2003 to restore the archived Apollo data and convert it to usable fully-described digital data sets suitable for archive with the Planetary Data System (PDS). A committee of lunar scientists at GSFC was convened to determine the highest priority data sets for restoration. In 2007 the Lunar Data Node was created at GSFC under the auspices of the PDS Geosciences Node in order to facilitate archive of data sets with PDS. This data restoration is not only time critical due to the loss of ability to read older media, it is also urgent because many of the people with the knowledge of these data have retired and are difficult to contact. We will report on the efforts being made by the Lunar Data Project / Lunar Data Node, the specific data sets being restored, and the status of the restorations.",

            "abstract": "Reed and South Reed Rock are two hydrovolcanic tuff ring deposits in the Fort Rock Volcanic Field (FRVF), Oregon, where microbial ichnofossils (endolithic microbores) exist within basaltic glass pyroclasts. Their presence indicates that continental volcanic settings can provide a habitable environment. The secondary phase assemblage of smectite clays (nontronite), zeolites (chabazite), calcite and palagonite point to a contemporaneous to post depositional hydrothermal alteration temperature range (~25-120°C), below which microbes introduced through groundwater were able to inhabit. Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy reveals geochemical differences between fresh glass and microbore interiors (eg., Fe, Mg depletion and K and Ca enrichment). These differences are interpreted to reflect acquisition by microbes of nutrients and energy by oxidizing and dissolving fresh basaltic glass. The Black Hills, a second study area located 20 km south the Reed Rocks, consists of a series of at least 6 hydrovolcanic vents. Petrographic observations from the Black Hills also reveal microbial ichnofossil features within basaltic glass pyroclasts. Conditions necessary for a habitable environment may therefore be common throughout the FRVF. In both locations, eruptive, depositional, and hydrothermal processes led to an environment conducive to microbial activity in which glass-rich deposits possess a source of biogenic elements, energy, and water. The histories of these deposits however, may be quite different in terms of peak hydrothermal temperatures, age relationships, water content and timing. Comparison of the textural, mineralogical and geochemical properties of the Reed Rocks and Black Hills deposits is ongoing in order to gain a better understanding of the conditions of habitability in these types of deposits. These results have important astrobiological implications for Mars where basaltic pyroclastic materials are widely distributed and may represent a habitable environment.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean (SO) region is one of the cloudiest on Earth, and as such clouds determine its albedo and play a major role in climate. Evidence shows Earth's climate sensitivity and the Intertropical Convergence Zone location depend upon SO clouds. But, climate models are challenged by uncertainties and biases in the simulation of clouds, aerosols, and air-sea exchanges in this region which trace back to a poor process-level understanding. Due to the SO’s remote location, there have been sparse observations of clouds, aerosols, precipitation, radiation and the air-sea interface apart from those from satellites.\nPlans for an upcoming observational program, SOCRATES, are outlined. Based on feedback on observational and modeling requirements from a 2014 workshop conducted at the University of Washington, a plan is described for obtaining a comprehensive dataset on the boundary-layer structure and associated vertical distributions of liquid and mixed-phase cloud and aerosol properties across a range of synoptic settings, especially in the cold sector of cyclonic storms. Four science themes are developed: improved climate model simulation of SO cloud and boundary layer structure in a rapidly varying synoptic setting; understanding seasonal and synoptic variability in SO cloud condensation and ice nucleus concentration and the role of local biogenic sources; understanding supercooled liquid and mixed-phase clouds and their impacts; and advancing retrievals of clouds, precipitation, aerosols, radiation and surface fluxes. Testable hypotheses for each theme are identified.\nThe observational strategy consists of long-term ground-based observations from Macquarie Island and Davis, continuous data collection onboard Antarctic supply ships, satellite retrievals, and a dedicated field campaign covering 2 distinct seasons using in-situ and remote sensors on low- and high-altitude aircraft, UAVs, and a ship-borne platform. A timeline for these activities is proposed.",

Here, I use an Earth system model to simulate terrestrial ecosystem emissions and atmospheric chemical composition in the mid-Pliocene (about 3 million years ago) and the preindustrial (~0k). Tropospheric ozone and aerosol precursors from vegetation and wildfire are ~50% and ~100% higher in the mid-Pliocene due to the spread of the tropical savanna and deciduous biomes. The chemistry-climate feedbacks contribute a net global warming that is 2-3 times larger than the carbon dioxide effect, and a net aerosol global cooling that masks 15-100% of the carbon dioxide effect. These large vegetation-mediated ozone and aerosol feedbacks operate on centennial to millennial time scales in the climate system and have not previously been included in paleoclimate sensitivity assessments.",

            "abstract": "Late Quaternary climate of western subtropical North America is related to the dynamics of summer as well as winter precipitation. During the last glacial maximum, it was hypothesized that the frequent winter storms provided more precipitation (COHMAP members, 1988) as the southern branch of the jet streams carried more moisture into the region (Kutzbach and Wright, 1985). However, the new global climate simulations do not provide indication of the jet stream split and some even suggest that the southern branch of the jet was weaker (Kim et al., 2008; Toracinta et al., 2004). In the last few years, the proxy records from the region have provided new information and suggested new hypothesis (Barron et al., 2012; Lyle et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2013). We present some new records of paleohydrological changes occurred over the late last glacial and deglaciation from the northwestern México. A compilation of all the important records from the region provides information about the geographic coverage of summer and winter precipitation. Minimal influence of summer as well as winter precipitation caused drier conditions over a large part of northern and northwestern Mexico (i.e. 29°-31°N) during the late last glacial (27-18 cal ka BP). Summer precipitation was restricted to the southern part of subtropical North America during >18 cal ka BP and it expanded to higher latitudes and covered different regions over the deglaciation (18-10 cal ka BP). We relate the different geographical coverage of summer precipitation to moisture flow sourced from the tropical and subtropical Pacific and Gulf of California during different intervals.",

            "abstract": "The traditional approach to measuring precipitation by placing a probe on the ground will likely never be adequate or affordable in most parts of the world. Fortunately, satellites today provide a continuous global bird's-eye view (above ground) at any given location. However, the usefulness of such precipitation products for hydrological applications depends on their error characteristics. Thus, providing error information associated with existing satellite precipitation estimates is crucial to advancing applications in hydrologic modeling. In this study, we present a method of estimating satellite precipitation error variance using regression model for three satellite precipitation products (3B42RT, CMORPH, and PERSIANN-CCS) using easily available geophysical features and satellite precipitation rate. The goal of this work is to explore how well the method works around the world in diverse geophysical settings. Topography, climate, and seasons are considered as the governing factors to segregate the satellite precipitation uncertainty and fit a nonlinear regression equation as function of satellite precipitation rate. The error variance models were tested on USA, Asia, Middle East, and Mediterranean region. Rain-gauge based precipitation product was used to validate the errors variance of satellite precipitation products. Our study attests that transferability of model estimators (which help to estimate the error variance) from one region to another is practically possible by leveraging the similarity in geophysical features. Therefore, the quantitative picture of satellite precipitation error over ungauged regions can be discerned even in the absence of ground truth data. ",

            "abstract": "Oceanic crust formed along spreading centers in the Lau back-arc basin exhibits a dramatic change in crustal structure and composition with proximity to the nearby Tofua Arc. Results from seismic studies indicate that crust formed near the arc is abnormally thick (~8-9 km) and compositionally stratified, with a thick low-velocity upper crust and an abnormally high-velocity (7.2-7.4+ km/s) lower crust. Lava samples from this area show arc-like compositional enrichments and tend to be more evolved than typical mid-ocean ridge basalts (MgO contents as low as ~1 wt%). We propose that slab-derived water entrained in the near-arc ridge system not only enhances mantle melting, as commonly proposed to explain high crustal production in back-arc environments, but also affects magmatic differentiation and crustal accretion processes. Phase equilibria modeling of the observed compositional trends suggests that the high water contents found in near-arc parental melts can lead to crystallization of an unusually mafic cumulate layer by suppressing plagioclase crystallization relative to olivine and clinopyroxene. Model runs with ~1-2 wt% H2O in the parental melts successfully reproduce the geochemical trends of the erupted lavas while crystallizing a cumulate assemblage with calculated seismic velocities consistent with those observed in the near-arc lower crust. The resulting residual melts are also water-rich, which lowers their density and aids in the extraction and eventual eruption of unusually evolved magmas. We present preliminary results of this petrological model for the formation of back-arc oceanic crust, which successfully predicts the unusual crustal stratification observed in the near-arc regions of the Lau basin, and helps explain the highly fractionated andesites and dacites that erupt there. We also comment on alternative proposed hypotheses for back-arc crustal accretion and discuss some of the challenges facing them in this particular region.",

            "abstract": "The Canterbury earthquake sequence began with the M7.1 Darfield earthquake in 2010, and includes the devastating M6.2 Christchurch earthquake in 2011. The high ground accelerations and damage in Christchurch suggested that the larger eartthquakes may be high stress drop events. This is consistent with the hypothesis that faults in low-strain rate regions with long inter-event times rupture in higher stress drop earthquakes. The wide magnitude range of this prolific sequence, and the high-quality recording enable us to test this. The spatial migration of the sequence, from Darfield through Christchurch and then offshore, enables us to investigate whether we can resolve any spatial or temporal variation in earthquake stress drop. An independent study of 500 aftershocks (Oth & Kaiser, 2014) found no magnitude dependence, and identified spatially varying stress drop. Such patterns can be more confidently interpreted if observed by independent studies using different approaches.\nWe use a direct wave, empirical Green’s function (EGF) approach that includes measurement uncertainties, and objective criteria for assessing the quality of each spectral ratio (Abercrombie, 2013). The large number of earthquakes in the sequence enables us to apply the same approach to a wide range of magnitudes (M~2-6) recorded at the same stations, and so minimize the effects of any systematic biases in results. In our preliminary study, we include 2500 earthquakes recorded at a number of strong motion and broadband stations. We use multiple EGFs for each event, and find 300 earthquakes with well-resolved ratios at 5 or more stations. The stress drops are magnitude independent and there is broad correlation with the results of Oth & Kaiser. We apply the same approach to a much larger data set and compare our results to those of Oth & Kaiser, and also to other regions studied using our EGF method.",

Overlapping 37 GHz, vertically polarized brightness temperature (Tb) measurements from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) were integrated to produce a temporally consistent and continuous global daily FT data record from 1979 to 2012 and derived at 25-km pixel resolution. In this study, we develop and evaluate FT-ESDR enhancements, including expanded record length and spatial coverage, alternate algorithm calibrations, and a finer scale FT classification. A larger global domain is evaluated that encompasses all land areas affected by seasonally frozen temperatures, including urban, snow-ice dominant, barren, and permafrost landscapes. The FT retrieval is obtained using a seasonal threshold algorithm (STA) that classifies daily Tb changes in relation to frozen and non-frozen Tb reference states on a per-pixel basis. STA sensitivity to FT reference states is evaluated and alternative ancillary data are applied for defining Tb reference conditions, including surface temperatures from global reanalysis and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) seasonal climatology. The resulting FT record shows mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 92 and 86 percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in-situ temperature measurements. Despite the larger domain and longer record, the new FT-ESDR showed a 1-3 percent spatial classification accuracy improvement over previous FT-ESDR versions. Areas with enhanced accuracy include the Central USA, Central Asia, and North and Central Europe. Sub-grid land surface spatial heterogeneity effects on the aggregate FT retrievals are also assessed to refine FT-ESDR data quality metrics. The results of this study are being applied for continuing FT-ESDR production and utility enhancements, and to inform development of similar FT algorithms and products from the NASA SMAP mission.

In particular, record lows in September sea ice extent from 2007-2013 have recast Arctic shipping routes as emerging international seaways for export of resources and as potential alternative pathways for global trade. While ensemble-averaged output from sea ice models suggest significant increases in vessel accessibility in September by midcentury (Smith & Stephenson, 2013), the seasonal length and variability of trans-Arctic shipping is not well understood. In addition, differences in ice extent due to inter-model variability reveal significant uncertainties in the magnitude and location of future vessel access. Here we present several scenarios of 21st-century trans-Arctic shipping as driven by sea ice output from CMIP5 models. Optimal vessel transits from North America and Europe to the Bering Strait are estimated for two periods representing present-day (2006-2015) and midcentury (2040-2059) conditions under two forcing scenarios (RCP 4.5/8.5), assuming Polar Class 6 (PC6) and open-water vessels (OW) with medium and no ice-breaking capability, respectively. Results illustrate a range of potential futures for shipping in the Arctic owing to differences in model choice, vessel capability, and climate forcing. Inter-model differences reveal the importance of model choice in devising projections for strategic planning by governments, environmental agencies, and the global maritime industry.",

            "abstract": "Discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in Mars surface materials has important implications for habitability and the potential development of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian history. The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover detected evolved nitric oxide (NO) gas during pyrolysis of scooped aeolian sediments and drilled mudstone acquired in Gale Crater. The detection of NO suggests an indigenous source of fixed nitrogen, and may indicate a mineralogical sink for atmospheric N2 in the form of nitrate. The ratio of nitrate to oxychlorine species (e.g. perchlorate) may provide insight into the extent of development of a nitrogen cycle on Mars. Nitrate and perchlorate on Earth are geochemically related in arid environments such as the Atacama Desert and the Dry Valleys of Antarctica due to their similar mobilities and deposition mechanisms [1,2]. Here, low NO3-/ClO4- molar ratios (~1000) dominate, in comparison to other places on Earth, where the main nitrate source is biological fixation of N2 to NO3-, and there is no corresponding biological source of perchlorate, resulting in much higher NO3-/ClO4- molar ratios (~10,000). The NO3-/ClO4- molar ratio is estimated to be ~ 0.05 on Mars based on SAM measurements at Gale Crater [3]. The possibility exists that perchlorate brines could leach and increase nitrate concentrations at depth, increasing the martian NO3-/ClO4- ratio in the subsurface. However, it is unknown whether terrestrial NO3-/ClO4- molar ratios could be achieved by this mechanism. Nevertheless, the low NO3-/ClO4- the ratio detected by SAM suggests that N fixation to nitrate on Mars, whether biologically mediated or abiotic, was extremely limited compared to the potentially ongoing abiotic formation and deposition of oxychlorine species on the martian surface.\n[1] Kounaves, S.P. et al. \"Discovery of natural perchlorate in the Antarctic dry valleys and its global implications.\" ES&T44, no. 7 (2010): 2360-2364.\n[2] Lybrand, R.A., et al. \"The geochemical associations of nitrate and naturally formed perchlorate in the Mojave Desert, California, USA.\" GCA104 (2013): 136-147.\n[3] Ming, D.

            "abstract": "Modern geological sciences depend heavily on investigating the natural world in situ, i.e., within “the field,” as well as managing data collections in the light of evolving advances in technology and cyberinfrastructure. To accelerate the rate of scientific discovery, we need to expedite data collection and management in such a way so as to not interfere with the typical geoscience, field workflow. To this end, we suggest replacing traditional analog methods of data collection, such as the standard field notebook and compass, with primary digital data collection applications. While some field data collecting apps exist for both the iOS and android operating systems, they do not communicate with each other in an organized data collection effort. We propose the development of a mobile app that coordinates the collection of GPS, photographic, and orientation data, along with field observations. Additionally, this application should be able to pair with other devices in order to incorporate other sensor data. In this way, the app can generate a single file that includes all field data elements and can be synced to the appropriate database with ease and efficiency.\nWe present here a prototype application that attempts to illustrate how digital collection can be integrated into a “typical” geoscience, field workflow. The purpose of our app is to get field scientists to think about specific requirements for the development of a unified field data collection application. One fundamental step in the development of such an app is the community-based, decision-making process of adopting certain data/metadata standards and conventions. In August of 2014, on a four-day field trip to Yosemite National Park and Owens Valley, we engaged a group of field-based geologists and computer/cognitive scientists to start building a community consensus on these cyberinfrastructure-related issues. Discussing the unique problems of field data recording, conventions, storage, representation, standardization, documentation, and management, while in the field, creates a unique opportunity to address critical issues with regards to advancing the development of cyberinfrastructure for the field-based geosciences while facilitating the combining of our datasets with those of other geoscience subdisciplines.",

            "abstract": "Thermospheric neutral wind circulation is set up as a result of a number of competing forcing processes. These include the pressure gradient, ion drag, Coriolis, momentum advection and viscosity forces. All of these forces change with varying solar radiation and geomagnetic activity. In this study we employ the thermosphere ionosphere electrodynamics global circulation model (TIEGCM) to elucidate the changes of thermospheric neutral winds with geomagnetic storms when a large amount of energy and momentum is deposited into the thermosphere at high latitudes. We will focus on the low and middle latitudes, where enhanced equatorward and westward winds are seen during the storms. The storm-time westward winds occur at all local times and are sustained well into the storm recovery phase. Diagnostic analysis on TIEGCM simulations suggests that momentum advection, ion drag and pressure gradient are the main drivers of these storm-time wind changes. The TIEGCM has also been run for different solar cycle conditions. Wind changes are smaller during solar maximum at low and middle latitudes. This is the result of higher neutral temperature and pressure gradient at low and middle latitudes in solar maximum, which limits the penetration of wind changes at high latitudes into low and middle latitudes.",

The ISOs are extracted by applying a data-adaptive method on the high-resolution gridded daily rainfall. Two leading ISOs emerge as nonlinear oscillations with broad-band spectra centered at 45 and 30 days. Both the ISOs propagate northward. The first ISO also propagates eastward while the second ISO shows some westward propagation. The amplitude of the first ISO is usually higher than that of the second ISO. This study examines whether there are modulations of the ISOs on interannual and decadal time scales and whether there are secular trends.

            "abstract": "The night side of magnetosphere is a very dynamic region, where substorms can release substantial amounts of energy in an explosive fashion. Even though many physical models explaining the substorm process have been proposed, the onset mechanism (initiation) of substorms is still an unsolved problem in Space Physics. It is presently not resolved whether the onset mechanism is triggered by current disruption (CD) process, by some other ideal MHD instability such as the ballooning mode, or by magnetic reconnection process (Rx). The former two processes would initiate a substorm close to Earth somewhere between 6 and 8 RE downtail, whereas a reconnection trigger is thought to occur around 20 RE. Recent observations by the THEMIS mission suggests that substorms are triggered by magnetic reconnection mechanism in mid-tail region (Angelopoulos et al., 2009 ), but those results are disputed (Lui et al., 2009). Distinguishing these processes depends critically on the correct timing of different signals in the plasma sheet and the ionosphere in order to establish a time sequence of events. This has been difficult to accomplish with data alone, since signals are sometimes ambiguous, or they have not been observed in the right locations. To investigate signal propagation paths and signal travel times, we use OpenGGCM global simulation. By launching wave pulses from various locations in the magnetosphere, we investigate the path taken by the waves and time it takes for different wave to reach the ionosphere. We find that the Tamao path is not generally preferred path for waves originating in the plasma sheet. We also find that a point source in the tail can lead to spread out signal in the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Traditional approaches to sediment transport are typically based on assumptions of fully developed, equilibrium conditions. Many flows, however, are dominated by the presence of intermittent, coherent large-scale structures, which may not satisfy such assumptions. The current study examines the erosion rates and suspended load produced by a strongly forced air jet impinging on a mobile bed of fine glass beads. A parametric study is conducted using a range of mean flow and forcing conditions (forcing amplitude and frequency) to elucidate the role of the dominant structure on the transport process. Single-phase PIV measurements were used obtain the initial characteristics of the flow (prior to significant erosion). The results show that the use of the time-averaged turbulent stress on the bed cannot be used to effectively predict the location or magnitude of erosion. Instead, it is shown that the erosion rate can be related to the location and magnitude of the periodic stress produced by the vortex interacting with the bed. After an initial transient, the erosion for all cases was observed to proceed at a relatively constant rate. The net removal rate was found to correlate closely to the unsteady stress produced by the periodic structures, and predicted the erosion rate for all of the conditions studied when scaled by the integral of the excess wall stress raised to the power 1.2. The turbulent suspended load and two-way coupling was measured by performing two-phase PIV measurements over a mobile bed. Conditions were studied during the early transients with nominally “flat” conditions, and at a later stage with significant bed forms present. The suspended load for the “flat” conditions was nearly an order of magnitude less than was observed for the “eroded” case, and also showed significant increase in flux along the radial direction.\n*This work is supported by the AFSOR under grant FA95500810406",

To advance system-level predictive understanding of the feedbacks of belowground microbial communities to multiple climate change factors and their impacts on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes, we have used integrated metagenomic technologies (e.g., target gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing, GeoChip, and isotope) to analyze soil microbial communities from experimental warming sites in Alaska (AK) and Oklahoma (OK), and long-term laboratory incubation. Rapid feedbacks of microbial communities to warming were observed in the AK site. Consistent with the changes in soil temperature, moisture and ecosystem respiration, microbial functional community structure was shifted after only 1.5-year warming, indicating rapid responses and high sensitivity of this permafrost ecosystem to climate warming. Also, warming stimulated not only functional genes involved in aerobic respiration of both labile and recalcitrant C, contributing to an observed 24% increase in 2010 growing season and 56% increase of decomposition of a standard substrate, but also functional genes for anaerobic processes (e.g., denitrification, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis). Further comparisons by shotgun sequencing showed significant differences of microbial community structure between AK and OK sites. The OK site was enriched in genes annotated for cellulose degradation, CO2 production, denitrification, sporulation, heat shock response, and cellular surface structures (e.g., trans-membrane transporters for glucosides), while the AK warmed plots were enriched in metabolic pathways related to labile C decomposition. Together, our results demonstrate the vulnerability of permafrost ecosystem C to climate warming and the importance of microbial feedbacks in mediating such vulnerability.",

In general terms, Metadata represents the who, what, when, where, why and how of the dataset. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is the preferred output format for metadata, as it makes it portable and, more importantly, suitable for system discoverability. The newly developed ORNL Metadata Editor (OME) is a Web-based tool that allows users to create and maintain XML files containing key information, or metadata, about the research. Metadata include information about the specific projects, parameters, time periods, and locations associated with the data. Such information helps put the research findings in context. In addition, the metadata produced using OME will allow other researchers to find these data via Metadata clearinghouses like Mercury [1] [2]. Researchers simply use the ORNL Metadata Editor to enter relevant metadata into a Web-based form.\nHow is OME helping Big Data Centers like ORNL DAAC? The ORNL DAAC is one of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) data centers managed by the ESDIS Project. The ORNL DAAC archives data produced by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program. The DAAC provides data and information relevant to biogeochemical dynamics, ecological data, and environmental processes, critical for understanding the dynamics relating to the biological components of the Earth's environment. Typically data produced, archived and analyzed is at a scale of multiple petabytes, which makes the discoverability of the data very challenging. Without proper metadata associated with the data, it is difficult to find the data you are looking for and equally difficult to use and understand the data. OME will allow data centers like the ORNL DAAC to produce meaningful, high quality, standards-based, descriptive information about their data products in-turn helping with the data discoverability and interoperability.\n",

The seismically-monitored Newberry Volcano is considered by the USGS to be a very high threat volcano, with the potential to impact adjacent populations in Bend, Sunriver, and LaPine and damage infrastructure including highways, railroads, and power lines. Unspectacular from a distance, the broad shield shape of Newberry Volcano hides the abundance and youthfulness of volcanic activity. Included in NNVM are 7-ka basalt to andesite lavas of the Northwest Rift Zone (NWRZ) that erupted from spatter and cinder cones over a N-S distance of 20 miles and temporarily blocked the flow of the adjacent Deschutes River. These well-exposed lavas are post-Mazama in age, having erupted after a blanket of ash and pumice was deposited on the volcano when Mt. Mazama erupted at 7.7 ka to form Crater Lake. Images from lidar data obtained in 2011 clearly display the post-Mazama lavas, which not only are unmantled by the tephra, but also lack the thick forest that has grown in the tephra further obscuring many of the youthful volcanic features across this massive rear-arc Cascades volcano. NNVM features interpretive trails at the Big Obsidian Flow in the caldera and at Lava Cast Forest and Lava Butte flow along the NWRZ. Also within the monument are two of the premier drivable viewpoints in Oregon, on Lava Butte and at the 7984-ft top of Paulina Peak on the rim of the caldera. On a clear day, views from Paulina Peak encompass much of the High Cascades, extending from Mt. Shasta in California to Mt. Adams in Washington.",

            "abstract": "Heat-flow mapping of the western USA has identified an apparent low-heat-flow anomaly coincident with the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, a thick sequence of basalt aquifers within the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). A heat and mass transport model (SUTRA) was used to evaluate the potential impact of groundwater flow on heat flow along two different regional groundwater flow paths. Limited in situ permeability (k) data from the CRBG are compatible with a steep permeability decrease (~3.5 orders of magnitude) at 600-900 m depth and ~40oC. Numerical simulations incorporating this permeability decrease demonstrate that regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in these highly anisotropic (kx/kz ~104) continental flood basalts. Simulation results indicate that the abrupt reduction in permeability at ~600 m depth results in an equivalently abrupt transition from a shallow region where heat flow is affected by groundwater flow to a deeper region of conduction-dominated heat flow. Abrupt k decreases at similar temperatures have also been observed in the volcanic rocks of the adjacent Cascade Range volcanic arc and at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, where they result from low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Because pore filling hydrothermal minerals are largely controlled by the major mineral assemblages of the volcanic rocks, other continental flood basalt provinces may also have large permeability changes at depths corresponding to ~40oC.",

            "abstract": "Salt contaminated stones or masonry materials are often observed to deteriorate under environmental conditions due to crystallization of salts, the importance of which is expected to increase in the future due to global climate change. When environmental conditions such as humidity or exposure to rain or rising damp vary, salts in contact with water (liquid or vapor) can dissolve and cause damage to the material by re-crystallization upon drying. The detailed mechanisms of the damaging processes have been investigated for several decades now. However there are still open questions such as why a given salt can lead to damage in some environmental conditions and not in others.\nWe present both macroscopic and microscopic experiments assessing the importance of the kinetics of salt crystallization for NaCl on damage in sandstone with environmental fluctuations, i.e. wetting/drying and humidity cycling. NaCl contaminated sandstones are put in contact with liquid water and water vapor until complete saturation, followed by drying at different relative humidities. Advanced techniques such as high resolution X-ray computed tomography and Scanning Electron Microscopy are used to study the kinetics of salt growth in the porous network.\nOur results show that the kinetics of recrystallization after deliquescence (contact with water vapor) and rewetting of salt contaminated sandstones leads to very different crystallization patterns. With humidity cycling, recrystallization promotes the formation of localised bigger cubic crystals at the subsurface of the stone whereas rewetting leads to efflorescence in the form of large localised cauliflowers at the surface. The different growth dynamics also affects the drying behaviour of the sandstones. These results reveal for the first time the major role of the crystallization dynamics in the way a given salt causes damage in some environmental conditions and not in other.",

            "abstract": "The ergodic hypothesis, implicitly used in virtually all atmospheric boundary layer studies, assumes that the time/space average of a measured flow variable converges to an ensemble of independent realizations from similar initial states and boundary conditions and for sufficiently long sampling times. Turbulent flows within roughness elements such as canopies differ from their classical boundary layer counterparts due to the short-circuiting of the energy cascade and the prevalence of von Karman vortex streets in the deeper layers of the canopy (see Figure). Despite recent experimental support for the validity of the ergodic hypothesis on turbulence statistics in the atmospheric surface layer, the impact of the aforementioned phenomena on the ergodicity of passive scalars within dense canopies remains unexplored. Using Laser Induced Florescence (LIF) measurements and flow visualization of scalar concentration within a rod canopy situated in a flume (see Figure), the necessary conditions for ergodicity of passive scalar turbulence statistics at two different depths were considered. The integral time and length scales were first analyzed and their corresponding maximum values were used to construct an ensemble of (weak) independent realizations. To within experimental limitation, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the distributions of temporal and spatial concentration series against the ensembles revealed that the ergodic hypothesis was reasonable, except close to the rods where wake-induced inhomogeneity and damped turbulence prevail. The spatial concentration statistics within a repeated rod-cell configuration appeared less ergodic than their temporal counterpart given the periodicity and persistence of von Karman vortices on the flow field. Using lagged cross-correlations of scalar concentration time series at different spatial locations, the local advection velocity of dominant eddies was inferred. The computed probability density function of the longitudinal advection velocity agreed with those measured using laser Doppler anemometry velocity time series collected in separate experiments (see Figure).",

            "abstract": "The warming rates projected by an ensemble of the Coupled Model Intercomparion Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) over southern Africa (south of 10 degrees latitude) are investigated. In all RCPs, CMIP5 models project a higher warming rate over the southwestern parts centred around the arid Kalahari and Namib deserts. The higher warming rates over these areas outpace global warming by up to a factor 2 in some GCMs. The projected warming is associated with an increase in heat waves. There is notable consensus across the models with little intermodel spread, suggesting a strong robustness of the projections. Mechanisms underlying the enhanced warming are investigated. A positive soil moisture-temperature feedback is suggested to contribute to the accelerated temperature increase. A decrease in soil moisture is projected by the GCMs over the area of highest warming. The reduction in soil wetness reduces evapotranspiration rates over the area where evaporation is dependent on available soil moisture. The reduction is evapotranspiration affects the partitioning of turbulent energy fluxes from the soil surface into the atmosphere and translates into an increase of the Bowen ratio featuring an increase in sensible relative to latent heat flux. An increase in sensible heat flux leads to an increase in near-surface temperature. The increase in temperature leads to a higher vapour pressure deficit and evaporative demand and evapotranspiration from the dry soils, possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture. A precipitation-soil moisture feedback is also suggested. A decrease in mean precipitation and an increase in drought conditions are projected over the area of enhanced warming. The reduced precipitation results in drier soils. The drier soil translates to reduced evapotranspiration for cloud and rainfall formation. However, the role played by the soil moisture-precipitation feedback loop is still inconclusive and characterized by some degree of uncertainty given that the strength of the local moisture recycling has not been explicitly quantified. An alternative mechanism involving the impact of soil moisture anomalies on boundary-layer stability and precipitation formation will be investigated.",

We have analyzed the ion temperatures detected on DMSP F15, 16, 17 and 18 during these storms and find that the largest change in ion temperature also occurs at high latitudes, typically in the region of antisunward convection. Further, we find that ions in the polar cap are typically hotter than at auroral latitudes during quiet periods preceding storm activity.

            "abstract": "We identfied a series of abrupt changes in GPS site motions observed in Lower Cook Inlet of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone in late 2004, early 2010 and late 2011. The site motions from 1995-2004, 2004-2010 and post-2011, however, appear to be steady. To first order, the deformation rates for 1995-2004 and 2010-2011 are similar to each other, as are 2004-2010 and post-2011. This pattrn of toggling between two deformation patterns is due to the time-dependent slip variations on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction plate interface. It is possible that a deeper part of the subduction interface had been suddenly locked between 2004 and 2010, causing additional interseismic strain accumulation, and we test this hypothesis.\nWe model time-dependent variatins in this seismogenic zone using the software TDEFNODE to estimate the slip rate deficit distribution on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction plate interface along with block rotation of upper plate blocks. To do so, we first divided the GPS time series into four time periods: before 2004, 2004 to 2010, 2010-2011, and post-2011. We removed the ongoing postseismic deformation due to the 1964 earthquake fom these GPS velocity fields. We constructed an upper plate block model including three main blocks, Southern Alaska (SOAK), the Peninsula block and the Bering Plate to model the contributions from the secular tectonic motions of the upper plate. We modeled the subduction fault surface based on the Slab1.0 model for the subduction zone, with the slab extended to the east as Slab1.0 terminates the slab under Prince William Sound. We found 50~60 mm/yr slip rate deficit in the shallow part of the seismogenic zone, to depths of ~30km which we identify as the main asperity that ruptured in 1964 earthquake. The shape of the locked region under Lower Cook Inlet differs for each time period, with the locked region being wider in 2004-2010 and post-2011. In the near future we will use TDEFNODE to model the GPS time series directly to estimate the time-dependent slilp deficit, and identify the likely range of temporal variations in the width of the seismogenic zone.",

            "abstract": "Katama Inlet, connecting Katama Bay to the Atlantic Ocean on the southern shoreline of Martha's Vineyard, MA, has migrated eastward more than 2.5 km since it was breached during the Patriot’s Day storm in 2007. This morphological evolution, typical of the inlet’s decadal cycle of breach-migration-closure, is owing to sediment transport driven by wave-orbital velocities, breaking-wave-generated mean currents, and tidal flows. Here, the rapidly evolving shoreline near Katama Inlet and on the southern edge of Martha’s Vineyard is investigated using field observations and numerical model simulations. The bathymetry was surveyed in summer 2013 and 2014, and tides, waves, and currents were measured for a month in August 2013 and 2014 in the surf zone (~2 m water depth), on the outer edge of the ebb shoal offshore of the inlet mouth (~6 m depth), and on the inner continental shelf (~7 m depth). The model [Delft3D with coupled waves (SWAN) and currents] skillfully simulates observed wave heights, wave directions, and tidal currents, and is used here to estimate sediment transport rates. Model results suggest that during the relatively calm August conditions there is little transport on the inner shelf, but there is significant transport that changes directions with the tide on the outer ebb shoal. Transport rates in the surf zone decrease and become more unidirectional (wave-driven) with distance away (west) from the mouth of the inlet. In August, transport of suspended sediments is relatively more important on the outer ebb shoal than near the surf zone, where bedload transport dominates. The relative impact of these types of simulated transport on the migration of Katama Inlet will be discussed.\nFunded by ONR, ASD(R&E), NSF, and NDSEG.",

            "abstract": "After the devastating 2005 hurricane season, Louisiana embarked on an ambitious and daunting effort to develop and implement a comprehensive Coastal Master Plan. The Master Plan sought to achieve two key goals simultaneously: reduce hurricane flood risk and halt the net conversion of its coastal landscape to open ocean. Numerous prior efforts to achieve these goals had been tried without significant success. In 2012, however, the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) produced a 50-year, $50 billion Master Plan. It had broad support from a diverse and often adversarial set of stakeholders, and it was unanimously passed by the Louisiana legislature.\nIn contrast to other efforts, CPRA took an approach to planning called by the U.S. National Research Council as “deliberation with analysis”. Specifically, CPRA used data, models, and decision support tools not to define an optimal or best strategy, but instead to support stakeholder dialogue and deliberations over alterative coastal management strategies. RAND researchers, with the support of CPRA and other collaborators, developed the planning tool at the center of this process. The CPRA planning tool synthesized large amounts of information about how the coast might evolve over time with and without different combinations of hundreds of different projects and programs. The tool helped CPRA propose alternative strategies that could achieve the State’s goals while also highlighting to stakeholders the key tradeoffs among them. Importantly, this process helped bring diverse communities together to support a single vision and specific set of projects and programs to meet many of Louisiana’s coastal water resources challenges.\nThis presentation will describe the planning approach and decision support tools developed to support the Master Plan’s participatory stakeholder process. The presentation will also highlight several important key takeaway messages that have broad applicability to other water resources planning efforts. Lastly, it will describe several on-going efforts in other parts of the U.S. that are employing this same approach.",

Recent work has indicated that the probability of a solar eruptive event in an active region (AR) is enhanced when a large flare has occurred in that AR during the previous day. In addition, peak intensities Sp of SEP events associated with fast CMEs are larger for CMEs with prior CMEs from the same associated ARs in the previous day. This suggests that the associated SEP event probability and/or Sp may be higher for a given solar X-ray flare with a recent prior major flare in the same AR. We use data sets of NOAA flares and SEP events from cycles 23 and 24 to test this idea statistically for periods of prior flares ranging from 12 to 48 hours. The occurrence probabilities of large SEP events are not higher for flares with prior same-AR major flares, hence prior flare occurrence is not a useful SEP event forecasting tool. We show an example of a flare-prolific AR for which the SEP-associated flares are spatially distinct from the numerous non-SEP associated flares, indicating how prior flares may be unrelated to SEP-associated flares.",

            "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variation in forest structure is a central aspect of tropical forest carbon dynamics. A major determinant of forest structure is the size and frequency of natural forest disturbance events. The resulting forest gaps are direct expressions of tree mortality, damage, and regrowth, and play integral roles in community structure and forest carbon storage. Static forest gaps, or those found at a single timeframe, express the time-integrated pattern of both past disturbance and forest regrowth. Dynamic gaps, or those appearing between two measurement periods, reflect committed carbon losses to the atmosphere. Studies of tropical forest disturbance often examine only static gaps to make inferences about annual carbon dynamics. Our goal was to determine whether the use of static gaps rather than dynamic gaps is appropriate for quantifying annual carbon flux. Using airborne LiDAR data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory at two time periods (2011 and 2012) and a new gap detection technique, we compared static and dynamic gaps over a 9000 ha lowland tropical forest in southeastern Colombia. We find static gaps are present across the landscape at 1.6 gaps ha-1, while dynamic gaps are present at 0.5 gaps ha-1. Moreover, 60% of these dynamic gaps are connected to pre-existing gaps (i.e., gap edge expansion), with new isolated gaps making up just 0.2 gaps ha-1. The lower density of dynamic gaps suggests studies using static gaps may overestimate the amount of tropical forest carbon lost annually to natural disturbance.",

            "abstract": "The Long Valley volcanic region in eastern California contains three magmatic foci; Long Valley Caldera (760-50 ka), Mammoth Mountain (120-8 ka), and Mono-Inyo Craters (60–0.3 ka). Zones of partial melt and/or hydrothermal fluids are known to exist under all three systems, but are not well constrained. In 2013-2014, we collected 110 magnetotelluric stations within a 40km x 45km grid, from Mono Craters through Long Valley Caldera. To date, a 3-D resistivity model has been created for Mono Craters showing three distinct features. Best constrained is a 150±50 km3, near vertical conductive anomaly (0.1-3 Ω·m) located under the southeast margin of Mono Craters at depths from 10km to >35km, which may reflect the deep, partially molten source region for Holocene eruptions. Electrical resistivity calculations suggest temperatures of 775°C±50 and a partial melt fraction 0.2 ±0.1. The location, melt fraction, and volume estimated in this study are consistent with those from teleseismic experiments conducted by Archauer (1986) and Dawson et al. (1990). A second conductive anomaly (0.5-5 Ω·m) at 12km to >35km depths was found 10km west of the Mono Craters near the eastern front of the Sierra Nevada. This anomaly coincides with a zone of sporadic, long-period earthquakes interpreted as “fluid-driven” by Pitt et al. (1994). This anomaly may reflect a zone of hydrothermal fluid infiltration originating from the aforementioned magmatic region. The third feature identified in this study is a resistive anomaly (103-104 Ω·m) under Aeolian Buttes, a Cretaceous quartz monzanite outcropping within the Bishop Tuff between Mono Craters and the Sierran front. The anomaly, which fills a crustal volume of 1500 ±500 km3, balloons upward from a deep root at >30 km to within 2 km of the surface and is interpreted as a cold, granitic pluton as supported by gravity and magnetic data. Future work will extend our three-dimensional resistivity model southwards to Inyo Craters and Long Valley Caldera.",

            "abstract": "NASA's IRIS mission has observed signatures of the Fe XXI 1354 line in tens of solar flares. In many of them, large blue shifts were identified, supporting the scenario of chromospheric evaporation in postflare loops. In the standard CSHKP flare model, the postflare loops are a natual consequence of magnetic reconnection occurring at the flare site. The CSHKP model also predicts downflow (and upflow) plasma having a speed close to the Alfven speed. Yet, to date there were no observations of fast moving downflow plasma in flares. Here, we report the first detection of large red shift (~200 km/s along line of sight) of the Fe XXI line with IRIS. Combined imaging and spectroscopic observations of IRIS, together with SDO/AIA and RHESSI observations, reveal that the redshifted Fe XXI feature co-located with the loop-top hard X-Ray source and above the retracting loops. We intepret this large redshift as signature of downward moving reconnection outflow/retracting loops. Possible flux rope eruption and reconnection inflows are also observed. Furthermore, we found that the entire Fe XXI line is blueshifted by ~250 km/s at the loop footpoints. Cool lines of Si IV, O IV, C II and Mg II all show obvious redshift at the same locations, consistent with the scenario of chromospheric evaporation. The map of electron temperature reconstructed from SDO/AIA observations shows that the locations of ~10MK temperature generally coincide with the observed Fe XXI feature very well. Hard X-rays up to ~100keV were found from RHESSI observations, indicating an efficient electron acceleration process in this event.",

            "abstract": "Several studies have recently addressed the complex interactions existing at various spatial scales among riparian vegetation, channel morphology and wood storage. The majority of these investigations has been carried out in relatively natural river systems, focusing mostly on the long-term vegetation-morphology dynamics under “equilibrium” conditions.\nLittle is still known about the role of flood events – of different frequency/magnitude – on several aspects of such dynamics, e.g. entrainment conditions of in-channel wood, erosion rates of vegetation from channel margins and from islands, transport distances of wood elements of different size along the channel network. Even less understood is how the river’s evolutionary trajectory may affect these processes, and thus the degree to which conceptual models derivable from near-natural systems could be applicable to human-disturbed channels. Indeed, the different human pressures – present on most river basins worldwide – have greatly impaired the morphological and ecological functions of fluvial wood, and the attempts to “restore” in-channel wood storage are currently carried out without a sufficient understanding of wood transport processes occurring during floods. On the other hand, the capability to correctly predict the magnitude of large wood transport during large floods is now seen as crucial – especially in mountain basins – for flood hazard mapping, as is the identification of the potential wood sources (e.g. landslides, floodplains, islands) for the implementation of sound and effective hazard mitigation measures.\nThe presentation will first summarize the current knowledge on fluvial wood dynamics and modelling at different spatial and temporal scales, with a particular focus on mountain rivers. The effects of floods of different characteristics on vegetation erosion and wood transport will be then addressed presenting some study cases from rivers in the European Alps and in the Italian Apennines featuring different degrees of human alteration. Finally, several conclusions about the applicability of wood transport modelling and on rationale vegetation/wood management strategies will be drawn.",

            "abstract": "The Green Valley and Bartlett Springs faults (GVF-BSF) together form the third largest branch of the dextral San Andreas transform fault system in northern California. Wilson Valley lies at the center of a tectonic pull-apart basin formed in the 2.5-km stepover between the Hunting Creek fault (northernmost section of the GVF) and the Highway-20 section of the BSF. A major regional drainage, Cache Creek flows through this depression and has been offset ~6 km right-laterally by the GVF-BSF during the Quaternary. We recently discovered the Kuikui fault, a dextral-oblique slip fault within the stepover, using high-resolution imagery from LiDAR acquired by USGS in 2011 along major northern California fault zones (ARRA11_USGS, DOI: 10.5069/G9H70CRD,\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5069/G9H70CRD\n). The Kuikui fault is ~2-3 km in length and forms steep, well-preserved scarps up to ~2.5 m high. It has only subtle expression of dextral slip, so its ratio of dip slip to strike slip is uncertain.\nAny evidence of large paleoearthquakes in the Wilson Valley stepover might indicate rupture of either the GVF or the BSF or both together, and timing information could be used to correlate events with other paleoseismic sites on the fault system. Additionally, fault creep has been documented on both the Highway 20 and Hunting Creek fault sections, so that any fault offset on the Kuikui fault might also include some aseismic slip. Because wilderness regulations required manual excavation, several participants from USGS, HSU, other colleagues and volunteers together dug an 8-m long by ≤1 m deep trench by hand to expose faulting in thin layers of alluvium deposited across the Kuikui fault. The youngest, and currently active soil layer is vertically offset by a minimum of 7 cm on a single fault strand. A much broader fault zone suggests larger movement has occurred. This exposure did not allow us to discriminate whether slip occurred as creep or by dynamic rupture. Future additional exposures may better distinguish evidence of creep from seismogenic ruptures. Pending radiocarbon dates may partially constrain when this slip occurred.",

            "abstract": "The Ganges Alluvial Plain (‘GAP’) is the sedimentary infill of the foreland basin created during Himalayan orogeny. Freshly eroded material from the Himalaya and southern cratonic tributaries is deposited into a system with long water-sediment interaction times, creating potential for further generation of river weathering fluxes. To quantify weathering processes in the GAP, 51 sites including all major tributaries were sampled in a September 2013 campaign and analysed for major and minor ions, Ge/Si ratios and δ30Si, δ13C and δ18O. Net dissolved Si (DSi) and major cation yields are 2 to 5 times lower in the GAP than the Himalaya, and at a whole basin scale approximate the global average, indicating that the plain apparently moderates the efficiency of Himalayan weathering rates.\nMainstem δ30Si spans 0.81 to 1.93‰ (see figure) and gives the impression of a system buffered to moderate DSi and δ30Si. Ge/Si ratios (µmol/mol) are higher than expected in the Himalaya (>3), reflecting input of Ge-enriched water from hot springs, and decline to ~1.4 in the GAP. For the Himalayan sourced rivers, δ30Si increases with distance from the Himalayan front, and can not be explained entirely by conservative mixing with higher δ30Si peninsular and GAP streams. To a first degree, the δ30Si data suggest incorporation of Si into secondary minerals as the key fractionating process, and that this occurs both in situ during initial weathering and progressively in the GAP.\nPartitioning of solutes between sources is complicated in the GAP. Consistent with previous work, carbonate weathering dominates the ion fluxes, but with substantial contributions from saline/alkaline soil salts, the chlorination of wastewater and highly variable rainfall chemistry. Due to these contributions, precisely inferring the input from silicate weathering is difficult. We introduce a novel method to infer silicate-weathering rates that exploits the fractionation of Si during clay formation to account for the loss of DSi from solution.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the inward intrusion of energetic electrons in the Earth’s radiation belts observed by the Van Allen probes during a 10-day quiet period in March 2013. The electron flux measurements from Mageis and REPT instruments on the Van Allen probes show the clear radial diffusion and slow decay of ~300 keV to ~4.5 MeV electrons. The energetic electrons are injected at L ~ 4.75 on March 06, and gradually diffuse inward at each energy channel to L ~ 4 until interrupted by a strong geomagnetic disturbance on March 17. Meanwhile, the differential energy flux of the energetic electrons decreased by about 1 order in 10 days. The electrons exhibit flattened pitch angle distributions above ~40°. We adopt a 3 dimensional radiation belt model which incorporates radial and local diffusion processes to simulate this event. The empirical radial diffusion rates provide reasonable agreement with the observed inward diffusion profile. The hiss wave amplitudes are observed by the THEMIS spacecraft on the dayside and by the Van Allen probes on the nightside. The electrons with energies lower than ~1 MeV are effectively scattered by hiss waves, causing the slow decay in consistent with observations. The higher energy electrons are effectively scattered by EMIC waves near the loss cone, and by hiss waves at higher pitch angles. The decaying timescale and the pitch angle distribution caused by the pitch angle scattering in the simulation are consistent with the observation at each energy channel. Our study demonstrates that the quiet time energetic electron dynamics are effectively controlled by the radial diffusion and pitch angle scattering processes in the Earth’s radiation belts.",

The study area is part of Mahakam Watershed that drains rugged and rolling terrain of 20,000 km2 dominated by rain forest with patchy farmland with precipitation of about 2,000 mm/year. The Hydrologic Engineering Corps - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) is used to simulate discharges using parameters determined from various geospatial data, including soil type, land cover and digital elevation model. Due to the limited in situ meteorological, water level and discharge data, a modified Thiessen polygon method is used to spatially model the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data to match the location of field meteorological stations. The challenge for employing ESA’s Environmental Satellite (Envisat) altimeter includes the limited spatial and temporal resolutions, e.g. the narrower river width compared to the satellite's ground footprint and the 35 days repeat period for the altimeter ground track . To mitigate the spatial limitation, or tracker biases causing the radar altimeter return waveforms to deviate from the expected waveform model, we selected Envisat altimetry water level data based on standard over-water waveform shapes for each of the 18 Hz averaged return signals. Results indicate that the use of Envisat altimetry is a viable approach for estimating water level of medium-sized river (200–800 m width). In addition, contrary to results from previous studies, the Ice-1 waveform retracker is not necessarily the best among the four standard radar waveform retrackers for Envisat altimetry for this study region. Further, although there is good comparison between HEC-HMS simulated and observed discharges, results indicate that satellite altimetry provided better estimates of water level than those inferred from HEC-HMS simulated discharges and rating curves.",

            "abstract": "It is now well established that global temperature responds approximately linearly to cumulative CO2 emissions, allowing a finite carbon emissions budget to be defined and associated with a given global temperature target. However, it is less obvious how to incorporate into this framework the other greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions, owing largely to their widely varying atmospheric lifetimes and consequent climate effect. In this presentation, I will propose a new way to compare the climate effect of a range of greenhouse gases and aerosols. I will first assess the lifetime of the temperature response to different types of emissions, which depends on the atmospheric lifetime of the gas in question, as well as the timescale of the climate system response to forcing. I will then use this timescale of temperature decay to weight emissions of a given gas over time, generating an estimate of the effective cumulative emissions that produce a given amount of temperature change at a particular time. Finally, I will illustrate the application of this method to the question of quantifying historical national contributions to global warming and determine future emission allowances for a given climate target.",

Measurements from HIRDLS have significantly advanced our understanding of the distribution and characteristics of these waves, which are a vitally important component in our dynamical understanding of the middle and upper atmosphere and play key roles in atmospheric processes at all scales.\nHere, we present detailed analyses of the wave spectrum observed by HIRDLS using techniques capable of detecting overlapping wave signals in the data. In particular, we decompose these results as a function of both horizontal and vertical wavelength, and show how this distribution varies both spatially and temporally, at seasonal and shorter timescales. We further consider how these results compare to other instruments observing gravity waves, and how they impact upon the modelling of gravity waves at both climate and weather scales, in particular considering how the uniquely high resolution of HIRDLS contributes to the state of the art of our understanding.",

Evapotranspiration provides a direct physical link between the soil, crop canopy, and the atmosphere, and is hence highly sensitive to changes in water availability. Here, we introduce a new surface energy balance model (High Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration; HRMET) that can map ET at very high resolution (meter-scale) requiring only canopy surface temperature, canopy structure, and meteorology as inputs. HRMET can be used in both open and closed canopy conditions. We validate HRMET over two commercial cornfields in the Yahara River Watershed (south-central Wisconsin, USA) and investigate the spatially variable ET response to severe drought conditions during the 2012 growing season. Results show that the magnitude of within-field ET variability is much larger when the drought is more severe. We then introduce a new metric, Relative ET (ETR), which normalizes ET on a field scale and allows for direct comparison across measurement dates, despite differences in meteorological conditions and crop growth stage. Using a novel paired-image technique, we use persistent patterns of ETR identify portions of the field that are most susceptible to drought, and portions that are consistently productive across measurement dates. These results have implications for precision agriculture and irrigation efficiency in addition to water management and yield forecasting, as identification of persistent patterns in crop productivity during low-stress periods allows farmers to direct resources to the most sensitive areas early in droughts.",

Continental dust may also play an important role in ocean fertilization and carbon sequestration. Because the lifetime of dust aerosol in the atmosphere is only on the order of days to weeks, spatial and temporal variability in concentrations and fluxes is high and understanding of recent and long term changes is limited.\nHere we present and discuss continuous, high depth resolution measurements of a range of dust proxies in a developing array of Arctic ice cores. Included are traditional proxies such as non-sea-salt (nss) calcium and insoluble particle number and size distribution as well as less traditional proxies such as rare earth elements which together provide important insights into how dust sources and transport may have changed in the past. The array includes a number of new ice core records from Greenland, the North Pacific, and Arctic Russia providing a spatial and temporal record of dust deposition to the Arctic. We compare these detailed dust records with climate and land use proxies to investigate drivers of dustiness in the Arctic during the last millennium.",

            "abstract": "During the recent solar minimum, a large amount of C/NOFS satellite measurements have revealed an upward drift that occurs during the post-midnight period (~2-3 LT). The upward drift is also frequently shown in radar measurements. The phenomenon has not yet been explained and the physics are still unknown. Our simulations have successfully reproduced the unusual upward drift using the coupled Whole Atmosphere Model and Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere Model (WAM/GIP). Simulations also reveal strong seasonal and longitudinal dependence of the upward drift. Preliminary results indicate that the upward drift during post-midnight period may be associated with the dynamics accompanying the midnight temperature maximum (MTM) that occurs in the thermosphere. The MTM reverses the typical zonal and meridional winds in the nighttime and the changes of winds are likely to have further impact on the nighttime electrodynamic processes. We will present the morphology and characteristics of the post-midnight upward drift shown in the simulations and propose theories to explain the causal mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The geostatistical approach (GA) to inversion has been applied to many engineering applications to estimate unknown parameter functions and quantify the uncertainty in estimation. Thanks to recent advances in sensor technology, large-scale/joint inversions have become more common and the implementation of the traditional GA algorithm would require thousands of expensive numerical simulation runs, which would be computationally infeasible.\nTo overcome the computational challenges, we present the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach (PCGA) that makes use of leading principal components of the prior information to avoid expensive sensitivity computations and obtain an approximate GA solution and its uncertainty with a few hundred numerical simulation runs. As we show in this presentation, the PCGA estimate is close to, even almost same as the estimate obtained from full-model implemented GA while one can reduce the computation time by the order of 10 or more in most practical cases. Furthermore, our method is “black-box” in the sense that any numerical simulation software can be linked to PCGA to perform the geostatistical inversion. This enables a hassle-free implementation of GA to multi-physics problems and joint inversion with different types of measurements such as hydrologic, chemical, and geophysical data obviating the need to explicitly compute the sensitivity of measurements through expensive coupled numerical simulations. Lastly, the PCGA is easily implemented to run the numerical simulations in parallel, thus taking advantage of high performance computing environments. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method with several examples such as 3-D transient hydraulic tomography, joint inversion of head and tracer data and geochemical heterogeneity identification.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Mississippi River dramatically incised and alluviated over Quaternary glacial cycles. Early Pleistocene till that crosses the present-day incised valley [Willman and Frye, 1969] indicates that at least one Pleistocene continental glaciation predated river incision; magnetically-reversed sediments in the Wisconsin River valley [Knox and Attig, 1988] record some amount of incision by 780 ka; and the modern Upper Mississippi valley is underlain by a thick alluvial fill [Horberg, 1950; Knox, 1999; Blumentritt et al., 2009]. Here we integrate geological data and geophysical modeling to provide insight into the ice sheet–fluvial system interactions that shaped the landscape of the modern Upper Mississippi valley. We show that buried ~50–95 m beneath the modern alluvial surface of the Mississippi lies a bedrock valley whose anomalously deep northern reach records fluvial incision through the ~1000 km wide and up to 40–50 m high Laurentide Ice Sheet forebulge. Subsequent forebulge collapse upon deglaciation led to thick alluviation that serves to preserve this fossil bedrock valley. Avulsions of the Mississippi during the last glacial cycle caused the remaining ~50 m of roughly uniform aggradation by trapping glacial-stage sediments behind bedrock sills along the new course of the river. Modeled rock uplift rates in the region over the last glacial cycle suggest that uplift should have peaked in the interval 16–12 ka, reaching ~10–40 mm yr−1 across much of the Upper Mississippi valley. This is synchronous with deglaciation and the resultant enhanced meltwater discharge [Wickert et al., 2013] and proglacial lake outflow [Knox, 2007] into the Mississippi River. The presence of the bedrock trough implies that during deglacial phases lasting a few thousand years, the Upper Mississippi River—located in the center of the stable North American craton—was capable of keeping pace with rock uplift rates reaching 2–10 times that of the most active mountain belts on Earth [e.g., Leland et al., 2008].",

Recent observations continue to raise questions about the effects and interaction of these in our geospace environment, and how these vary between extremes in solar activity. To address these, ICON will measure all key parameters of the atmosphere and ionosphere simultaneously and continuously with a combination of remote sensing and in-situ measurements. ICON will fly in a 27-degree inclination orbit with a payload designed to observe the processes of vertical wave coupling in the Ionosphere/Thermosphere/Mesosphere system, how these processes influence the state of the system itself, and how that state preconditions the system for modification by external influence (e.g. solar and solar wind forcing). ICON will remotely observe winds and temperatures in the 90-150 km region while measuring the highly variable electric field in the ionosphere on magnetically connected field lines. Simultaneous to these observations, ICON remotely observes the thermospheric composition and density, and ionospheric density in day and night. The retrievals involved and resultant precision in the determination of key parameters will be presented. The scientific return from ICON is enhanced by dynamic operational modes of the observatory that provide capabilities well beyond that afforded by a static space platform. Careful selection of these modes and the selective implementation of instrument redundancy provide the ability to operate with large technical margins that support the greatest return of science data.",

            "abstract": "The Naches River drainage basin east of Mount Rainer includes tributary valleys of the Little Naches, American, Bumping, and Tieton rivers. An investigation of surface boulder frequency, weathering rind thicknesses, and soil development on moraines in these valleys identified two stages of Pleistocene glaciations in the American, Bumping, and Tieton drainages, followed by Neoglaciation. These stages include a more extensive early glaciation (Hayden Creek?), and the later Evans Creek Glaciation (25-15 ka). Thick forest cover, limited road cuts, and widespread post-glacial mass wasting hamper efforts to determine the maximum extent of glaciation. However, glacial striations at Chinook Pass, moraine complexes in the vicinity of Goose Egg Mountain, ice-transported boulders and striations on Pinegrass Ridge, and a boulder field possibly derived from an Evans Creek jökulhaup in the Tieton River valley, all point to extensive Pleistocene ice in the central tributaries of the Naches River.\nLowest observed ice elevations in the Tieton (780 m), Bumping (850 m), and American (920 m) drainages increase towards the north, while glacial lengths decrease from 40 to 28 km. The Little Naches is the northernmost drainage in the study, but despite a maximum elevation (1810 m) that exceeds the floor of ice caps to the south, glacially-derived sediments are not evident and the surrounding peaks lack cirques. The absence of ice in the Little Naches drainage, along with the systematic northward change in glacial length and lowest observed ice elevations in the other drainages, are likely due to a precipitation shadow northeast of Mount Rainier. In contrast, the source of glacial ice in the Tieton drainage to the southeast was the Goat Rocks peaks. Ground-based study of neoglacial moraines and analysis of 112 years of topographic maps and satellite imagery point to rapid retreat of the remaining Goat Rocks glaciers following the Little Ice Age.",

            "abstract": "Carbon isotopes are frequently used to infer changes in past ocean circulation based on proxy records. Climate models on the other hand simulate the full climate system, but not the isotopic proxy record that corresponds to the climate state, making it difficult to compare model results with isotopic proxy data. In order to bridge this gap, we have implemented carbon isotopes (13C and 14C) in the ocean model of a state-of-the-art earth system model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). These improvements will allow us to more directly compare the model results to paleo proxies in future paleo simulations with the widely used CESM. Furthermore, simulating carbon isotopes in the model will allow us to investigate the details of the relationship between physical changes in the ocean circulation and isotopic changes in the self-consistent model system. We will discuss the implementation of abiotic and biotic radiocarbon and biotic 13C in the ocean model of the CESM1, to introduce these new features to the community. Then we will show how the model performs compared to present-day data, characterize the sensitivity of the simulated δ13C distributions to different biological fractionation parameterizations, and show results from idealized freshwater hosing experiments. In the near future, we plan to use the carbon-isotope enabled CESM to study changes in the ocean circulation during the LGM and the deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of the noble gas abundances and isotopic compositions in the Martian crust and atmosphere come from two sources, measurements of meteorites from Mars and in situ measurements by spacecraft. Measurements by the Viking landers had large uncertainties, but were precise enough to tie the meteorites to Mars. Hence most of the questions we have are currently defined by meteorite measurements. Curiosity’s SAM has confirmed that the Ar isotopic composition of the atmosphere is highly fractionated, presumably representing atmospheric loss that can now be modeled with more confidence. What turns out to be a more difficult trait to explain is the fact that the ratio of Kr/Xe in nakhlites, chassignites and ALH84001 is distinct from the atmospheric ratio, as defined by measurements from shergottites. This discrepancy has been suggested to be a result of atmosphere/groundwater/rock interaction, polar clathrate formation, or perhaps local temperature conditions. More detailed atmospheric measurements, along with targeted simulation experiments, will be needed to make full use of this anomaly.",

New apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He data combined with published apatite fission track data (AFT), new 1:50:000-scale mapping, and in-progress drafting of a balanced cross-section provide new insight into the geometry and timing of deformation, and the timing and rates of exhumation. Mapping was focused along an east-west transect through the Subandean Zone (SAZ), Interandean Zone (IAZ), and Eastern Cordillera (EC). Regional-scale folds (~10-20 km wavelength, ~4-6 km amplitude) in the SAZ exhume rocks as deep as Carboniferous above a 10-12 km deep decollemont in Silurian rocks. In the IAZ, thinner (~1-4 km), closely-spaced thrust sheets exhume Devonian and Silurian rocks, and a regional-scale anticlinorium in the easternmost EC exhumes rocks as deep as Cambrian and Ordovician. 11 new apatite and 5 new zircon (U-Th)/He cooling ages provide timing constraints on the initiation of thrust-related exhumation. Zircon cooling ages (32.8±1.4 to 25.4±1.2 Ma) reveal initiation of exhumation in the easternmost EC as early as ~32 Ma, and an exhumed partial retention zone at the EC-IAZ boundary. Apatite ages in the IAZ range from 21.71±0.77 to 7.45±0.20 Ma, and consistently young to the east. Exhumation was previously thought to have begun in the IAZ at ~10 Ma, but our results show thrust-related exhumation as early as ~22 Ma, in agreement with published AFT data that show that deformation had propagated eastward into the IAZ by at least ~18 Ma. In the western SAZ, apatite cooling ages of 6.10±0.17 and 4.84±0.14 Ma demonstrate that thrust-related uplift and exhumation in the western SAZ had begun by at least the late Miocene. These new data show a consistent eastward propagation of thrust-related uplift and exhumation from the eastern EC to the western SAZ between ~32 and ~5 Ma. Integration of these data with sequential restoration of a balanced cross-section will provide a temporal record of shortening rates, which will allow testing of predicted feedback responses of the Andean thrust belt to middle Miocene uplift of the southern Altiplano.",

The research team developed a detailed data collection methodology. The methodology involves assessing the vehicle fleet and activity in Murmansk using traffic, parking lot and driver surveys combined with an existing database from a vehicle inspection station and statistical data. The team also assessed the most appropriate emission factors, drawing from both Russian and international inventory methodologies. The researchers also compared fuel consumption using statistical data and bottom-up fuel calculations. They then calculated emissions for on-road transportation, off-road transportation (including mines), diesel generators, fishing and other sources. The article also provides a preliminary assessment of Russia-wide emissions of black carbon from diesel sources.",

            "abstract": "Episodes of low-fountaining eruption lasting minutes to tens of minutes alternated with passive degassing at Halema`uma`u during 5 days of observations in December 2013. Some low fountains were triggered by small collapses from the vent walls and originated close to the margin of the lava lake. Others began in the lake interior and migrated to its margins without any obvious link to rock falls.\nObservations using high-frequency (50-500 Hz) thermal and visible imaging reveal that the fountains consist of sequences of close-spaced, meter-scale pockets of gas that burst through the free surface. Bursts lasted between 0.15 and 1.5 seconds, often partially overlapping in time and space. Bursts entrain both relatively brittle plates from the crust of the lava lake and very ductile thin crust that formed between successive pockets. The latter form spectacular ‘lace-work’ pyroclasts, of meter-scale diameter, which rise, deform, tear, and fall back into the lava lake.\n The process can be treated as a form of hydrodynamic fragmentation involving the transformation of masses of accelerating liquid into jets via the generation of liquid films that experience strong stretching during highly non-linear fluid motion.",

            "abstract": "Frozen precipitation in the mid-latitudes and semi-arid environments frequently serves a crucial role in the annual water budget. Often occurring along elevational gradients, the rain/snow transition (or, “snow line”) in mountain systems determines the amount of water which enters the system slowly during melt phases as opposed to rain which immediately infiltrates or runs off to lower elevations. This in turn influences the location and composition of ecological communities such as conifer forests, as well as timing and nature of the entire mountain block annual hydrologic cycle. Characterization of the rain/snow transition is becoming a priority in mountainous semi-arid regions, as increasing human populations and repeated drought episodes combine to create water shortages. Atmospheric conditions (temperature and relative humidity) which signal the rain/snow transition have been described, but variability within the conditions window can create error in estimating true areal cover of frozen versus liquid precipitation. In populated, flood-prone regions, radar installations specifically tuned to the detection of the “bright band” transition elevation can be deployed; however these cannot be permanently installed at remote, solar-power-dependent climate stations or with fine geographical scale. Characterization of current trends in rain/snow transition can be made using automated weather stations placed along the elevational gradient fielding sensors for high-frequency (e.g. 1-10 minute) measurement of air temperature, relative humidity, liquid precipitation, and precipitation mass. Visual validation of precipitation modes detected through automated means is performed using time-series records from digital cameras placed at each station. Refinements of geographically-explicit relationships of atmospheric conditions to precipitation mode can be made over time, as well as detection of seasonally-anomalous but eco-hydrologically-significant frozen precipitation events such as summertime hail storms.",

MFJD is a tributary to the Colombia and is part of one of the longest free flowing rivers systems in the continental United States. It is a gravel and cobble bed river with a drainage area of 2,100 km2. The river has endured extensive channel and floodplain degradation from years of channel alteration and straightening due to human influences including dredge mining, ranching, and farming. As part of the river restoration project on the MFJD, engineered log jams have been constructed to address many of the restoration goals including creating scour pools, inhibiting bank erosion, creating and maintaining a sinuous river planform, and increasing complexity of fish habitat. There is a need for more detailed understanding on ELJ channel morphologic effects and how site-specific characteristics and differences in log jam infrastructure interact to create the in-channel features over timescales longer than a few years. This study uses detailed channel bed topographic surveys collected either with a total station or RTK-GPS technology. Geomorphic change detection techniques are utilized to monitor topographic change under and around the 26 log structures in two different river reaches over a six to seven year period The log structures are often associated with deepening of pools as desired, but also some structures show sedimentation under the structure. Differences in the patterns will be assessed based on the design, location, and specific characteristics of the log structures; variables include number and placement of logs, volume of structure, location on meander bend, and sediment sizes.",

One site (‘borrow site’) was 2 km offshore and used as a dredging site for beach nourishment of nearby Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, and the other site (‘reference site’) was 10 km offshore and not directly impacted by the dredging. In-situ time-series data were collected during two periods after the dredging: March 15 - June 12, 2012(‘spring’) and August 18 - November 18, 2012 (‘fall’). At the reference site directional wave spectra and upper water column current velocities were measured, as well as high-resolution current velocity profiles and suspended sediment concentration profiles in the Bottom Boundary Layer (BBL). Seabed elevation and small-scale seabed changes were also measured. At the borrow site seabed elevation and near-bed wave and current velocities were collected using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. Throughout both deployments bottom wave orbital velocities ranged from 0 – 110 m/s at the reference site. Wave orbital velocities were much lower at the borrow site ranging from 10-20 cm/s, as wave energy was dissipated on the extensive and rough sand banks before reaching the borrow site. Suspended sediment concentrations increased throughout the BBL when orbital velocities increased to approximately 20 cm/s. Sediment grain size and critical shear stresses were similar at both sites, therefore, re-suspension due to waves was less frequent at the borrow site. However, sediment concentrations were highly correlated with the tidal cycle at both sites. Semidiurnal tidal currents were similar at the two sites, typically ranging from 0 – 50 cm/s in the BBL. Maximum currents exceeded the critical shear stress and measured suspended sediment concentrations increased during the first hours of the tidal cycle when the tide switched to flood tide. Results indicate waves contributed more to sediment mobility at the reference site, while tidal forcing was the dominant factor at the borrow site. The seabed elevation data corraborates these results as active migrating ripples of 10 cm were measured at the reference site, while changes in seabed elevation at the borrow site were more gradual with approximately 30 cm of net accretion throughout the study.",

            "abstract": "Orogenic plateaus like Tibet form when rock uplift and lateral tectonic growth outpace the headward incision of rivers. Although it is generally acknowledged that drainage systems concurrently reorganize, the patterns, timing, and causes of such events are usually poorly defined. Here we report the discovery of a deeply incised canyon of the Yarlung Tsangpo, at the eastern end of the Himalaya, which is now buried under >500m of sediments. Five drillings have recently been conducted at distances of up to 300 km upstream from the Tsangpo Gorge. Each drilling reached bedrock after penetrating through unconsolidated sediments and allowed us to reconstruct the former valley bottom. Results show that prior to aggradation, the Yarlung Tsangpo was able to erode back into the Tibetan Plateau and to develop a nearly graded profile. Cosmogenic nuclide derived burial ages from the base of the valley fill suggest that aggradation initiated at ~2-2.5 Ma. Our results provide clear evidence that accelerated uplift of the Namche Barwa and Gyala Peri massifs started ~2-2.5 Myr ago, blocked the canyon, and formed the modern Tsangpo Gorge. These findings refute existing hypotheses that relate the Tsangpo Gorge to young river capture or glacial damming during the Quaternary. We provide evidence for a similar and synchronous evolution of the Indus and Tsangpo Gorges, suggesting that the Himalayan syntaxes responded to a common forcing, possibly related to accelerated E-W extension of southern Tibet.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the worst tsunami disaster in history with 230,000 casualties, was generated by the largest earthquake (M 9.1) since the 1960 Chilean and 1964 Alaskan earthquakes, but such a giant earthquake was not anticipated in the Indian Ocean. Besides its size, lack of tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean and lack of knowledge about tsunami among the coastal residents enhanced the tsunami disaster, while scientific knowledge and technology for far-field tsunami warning system existed. Developments since 2004 include paleo-tsunami studies, global tsunami observations and tsunami warning and hazard mitigation systems. Tsunami deposits found in Indonesia, Thailand and India show that giant tsunamis similar to the 2004 tsunami occurred in the past. Deep ocean pressure gauges (DART system), GPS buoys and coastal tide gauges have been installed with real-time data-telemetry capability in Indian Ocean as well as the Pacific Ocean. Three regional tsunami warning centers are now in operation in India, Indonesia and Australia. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake was also generated by a giant (M 9.0) earthquake. While such an earthquake was unexpected in Japan, similar tsunamis occurred in the past and caused damage on Sanriku coast and Sendai plain. The tsunami warning, issued 3 min after the earthquake, saved many lives yet caused significant (~19,000) fatalities, partly because of underestimation of earthquake size. The insufficient tsunami hazard assessment caused the significant number of casualties and the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident. Existed coastal sea walls might have given inappropriate belief to coastal residents that they were protected from tsunami disaster. Scientific and technological developments needed for the future include estimation of probable maximum earthquake size for tsunami hazard assessment, and real-time estimation of earthquake and tsunami size based on seismic and sea level measurements. In addition, limitation of scientific knowledge and technology need to be transmitted to coastal residents.",

            "abstract": "A method has been developed to assimilate ionosonde virtual heights and GPS slant TEC data to estimate the parameters of a local ionosphere model, including estimates of the topside and of latitude and longitude variations. This effort seeks to better assimilate a variety of remote sensing data in order to characterize local (and eventually regional and global) ionosphere electron density profiles.\nThe core calculations involve a forward refractive ray-tracing solution and a nonlinear optimal estimation algorithm that inverts the forward model. The ray-tracing calculations solve a nonlinear two-point boundary value problem for the curved ionosonde or GPS ray path through a parameterized electron density profile. It implements a full 3D solution that can handle the case of a tilted ionosphere. These calculations use Hamiltonian equivalents of the Appleton-Hartree magneto-plasma refraction index model. The current ionosphere parameterization is a modified Booker profile. It has been augmented to include latitude and longitude dependencies. The forward ray-tracing solution yields a given signal's group delay and beat carrier phase observables. An auxiliary set of boundary value problem solutions determine the sensitivities of the ray paths and observables with respect to the parameters of the augmented Booker profile. The nonlinear estimation algorithm compares the measured ionosonde virtual-altitude observables and GPS slant-TEC observables to the corresponding values from the forward refraction model. It uses the parameter sensitivities of the model to iteratively improve its parameter estimates in a way the reduces the residual errors between the measurements and their modeled values.\nThis method has been applied to data from HAARP in Gakona, AK and has produced good TEC and virtual height fits. It has been extended to characterize electron density perturbations caused by HAARP heating experiments through the use of GPS slant TEC data for an LOS through the heated zone.\nThe next planned extension of the method is to estimate the parameters of a regional ionosphere profile. The input observables will be slant TEC from an array of GPS receivers and group delay and carrier phase observables from an array of high-frequency beacons. The beacon array will function as a sort of multi-static ionosonde.",

These problems have been pointed out from the domestic seismic design industry. Among various estimation methods, this study used the method H/V ratio of ground motion for estimating site amplification. The method has been extended to background noise, Coda waves and S waves recently for estimating site amplification. This study applied the method to the 3 kinds of seismic energy simultansously, that is, background noise, Coda wave energy and S waves. This study analysed more than 267 background noises from 15 macro earthquakes including main Fukuoka earthquake (2005/03/20, M=6.5) and then compared results from background noise, Coda wave energy, and S waves, at the specific seismic station, for all the 8 main domestic seismic stations(KRA, GSU, GKP1, TJN, HKU, HSB, SNU, and KHD). The results showed that, at the specific sesimic station, most of the domestic seismic stations showed similar results among 3 different seismic energies. Each station showed its own characteristics of site amplification property in low, high and specific resonance frequency ranges. Comparison of this study to other studies using different method can give us much information about dynamic amplification of domestic sites characteristics and site classification.",

            "abstract": "Destructive debris flows often grow, and extend their runouts, by entraining sediment as they travel. However, incorporating varied entrainment processes into physics-based flow routing models is challenging. As an alternative, we developed a relatively simple, automated method for forecasting the inundation hazards posed by debris flows that entrain sediment and coalesce from multiple flows. Within a drainage network, we amalgamate the effects of many possible debris flows with each flow volume proportional to an entrainment rate scaled by the upslope contributing area, and then use these volumes in the USGS GIS-based inundation model LAHARZ. Our approach only requires estimates of two parameters: spatial entrainment rate & maximum entrainment area or maximum volume. Our procedure readily integrates various sediment sources and it can portray different inundation hazard levels on a GIS-based map by varying our two parameters.\nWe applied this approach to part of the Coast Range, southern Oregon, USA. Using aerial photography, we mapped debris flows triggered by a large 1996 rain event on a LiDAR-derived topographic base, and identified initiation locations, travel paths, and areas of channel erosion and deposition. Many catchments experienced multiple debris flows that coalesced downstream and about 95% of the debris flows entrained sediment as they traveled. Flows typically stopped entraining sediment before the upslope contributing area reached ~500,000 m2. We used pre- and post-debris-flow stereo photos to estimate spatial entrainment rates in four clear-cut catchments having both channel erosion and coalescence of flows; these rates varied from 0.12 to 0.2 m3/m2. GIS-based inundation maps, using our automated methods, are quite similar to the mapped flow paths and deposits. Given appropriate parameters, our approach could be applied to a variety of steep, channelized environments where entrainment is important, such as alpine and post-wildfire slopes.",

To address this problem, a 1:250,000-scale paleogeologic map of eastern Nevada, showing spatial distributions of Paleozoic-Mesozoic rocks exposed beneath a Paleogene unconformity, divided out at the formation scale, is integrated with maps of dip magnitude for Paleozoic-Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks, published sedimentary thickness records, and a published reconstruction of Basin and Range extension, in order to define and regionally-correlate thrust faults and folds, and estimate the pre-extensional amplitude, wavelength, and limb dips of folds. A new structural province, the Eastern Nevada fold belt (ENFB) is defined, and consists of a 100-150 km-wide region containing as many as five 1st-order, N-trending folds that can be traced for map distances between 100-250 km, have amplitudes between 2-4 km, wavelengths between 20-40 km, pre-extensional limb dips typically between 10-30˚, and deform rocks as young as Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. No regional-scale thrust faults or decollemont horizons breach modern exposure levels in the ENFB. ENFB folds are interpreted to have formed above a deep (≥10 km below the Paleogene unconformity), blind decollemont or shear zone, perhaps the westward projection of the master decollemont of the Sevier fold-thrust belt.\nTwo additional structural provinces of the Sevier hinterland, the Central Nevada thrust belt (CNTB) and Western Utah thrust belt (WUTB), represent zones of N-striking, E-vergent thrust faults and folds that each accommodated ca. 10 km of shortening. Both thrust belts branch northward off of the Sevier thrust belt, and are interpreted to represent contemporary, interior components of the Sevier thrust system. The CNTB, WUTB, and the intervening ENFB collectively record low-magnitude (a few 10’s of km) upper-crustal shortening that accompanied Cretaceous detachment and translation of the Cordilleran passive margin basin 220 km eastward during Sevier orogenesis. Low deformation magnitudes in the Sevier hinterland are attributed to the high rheological competence of this thick basin.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric lapse rate has been observed to decrease as a result of global warming. Reduced lapse rate is a result of a robust water vapor/lapse rate climate feedback simulated in coupled ocean–atmosphere models. The reduced lapse rate makes the atmosphere more stable, and in turn the more stable atmosphere can affect air quality in many aspects, most of them detrimental to the air quality. The largest effect of an increased vertical stability is an increased trapping of air pollutants in the boundary layer. A more stable atmosphere also makes it less likely to precipitate, especially for light and moderate precipitation that requires an unstable large–scale environment. Thus there is less scavenging of air pollutants by precipitation. Furthermore less precipitation implies less cloud cover or more clear days which can result in more nighttime inversions, again trapping more pollutants in the surface layer. Significant increase in clear days has been observed in China in the last 50 years, this can be a major contributor to more and worse fog/haze events in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the published literature regarding the climatic and hydrological variations of the past 8000 years in northern Xinjiang of China in hope that some of the controversies surrounding the Holocene climate history can be reconciled. Based on the well-tested premise that the overall relationship between the A/C ratios and the bioclimates in arid and semi-arid areas of China still holds, we compared the A/C ratio-based SMI (Standardized Moisture Index) of five selected lacustrine sequences. Our comparison shows that the regional average SMI had a general rising trend, and the rising trend was reasonably corroborated by other pollen proxies. The rising trend can be explained by invoking its climatic linkage with the North Atlantic Ocean, and a possible linkage with ENSO is an additional or an alternative mechanism for explaining the rising trend. The nearly parallel rising trends of seven δ18O-indicated SSI curves (Standardized Salinity index) mean that the lake-water salinity has been rising since ~8.0 cal. ka BP. The rising trend can be explained by invoking the Holocene variations in the areal extent of ice covers in the Tianshan Mountains and the Altay Mountains. That is, the persistent shrinking of the ice extent in the mountains generated less and less melting water supplies to the lakes and thus resulted in saltier and saltier waters in the lakes. The contradiction between the increasing trend of the basin-wide moisture and the increasing trend of the lake-water salinity can be reconciled as follows: the increasing trend of the precipitation accompanied by the lowering tend of the temperature might have increasingly enhanced the effective soil moisture in northern Xinjiang, but the increase in the basin-wide moisture was not enough to compensate for the decrease in the lake inflowing water resulted from the shrinkage of ice-covered areas in the mountains.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic Fe-oxyhydroxides have been widely found in freshwater and marine environments. Many studies have suggested a microbial role in iron precipitation in these settings, through either direct metabolic activities of bacteria or passive sorption and nucleation reaction. Due to the complex origin of biogenic Fe-oxyhydroxides, however, it is still a great challenge to ascertain the exact role of microorganisms in the formation of biogenic Fe-oxyhydroxides in nature environments, especially in Fe-rich neutral pH environments. Here, we report the geomicrobiological characterization of Fe-rich reddish precipitates from a high Fe, near-neutral pH hot spring with a temperature of 42 to 73°C located in the Rehai Geothermal Field, Tengchong, China. Abundant sheath-like Fe-oxyhydroxides, which are composed largely of Fe, Si, O and other trace elements, are scattered in the reddish precipitates and exhibit a diversity of morphologies and sizes. The sheath-like Fe-oxyhydroxides consist of ferrihydrites rather than more crystalline Fe oxides. Molecular evidences show that no chemolithotrophic Fe oxidizers were identified. Various thermophiles, mainly including cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, β-proteobacteria, Deinococci-Thermus and Chlorobi, may be involved in the formation of the sheath-like Fe-oxyhydroxides, through simply acting as binding and nucleation surface for Fe-oxyhydroxides. The oxygen produced by cyanobacteria that dominate the microbial community may greatly accelerate the oxidization of Fe(II) in the spring. Biogenic sheath-like Fe-oxyhydroxides in such a hot, near-neutral pH, Fe-rich spring have important implications for geochemical cycles driven by microorganisms, the origin of microfossils and the formation of banded iron formations (BIFs) in the Archean ocean.",

Multi-proxy records from eight sediment cores and on-shore sections display heterogeneous sediment distribution patterns and local catchment influences on lake formation.\nDetrital flux, stable isotopes and geochemical parameters indicate variations in water discharge, attributed to local effects and regional climate influence. A mass flow is related to a local non-climatic event. Ostracod assemblages and algae formation in combination with geochemical and sediment properties indicate four phases of centennial-scale fluctuations in water and sediment supply.\nDuring the global LGM the lake experienced the lowest lake level under cold and dry climate conditions. The lake level rose after 14 ka due to climatic amelioration (phase 1). Strong fluctuations are recorded for the Early Holocene, indicating variable conditions and unstable summer monsoon influence (phase 2). Minor fluctuations occurred between 7.8 and 4.5 ka as a result on ongoing glacier melt and increased westerly influence (phase 3). An earthquake-induced mass flow layer occurred at ca. 7.0 ka. The abrupt change of detrital carbonate contribution at around 6 ka is attributed to the continued retreat of glaciers and fluvial erosion of limestone. Short-term changes in water balance and sediment fluxes after a lowstand at 4.1 ka can be attributed to the variable influence of westerly-driven moisture supply (phase 4).\nWe can show that several events can be related to changes in the catchment configuration apart from climate influence. The hydrology was mainly controlled by meltwater discharges and westerly-driven air masses. The influence of the East Asian Summer Monsoon effective moisture supply remained on a very low level or was completely absent.",

The South China block has been traditionally thought to have formed by Neoproterozoic welding between the Yangtze and Cathysian blocks along the Jiangnan Orogen. However, increasing evidence suggests that the Neoproterozoic unification of South China comprises a set of collision events. Here we report a newly recognized syn-collisional intrusive suite at the northwestern Yangtze block.\nThe igneous suite is located at the Wangcang area, NE Sichuan province. It consists of tholeiitic- and alkali mafic rocks, and adakitic to calc-alkali felsic intrusions. They are dated at 8554Ma to 8675 Ma by U-Pb zircon, and show arc-related geochemical affinities with highly variable whole rock εNd (up to +7.78) and zircon εHf(t) values. The Wangcang suite is featured by high deformation and metamorphism of upper greenschist to amphibolitic facieses, which is contrast to the low grade ~820-750 Ma igneous suites in the same region. It suggests that the northwestern Yangtze block experienced an arc-continental orogenic event occurred during ~860-820 Ma.\nOur recent work has revealed that the Shennongjia terrain and the Yangtze continental nucleus was welded between ~1100-950Ma. These findings suggest that the unification of South China comprises a set of collision events.

            "abstract": "High Asia (HA), extensively including Tibetan Plateau, Pamir, Tienshan, and Altai, is a wide region characterized by high mean elevation over 4000 m. It is thought to be a remote area with less pollution, although surrounded by populous regions of strong pollutant-emission, like South Asia and China. However, evidences from in-situ air monitoring data, ice core records, snow sample analysis, and lake sediment record showed that the environment of HA is more and more severely under the threat of pollutant locally generated and exotic. A three-year-round aerosol sampling in Pamir during 2003-2006 showed the concentrations of black carbon seemed to increase by a factor of 2. Trajectory analysis suggested the pollutants from the eastern parts of China should contribute large to this. Inside Tibet, the atmospheric BC at Nam Co also showed a slight increasing trend during 2006-2009 associated with the pollutant penetration from South Asia. Ice core records along the Himalaya showed black carbon from South Asia can be transported into Tibet primarily through the Brahmaputra river valley, and secondly by the uplifted air stream. The deposition of black carbon in the surface of HA glaciers can cause a mean forcing of 6 W/m2. The darkening of the mid-Himalaya glaciers can be partly due to black carbon. The mean concentration of BC in HA glaciers is ~50 ppbw, and that in the snow cover of Xinjiang is ~70 ppbw. BC can be responsible for 30% reduction in the albedo of a winter snow cover observed at Nam Co. A 150-year record retrieved from the sediment of Nam Co Lake showed a significantly increasing trend of BC since 1860, which is consistent with the emissions of South Asia. We conclude that BC from exotic surroundings has impacted the environment of HA significantly.",

            "abstract": "We build a numerical earthquake model, including numerical source and wave propagation models, to understand the rupture process and the ground motion time history of the 2013 ML 6.4 Ruisui earthquake in Taiwan. This moderately large event was located in the Longitudinal Valley, a suture zone of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasia Plate. A joint source inversion analysis by using teleseismic body wave, GPS coseismic displacement and near field ground motion data was performed first. The inversion results derived from a western dipping fault plane indicate that the slip occurred in depths between 10 and 20 km. The rupture propagated from south to north and caused two asperities. The largest one located approximately 15 km north of the epicenter with a maximum slip about 1 m. A 3D seismic wave propagation simulation based on the spectral-element method was then carried out by using the inverted source model. A strong rupture directivity effect in the northern area of the Longitudinal Valley was found, which was due to the northward rupture process. Forward synthetic waveforms could explain most of the near-field ground motion data for frequencies between 0.05 and 0.2 Hz. This numerical earthquake model not only helps us confirm the detailed rupture processes on the Central Range Fault but also gives contribution to regional seismic hazard mitigation for future large earthquakes.",

Many studies have shown that hydrophone can be set up in the SOFAR channel to collect acoustic data to investigate plate movement (Fox and Dziak, 1999), seismisity (Fox et.al, 2001), characteristic of T-wave (Park et.al, 2001), seafloor volcanism (Nicolas, 1989), among others. Institute of Earth Sciences of Academia Sinica has been collaborating with Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI) and the Institute of Undersea Technology (IUT) of the National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU) to succefully build a new wide-band OBS (Yardbird). We hope that Yardbird is not only an OBS but also a multi-function underwater recording plotform. Therefor we are developing a low-power consumption, inexpensive hydrophone to catch acoustic signals. The protoypte of it has passed a series of tests and got some seismic seafloor data. This paper describes the design goal of hydrophone, component specifications, field data analyzed, and discusses the future directions of instrument development.\nKeywords: T-wave; Hydrophone; OBS; acoustic signal\nReferance:\n1 Fox, C.

Multi-spacecraft observations show that low-energy (<20 MeV) proton intensities may decrease when the spacecraft enters into the ICMEs. Based on a numerical solution of a focused transport equation, we obtained the fluxes of solar energetic particles (SEPs) accelerated by an interplanetary shock in a three-dimensional magnetic field. The shock is treated as a moving source of energetic particles with an assumed particle distribution function, while the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) disturbances generated by an ICME behind the shock are modeled by a Stokes' stream function with a spherical boundary. We computed the time profiles of particle flux and anisotropy as measured by multi-spacecraft. With perpendicular diffusion, energetic particles can cross magnetic field lines, and they can still be detected after the spacecraft enters into the ICMEs. By comparing our simulations with observations, the particle perpendicular diffusion coefficients can be qualitatively determined, and the radial and latitudinal variations of SEPs response to ICMEs have been studied.",

This paper systematically analyses the characteristics of random blocks in the underground powerhouse on the right bank of Wudongde hydropower station. Based on the theory of the general block method and data of fractures obtained from the field survey, the discrete fracture network model is established by an inverse method for identifying and analyzing random blocks. The calculation is realized for 10 times at random by GeneralBlock to reduce the influence of randomness. The results show that most of random blocks formed by discontinuities and excavations can be found in the vault of the powerhouse; for the 10 realizations, the average number of the random blocks is 414; the average volume of the blocks is 2.9m3 and the maximum volume of the blocks is 152.0 m3; the average depth of the blocks is 1.2m and the maximum depth is 8.8m. Most of the blocks are stable. Most of the unstable blocks present a failure of falling. Most removable blocks have 3 or 4 discontinuities and the maximum value is 12; fractures with west dip-direction and medium dip are the most dangerous for forming unstable blocks. Therefore, it is suggested that the anchor bolts should pierce through the fractures of west dip-direction and medium dip.",

Our analysis indicates that, once subducted, the STUW spreads in the subtropical North Atlantic as a vertical salinity maximum near 25.5 kg m-3. Both annual and interannual variability is identified in the STUW along the 25.5 kg m-3 density surface, which is completely different from the basin-scale variability in sea surface salinity. The annual and interannual variability in the STUW, however, shows a good correspondence with the sea surface salinity variability in the region enclosed by the 37.0 psu isohaline. Because of the formation of the STUW, this surface variability can be conveyed into the thermocline and transported over the entire basin. The effects of climate modes on the large-scale variability of the STUW are discussed.",

            "abstract": "With a quasi-exponential growth in industrialization since the mid-1990s, Asia has undergone a dramatic increase in anthropogenic emissions of aerosol and precursor gases to the atmosphere. Meanwhile, such emissions have been stabilized or reduced over North America and Europe. This geographical shift of global emission sources could potentially perturb the regional and global climate due to impact of aerosols on cloud properties, precipitation, and large-scale circulation. We use an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with different aerosol scenarios to investigate the radiative and microphysical effects of anthropogenic aerosols on the large-scale circulation and regional climate over the globe. We conduct experiments to simulate the continental shift of aerosol distribution by contrasting two simulations using 1970 and 2010 anthropogenic emission sources. We found the elevation of aerosol concentrations in East and South Asia results in regional surface temperature cooling of −0.10° to −0.17°C, respectively, due to the enhanced solar extinction by aerosols and cloud reflectivity. The reduction of the local aerosol loadings in Europe causes a significant warming of +0.4°C. However, despite recent decreasing in aerosol emission, North America shows a cooling of −0.13°C, likely caused by increasing of cloudiness under the influence of modulated general circulation. These aerosol induced temperature changes are consistent with the observed temperature trends from 1980 to 2013 in the reanalysis data. Our study also predicts weaker East/South Asia summer monsoons due to strong regional aerosol forcing. Moreover, the ascending motion in the northern tropics is found to be weakened by asymmetrical aerosol forcing, resulting in the cross-equatorial shift of Hadley Circulation.",

A CJ can be useful with respect to developing social justice and environmental awareness issues because it can empower community action and present different viewpoints. A practical CJ exercise is used in a second-year undergraduate course entitled Climate Change and Society, at University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. The CJ is used to consider some of the impacts of management policies used for climate change and sustainable development adaption, based on a hypothetical scenario. This scenario is that a major energy company wants to build a dam with hydroelectric power station in a developing country. This will provide low-carbon renewable energy to the country, investment in electricity infrastructure, and the company is committed to help economic development in the country, including in jobs and education. However, building and flooding of the dam will involve displacing 10,000 people from rural communities, flooding agricultural areas and areas of high biodiversity, and archaeological sites. The exercise is based on students, in groups, assuming different ‘identities’ which may include a local business person, resident, politician, member of an NGO, tourist, engineer, farmer etc, from which viewpoint they must argue for/against the proposal and to question other peoples' viewpoints. This exercise is useful because it allows students to develop understandings of different viewpoints, evaluate risk and impacts on different communities, and highlights the complexity of real-world decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is the most effective insoluble light-absorbing particulate (ILAP), which can strongly absorb solar radiation at visible wavelengths. Once BC is deposited in snow via dry or wet process, even a small amount of BC could significantly decrease snow albedo, enhance absorption of solar radiation, accelerate snow melting, and cause climate feedback. BC is considered the second most important component next to CO2 in terms of global warming. Similarly, mineral dust (MD) is another type of ILAP. So far, little attention has been paid to quantitative measurements of BC and MD deposition on snow surface in the midlatitudes of East Asia, especially over northern China. In this paper, we focus on the optical properties of BC and MD in snow or ice core, and their source attributions during several experiments in the high Asian glaciers over the mountain range and in seasonal snow. Results from the surveyed literature indicate that the absorption of ILAP in seasonal snow is dominated by MD in the Qilian Mountains and by local soil dust in the Inner Mongolian region close to dust sources. The detection of BC in snow and ice cores using modern techniques has a large bias and uncertainty when the snow sample is mixed with MD. Evidence also indicates that the reduction of snow albedo by BC and MD perturbations can significantly increase the net surface solar radiation, cause surface air temperature to rise, reduce snow accumulation, and accelerate snow melting.\nKey words: black carbon, mineral dust, ice core, seasonal snow, radiative forcing, Tibetan Plateau",

This great basin has been considered to be one of the most sensitive areas in the world to climate change.\nThe present paper investigates fluvial flood hazards in urban areas in the Mekong Delta to inundation due to seasonal flooding, a phenomenon which is likely to be exacerbated by future sea-level rise. Unlike past researches which mainly focus on flooding due to river discharge from upstream or heavy precipitation, the present paper scrutinizes the influence of ocean tides. The research reveals that ocean tides predominantly determine water elevation even in an upstream location such as Can Tho City, 80 km inland from the river mouth, and that the river flow causes tidal damping and effectively reduces the energy of the incoming tides. This tidal damping is especially pronounced during the rainy season. Analysis based on the water levels monitored by the Mekong River Commission reveals that the ground near the riverbank of Can Tho had experienced inundation for a total of 215 hours between July 2009 and June 2010 (2.5% of the time over a one year period). It is also shown that inundation reached up to a maximum height of 47 cm above the roads of Can Tho downtown in this one-year period.\nAssuming two scenarios of sea-level rise of 25 cm in the middle of the 21st century and 60 cm in the end of the century, all based on the Fifth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projections, it was found that the duration of inundation will be prolonged from the present percentage of 2.5% to 7.5% and 24% of the year, respectively.\nIt is important to note that while at present this flooding is seasonal and limited, in the future it could become more frequent and persistent, even without considering the more extreme SLR scenarios outlined in the IPCC AR5.",

            "abstract": "An earthquake sequence is a prolonged natural hazard event. Scientists can dynamically forecast aftershock frequency within bounds of uncertainty. We examine how this capability can be used in decision-making to reduce risk during a period of heightened seismicity. We draw from experience of the Canterbury earthquake sequence initiated by a magnitude 7.1 mainshock on September 4, 2010 near the city of Christchurch, a population of 370,000. The sequence impacted the built, economic, social and natural environments of the Canterbury region.\nWe study the use of aftershock forecasts in decision-making across the roles of policy makers, emergency managers and responders, critical infrastructure providers, insurers, communication officers, scientists, and the public. We held focus groups and interviews involving 53 participants using a semi-structured message centered approach in May and June of 2013. Transcripts from the focus groups and interviews were thematically coded using qualitative analysis.\nResponses to a pre-questionnaire suggested that aftershock information for decision-making increases slightly in importance throughout the four phases of a disaster – mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. We summarize our findings from this research, including\nthe use and barriers to the use of aftershock forecasts in decision-making across the disaster phases by roles\nconflicts of interest that arise in the decision-making hierarchy\nchallenges with providing and using forecasts during a prolonged event.\nFinally, we reflect on implications for Operational Earthquake Forecasting and how our findings may be generalized to other prolonged hazards.",

            "abstract": "An Integrated Terrestrial Water Analysis System, or NCA-LDAS, has been created to enable development, evaluation, and dissemination of terrestrial hydrologic climate indicators focusing on the continental U.S. The purpose is to provide quantifiable indicators of states and estimated trends in our nation's water stores and fluxes over a wide range of scales and locations, to support improved understanding and management of water resources and numerous related sectors such as agriculture and energy. NCA-LDAS relies on improved modeling of terrestrial hydrology through assimilation of satellite imagery, building upon the legacy of the Land Information System modeling framework (Kumar et al, 2006; Peters-Lidard et al, 2007). It currently employs the Noah or Catchment Land Surface Model, run with a number of satellite data assimilation scenarios. The domain for NCA-LDAS is the continental U.S. at 1/8 degree grid for the period 1979 to present. Satellite-based variables that are assimilated are soil moisture and snow water equivalent from principally microwave sensors such as SMMR, SSM/I and AMSR, snow covered area from multispectral sensors such as AVHRR, and MODIS, and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. Once simulated, output are evaluated in comparison to independent datasets using a variety of metrics using the Land Surface Verification Toolkit (LVT). LVT schemes within NCA-LDAS also include routines for computing standard statistics of time series such means, max, and linear trends, at various scales. The dissemination of the NCA-LDAS, including model descriptions, forcings, parameters, daily output, indicator results and LVT tools, have been made available to the public through dissemination on NASA GES-DISC.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, gas hydrate deposits have attracted growing interest from both academic and industry research, due to their potential as an unconventional energy resource, role in climate change and concern as a geohazard to various marine infrastructures. Methane hydrates are known to accommodate widespread regions of sea sediments at depths ranging from 130 to 2,000 m along offshore continental margins, normally located close to the seafloor and often presenting pockmarks that are underlain by chimney-like structures. The Nyegga region is situated along the west Norwegian continental slope and characterized by an extensive pockmark field. The Nyegga pockmarks are manifested by bathymetric troughs, seep-associated organisms, and rich methane-derived authigenic carbonate rocks. A controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) survey was performed along Nyegga CNE03 Pockmark, where high-resolution 3D seismic data was previously collected and analyzed. The aim of this CSEM study is to characterize the hydrate and free gas distribution along the CNE03 pockmark region. 2D CSEM inversions and pseudosections were computed using the data acquired by ocean bottom electrical field receivers (OBE) and the 3-axis towed receiver (Vulcan), respectively. Initial results from both data sets, confirm the existence of a subtle though distinctive resistivity anomaly structure at the CNE03 pockmark, suggesting a shallow anomaly at the chimney center, likely to result from the presence of gas hydrate. Furthermore, a deeper and latterly extensive resistivity anomaly emerged from the 2D inversions, most probably attributed to the existence of a free gas layer beneath the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ). This work will contribute to accurately estimate the amount of methane hydrate and free gas both at the pockmark level and over a larger regional scale, providing valuable information in light of the fact that there are more than 220 known gas hydrate deposits worldwide.",

Recent observations\nnow suggest that this suppression of power extends into the low chromosphere and is\nalso present in small magnetic elements far from active regions. We\nconstruct a model to investigate a possible mechanism of this power\nloss whereby p modes buffet small magnetic elements and excite MHD\nsausage tube waves. These magnetic tube waves propagate along the many\nmagnetic fibrils which are embedded in the convection zone and expand\ninto the chromosphere due to the fall in density with height of the\nsurrounding plasma. We treat the magnetic fibrils as vertically\naligned, thin flux tubes embedded in a two region polytropic-isothermal\natmosphere to study the coupling of p-mode driven sausage waves,\nwhich are excited in the convection zone and propagate into the\noverlying chromosphere. The excited tube waves carry energy away from\nthe p-mode cavity resulting in a deficit of p-mode energy which we\nquantify by computing the associated damping rate and absorption\ncoefficient of the driving p modes. We also compare the vertical\nmotion within the ﬁbril with the vertical motion of the incident p mode\nby constructing the ratio of their powers using HMI data and theory.\nIn agreement with observational measurements we ﬁnd that the total\npower is suppressed within strong magnetic elements for frequencies\nbelow the acoustic cut-off frequency. We also ﬁnd that the magnitude\nof the power deﬁcit increases with the height above the photosphere\nat which the measurement is made.

            "abstract": "The last transition from full glacial to current interglacial conditions was accompanied by distinct short-term climate fluctuations caused by changes in the global ocean circulation system. Most palaeoceanographic studies focus on the documentation of the behaviour of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the last deglaciation in response to freshwater forcing events. In this respect, the role of Arctic sea ice remained relatively unconsidered - primarily because of the difficulty of its reconstruction. Here we present new proxy data on late glacial (including the Last Glacial Maximum; LGM) and deglacial sea ice variability in the Arctic Ocean and its main gateway - the Fram Strait - and how these changes in sea ice coverage contributed to AMOC perturbations observed during Heinrich Event 1 and the Younger Dryas.\nRecurrent short-term advances and retreats of sea ice in Fram Strait, prior and during the LGM, are in line with a variable (or intermittent) North Atlantic heat flow along the eastern corridor of the Nordic Seas. Possibly in direct response to the initial freshwater discharge from melting continental ice-sheets, a permanent sea ice cover established only at about 19 ka BP (i.e. post-LGM) and lasted until 17.6 ka BP, when an abrupt break-up of this thick ice cover and a sudden discharge of huge amounts of sea ice and icebergs through Fram Strait coincided with the weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich Event 1. Similarly, another sea ice maximum at about 12.8 ka BP is associated with the slowdown of the AMOC during the Younger Dryas.\nThe new data sets clearly highlight the important role of Arctic sea ice for the re-organisation of the oceanographic setting in the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation. Further studies and sensitivity experiments to identify crucial driving (and feedback) mechanisms within the High Latitude ice-ocean-atmosphere system will contribute the understanding of rapid climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Most plate boundaries are activated obliquely with respect to the direction of far field stresses, and purely orthogonal systems are exceptional. The obliquity of these systems is controlled by (i) lateral rheological variations within the lithosphere and (ii) the geodynamics of the global plate circuit. Plate tectonics and magmatism drive rheological changes within the lithosphere and consequently influences strain localization. Geodynamical evolution controls large-scale mantle convection and plate re-organization, thus triggering plate kinematics variations, and the adjustment and re-orientation of far field stresses. These geological processes explain the localization of the strain along structures that are not perpendicular to the far field stresses direction. Here we present two natural examples of oblique boundary systems: (i) the Main Ethiopian Rift, which is a transtensive plate boundary between the Nubian and Somalian plates and (ii) the Sunda Subduction Zone, which is a transpressive boundary between the overriding Sunda plate and the subducting Australian plate.\nIn extensional oblique boundary systems, field data shows dip-slip faults indicating pure extension, irrespective of the fault strike with respect to the stress direction. This observation is in total disagreement with the commonly admitted theory, which states that during oblique extension, structures that are orthogonal to the stress direction show dip-slip kinematics, whereas the ones that are oblique to the stress direction show strike-slip kinematics.\nIn compressional oblique boundary systems, field investigations along plate-scale strike slip faults allow the identification of two domains, compressional and extensional, of diffuse strain. Here, the offset between theory and nature is also relevant, with the former stating that oblique convergence activates pure dip-slip in the subduction thrust and the development of a plate-scale strike-slip fault, and the latter showing a complex distributed strain pattern.\nWe should therefore aim at deepening our understanding on the mechanics of strain distribution and its controlling factors in oblique boundary systems, through detailed analyses of their inherited conditions, their kinematics and geodynamic evolution.",

An interpretation that the zone is an incipient Eurasian-Okhotsk plate boundary has been proposed, based on several large-magnitude earthquakes occurring in this zone during historic times. In this study we conducted a paleomagnetic and rock magnetic investigation of Plio-Pleistocene sediments of the Sasaoka Formation in northern Honshu, Japan, in order to test whether the compressional deformation is accompanied by rotation about a vertical axis. Despite the possible presence of magnetic iron-sulfides in fine clastic sediments, pre-folding remanent magnetization is confirmed by a bootstrap fold test and reversals test. Recognizable felsic tuffs mostly have stable remanent magnetization carried by magnetite. Site-mean remanent magnetization directions were determined for 23 sites, which cover an interval from ca. 2.7 Ma to 1.7 Ma on the basis of magnetostratigraphic correlation. The resultant overall mean direction is indistinguishable from the geocentric axial dipole field direction, suggesting no rotation. Comparison of this result with Plio-Pleistocene directions reported from other areas illuminates no detectable rotation in and adjacent to the deformation zone, except for local rotations along strike-slip faults.",

            "abstract": "The respective roles of an asteroid impact and Deccan Traps eruptions in biotic changes at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary are still debated. In many shallow marine sections around the world, the K-T boundary is marked by a distinct impact clay layer that is often underlain by a several decimeter-thick “white” low susceptibility zone. A previous study of the Gubbio section, Italy [Lowrie et al., 1990; EPSL, 98, 302-312], attributed the loss of coloration and low magnetization intensity in the white beds to post-depositional dissolution of ferrimagnetic minerals. Dissolution is thought to be a consequence of downward infiltration of reducing waters that resulted from rapid accumulation of organic matter produced by mass extinctions after the impact. We compared rock magnetic characteristics of the Gubbio section with those of the Bidart section in France. The two sections are similar in their carbonate lithology, presence of a boundary clay and low susceptibility zone. When compared to background Cretaceous sediments, the white zone in both sections is marked by an absence of biogenic magnetite, a decrease in total ferrimagnetic mineral content, and preferential loss of magnetite with respect to hematite - features that are consistent with reductive dissolution. However, unlike the Gubbio section, where the white zone starts immediately below the impact clay, at Bidart the low susceptibility zone and the clay layer are separated by a ~2 cm carbonate interval that contains abundant biogenic magnetite. Such separation casts doubt on a causal link between the impact and sediment bleaching. The white layer, thus, is more likely to record an episode of unusual bottom water chemistry that preceded the asteroid impact. A change in sea-water acidity associated with Deccan Traps volcanism may explain the magnetic mineral dissolution in the white beds.",

            "abstract": "Saturn’s moon Enceladus has a very active province at its south pole, where geysers of water vapor and ice emanate from warm tectonic ridges. This intense activity is probably the result of tidal stresses experienced by Enceladus as it moves around Saturn on a slightly eccentric orbit, and it suggests the presence of an internal water reservoir. Infra-red (VIMS, Hedman et al. Nature, 2013) and visible (ISS, Nimmo et al., Astronom. J 2014) observations showed an orbital modulation of the eruption activity, consistent with time varying stresses. However, the activity appears to be delayed by several hours with respect to the diurnal tides predicted for a global ocean and elastic response (Nimmo et al. Astronom. J. 2014). Here, by modeling the viscoelastic tidal response of Enceladus with a full three-dimensional model (Behounkova et al. Icarus 2012), we show that the delay in eruption activity is mostly controlled by the ocean size and the viscosity structure in the south polar region. Comparisons between modeled stress variations along faults and ISS and VIMS plume brightness data indicate that the observed activity is consistent with a regional sea, extending about 40-60◦ from the south pole at depth of 40 to 60 kilometers, consistent with Cassini gravity data (Iess et al. Science 2014), although viscoelastic solutions with a global ocean cannot be ruled out at the moment. Our calculations show that the tidally-controlled eruption activity requires a thin lithosphere (<5 km) in the south polar region and a warm ice mantle having a viscosity of about 1013-1014 Pa.s above the ocean area. Future observations will permit us to refine the interior models compatible with the data, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the internal structure and dynamics of Enceladus.",

            "abstract": "Deformation analysis plays an important role for human life safety; hence investigating the reliability of the obtained results from deformation analysis is crucial. The deformation monitoring network is established and the observations are analyzed periodically. The main problem in the deformation analysis is that if there is more than one displaced point in the monitoring network, the analysis methods smear the disturbing effects of the displaced points over all other points which are not displaced. Therefore, only one displaced point can be detected successfully. The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) gives opportunity to prevent smearing effect of the displaced points. In this study, we have simulated a monitoring network that consisting four object points and generated six different scenarios. The displacements were added to the points by using a device that the GPS antenna was easily moved horizontally and the seven hours static GPS measurements were carried out. The measurements were analyzed by using online\nAutomatic Precise Positioning Service\n(APPS) to obtain the coordinates and covariance matrices. The results of the APPS were used in the deformation analysis. The detected points and true displaced points were compared with each other to obtain reliability of the method. According to the results, the analysis still detect stable points as displaced points. For the next step, we are going to search the reason of the wrong results and deal with acquiring more reliable results. ",

            "abstract": "A good understanding of the interrelations of a typical land use pattern was essential for ecosystem management and water resources distribution in arid inland river basin. This study was conducted to compare the soil water content and explore the hydrological relation of a cropland-treebelt-desert system at the oasis-desert ecotone in the middle of China’s Heihe River Basin. Volumetric soil water content, the relationship between treebelt water use characteristics and groundwater, and plant root distribution were measured. The results showed that the mean volumetric soil water content in the 0-200 cm layer was greater in the cropland (8.88%) than that in the treebelt (5.78%) and desert (4.37%) as a result of frequent irrigation events. However, the cropland had noticeably lower mean volumetric soil water content below 200 cm depth (14.27%), compared to treebelt (18.07%) and desert (17.30%) with deeper roots to suck up groundwater. Groundwater table had negative impact on tree transpiration. The contribution of groundwater to tree transpiration was estimated to be 35.1% and 19.0% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The great precipitation in 2013 weakened the dependence of tree transpiration on groundwater. The hydrological relation between treebelt and cropland in the upper soil layer was mainly occurred by treebelt root water uptake from cropland. The biomass of fine treebelt root extended into the cropland decreased logarithmically with the distance from the cropland-treebelt interface, which resulted in the smaller volumetric soil water content in the cropland with more proximity to the treebelt. Meanwhile, the threshold distance of cropland irrigation influencing the tree transpiration was about 8 m. The hydrological relation in the lower soil layer among cropland-treebelt-desert was caused by groundwater recharge, as cropland irrigation raised up the groundwater level to replenish the deep soil layer. The percolation in the cropland was an important water source for the growth of treebelt and desert plants.",

            "abstract": "The collection of H2O-CO2-SO2 volcanic gas datasets at open-vent basaltic volcanoes has increased since the introduction of electrochemical/NDIR (Multi-GAS) instruments in the field. An open problem remains to understand the degassing regime of volcanoes of intermediate compositions, which is complicated by wide range of eruption styles. We propose here to initiate the study of the degassing regime of Telica and San Cristobal (Nicaragua), two constantly monitored volcanoes in the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA). We calculated the CO2 flux sustained by summit plume degassing at Telica and San Cristobal as the product of the CO2/SO2 ratio of Multi-GAS technique with parallel SO2 flux measurements, made by using scanning UV-DOAS instruments in 2013. At Telica, the CO2 flux was evaluated at 166±76 t/d and at San Cristobal we measured 520±260 t/d. Degassing activity at Telica volcano consists in surface gas discharges dominated by H2O (70-98 mol%; mean of 92 mol%), and by CO2 (1-23 mol%; mean of 6 mol%) and SO2 (0.5-7.4 mol%; mean of 2.9 mol%). San Cristobal gas is dominated by H2O (85-97 mol%; mean of 92 mol%), and by CO2 (2-12 mol%; mean of 6 mol%) and SO2 (3-5 mol%; mean of 3.8 mol%). These values are typical of volcanic arc regions and the volcanoes were in a stage of quiescent degassing without excess of CO2 output relatively to the other major gases. By interpreting our recent gas measurements in tandem with preliminary melt inclusion records of pre-eruptive dissolved volatile abundances, we hope to build a conceptual degassing model taking into account the active degassing regimes during past volcanic eruptions. Finally, we hope to refine the CO2 budget estimates along the CAVA.",

These interviews will be coupled with a structured course of hazard education in the Geography syllabus; the students not taking Geography will form a control group. To avoid distortion of our results arising from the developing verbalization and literacy skills of the students over the 5 years of the project, we have adapted the PRISM tool used in clinical practice to assess patient perceptions of illness and treatment (Buchi & Sensky, 1999). This novel measure is essentially non-verbal, and uses spatial positions of moveable markers (“object” markers) on a board, relative to a fixed marker that represents the subject’s “self”, as a visual metaphor for the importance of the object to the subject. The subjects also explain their reasons for placing the markers as they have, to provide additional qualitative information. The PRISM method thus produces data on the perceptions measured on the board that can be subjected to statistical analysis, and also succinct qualitative data about each subject. Our study will gather data on participants’ perceptions of different natural hazards, different sources of information about these, and organizations or individuals to whom they would go for help in a disaster, and investigate how these vary with geographical and social factors. To illustrate the method, which is generalisable, we present results from our initial interviews of the cohort of 11 year olds whom we will follow through their secondary school education.\nBüchi, S., & Sensky, T.

            "abstract": "We used two “vintages” of ambient seismic noise recorded at the Valhall Life of the Field Seismic network in 2004 and 2005 to perform a passive time-lapse imaging of the subsurface. First, the cross-correlations between each pair of stations were computed for both vintages to extract Scholte waves. Second, the relative velocity variations between the 2004 and 2005 cross-correlations were measured on the ballistic waves using the Moving-Window Cross-Spectral technique. Finally, the best-quality relative velocity variation measurements were regionalized using a modified eikonal tomography technique. The results, albeit noisy because of the short duration of the available records, show a large patch of increased seismic velocity in the southern part of the network and a weaker anomaly in the northern part. The increase of velocity can be attributed to the subsidence caused by the exploitation of the flanks of the Valhall reservoir with new wells. Our results are in good agreement with other time-lapse results using Scholte waves from active or passive datasets. The proposed technique could be used for continuous monitoring of the hydrocarbon reservoir under exploitation and of the CO2 sequestration sites.",

They put constraints on the topographic evolution, volume and stable isotope contents of LIS, thus on LGM ocean volume and isotopic composition. Here, we re-visit field-based information about Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) dynamics in the Hudson Bay and Strait area, from the LGM to its final decay, and confront this information with deep-sea core records from Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea. Core HU08-029-004 raised off Hudson Strait points to continuous in Hudson Strait throughout the whole interval, with acceleration during Heinrich (H) events 2 and 1, possibly triggered (at least for H1) by a delayed LGM-glacio-isostatic response. Streaming sediment supplies from Hudson Strait are recorded by fine detrital carbonates, without evidence of Foxe Basin sediment sources, thus suggesting streaming from the Ungava Peninsula and southern Baffin Island. Later on, in southern Hudson Bay, the Cochrane surges (~8.7 ka BP) illustrate fast ice streaming southwards, mostly from the Keewatin ice-divide, into Lake Agassiz-Ojibway. Ice-thinning in the Bay and the Foxe Basin areas led to the lake final drainage through Hudson Strait, and its replacement by the Tyrrell Sea (~8.3 ka BP). In Baffin Bay, out of phase surgings, mostly from the Inuitian and Greenland ice sheets, are similarly recorded. These new data and re-interpretation of earlier information corroborate the concept of a dynamic (ice-stream prevalent) North American Ice complex during the Late Wisconsin as evident in recent glaciological reconstructions. This along with recent data-calibrated glaciological reconstructions for the other major ice sheets result in a global shortfall of at least 10m compared to far field relative sea-level records.",

            "abstract": "High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems are composed of a bipole transmission line with a converter substation at each end. Each substation may be equipped with a HVDC ground electrode, which is a wide area (up to 1 km Ø) and deep (from 3 to 100m) electrical grounding. When in normal operation, the ground electrode will dissipate in the soil the unbalance of the bipole (~1.5% of the rated current). When in monopolar operation with ground return, the HVDC electrode will inject in the soil the nominal pole continuous current, of about 2000 to 3000 Amperes, continuously for a period up to a few hours.\nHVDC ground electrodes site selection is a work based on extensive geophysical and geological surveys, in order to attend the desired design requirements established for the electrodes, considering both its operational conditions (maximum soil temperature, working life, local soil voltage gradients etc.) and the interference effects on the installations located up to 50 km away.\nThis poster presents the geophysical investigations conducted primarily for the electrodes site selection, and subsequently for the development of the crust resistivity model, which will be used for the interference studies.\nA preliminary site selection is conducted, based on general geographical and geological criteria. Subsequently, the geology of each chosen area is surveyed in detail, by means of electromagnetic/electrical geophysical techniques, such as magnetotelluric (deep), TDEM (near-surface) and electroresistivity (shallow). Other complementary geologic and geotechnical surveys are conducted, such as wells drilling (for geotechnical characterization, measurement of the water table depth and water flow, and electromagnetic profiling), and soil and water sampling (for measurement of thermal parameters and evaluation of electrosmosis risk).\nThe site evaluation is a dynamic process along the surveys, and some sites will be discarded. For the two or three final sites, the inversion of the combined deep, near-surface and shallow apparent resistivity curves, results in the layered crust resistivity models. These models will allow for the preliminary interference studies, that will result on the selection of the final electrode site (one for each converter substation).",

            "abstract": "Near infrared remote sensing data of Mars have revealed thousands of ancient, astrobiologically interesting deposits of Fe/Mg-rich smectitic clay minerals within the crust. Diagnostic (Fe,Mg)-OH infrared spectroscopic absorptions used to interpret the mineralogy of these clays occur at (λ=) 2.27-2.32 μm, indicating variable Fe/Mg ratios in the clay structures. Using a suite of Fe/Mg-rich seafloor clays as a mineralogical and spectroscopic analog for Martian clays, we show how crystal chemical substitution and mixed-layering affect the position of the diagnostic metal-OH feature in smectitic clays. We show how substitution of divalent cations such as Fe2+ and Mg2+ into dioctahedral clays predictably affects the placement of the metal-OH absorptions used to interpret the composition of smectitic clays from remote sensing data. The effect of substitution of trivalent cations (chiefly Fe3+) into trioctahedral clays is less pronounced, but discernable. Taken together, we are able to constrain the actual composition, especially the Fe/Mg ratio of Martian smectitic clays from near infrared data. We show how these clays, detected from orbit, fall into four groups. We compare the Fe/Mg ratios of each of these groups with the Fe/Mg ratios of various candidate source materials, such as olivines and pyroxenes in Martian meteorites. One of these groups of clays has similar chemistry to candidate protoliths, consistent with little segregation of Fe with respect to Mg compared to potential protoliths. The other three groups suggest significant segregation, indicating Mg-mobility in what was likely open-system alteration. We propose that these differences are related to oxidative, open system weathering in groups 1-3, and reduced, closed system hydrothermal alteration in the case of group 4.\nFigure caption: The sample suite of analog materials studied here includes pure nontronite as well as mixed layer (or interstratified) glauconite-nontronite, talc-saponite, and talc-nontronite.

            "abstract": "Interpretation of push-pull data is limited by the absence of a clearly defined length scale, information on subsurface heterogeneity, and the assumption that ambient flow is negligible. We address these issues through a series of push-pull experiments with saline and deionized tracers at a granitic experimental research site in Ploemeur, France. The experiments involve different injection fractures, chaser volumes and resting times. Monitoring is performed in a neighboring borehole (~6m away) by single-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR), in both moving and fixed antenna settings. The GPR borehole is isolated from the tracer using a flexible-liner. We clearly image the dominant fractures in which tracer transport takes place and the spatial extent of the tracer plume at different times, which varies from a few meters to more than 10 meters away from the injection point. The differences between time-lapse images are subtle and consistent and in good agreement with the concentration data. We identify fractures in which the tracer is trapped for longer time periods and postulate that these fractures are partly responsible for the observed tailing behavior. By increasing the chasing volume, we see the tracer moving further away from the injection point and occupying different fractures, but our ability to image the tracer retrieval is decreased. By varying the resting time of a given experiment we identify regions of density-driven flow, heterogeneous advection, and ambient flow. Deionized water minimizes density effects, but the response is more quickly attenuated compared with saline tracers. The fixed antenna acquisitions provide data of unprecedented quality that display temporal dynamics in agreement with the concentration data down to very low concentrations. This data set offers very exciting perspectives for coupled hydrogeophysical inversion aimed at understanding anomalous transport in fractured rock formations.",

            "abstract": "Field evidence of the River Mahakam reveals autogenic scour and channel widening in a series of sharp bends. An integral analysis of a 300 km reach of the river is presented, including a comprehensive survey of the river banks, delineation of the river corridor from radar observations, Large Eddy Simulations of observed flow patterns, and a geometric analysis of planform and depth information. Scour depths strongly exceed what can be expected based on existing understanding of sharp bends, and are highly correlated with curvature. Histograms of the occurrence of erosive, stable, advancing, and bar-type banks as a function of curvature quantify the switch from a mildly curved bend regime to a sharp bend regime. In mild bends, outer banks erode and inner banks advance. In sharp bends the erosion pattern inverts. Outer banks stabilize or advance, while inner banks erode. In sharply curved river bends, bars occur near the outer banks that become less erosive for higher curvatures. Inner banks become more erosive for higher curvatures, but nevertheless accommodate the larger portion of exposed bars. Soil processes may play a crucial role in the formation of sharp bends, which is inferred from iron and manganese concretions observed in the riverbanks, indicating ferric horizons and early stages of the formation of plinthic horizons. Historical topographic maps show the planform activity of the river is low, which may relate to the scours slowing down planimetric development. The occurrence of exceptionally deep scours is attributed to downﬂow near the scour exceeding 12 cm/s, increasing the bed shear stress. The downflow, in turn, is explained from the cross-sectional area increase, which is shown to be important in generating adverse surface gradients driving flow recirculation in the Large Eddy Simulations. Strong secondary ﬂow distorts the vertical pressure distribution that is no longer hydrostatic. The downﬂow advects longitudinal momentum, moving the core of the ﬂow to the bed of the channel.",

In analysing the data, we looked at two characteristics – occurance dates, and epicenter latitudes. We calculated the power spectrum Sd(f) for occurance dates, and found that this spectrum can be approximated by the function Cfα, where α<0, Figure 1b. To interpret the data, we have also shown a graph of Ln(fα), Figure 1c. This graph shows that the exponent α is not a constant, but varies with the frequency. In addition, we calculated the power spectrum for epicenter latitudes Sl(f), Figure 1d, and found that this spectrum can be similarly approximated by the function Cfβ, where β<0. As with the occurance dates, we show a graph of Ln(fβ), Figure 1e, which indicates that β also varies with the frequency. This result is quite different from the well-known Gutenberg-Richter “frequency-magnitude” relation represented in bilogatithmic coordinates by a straight line. Coefficients α and β vary approximately from -2.5 to -1.5, depending on the “length” of the calculated spectrum subset used to plot the trend line. Based on the fact that the power spectrum has the form Cfα, -2.5<α<-1.5, we conclude that a long-time and long-distance correlation exists between earthquakes in the Eastern Pacific Tectonic Belt. In this work, we present an interpretation of the regularities in the spatial and temporal distribution of earthquakes in the Eastern Pacific Tectonic Belt.

            "abstract": "Observed Arctic warming has been projected to continue in this century. Permafrost degradation is thus expected to continue, exposing large amounts of carbon for decomposition. Dynamics of Arctic landscape and hydrology are complicated due to changing climate and thawing permafrost, affecting the carbon biogeochemical cycling in the region. Further, human activities together with changing climate transform the regional land use and land cover, including wildfires, logging, and agricultural land conversion. This presentation will review the effects of factors, controls, and processes as well as landscape types (e.g., forests vs. lakes) on carbon biogeochemistry based on regional modeling studies and observations. Specific effects on carbon dynamics to be discussed will include: 1) thawing permafrost; 2) fire disturbances; 2) atmospheric carbon dioxide; 3) inorganic and organic nitrogen uptake by plants; 4) priming; 5) aerobic and anaerobic organic matter decomposition; and 6) various complexities of microbial physiology of soils. Partitioning the contribution of these processes to regional carbon dynamics shall help us improve the terrestrial biogeochemistry models, an important component of Earth System Models that are used to project our future climate.",

            "abstract": "Many investigations currently show that the pore fluid pressure has been observed to influence the thrust fault strength and slip behavior and updip limit of the seismogenic zone. Clay dehydration is one key control on overpressure generation under undrained condition in thermal pressurization processes. Increasing pressure and temperature with depth depending on the local geological setting and conditions can cause clay dehydration which has been proposed as an explanation for the generation of overpressure. However, study about the effect of excess pore pressure caused by clay dehydration on the triggering of earthquake is seldom addressed in Taiwan. The fault zones in Taiwan like the Chelungpu Fault, clay minerals are abundant in the fault gouge. Therefore, to quantify the effect of overpressure caused by clay dehydration on the triggering of earthquake under undrained condition, we adopt the chemical kinetic model to calculate the amount of water expelled from clay dehydration; derive the three-dimensional governing equation of groundwater flow with clay dehydration varied with pressure and temperature, and simplify a one-dimensional analytical solution of overpressure in fault zones; follow the Coulomb-Mohr frictional failure model of earthquake occurrence to evaluate the influence of the pore pressure on the change of effective Coulomb stress. The results show that the overpressure is greater than the value of 0.01 MPa in fault zones derived from one-dimensional analytical solution. However, Coulomb stress increases of ≥0.01 MPa have been shown to be associated with seismicity rate increase and in many cases triggering earthquakes. Therefore the result denotes that the triggering of earthquake will be progressed. The result could prove to be a feasible examining tool for evaluation of overpressure influence on triggering of earthquake, especially when considering faults with abundant clay minerals of smectite.",

            "abstract": "Tundra burning is emerging as a key process in the rapidly changing Arctic, and knowledge of tundra fire-regime responses to climate change is essential for projecting Earth system dynamics. This presentation will focus on climate-fire relationships in the Arctic, spatiotemporal patterns of Holocene tundra burning, and the effects of tundra burning on carbon cycling.\nAnalysis of historical records reveals that across the Arctic, tundra burning occurred primarily in areas where mean summer temperature exceeded 9 °C and total summer precipitation was below 115 mm. In Alaska, summer temperature and precipitation explain >90% of the interannual variability in tundra area burned from AD 1950-2009, with thresholds of 10.5 °C and 140 mm. These patterns imply tipping points in tundra fire-regime responses to climate change.\nThe frequency of tundra fires has varied greatly across space and through time. Approximately 1.0% of the circum-Arctic tundra burned from AD 2002-2013, and 4.5% of the Alaskan tundra burned from AD 1950-2009. The latter encompassed ecoregions with fire rotation periods ranging from ~400 to 13,640 years. Charcoal analysis of lake sediments also shows that Arctic tundra can sustain a wide range of fire regimes. Fires were rare on the Alaskan North Slope throughout the Holocene, implying that the climate thresholds evident in the historical records have seldom been crossed. In contrast, in areas of NW Alaska, tundra has burned regularly at 100-250 year intervals during the late Holocene.\nTundra burning may cause sudden releases of the enormous amount of Arctic soil C. Charcoal particles from recent burns yielded 14C ages of AD 1952-2006. Thus the C consumed in recent fires may recover through vegetation succession. However, our results suggest that in areas that have burned multiple times in recent decades, old soil C is vulnerable to future fires.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale weather models have increasingly been featured in wind resource assessment development. The incorporation of real meteorological conditions into such assessments allow a more realistic, physical determination of the wind loads that will be experienced within a wind farm site. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) confers the advantage of representing finer scale turbulence, such as wake effects. However, nesting LES within real mesoscale simulations is still in the nascent stage of development. One of the difficulties lies in providing accurate mesoscale forcing boundaries for the LES domain. This study aims to characterize the mesoscale variability in WRF to lay the groundwork for future mesoscale-LES nested simulations.\nA low-level jet (LLJ) event that was observed during the CBLAST-Low 2001 campaign (07 Aug to 09 Aug) provides a robust case study to test the capabilities of and characterize the mesoscale variabilities in WRF. The dynamical interaction of a frontal passage with a stable boundary layer over a coastal region makes this an interesting and challenging case for real mesoscale simulation and future LES nested simulations.\nSensitivities to vertical resolution, PBL schemes and initial forcing datasets were tested. This presentation will describe and explain the factors that influence the simulation of this frontal passage and the resulting LLJ. The initial forcing datasets have a major influence on spatial and temporal characteristics, as seen in Figure 1, introducing larger differences than the PBL schemes do. Furthermore, the mesoscale simulation also showed a strong dependence on the vertical resolution: increasing the vertical resolution within the atmospheric boundary layer resulted in a more accurate vertical profile for wind speed. Lastly, the simulations did show a dependency on the PBL scheme selected however, the variability between PBL schemes were not large, especially compared to the variability introduced by the boundary and initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "The energy budget of earthquakes is a question of significant fundamental and practical interest. Using rate-and-state fault models that produce earthquake sequences, we focus on exploring the breakdown energy portion G of this budget and its relation to stress drop in events over a range of magnitudes. We focus on understanding which models can reproduce the observation that breakdown energy increases with increasing magnitude, but stress drop appears to be magnitude-invariant.\nWe begin with simulations with pure rate-and-state friction and study how breakdown energy changes with characteristic slip distance L of rate-and-state friction, a parameter often selected based on numerical tractability. We explore values of L ranging two orders of magnitude and calculate breakdown energy G for events with various amounts of slip. The values of G in our simulations are similar to those of natural earthquakes. However, we find nearly-constant values of G across a range of slips for a given L, as well as decreasing G with smaller values of L, as expected based on prior studies. Hence simulations with laboratory-like values of L (0.01-0.1 mm), necessary for producing microseismicity, would result in breakdown energies too small for large events, compared with observations.\nWe then proceed to a model utilizing dynamic weakening due to thermal pressurization of pore fluid within the fault core. Co-seismic weakening through mechanisms such as thermal pressurization can explain the trend of increasing breakdown energy with magnitude as shown by Rice (JGR, 2006) in a simplified slip model. Our goal is to explore this result in fully dynamic simulations that produce a series of seismic events of different sizes, and investigate whether it can be reconciled with the magnitude-invariant stress drop. We find that our sequences are able to capture the trend of increasing breakdown energy with increasing magnitude while also displaying roughly magnitude-invariant stress drops for a range of the smaller magnitude events. Our current work is directed towards studying the stress drops for the largest, model-spanning events, which can be smaller, larger, or similar depending on the model assumptions.",

The results show that trade is facilitating the concentration of pollution in less economically developed areas, which in turn export pollution-intensive goods to more affluent areas.

            "abstract": "Glaciers have affected profoundly the growth, collapse, preservation, and possibly, eruptive behavior of Quaternary stratovolcanoes in Alaska. Holocene alpine glaciers have acted as effective agents of erosion on volcanoes north of ~55 °N and especially north of 60 °N. Cook Inlet volcanoes are particularly vulnerable as they sit atop rugged intrusive basement as high as 3000 m asl. Holocene glaciers have swept away or covered most of the deposits and dome lavas of frequently active Redoubt (60.5 °N); carved through the flanks of Spurr’s active vent, Crater Peak (61.3 °N); and all but obscured the edifice of Hayes (61.6 °N), whose Holocene eruptive history is known almost exclusively though far-traveled tephra and flowage deposits. Relationships between Pleistocene eruptive histories, determined by high-precision Ar-Ar dating of lava flows, and marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 2–8 (Bassinot et al., 1994, EPSL, v. 126, p. 91­–108) vary with a volcano’s latitude, size, and elevation. At Spurr, 26 ages cluster in interglacial periods. At Redoubt, 28 ages show a more continual eruptive pattern from the end of MIS 8 to the present, with a slight apparent increase in output following MIS 6, and almost no preservation before 220 ka. Veniaminof (56.2 °N) and Emmons (55.5°N), large, broad volcanoes with bases near sea level, had voluminous eruptive episodes during the profound deglaciations after MIS 8 and MIS 6. At Akutan (54.1 °N), many late Pleistocene lavas show evidence for ice contact; ongoing dating will be able to pinpoint ice thicknesses. Furthest south and west, away from thick Pleistocene ice on the Alaska Peninsula and mainland, the Tanaga volcanic cluster (51.9 °N) has a relatively continuous eruptive record for the last 200 k.y. that shows no clear-cut correlation with glacial cycles, except a possible hiatus during MIS 6. Finally, significant edifice collapse features have been temporally linked with deglaciations. A ~10-km3 debris-avalanche deposit from Spurr directly overlies bedrock, suggesting that edifice collapse closely followed MIS 2. The geologic history of Veniaminof suggests possible massive edifice collapse following MIS 6. A stack of westward-dipping lavas and breccias on the east flank of Redoubt Volcano erupted during MIS 6, and may have also failed during the major deglaciation of MIS 5.5.",

            "abstract": "Black shales underlying the areas from Eastern Ohio, through Pennsylvania, and into Central New York State have become of economic interest lately due to the recent economic viability of shale gas extraction. Sulfide minerals such as pyrite and marcasite occurring in these shales are often the primary phases that trace metals are associated with. Trace metals can be incorporated into these sulfides via various pathways during initial shale deposition and secondary diagenesis including substitution for Fe (Co and Ni), substitution for S (As and Se), and excluded to form other sulfide phases (Cu and Zn). The manner in which these trace metals are incorporated directly influences how they are released into the environment during sulfide oxidation following shale weathering or hydraulic fracturing. The aim of this research is to examine the distribution of trace metals in iron sulfides from black shales using Synchrotron-based X-ray microprobe techniques including micro-X-ray fluorescence and micro-X-ray diffraction of shale thin sections. Marcellus Shale samples were collected from: (1) outcrops from the Oatka member in Leroy, NY and Jersey Shore, PA and the Union Springs member in Lewiston, PA, and (2) drilling core sample from Beaver Meadow, NY and Hancock Co, TN (Chattanooga shale). Analyses have shown that the sulfide grains are a combination of pyrite and marcasite. As and Se are spatially correlated with each other and within the pyrite grains. Ni is spatially correlated with larger euhedral pyrite, as well as smaller non-iron sulfide grains. Cu and Zn are not spatially correlated with the pyrite and form separate Cu- and Zn- sulfides. During iron sulfide oxidative dissolution, these differences in distribution of trace metals will affect the order and rate in which they are released into the environment.",

            "abstract": "We design an earthquake detection and location algorithm that explores coherence and characteristic behavior of teleseismic body waves recorded by a large-scale seismic network. The procedure consists of three steps. First, for every tested source location we construct a time-distance gather by computing great-circle distances to all stations of the network and aligning the signals respectively. Second, we use the constructed gather to compute a Tau-P transform. For waves emitted by teleseismic sources, the amplitude of this transform has a very characteristic behavior with maxima corresponding to different seismic phases. Relative location of these maxima on the time-slowness plane strongly depends on the distance to the earthquake. To explore this dependence, in a third step, we convolve the Tau-P amplitude with a time slowness-filter filter whose maxima are computed based on prediction of global travel-time calculator (Buland and Chapman, 1983). As a result of this three-step procedure, we obtain a function that characterizes a likelihood of occurrence of a seismic event in a given position in space and time. We test the developed algorithm by applying it to continuous vertical-component seismograms of USArray recorded during 2010.",

            "abstract": "We develop a conceptual model of the closely co-dependent Bering shelf, Bering Strait, and Chukchi shelf circulation fields by evaluating the effects of wind stress over the North Pacific and western Arctic. This conceptual model suggests Bering Strait transport anomalies are primarily set by the longitudinal location of the Aleutian Low, which drives oppositely signed anomalies at synoptic and annual time scales. Synoptic time scale variations in shelf currents result from local wind forcing and remotely generated continental shelf waves, whereas annual variations are driven by basin scale adjustments to wind stress that alter the magnitude of the along-strait (meridional) pressure gradient. In particular, we show that storms centered over the Bering Sea excite continental shelf waves on the eastern Bering shelf that carry northward velocity anomalies northward through Bering Strait and along the Chukchi coast. The integrated effect of these storms tends to decrease the northward Bering Strait transport at annual to decadal time scales by imposing cyclonic wind stress curl over the Aleutian Basin and the Western Subarctic Gyre. Ekman suction then increases the water column density through isopycnal uplift, thereby decreasing the dynamic height, sea surface height, and along-strait pressure gradient. Storms displaced eastward over the Gulf of Alaska generate an opposite set of Bering shelf and Aleutian Basin responses. While Ekman pumping controls Canada Basin dynamic heights [Proshutinsky et al., 2002], we do not find evidence for a strong relation between Beaufort Gyre sea surface height variations and the annually averaged Bering Strait throughflow. Over the western Chukchi and East Siberian seas easterly winds promote coastal divergence, which also increases the along-strait pressure head, as well as generates shelf waves that impinge upon Bering Strait from the northwest.",

            "abstract": "An important objective of NASA's STEREO mission has been to understand the mechanisms responsible for the transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) between the solar corona and 1 AU. For 3He-rich SEP events, in which particle acceleration is believed to be associated with a relatively small magnetic-reconnection region, it had been thought that the longitudinal distribution of particles arriving at 1 AU should be relatively narrow and single-spacecraft studies had been used to infer a standard deviation in longitude of about 20 degrees. However, measurements on ACE and STEREO showed that some 3He-rich SEP events are observable over a much broader range of longitudes. Whether the longitudinal spreading of the particles in these events occurs in the solar corona or in interplanetary space has not yet been conclusively established. It was originally anticipated that the twin STEREO spacecraft would be able to investigate the longitudinal transport problem as they began separating from one another shortly after their 2006 launch. However, during the long, quiet minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 there were hardly any 3He-rich events on which to base such studies. The longitudinal separation of the two spacecraft on the back side of the Sun is now less than 35 degrees and decreasing, making it possible to carry out the studies that could not be done in 2007-2009. Although frequent detections of individual 3He-rich events at both spacecraft have become common, there are still instances where an event is clearly observed at one spacecraft but not detected at the other. We will report results from a study in which we investigate the particle transport by determining the characteristics of events observed at both spacecraft and comparing with the corresponding characteristics of events that are observable at only one of the two. These results are expected to aid in the development of SEP transport models that can be used for predicting the characteristics of events that will be observed by the Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions.",

            "abstract": "Human biases and heuristics reflect adaptation over our evolutionary past to frequently experienced situations that affected our survival and that provided sharp distinguished feedbacks at the level of the individual. Human behavior, however, is not well adapted to the more diffusely experienced (i.e. less immediately/locally acute) problems and issues that scientists and society often seek to address today. Several human biases are identified that affect how science is conducted and used. These biases include an innate discounting of less visible phenomena/systems and of long-term perspectives; as well as a general lack of consideration of the coupling between the resources that we use and the waste that we consequently produce. Other biases include strong beliefs in human exceptionalism and separatedness from “nature”. Francis Bacon (The New Organon, 1620) provided a classification of the factors, of the “idols of the mind”, that bias pursuit of greater knowledge. How can we address these biases and the factors that affect behaviour and pursuit of knowledge; and ultimately impact the sustainability and resilience of human societies, resources and environments? A process for critical analysis is proposed that solicits explicit accounting and cognizance of these potential human biases and factors. Seeking a greater diversity of independant perspectives is essential: in both the conduct of science and in its application to the management of natural resources and environments. Accountability, traceability and structured processes are critical in this endeavor. The scientific methods designed during the industrial revolution are necessary, but insufficient, in addressing the issues of today. A new area of study in “the behavioral biogeosciences” is suggested that counters, or at least closely re-evaluates, our normal (i.e. adapted) human priorities of observation and study, as well as our judgements and decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Reconnection with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the dayside magnetosphere opens the previously closed Earth’s field line, allowing solar wind particles to enter the magnetosphere, some of which precipitate into the ionosphere. As the open-field line ExB convects to the nightside, fewer ions can enter the magnetosphere. As a result, field-aligned (parallel) electric potential increases with latitude to prevent more electrons from entering, in order to maintain charge quasi-neutrality. The APL open-field line model predicts that the parallel potential drop increases from cusp to mantle to polar rain. This trend has been confirmed in a study that compared phase space densities of ACE solar wind electrons to those of DMSP precipitating electrons. However, the same study also found that sometimes there is an anomaly: the parallel potential drop would have the opposite polarity such that solar wind electrons are accelerated downward in the afternoon polar cap. Using DMSP magnetometer and particle precipitation data, we show that this accelerating potential drop can be found often in the poleward upward field-aligned current region. The velocity shear at the magnetopause boundary leads to a voltage drop across the boundary, which drives the upward field-aligned currents. At higher latitude or further away from noon, the field line maps to the magnetopause location that is further down the magnetotail where the magnetosheath velocity shear is higher and density is lower. When the velocity shear and hence field-aligned current density (J//) is too high or density too low, parallel potential develops to accelerate more electron downward, in accordance with Knight relation.",

            "abstract": "Forest, wetland, lake and tundra ecosystems of northern ecoclimatic regions are undergoing rapid changes in extent and spatial distribution in response to increasingly warmer air temperatures. Through various feedback mechanisms these changes are projected to have consequences for how northern ecoclimatic regions function as part of the climate system. A wealth of studies has documented a northward shift of the treeline into areas presently occupied by tundra. This expansion in forest cover is contrasted by a decline in forest cover along the southern limit of permafrost where forest with degrading permafrost is replaced by permafrost-free, treeless wetlands and lakes. Both types of land cover change are expected to alter the surface energy balance and thus regional climate given the distinct differences in surface characteristics between forests and tundra, and between forests and wetlands. We measured latent and sensible heat fluxes using the eddy covariance technique together with net radiation and ground heat fluxes as part of an evolving meso-network of micrometeorological towers in the Northwest Territories. Experiencing similar meteorological conditions each, one pair of instrumentation was installed over a “northerly” boreal forest (68° 19’ N; 133° 31’ W) and a nearby tundra site (68° 44’ N; 133° 31’ W) and one pair over a “southerly” boreal forest-wetland and a nested wetland site (61° 18’ N; 121° 18’ W). Here, we contrast differences in surface characteristics and energy balance components between northerly boreal forest expansion and southerly increasing wetland cover to discuss respective implications for regional climate in northwestern Canada. Peak sensible heat fluxes at the tundra and wetland sites were ~150 W m-2 and ~200 W m-2 smaller than at the paired boreal forest and boreal forest-wetland sites, respectively. Differences in latent heat fluxes during the snow cover period were negligible. The tundra and wetland sites showed ~100 W m-2 and ~50 W m-2 higher peak latent heat fluxes, respectively, compared to their corresponding boreal forest and boreal forest-wetland sites. These results suggest that the warming trend along the southern limit of permafrost might be attenuated, whereas additional regional warming might occur through the northward shift of the treeline.",

            "abstract": "Southern Arizona and New Mexico receive 40-60% of their annual rainfall in the summer, as part of the North American Monsoon (NAM). Modeling studies suggest that 15-25% of this rainfall first falls on Mexican land, is transpired by vegetation, and subsequently is transported northward across the border to the US. The main source regions in Mexico include two primary landcover types in Sonora and Sinaloa: subtropical scrub and tropical deciduous forests in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental; and large expanses of irrigated agriculture along the Gulf of California. The foothill ecosystems, known for their rapid greening and large transpiration rates at the onset of the monsoon, are under threat from deforestation for grazing activities. On the other hand, irrigated agriculture in both the winter and summer has shifted the seasonality of evaporative fluxes and introduced socio-economic factors into their interannual variability and predictability. In this study, we examine the differences in spatial and temporal characteristics of evapotranspiration yielded by current and pre-industrial land cover / land use. To this end, we employ the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model at 1/16 degree resolution, driven by gridded meteorological observations and MODIS LAI, NDVI, and albedo products, across the NAM region (Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico). We compare the magnitude and timing of land-atmosphere fluxes given by both pre-industrial and current land cover/use, as well as the land cover under several possible alternative land use scenarios. We identify the regions where the largest changes in magnitude and timing of evapotranspiration have occurred, as well as the regions and land use changes that could produce the largest changes in future evapotranspiration under different scenarios. Finally, we explore the consequences these effects have for the predictability of monsoon moisture transport.",

            "abstract": "We describe a conceptual framework for Citizen Science that can be applied to improve the understanding and management of natural resources and environments. For us, Citizen Science represents an engagement from members of the public, usually volunteers, in collaboration with paid professionals and technical experts to observe and understand natural resources and environments for the benefit of science and society. Our conceptual framework for Citizen Science includes crowdsourcing of observations (or sampling). It considers a wide range of activities, including volunteer and professional monitoring (e.g. weather and climate variables, water availability and quality, phenology, biota, image capture and remote sensing), as well as joint fact finding and analyses, and participatory mapping and modeling. Spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the biophysical processes that control natural resources and environments are taken into account within this conceptual framework, as are the availability, scaling and diversity of tools and efforts that are needed to properly describe these biophysical processes. Opportunities are sought within the framework to properly describe, QA/QC, archive, and make readily accessible, the large amounts of information and traceable knowledge required to better understand and manage natural resources and environments. The framework also considers human motivational needs, primarily through a modern version of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. We examine several USGS-based Citizen Science efforts within the context of our framework, including the project called “iCoast – Did the Coast Change?”, to understand the utility of the framework, its costs and benefits, and to offer concrete examples of how to expand and sustain specific projects. We make some recommendations that could aid its implementation on a national or larger scale. For example, implementation might be facilitated (1) through greater engagement of paid professionals, and (2) through the involvement of integrating entities, including institutions of learning and agencies with broad science responsibilities.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is one of the most crucial properties for monitoring and modeling landscape processes. For this study hyperspectral imagery and soil physical properties were collected in both in situ and controlled laboratory experiments to establish predictive capabilities for soil moisture in saline soils. An inverse Gaussian model was first applied to fit the spectral reflectance curves and to derive three curve-specific parameters, namely the inverted amplitude, the distance from the center to the inflection point, and the area under the Gaussian curve. Then both linear regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to develop soil moisture prediction models. Results indicate that soil salinity greatly affects surface reflectance and thereby prediction of soil moisture. The linear regression model failed to predict soil moisture for all in situ field samples as well as for controlled laboratory samples with moderate salinity levels. It was only able to predict moisture reasonably well when salinity levels were extremely high. Application of ANNs significantly improved prediction accuracy as evidenced by a substantial increase of the correlation coefficient and Nash – Sutcliffe efficiency. Based on obtained results, the coupling of an inverse Gaussian model with artificial neural networks provides practical and accurate means for prediction of soil moisture of saline soils and shows great potential for large-scale soil moisture mapping based on hyperspectral imagery.",

The Green River formation holds the largest oil shale deposits in the world and understanding the elemental composition of these samples is important in its study.

            "abstract": "Nitrite has been observed to accumulate near the bottom of the euphotic zone in many regions of the world ocean. This recurring feature is referred to as the primary nitrite maximum (PNM). The production of nitrite in the PNM has been attributed to both nitrate reduction and ammonium oxidation, depending on the location. However, the factors driving nitrite accumulation are not well understood. We use nitrite isotope data collected during the GEOTRACES 2013 Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) to examine differences in nitrite production mechanisms in the PNM of a gradient from coastal to oligotrophic offshore waters in the tropical south Pacific. Large differences in the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrite (reported as δ15N vs air N2 and δ18O vs VSMOW in units of ‰, respectively) were found between eastern and western parts of the transect (eastern and central south Pacific, respectively). δ15N of nitrite ranged between −5 and −54‰ in the in the eastern PNM, while ranging between 1 and 7‰ in the central PNM. δ18O of nitrite was between 10 and 45‰ in the eastern PNM, and 10 to 14‰ the central PNM. These differences in δ15N and δ18O of nitrite in the eastern versus central PNM may be related to differences in nitrite production mechanisms, namely nitrate reduction and ammonium oxidation. We hypothesize that nitrate reduction may be the more important nitrite-producing process in the eastern PNM, while ammonium oxidation is likely to be more important in the central PNM. Furthermore, since nitrite oxidation has been observed to exhibit an inverse kinetic isotope effect, the strongly negative δ15N values of nitrite in the eastern PNM suggest that nitrite oxidation may be an important nitrite sink there. Analysis of nitrate isotopes will allow us to further constrain the contributions of these processes, and this is currently underway.",

            "abstract": "In the solar corona, in the magnetosphere, and in other astrophysical settings, magnetic reconnection often occurs in a low-beta plasma. Unfortunately, less is known about low-beta reconnection, partially due to lack of attention and partially due to numerical difficulties. Recent MHD simulations revealed several new features of low-beta reconnection; For example, Zenitani et al.(2010,2011) [1,2] discovered a normal shock which is perpendicular to the Petschek shock and a repeated shock-reflection in front of a magnetic island.\nIn this contribution, we extend earlier works with improved MHD codes and organize the results from the perspective of compressible fluid dynamics. In fluid dynamics, once a flow speed becomes comparable with the local sound speed, various compressible effects take place. This is the case for low-beta reconnection, because an Alfvenic reconnection jet becomes supersonic. Many phenomena can be understood as compressible fluid effects: the normal shock is equivalent to a recompression shock on a transonic airfoil, the shock-reflection corresponds to shock-diamonds in an over-expanded supersonic flow, the adiabatic acceleration similarly takes place as the Laval nozzle, and so on. They appear regardless of Sweet-Parker, plasmoid-mediated, or Petschek reconnections.\nWe further discover another shock-diamonds in extreme cases. A critical condition for these hidden shocks is derived. All these issues can be applied to more extreme cases of relativistic reconnection, in which the sound speed is ``relatively'' slow. We will also address the relevance to the physics of extragalactic jets.\n",

            "abstract": "We measured the local strain and strain heterogeneity produced during creep deformation of split cylinders of Carrara marble under conventional triaxial loading to inelastic strains of 11% at a strain rate of 3x10-5s-1, confining pressure of 300 MPa and 400<T< 700ºC. A second suite of samples were deformed to strains of 11%, 22% and 36% at 600ºC and the same rate and confining pressure. Microscale strain mapping at a scale of 10 micrometers (MSSM) show that the partitioning of strain amongst twinning, dislocation slip, and grain boundary sliding mechanisms change with T. Preliminary results using a VPFFT model that gives more importance to dislocation slip predict strain heterogeneities with larger wavelength. Interestingly, at all T, although sliding occurred on some boundaries, on average, strain in regions near boundaries was less than that in grain interiors suggesting the formation of a core-mantle structure observed in naturally deformed rocks. The production of local crystallographic texture also depends on T (and presumably, partitioning amongst the mechanisms). In all the experiments, the texture index (TI) of local areas decreased after deformation, but the path of the evolution differed with changing T. Reductions in TI were greatest for samples deformed at 400ºC, where twin activity was greatest, and at 700ºC, where boundary sliding was more prevalent, and less for intermediate T. The wavelength and amplitude of the heterogeneity in local strain decreased with increasing strain at 600ºC, suggesting that the strain (and perhaps, structures) were being homogenized. From this data and previous observations, we conclude that the evolution of deformation structures in marble takes place over a substantial interval in strain; that the duration of this interval probably depends on strain rate, temperature, and pressure; and that extrapolation of mechanical behavior from lab to natural conditions will need to account for changes in strain partitioning.",

            "abstract": "The behavior of potassium (K) in eclogite from deep subducted slab is rarely studied, even though there have been many experimental studies in basalt or clinopyroxene systems at high pressure and temperature. We have performed high P-T sub-solidus experiments in the eclogite system with excess K up to 10 GPa, using the multi-anvil press. From 4 to 10 GPa, there is a systematic increase of K2O content in omphacite from ~0.4 wt% to ~4.4 wt%. Therefore, eclogitic omphacite could be an important carrier to transfer K into the deep mantle. The partitioning coefficient of K (Dk(Grt/Omp)) between garnet and clinopyroxene has a negative trend with increasing pressure, indicating that K is preferred to be incorporated into omphacite when the slab is subducted to deep interior. As the amount of AlVI in the stoichiometric formula of omphacite is limited, the content of the end-member NaAlVISi2O6 should be decreased with increasing pressure, because K substitutes for AlVI to produce the end-member KAlVISi2O6. The end-member substitution of diopside (CaMgSi2O6) by K-jadetie (KAlSi2O6) in omphacite results in the increases of Ca, Mg in garnet and of K, Al in omphacite. The K content in clinopyroxene is strongly depended on the mineral composition and pressure.",

Among these are the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (“AMO”) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (“PDO”). Separating these internal variability components from long-term forced temperature changes, however, is a non-trivial task. We apply a semi-empirical approach that combines climate observations and model-simulations to estimate Atlantic- and Pacific-based internal multidecadal variability (termed ‘AMO’ and ‘PMO’, respectively). Using analyses of coupled global climate model simulations, we show that our approach correctly identifies the internal variability components, while several alternative approaches overestimate and misidentify these components and their contribution to hemispheric mean temperatures. Using our method, the AMO and PMO are found to project in nearly equal proportion onto internal multidecadal variability in Northern Hemisphere mean temperature (termed ‘NMO’). A recent NMO cooling trend which contributes to the slowdown or “false pause” in warming of the past decade is seen to reflect a competition between a modest positive peak in the AMO and a substantially negative-trending PMO.",

An important research effort has been dedicated to laboratory and numerical studies of sheet flow regime that have allowed to make some progress in the understanding of the underlying physical processes. Recent advances made in high resolution measurement techniques allows to give new insights into the small scale physical processes. In this contribution, a novel uniform and steady sheet flow dataset based on an Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler (ACVP) is presented. Profile of colocated velocities (streamwise and wall-normal) and sediment concentration has been measured at high-resolution (3 mm ; 78 Hz for the velocities and 4.9 Hz for the concentration). The measured profiles extend over the whole water column, from the free surface down to the fixed bed and an ensemble averaging over eleven realisations of the same experimental conditions has been used to obtain mean profiles of streamwise velocity, concentration, sediment flux and turbulent shear stress. The present experiment corresponds to a Shields number of θ=0.44 and a suspension number of ws/u*=1.1 corresponding to the lower limit of the no-suspension sheet flow regime. The analysis of the mixing length profile allows to identify two layers, a dilute suspension layer dominated by turbulence and a dense moving bed layer dominated by granular interactions. Our measurements show that the Von Karman parameter is reduced by a factor of more than two and that the Schmidt number is almost constant with a mean value of σs=0.44. Frictional and collisional interactions are encountered in the bed layer. Frictional interactions dominate close to the fixed bed interface whereas collisional interactions seems to control the flow at the transition between the dense and dilute layers. The relevancy of different constitutive laws for two-phase flow models are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The North Cascade Glacier Climate Project (NCGCP) was founded in 1983 to monitor 10 glaciers throughout the range and identify their response to climate change. The annual observations include mass balance, terminus behavior, glacier surface area and accumulation area ratio (AAR). Annual mass balance (Ba) measurements have been continued on the 8 original glaciers that still exist. Two glaciers have disappeared: the Lewis Glacier and Spider Glacier. In 1990, Easton Glacier and Sholes Glacier were added to the annual balance program to offset the loss. One other glacier Foss Glacier has declined to the extent that continued measurement will likely not be possible. Here we examine the 30 year long Ba time series from this project. All of the data have been reported to the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). This comparatively long record from glaciers in one region conducted by the same research program using the same methods offers some useful comparative data. Degree day factors for melt of 4.3 mm w.e.°C-1d-1 for snow and 6.6 mm w.e.°C-1d-1 for ice has been determined from 412 days of ablation observation. The variation in the AAR for equilibrium Ba is small ranging from 60 to 67. The mean annual balance of the glaciers from 1984-2013 is -0.45 ma-1, ranging from -0.31 to -0.57 ma-1 for individual glacier’s. The correlation coefficient of Ba is above 0.80 between all glaciers including the USGS benchmark glacier, South Cascade Glacier. This indicates that the response is to regional climate change, not local factors. The mean annual balance of -0.45 ma-1 is close to the WGMS global average for this period -0.50 ma-1. The cumulative loss of 13.5 m w.e. and 15 m of ice thickness represents more than 20% of the volume of the glaciers.",

            "abstract": "The Birimian greenstone belt likely formed through collision between the West African and Congo Cratons ~2.2 Ga. Accreted greenstone belts that formed through collision especially during the Palaeoproterozoic are usually not only good targets for preservation of oceanic sedimentary sequences but also greatly help understand the nature of the Paleoproterozoic deeper oceanic environments. In this study, we focused on the coastal area around Cape Three Points at the southernmost part of the Axim-Konongo (Ashanti) greenstone belt in Ghana where excellently preserved Paleoprotrozoic deeper oceanic sedimentary sequences extensively outcrop. The Birimian greenstone belt in both the Birimian rock (partly Sefwi Group) and Ashanti belts are separated from the Tarkwaian Group which is a paleoplacer deposit (Perrouty et al., 2012). The Birimian rock was identified as volcanic rich greenstone belt; Kumasi Group is foreland basin with shale and sandstone, quartzite and turbidite derived from 2.1 Ga granite in the Birimian; Tarkwaian Group is composed of coarse detrital sedimentary rocks deposited along a strike-slip fault in the Birimian. In the eastern part of the Cape Three Point area, over 4km long of volcanic-sedimentary sequence outcrops and is affected by greenschist facies metamorphism. Four demarcated zones along the coast as Kutike, Atwepo, Kwtakor and Akodaa zones. The boundaries of each zone were not observed, but each zone displays a well preserved and continuous sedimentary sequence. Structurally, this region is west vergent structure and younging direction to the East. Kutike zone exhibits synform structure with S0 younging direction. Provisional stratigraphic columns in all the zones total about 500m thick. Kutike, Atwepo zones (> 200m thick) have coarsening upward characteristics from black shale to bedded volcanic sandstone. Kwtakor zone (> 150m) is the thickest volcaniclastic sequence and has fining upward sections. Akodaa zone (> 150m) consists of finer bed of volcaniclastics with black shales and has fining upward character. This continuous sequence indicate distal portion of submarine volcaniclastic section in an oceanic island arc between the West African and Congo Cratons.",

            "abstract": "Ultrasound is a form of mechanical energy with a frequency greater than ≈ 20 kHz (upper human hearing limit). It is used in many scientific as well as industrial fields. Most modern applications of ultrasound utilize sources which are either piezoelectric or magnetostrictive (Benwell et Bly 1987). A meteorite impact has been considered to be an ultrasound source during last years (Rajlich 2011). Rajlich (2014) is coming with a hypothesis that white planes made of microcavities in Bohemian quartz have their origin in an impact-related ultrasonic sounding. The Bohemian Massif has been considered to be one of the largest impact craters in whole of the world (Papagiannis et El-Baz 1988, Papagiannis 1989, Rajlich 2014). Rajlich's hypothesis implies a liquid behavior of quartz during the impact event. We state that then there have to exist planes of slightly higher density than their surroundings together with planes of microcavities. They should intersect each other without mutual influencing (as in a case of planes made of microcavities). Because physics of ultrasound during an impact event is a brand new and unknown field, we try to choose a simple way of its cognition. It is possible to take the sine wave and set 3 requirements. (1) There exist some surroundings of points of peak amplitudes. (2) These surroundings are of higher density (compression) or lower density (rarefaction) than the mean density of quartz. (3) The difference between the higher/lower and surrounding density is measurable. There was done an experimental study of Bohemian quartz using QCT bone densitometry at the Radiology Munich. Quartz with a size of ≈ 5 x 8 cm absorbed too much RTG radiation (kV 140, mAs 330), which made a picture of internal structure impossible. We propose another techniques and appeal to other scientists to face this challenge. If Bohemian quartz has a harmonically distributed density, we consider it to be a support for Rajlich's hypothesis.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank to Prof. Martin Mack for the fact he enabled an irradiation of quartz sample at the Radiology Munich.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Venus is thought to have undergone a global resurfacing event approximately 750 Ma. While several variations and modifications within the proposed resurfacing models exist, two end-member mechanisms can be broadly identified: (1) catastrophic overturns of the lithosphere, and (2) global volcanic resurfacing. We perform high-resolution, 3D spherical convection calculations using CitcomS to determine the conditions in Venus’ deep interior necessary for each mechanism to occur. To date, we have focused on modeling episodic overturns of the lithosphere in the stagnant lid regime following the method of van Heck and Tackley (2008), and implementing a temperature-dependent rheology and yield stress. We find in general that lithospheric yielding can occur with a Rayleigh number of the order of 105 and a yield stress of the order of 20 ­- 400 MPa, consistent with the results of van Heck and Tackley. Additionally, we find that the behavior of lithospheric overturn depends strongly on the yield stress. To see this, we systematically increase the Rayleigh number and the yield stress via a priori scaling relationships. We find that models with Rayleigh number between 105 and 108 exhibit some variation of stagnant-lid convection; however, we observe that by varying the yield stress we are able to control the degree to which the overturns consist of the subduction of large, coherent segments of lithosphere as opposed to the formation of a large number of smaller, regional delaminations. We analyze these two modes of overturn by looking at the resultant geoid and topography fields to see if they yield distinguishable signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the geoid and topography to determine the extent to which their signatures are contributed from lower mantle anomalies and surface features. We also test the effects of mineral phase transformations and depth­-increasing viscosity on lithospheric overturn behavior by varying the mantle viscosity structure. Melt fraction estimates are calculated within the upper 100 km of the mantle during and after the overturn events to estimate the volume of melt available for resurfacing.",

            "abstract": "We submit that the tightly coupled coevolution of biota and climate is a critical driver of the self-organization of the biosphere over geologic time. The long-term carbon biogeochemical cycle includes a major influence of biology relevant to climatic, namely the biotic enhancement of weathering (BEW). According to a meta-analysis of field and experimental evidence, the likely magnitude of the present BEW is roughly two orders of magnitude, the culmination of its progressive increase over geologic time. Within the context of modeling this long-term cycle, this value can be used to estimate the likely abiotic temperature history of the Earth’s surface, assuming plausible initial temperatures, and histories of volcanic outgassing and continental crust growth. The result of this modeling is that the Earth would have been habitable for thermophilic life (growing above 50 deg C) for the past 4.4 billion years, but not for low-temperature life, including plants and animals. Hence biospheric cooling due to biotic actions allowed the emergence of complex life. Much larger increases in BEW are self-limiting, since the atmospheric CO2 level would plunge below the lower limit potentially for photosynthesis, thereby driving a decline in the biological productivity and global BEW, related to reduced plant and soil activities, with the system being kept at this threshold or going back to higher CO2 levels, with scenarios dependent on volcanic outgassing and solar inputs. We will present astrobiological implications of this modeling. ",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed how forest cover removal can alter the frequency and magnitude of annual peak flows. However, to fully understand the impacts of land cover changes on stream channels, it is necessary to examine how multiple attributes of the flow regime are affected. Changes in the frequency and duration of peaks over threshold (PoT) discharge for sediment mobilization has the potential to alter the dynamics of bedload mobility and channel form in alluvial gravel-bed streams. A meta-analysis investigation of changes in the duration and number of PoT in four snowmelt catchments of western North America contributes towards a comprehensive understanding of the influence of harvesting on the snowmelt flow regime. Analysis results reveal that harvesting causes the duration and number of PoT of snowmelt peak flows to increase and that these increases are generally greater for larger flood quantiles. Such a response indicates that, following harvesting, the hydrograph in all four catchments has become more responsive during the freshet period. In addition harvesting has resulted in increases in the total volume (i.e. duration) of flood peaks so that discharge remains elevated above specific thresholds for longer periods of time.\nThe meta-analysis results suggest that physical basin characteristics including percentage of alpine area, slope aspect, and gradient, elevation and watershed size all play a role in catchment scale response to harvesting-related increases in flood duration and PoT. In snow environments alterations to the flow regime due to forest removal are likely to persist for many decades until sufficient forest regeneration restores stand level processes of snow accumulation and snowmelt.",

            "abstract": "The Eurekan Orogeny, which created much of the high topography of Ellesmere Island and adjacent Greenland, occurred as a result of mountain-building processes the dynamics of which are not well understood. It is generally considered that the rotation of Greenland in the Eocene (related to sedimentary basin formation in Baffin Bay) produced compressional tectonics between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. As part of this process, the Eurekan Orogeny formed away from a traditional convergent ocean-closure plate boundary, and represents a style of “intraplate\" deformation. In this work, the geodynamic evolution of the Eurekan Orogeny and its relationship to the tectonics of the Canadian polar margin and northern Baffin Basin is explored using high-resolution thermal-mechanical numerical experiments with the modelling code SOPALE. The modelling of the High Arctic is constrained by the first-order crustal structure of the region (deduced by local gravity field and passive seismological data). Presented are suites of numerical experiments that investigate how the pre-existing lithospheric structures (both crustal and sub-crustal) control the evolution of the resulting intraplate orogen. The influence of other primary modelling parameters, such as plate convergence velocity and assumed rheology, are also explored. To highlight the role of surface processes on plate and lithosphere deformation, the importance of climate-controlled erosion and deposition in influencing the tectonics of High Arctic orogenesis is considered. As the tectonic evolution of the region is poorly resolved, we present some of the first interpretations of the development of Ellesmerian and northern Baffin lithosphere from the Earth’s surface down to the base of the lithosphere. The numerical experiments evaluate and refine the geodynamical interpretations for enigmatic intraplate tectonics—applicable to this Arctic region and other instances globally.",

            "abstract": "New microscopic techniques have revolutionized cell biology over the past two decades. However, there are still biological processes whose details elude us, especially those involving motility: e.g. feeding behavior of microorganisms in the ocean, or migration of cancer cells to form metastases. Imaging prokaryotes, which range in size from several hundred nm to a few microns, is especially challenging. An emerging technique to address these issues is Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM).\nDHM is an imaging technique that uses the interference of light to record and reproduce three-dimensional magnified images of objects. This approach has several advantages over ordinary brightfield microscopy for fieldwork: a larger depth of field, hands-off operation, robustness regarding environmental conditions, and large sampling volumes with quantitative 3D records of motility behavior. Despite these promising features, real-time DHM was thought to be impractical for technological and computational reasons until recently, and there has so far been very limited application of DHM to biology. Most existing instruments are limited in performance by their particular (e.g. in-line, lens-less, phase-shifting) approach to holography. These limitations can be mitigated with an off-axis dual-path configuration. Here we describe the design and implementation of a design for a Mach-Zehnder-type holographic microscope with diffraction-limited lateral resolution, with intended applications in environmental microbiology.\nWe have achieved sub-micron resolution and three-dimensional tracking of prokaryotic and eukaryotic test strains designed to represent different modes and speeds of microbial motility. Prokaryotes are Escherichia coli, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Bacillus subtilis. Each shows a characteristic motility pattern, as we illustrate in holographic videos in sample chambers 0.6 mm in depth. The ability to establish gradients of attractants with bacterial taxis towards the attractant is also established. The eukaryotic strains are Euglena gracilis, which demonstrates both phototaxis and geotaxis, and Paramecium micromultinucleatum. The challenges of optimizing resolution vs. field of view, and of handling the large volumes of data generated during holographic imaging, are discussed.",

We extend previous theoretical treatments for ocean tidal dissipation by taking into account the effects of ocean loading, self-attraction, and deformation of the solid regions. These effects modify both the forcing potential and the ocean thicknesses for which energy dissipation is resonantly enhanced, potentially resulting in orders of magnitude changes in the dissipated energy flux.\nAssuming a Cassini state obliquity, Enceladus' dissipated energy flux due to the obliquity tide is smaller than the observedvalue by many orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the dissipated energy flux due to the resonant response to the eccentricity tide can be large enough to explain Enceladus' observed heat flow.The figure shows the dissipated energy flux due to the obliquity and eccentricity tides as a function of the quality factor and ocean thickness. Narrow maxima correspond to ocean thicknesses for which the tidal flow is resonantly enhanced.",

            "abstract": "In the Arctic, the late Pleistocene mountain glacier record is limited due to expansive occupation of the high latitudes by vast ice sheets. However, certain centers of alpine glaciation, like the Brooks Range, northern Alaska, contain detailed Pleistocene moraine sequences. The Holocene record is more widespread and spans both the western and eastern sectors of the Arctic. Nevertheless, only in a few areas do we have more than a basic understanding of the Holocene moraine sequences and their general ages, usually defined by morphostratigraphy, lichenometry, and the odd indirect constraint by radiocarbon dating. Cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating has recently provided more precise absolute moraine chronologies, but well-dated sites are still few and far between. This presentation will focus on the latest view of the Holocene moraine chronology in the North American Arctic: the Brooks Range, Baffin Island and Greenland. The general pattern reveals: 1) a definitive lack of Younger Dryas moraines, at least in the Brooks Range and Baffin Island; 2) moraines deposited during the 8.2 ka event, at least on Baffin Island; 3) Neoglaciation was underway by ~5-4 ka, based on moraines in the Brooks Range and on lake sediments and ice-killed vegetation on Baffin Island and Greenland; 4) moraines deposited during the Little Ice Age mark the largest extent of glaciers during the late Holocene in most valleys, but pre-Little Ice Age moraines are common in all sectors of the Arctic; 5) moraine sequences on both Baffin Island and western Greenland surprisingly date to Medieval time. Key implications of this pattern of Holocene glaciation in the Arctic will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The direct, non-climate, contribution of carbon dioxide and water emissions from fossil-fuel (FF) combustion to the volume and mass of the oceans has been omitted from estimates of sea-level rise (SLR) in IPCC reports. Following the method of Gornitz et al. (1997), H2O emissions are estimated using carbon emissions from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, along with typical carbon and hydrogen contents of FF.\nHistoric H2O emissions from 1750 to 2010 amount to 430 ±50 PgH2O, equivalent to 1.2 ±0.2 mmSLR. Sometime in this decade the volume of H2O from historic FF combustion will exceed the volume of Lake Erie (480 km3). CO2 dissolved in the ocean increases the seawater volume by 31-33 mL mol-1 CO2. From 1750 to 2010, 370 ±70 PgCO2 from FF combustion has dissolved in the oceans, causing 0.7 ±0.2 mmSLR. Combined H2O+CO2emissions from FF have therefore added 1.9 ±0.4 mm to sea levels in the Industrial Era.\nCombustion of FF in 2010 resulted in emissions of 32 PgCO2 and 12 ±1 PgH2O. SLR contributions for that year from FF emissions were 0.033 ±0.005 mm from H2O and 0.011±0.003 mm from dissolved CO2, a total rate of 0.044 ±0.008 mm yr-1.\nEmissions incorporated in socio-economic models underlying the RCP 8.5 and 2.6 scenarios are used along with concentration-driven CMIP5 Earth System Models results to estimate future sea-level rise from FF combustion. From 2010 to 2100, RCP8.5 and 2.6 models respectively produce 9 ±2 mmSLR and 5 ±1 mmSLR from FF H2O+CO2. For perspective, these amounts are larger than the modelled contributions from loss of glaciers in the Andes.\nThe direct contribution of FF emissions to SLR is small (1-2%) relative to current rates and projected estimates under RCP scenarios up to 2100. The magnitude is similar to SLR estimates from other minor sources such as the melting of floating ice, land-use emissions and produced water from oil operations, none of which are currently included in SLR assessments. As uncertainties in observations and contributions are reduced, small contribution factors, hitherto neglected, will become relatively more important in balancing the books.\n",

            "abstract": "To better understand earthquake source processes involved in dynamically triggering remote aftershocks, we design and test an automated algorithm to detect far-field aftershocks from two large earthquakes. Our goal is to create a method that is tractable for large datasets, ensures robust catalogs, and delivers lower magnitude of completeness than current catalogs. We use data recorded by the EarthScope’s USArray Transportable Array (TA), which has a uniform 70km grid spacing and large spatial coverage. We test 3-hours of data following the 12 September 2007 Sumatra M8.5 earthquake and the 07 November 2012 M7.4 Guatemala earthquake, when the TA network was on the west-coast and east-coast of the contiguous US, respectively. This allows exploration of a broad range of tectonic environments and regions of both small tectonic earthquakes (2007 data) and significant extraction sector activity, such as mine blasts (2012 data). The main steps in our data processing include: (1) A frequency domain detection algorithm to identify signals above the noise floor in the 4-12 Hz range to create a detection catalog. (2) Iteratively implementing a nearest-neighbor technique to remove detection outliers from the catalog. (3) Partitioning the detections into high density clusters. (4) Building an earthquake catalog where, for each cluster, we assume the station location that first recorded the seismic energy is a good proxy for the location of the local earthquake and this signal’s arrival time is a good proxy for the time of the earthquake. Our results identify 7 and 9 events in the 2007 and 2012 data, respectively, which is a significant increase over the 3 and 2 earthquakes listed in the ANF catalog during the same time periods. This method is ideal for identifying the signature of small earthquakes within the wavetrain of large remote mainshocks recorded by the TA network.",

            "abstract": "Water quality is dictated by interactions among geomorphic processes, vegetation characteristics, weather patterns, and anthropogenic land uses over multiple spatio-temporal scales. In order to understand how changes in climate and land use impact river water quality, a suite of data with high temporal resolution over a long period is needed. Further, all of this data must be analyzed with respect to connectivity to the river, thus requiring high spatial resolution data. Here, we present how changes in climate and land use over the past 25 years have affected water quality in the 268 sq. km Hoteo River catchment in New Zealand. Hydro-climatic data included daily solar radiation, temperature, soil moisture, rainfall, drought indices, and runoff at 5-km resolution. Land cover changes were measured every 8 days at 30-m resolution by fusing Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery. Water quality was assessed using 15-min turbidity (2011-2014) and monthly data for a suite of variables (1990-2014). Watershed connectivity was modeled using a corrected 15-m DEM and a high-resolution drainage network. Our analyses revealed that this catchment experiences cyclical droughts which, when combined with intense land uses such as livestock grazing and plantation forest harvesting, leaves many areas in the catchment disturbed (i.e. exposed soil) that are connected to the river through surface runoff. As a result, flow-normalized turbidity was elevated during droughts and remained relatively low during wet periods. For example, disturbed land area decreased from 9% to 4% over 2009-2013, which was a relatively wet period. During the extreme drought of 2013, disturbed area increased to 6% in less than a year due mainly to slow pasture recovery after heavy stocking rates. The relationships found in this study demonstrate that high spatiotemporal resolution land cover datasets are very important to understanding the interactions between landscape and climate, and how these interactions affect water quality.",

Informal discussions with ice storm experts indicate that due to competing temperature and precipitation effects as well as local topographic effects, it is unclear how exactly climate change will affect ice storms. Here we ask how incident frequencies might change in a future climate at four weather stations prone to ice storms. Using historical atmospheric soundings, we conduct a thought experiment where we perturb the temperatures as might be expected in a future climate. We then discuss changes in monthly frequency of ice storms. ",

Sub-national, instead of national fuel data are used to reduce spatial bias due to uneven distribution of per person energy consumption within large countries. Space-for-time substitution method was developed to model the dependence of residential energy consumptions on a series of meteorological and socioeconomic conditions. The regression models were used to project temporal variation of energy consumption, subsequently emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. The models can also be used to downscale spatial distribution of residential emissions. By using this approach, global emission inventories of black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, mercury, TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 have been established. The inventories were used to potential health impact assessment, atmospheric transport and long-range transport modeling, as well as exposure and health impact modeling.",

            "abstract": "More serious drought has been projected due to the climate change in the Kansas State of the U.S., which might threaten the local agriculture and thus require effective adaptation responses to drought, e.g. better irrigation. But the irrigation adaptation on drought at the current technology-level is poorly quantified, therefore challenges to figure out how much additional efforts are required under more aridity of climate. Here, we collect the irrigation application data for maize, soybean, sorghum and wheat in Kansas, and establish a two-stage model to quantify the crop-specific irrigation application responses to changes in climatic drivers, and further estimate the existing effectiveness of the irrigation to adapt future drought based on the IPCC AR5 ensemble PDSI prediction under RCP4.5 scenario. We find that the three summer season crops (maize, soybean and sorghum) would experience 0 – 20% yield losses depending on county due to more serious drought since 2030s, even though increased irrigation application as the response of drought had saved 0 – 10% yields. At the state level, maize receives most benefits from irrigation, whereas the beneficial effects are least for sorghum among the three crops. To wheat, irrigation adaptation is very weak since irrigation water applied is much less than the above three crops. But wheat yields were projected to have a slight increase in central and eastern regions because climate would become more moisture over the growing season of winter wheat in future. Our results highlight that the existing beneficial effects from irrigation would be surpassed by the negative impact of drought in future, which would cause overall yield reduction in Kansas especially for those summer season crops.",

            "abstract": "Northwestern China (NWC) is a typical arid and semi-arid region. In this study, the main summer climate features over NWC are presented and the performance of an atmospheric general circulation model (NCEP GCM/SSiB) over the region is evaluated. Satellite-derived vegetation products are applied in the model. Based on a comparison with observed and Reanalysis II data, the GCM generally simulates the major features of the NWC summer energy balance and circulation. These major features include: a high surface temperature center dominating the planetary boundary layer; widespread descending motion; an anticyclone (cyclone) located in the lower and middle (upper) troposphere, covering most parts of central NWC; and precipitation located mainly in the high elevation areas surrounding NWC.\nThe sensitivity of the summer energy balance and circulation over NWC and the surrounding regions to land surface processes is preliminarily assessed with specified land cover change. In the sensitivity experiment, the degradation over most parts of NWC, except the Taklimakan Desert, decreases the surface-absorbed radiation and leads to weaker surface thermal effects. In northern Xinjiang and surrounding regions, less latent heating causes stronger anomalous lower-level anticyclonic circulation and upper-level cyclonic circulation, leading to less summer precipitation and higher surface temperature there. Meanwhile, the dry conditions in the Hexi Corridor produce less change in the latent heat flux. The circulation change to the north of this area plays a dominant role in indirectly changing lower-level cyclonic conditions, producing more convergence and weaker vertical descending motion, and thus an increase in precipitation over this region.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific Northwest receives some of the highest rates of atmospheric mercury deposition in the USA (>14 µg/m2/year) which is largely driven by the large volume of precipitation this region receives. Forested landscapes have been shown to act as a net sink for atmospheric Hg inputs which has resulted in a legacy of mercury accumulated in the soil. Timber production and harvesting (typically via clearcutting) is a common land-use feature throughout the Pacific Northwest, accounting for roughly 25% of the total land area. Timber harvesting and associated activities (road construction and slash removal) have fundamental effects on watershed hydrology and biogeochemicial processes, and can also alter mercury cycling dynamics. The objective of our study was to understand how different forest harvest practices impact key components of the mercury cycle including: mobilization in runoff, methylation, volatilization, and downstream bioaccumulation. The study utilized a paired harvested and un-harvest sub-watershed experimental design. Flumes were located at the outflow of each of the 8 sub-watershed studied and were continuously monitored for flow volume and other water quality parameters. Water samples for filtered and particulate total and methylmercury (as well as several ancillary parameters) were measured approximately monthly for 1.5 years following harvest and represented the full range of hydrological conditions. Surface-air flux measurements were conducted seasonally using the dynamic flux chamber (DFC) approach. The results showed increased fluxes of mercury in streams and to the atmosphere in response for forestry operations. The stream fluxes showed higher loads in the filtered phase than associated with particulates. Methylmercury concentrations remained low (<0.05 ng/L) in all of the headwater catchments studied. Overall, these results highlight the effects of forestry operations on several important aspects of mercury cycling in forested landscapes.",

However, number of the reported gas flow tests for fractured rocks are limited, therefore, the applicability of the conventional two-phase flow functions used for porous media, such as Mualem-van Genuchten model, to prediction of the gas transport in the fractured rock mass are not well understood.\nThe authors conducted the two types of in-situ tests, with different scales, a borehole gas-injection test and a chamber gas-injection test in fractured granitic rock. These tests were conducted in the Cretaceous granitic rocks at the Namikata underground LPG storage cavern construction site in Ehime Prefecture in Japan, preceding to the cavern scale gas-tightness test.\nA borehole injection test was conducted using vertical and sub-vertical boreholes drilled from the water injection tunnel nearly at the depth of the top of the cavern, EL-150m. A new type downhole gas injection equipment that is capable to create a small ‘cavern’ within a borehole was developed. After performing a series of preliminary tests to investigate the hydraulic conductivity and gas-tightness, i.e. threshold pressure, gas injection tests were conducted under different gas pressure. Fig.1 shows an example of the test results\nFrom a chamber test using a air pressurizing chamber with volume of approximately166m3, the gas-tightness was confirmed within the uncertainty of 22Pa under the storage pressure of 0.7MPa, however, significant air leakage occurred possibly through an open fracture intersecting the chamber just after cavern pressure exceeds the initial hydrostatic pressure at the ceiling level of the chamber. Anomalies were detected in the data of the pore pressure as well as AE monitoring around the chamber.\nResults from the above two tests were simulated using a multi-phase transport simulator, TOUGH2, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

            "abstract": "The solar wind creates a giant plasma bubble in our immediate, very local interstellar medium (VLISM), the heliosphere. As is true for every physical system, its structure is determined by dynamic processes and by the boundary conditions at the Sun and in the VLISM. Because of the supersonic expansion of the solar wind the structure of the inner (several AU) heliosphere is (nearly) exclusively determined by the Sun. As simple as this may all appear, the problem of linking heliospheric structure to solar features is remarkably complex and has so far eluded satisfactory solutions. ESA and NASA have implemented the Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions to tackle and solve the mystery of how the Sun creates and controls the heliosphere. Previous missions, especially the twin Helios mission, lacked two crucial elements, remote-sensing of solar features and their dynamics, and composition measurements of the solar plasma, wind, and energetic particles. Solar Orbiter has both elements in its highly sophisticated payload and will allow us to link solar features to the solar wind sampled in situ by using composition and energetic particles as tracers. The composition of the solar wind is altered from its photospheric origin by two processes very probably acting at different altitudes in the solar atmosphere. Elemental composition of the solar wind appears to be fractionated by its First Ionization Potential (FIP) or time (FIT), indicating that some mechanism separates neutral atoms from ions. This requires temperatures low enough to allow a substantial neutral fraction of the solar plasma and therefore the FIP-effect is believed to act primarily in the chromosphere. Charge states on the other hand are determined by the expansion and acceleration of the solar wind and the electron temperature high in the corona. Solar Orbiter will allow remote-sensing measurements of the elemental composition of solar features and comparison with that measured in situ after the solar wind has traveled from the Sun to the spacecraft. Further information about the linkage between Sun and heliosphere will come from energetic particles which are tightly bound to magnetic field lines and therefore serve as good tracers for the magnetic connection between Sun and heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "A new laboratory experimental method has been developed to obtain the hydraulic head loss of either the closed fractures or conduits whose surfaces are in contact. This method has been developed based on the balance of energy. It was found that the linearity between the hydraulic head loss and the flow velocity decreases with the aperture increases, based on which a possible division of fractures and conduits is proposed. The results of the division show that a closed flow structure with about less than 1.4635mm aperture can be defined as a fracture whilst a closed flow structure with more than 1.8375mm aperture can be defined as a conduit. The flow structure with an aperture of 1.6000mm is in the transitional area of fractures and conduits. In addition, the Cubic law cannot exactly describe the relationship between the hydraulic head loss and the velocity when applied to closed fractures in these investigations. The effects of deviations from the ideal conditions when applying the Cubic law cause an apparent reduction in hydraulic head loss and may be incorporated into the Cubic law by adding the effects of both the width of the fracture and the ratio of the width to the aperture.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reversal stratigraphy in terrigenous rocks has been used for a number of years to decipher deformational histories in orogenic fronts and associated basins. When applied to syntectonic sediments, magnetostratigraphy in combination with rockmagnetic cyclostratigraphy, offers a unique opportunity to address fundamental questions such as the unsteadiness of deformation with high resolution. Along the northern boundary of the Ebro Foreland Basin, the footwall of the Vallfogona thrust exposes a spectacular regional-scale growth fault-propagation fold in the syntectonic Berga Conglomerate Group. Across the structure, bedding dips change from 70 degrees overturned to upright and horizontal over a few kilometers of section. We used these growth strata to recover deformation rates using a new 1.5 km long magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy section. Samples for paleomagnetism were taken every 10 to 15 m and progressively thermally demagnetized to isolate the charateristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions. Correlation of the local magnetostratigraphy to the Global Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) suggests that the Berga conglomerates were deposited during chrons C12r to C15r with a total duration of about 4 million years. Sediment accumulation rates decreased upsection and are related to changes in depositional facies with 45 cm/ka rates in sub-aerial debris flows, 25 cm/ka in axial fluvial fans, and 17 cm/ka in fans longitudinal to the mountain front. Deformation rates were also unsteady with 113o of folding occurring in short time intervals separated by longer periods of tectonic quiescence. To develop the cyclostratigraphy, we used an anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) data series. ARM data reveals variations in magnetite concentration that have been shown to vary with climatic changes at Milankovitch frequencies. Samples for cyclostratigraphy were collected every 0.75 cm for ~800 m from chron C12r-C13r. Time-frequency analysis of stratigraphically referenced ARM measurements, which reflect variation in primary magnetite concentration, were calibrated to time using the magnetostratigraphy and revealed cyclicity with significant power at Milankovitch periodicities. Low frequency ARM cyclicity aligns with lithologic cyclicity at ~100 m, visible at the outcrop scale.",

With coverage currently at ~80% of the country and due to be completed by 2015 this spatially extensive, high resolution dataset has opened up new avenues of research for Quaternary geology in the country. The work presented here utilises the SNHM to map and evaluate more than 10,000 glacially streamlined landforms in the south-east of Sweden. The subsequently extracted morphological variables of length, width and height are then used to investiagte three areas; to test recent conclusions drawn from the glacially streamlined landscapes of Great Britain and North America/Canada, to assess the impact of different core types on the morphological expression of said features and to attempt to calculate which morphological variable best accounts for the variability seen in the dataset.\nIt is found that in common with drumlins found in the British Isles, and elsewhere, their characteristics can be described by a log-normal distribution. However the long tail of the features characteristic distributions can cause problems for many of the commonly applied statistical methods of evaluation. Furthermore a re-appraisal of some conclusions drawn by previous works as to the presence of a fundamental scaling law in streamlined feature elongation is necessary due to evidence gathered here. Additionally; based on a limited sample size it has been found that it is not possible to differentiate a streamlined landform’s core type based on their morphological characteristics alone. Larger 'known'-core data sets may be able to do so, based upon the length of a feature for example, however the sample size here was not sufficient to allow significant differences to come to the fore should they exist. And lastly, the extracted variable 'height' was found to account for the vast majoirty of the variance seen in the dataset when subject to a principle component analysis (PCA).",

Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation – Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) has been continuously measuring CO2 and CH4 distributions globally, and the retrieved column CO2 and CH4 data have been distributed to the public. To make a successful retrieval of XCO2 and XCH4, the spectral quality of Oxygen A-band is the most importance. Over five years in-orbit operation of TANSO-FTS, the spectral distortion related with input radiance on Oxygen A-band have been observed and reduced the retrieval accuracy and precision of XCO2 and XCH4. It suggests that the Oxygen A-band signal chain has non-linear response against input radiance. To characterize the non-linear response of signal chain against input signal levels, the test procedure is newly developed coupled with the modulated laser light, simultaneous signal acquisition system and on-ground TANSO-FTS, which called engineering model. The results present clearly that the analogue signal chain of Oxygen A-band excites the non-linear response both of amplitude and phase delay against input signal levels. Also, the non-linear interferogram drives both of the artificial spectra on the out-band region and the spectral distortion linked with absorption spectral lines. To improve the spectral quality of Oxygen A-band, these artificial and distorted spectra have to correct with properly. The newly correction algorithm for level-1 processing was developed and the corrected spectra were retrieved and validated by applying RemoTeC algorithm. Comparing with the previous version of level-1 products, the agreement between observation and theoretical calculation is well improved and the biases of biases of XCO2 and XCH4 against ground validation site are reduced.",

            "abstract": "Model of solid-liquid equilibrium laws and substances properties in lower mantle conditions is important to understand the early stages of evolution of terrestrial planets, such as core formation and magma ocean crystallization. This model is also necessary to prove theories on some modern seismic features of the Earth (e.g. ultra-low velocity zones) and petrological observations (e.g. lower mantle mineral assemblage inclusions in diamonds).\nNumerous experimental and numerical studies of the lower mantle phases provide sufficient amount of data to build up a thermodynamic model, which can be used in geophysical fluid dynamics research. Experimental studies are the direct source of soliduses values, but other thermodynamic parameters stay unclear. Molecular Dynamics modeling provides data on thermodynamic properties of solids and liquids (density, heat capacity, latent heat of melting etc.). But absence of minor components (iron, alkali etc.) and some numerical issues (e.g. [Belonoshko, 2001]) make it to overestimate melting temperatures significantly (up to 20-30%).\nOur approach is to develop a model based on MD data by [de Koker et al., 2013] with evaluation of all important parameters according to classical thermodynamic equations. But melting temperatures (especially at eutectic points) are corrected along Clausius-Clapeyron slopes to agree with modern experimental data ([Andrault et al., 2011], [Andrault et al., 2014], [Fiquet et al., 2010], [Hirose et al., 1999], [Mosenfelder et al., 2007], [Nomura et al., 2014],\n[Ozawa et al., 2011], [Zerr et al., 1998]). Notable effect on melt and solid densities has iron partitioning, so KD value reported by [Andrault et al., 2012] was used.\nProposed model was implemented into StagYY software (e.g. [Tackley, 2008]). It is a finite-volume discretization code for advection of solid and liquid in a planetary scale. CMB temperature was set to be 4000-4400 K. Calculations predict appearing and disappearing batches containing up to 5-7% of melt. Amount of FeO in liquid is up to 18%, so melts are 2 % denser than solid counterpart, resulting in total density increase up to 1 %. This data fits properties proposed for Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (melt fraction between 5 and 30 % [Garnero et al., 1998], and density increase of at least 1% [Beuchert & Schmeling, 2013]).",

The field works were undertaken in 2012 and 2013. Analyses of oxygen (δ18O) and hydrogen (δD) stable isotopes were obtained using the Picarro Isotopic Liquid Water Analyzer (Biogeosciences group, ETH-Zurich, Switzerland). The ground ice samples were collected both from four boreholes (BH) drilled on the right limit of the Kolyma River valley and from one section (S) in the Duvanny Yar exposure.\nLate Pleistocene wedge ice (Ice complex) was recovered by the BH13/1 located on a yedoma relics towering over the low thermokarst plain (N68°30.7' E161°29.6') and S12/4 in the Duvanny Yar exposure (N68°37.8' E159°08.6'). Isotopes δ18O and δD range from -31.413 to -34.05 and from -244.934 to -260.57, correspondingly.\nModern wedge ice was recovered by the BH13/3 located on the joint Kolyma and Panteleikha Rivers floodplain underlain by river-bed sediments (N68°36.8', E161°21'). Isotopes range from -25.83 to -26.32(δ18O) and from -197.09 to -204.47 (δD).\nOblique segregated ice layers adjacent to a modern ice wedge were recovered by the BH12/2 on the annually flooded thermokarst plain (N68˚30.8' E161˚30). Isotopes range from -18.778 to -20.897 (δ18O) and from -149.883 to -168.901 (δD). The δD contents are the lowest here, resulting possibly from mixed (ice wedging and segregation) mechanism of ice lenses formation.\nSegregated ice was recovered by the BH13/2 on the Schuch’e lake alas (N68°44.77', E161°23.3') and S12/4 in the transition layer of the Duvanny Yar. Isotopes range from -19.63 to -23.43 (δ18O) and from -146.77 to -177.23 (δD).\nPreliminary results are as follows: 1) all samples are distributed near the line of meteoric water providing evidence for atmospheric origin of ground ice in the region; 2) isotope distribution exhibits a clear distinction between Late Pleistocene wedge ice, modern wedge ice, segregated ice adjacent to a modern ice wedge, and segregated ice; 3) the excess shows evidence of far remoteness of the region from the sources of atmospheric moisture; 4) mean annual air temperatures reconstructed by δ18O constitute, on average, ca. -26°C for the Late Pleistocene wedge ice, -10°C for modern wedge ice, and, with certain reservation, -9° C for segregated ice.",

            "abstract": "Chlorinated solvents tend to persist for long periods in heterogeneous porous media, in part due to sustained sources of contaminant sequestered in lower permeability zones and sorbed to the soil matrix. Sharp contrasts in soil properties have been modeled successfully using Markov Chain / Transition Probability (MC/TP) methods. This statistical approach provides a means of generating permeability fields that are consistent with prior knowledge concerning the frequency and relative positioning of different strata.To assess source zone mass depletion in a suite of such geological realizations, the large computational burden may prohibit the use of direct numerical simulations. One alternative approach is the application of a multi-rate-mass-transfer (MRMT) method, an extension of the dual-domain concept that was first developed in the soil science literature for sorption modeling. In MRMT, rather than discretizing immobile regions, such as clay layers, the concentration in these regions is treated by explicit state variables, and the transport between mobile and immobile regions is modeled by first-order exchange terms. However, in the implementation of this approach, fine-scale simulations on subdomains are often necessary to develop appropriate parameters. Such simulations are tedious, especially when attempting to account for uncertainty in the geological description. In this work, the link between characteristics of MC/TP and transfer parameters in the MRMT is evaluated by regression based on fine-scale simulations, using the simulator MODFLOW/MT3DMS. Upscaled simulation results are obtained with the same simulator, linked to an MRMT module. The results facilitate efficient assessment of reactive transport in domains with sharp contrasts in soil properties and limit the need for fine-scale numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "Both observations and simulations of 20 models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) reveal that drylands have expanded during the last 58 years (1948-2005). However, the dryland expansion in the simulations (0.4×106 km2 ) is only one-sixth of that (2.5×106 km2) in the observations. The large model biases in dryland expansion are accompanied with large uncertainties of aridity index (AI) and poor simulation of precipitation in the models. The precipitation is overestimated by climate models only 7 mm in hyper-arid regions, but 30 mm and 37 mm in semi-arid and dry subhumid regions. The AI also shows large biases in the semi-arid (0.02) and dry subhumid regions (0.04), which is 8 and 15 times as much as that in the hyper-arid regions. We conclude that the semi-arid and dry subhumid regions are two key regions in the models, because they show large biases from the observations.\nKey words: aridity, dryland expansion, climate change, CMIP5",

            "abstract": "A new regional Earth system model of the Arctic, the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), has recently been developed. The initial version of this model includes atmosphere (WRF), ocean (POP), sea ice (CICE), and land (VIC) component models coupled with the NCAR CESM CPL7 coupler. The model is configured to run on a large pan-Arctic domain that includes all sea ice covered waters in the Northern Hemisphere and all Arctic Ocean draining land areas.\nResults from multi-decadal (1979 to present) simulations with RASM will be presented and will focus on the model climate's sensitivity to atmospheric processes and a comparison of the fully coupled model and atmosphere-only simulations. The modeled radiation budget, and sea ice cover, was found to be sensitive to the details of the cloud and radiation parameterizations in the atmospheric component (WRF) of RASM, including details of cloud droplet size. Another model sensitivity was found in relation to atmosphere-land processes. Care is needed to ensure that decoupling between the atmosphere and land do not occur under strongly stable conditions over land areas in winter.\nComparison of RASM near surface climate with that simulated with stand-alone WRF show areas of both improved and degraded results. Improvement in the coupled model climate are related to more physically realistic representation of coupled processes such as energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere through leads in the sea ice during winter. Degraded results come from feedbacks in model component biases, such as atmospheric circulation biases resulting in incorrect local sea ice cover that then result in large local atmospheric temperature biases.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution records of microfossil assemblages from deep-sea sediment cores covering the last 20,000 years in the North Atlantic Ocean were investigated to understand biotic responses to abrupt climate changes over decadal–centennial timescales. The results show pervasive control of deep-sea benthic species diversity by rapidly changing climate. Species diversity rapidly increased during abrupt stadial events during the last deglacial and the Holocene interglacial periods. These included the well-known Heinrich 1, the Younger Dryas, and the 8.2 ka events when the strength of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) decreased. In addition, there is evidence for quasi-cyclic changes in biodiversity at a ~1500-year periodicity. Statistical analyses revealed that AMOC-driven bottom-water-temperature variability is a primary influence on deep-sea biodiversity. Our results may portend pervasive, synchronous and sudden ecosystem responses to human-induced changes to climate and ocean circulation in this century. Exceptionally highly resolved fossil records help us to understand past, present and future ecosystem responses to climate changes by bridging the gap between biological and palaeontological time-scales.",

However, comparative studies of TEC response during geomagnetic disturbances in solar minimum and solar maximum have not been reported yet. Here we present some new results of TEC enhancements during geomagnetic disturbancesin extreme solar maximum and deep solar minimum.\nThe JPL TEC maps from 12/01/2000 to 12/31/2003 during high solar activity and from 01/01/2007 to 12/31/2010 during low solar activity are used. The deviation of TEC is defined as the differences between TEC and TECq, which represents the 27-day sliding smooth median. The geomagnetic disturbances selected have peaks of geomagnetic index Ap>20. We found that the winter anomaly appears in both extreme solar cycle conditions and has longer-lived patterns than other seasons.The nighttime enhancement is more significant in solar maximum than solar minimum. The mean duration of TEC enhancements is longer in solar minimum than solar maximum. The mean delay at the beginning of positive anomaly responds fastest at around 1500 LT and slowest at around midnight during solar minimum.The mean intensity of enhancements is stronger at higher latitudes and weaker at lower latitudes, and the mean delay is smaller at higher latitudes and larger at lower latitudes in both extreme solar cycle conditions.\nAcknowledgments: Thiswork was supportedby the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 41204107.

            "abstract": "Landslide has long been considered as a major geological hazard with great threats to local residents and social economic developments within the Three Gorges area, China. With the regular operation of Three Gorges Dam since 2009, the reservoir water level undergoes an annual cycle from 145 m in early summer to 175 m in early winter caused by storage and discharge operations. Consequently, many ancient landslides were activated by such large variations of water level. One of typical examples is the famous Shuping landslide located in Zigui County.\nTo reduce the risks of landslide collapse, long-term monitoring of ground surface deformation must be carried out. Terrestrial surveillance like GPS and extensometer have been installed at Shuping in 2003. Although these methods can achieve highly accurate displacement measurements, only sparse points can be observed, which is far from the requirement of monitoring vast reservoir area coverage.\nFor such a vast and inaccessible area, D-InSAR and PS-InSAR can measure long-term and continuous displacement trends. Nevertheless, it has been revealed by several studies that InSAR can hardly retrieve accurate deformation signal on fast-moving landslides such as Shuping.\nTherefore, we further investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of pixel offset tracking (POT) method to detect fast-moving with high-resolution SAR data. One of the key points is to estimate displacement at each pixel through subpixel-level SAR image matching. In order to tackle the difficulties of using traditional POT technique, the point-like target offset tracking (PTOT) is developed. By making use of point-like targets with stable backscattering behavior over long time span, PTOT method is can achieve more reliable results with accuracies at 1/20 of SAR pixel resolution. More importantly, PTOT method can measure two-dimensional displacements, i.e. in both azimuth and slant range direction, while InSAR can measure displacement only along the line-of-sight direction. The experiment at Shuping landslide is carried out with TerraSAR-X datasets acquired in both Stripmap (SM) and High-resolution Spotlight (HS) mode. Preliminary results suggest that both SM and HS data can be used to measure the large displacement, while HS data measurements seems more reliable due to higher resolution than SM data.",

Average hypolimnetic temperature remained constant (~15oC), so that the thermal gradient across the metalimnion increased. The average duration of the stratification period (~286 days) remained unchanged. We show that the stratification changes are the result of lake level decrease, a slight increase in air temperature during the spring and summer, and a reduction of inflows to the lake. These changes in time affect the stratification pattern in the same direction, i.e., an increase in the lake epilimnetic temperature and an increase in the thermal gradient across the metalimnion. Analysis of the data indicates that the effect of over pumping, which leads to a reduction in lake level is larger than the effect of changes due to air temperature increase and the reduction in inflow volumes.",

A land–sea index (LSI) wasdefined to measure asymmetric zonal thermal forcing, which determined that it has changed from a negative to positive anomaly since the 1980s. In the positive phase of the LSI, the 500-hpageopotential height decreased in polar regions and increased in the mid-latitudes. The tropospheric planetary wave activity also became stronger and exerted an easterly wind forcing on the westerly wind.These circulation changes were favorable for westerly wind acceleration and the decrease in blocking. In turn, the response of the westerly and blocks could further enhance continental warming, which would strengthen the “cold ocean and warm land (COWL)” pattern. This positive feedback could amplify regional warming in the context of overall global warming.",

            "abstract": "Mocho-Choshuenco (39°55’S 72°2’W) is a poorly studied volcanic complex in southern Chile. Previous work on the volcanic deposits identified three post-glacial (<17 ka) explosive eruptions with volumes ≥1km3. We have re-examined the field stratigraphy and carried out extensive geochemical analyses on the deposits to fingerprint and correlate the deposits to establish a detailed, high-resolution, post-glacial explosive history of the volcano. This new data indicates that there have been four large (volume ≥1km3) explosive eruptions, 12 more minor events from the main edifice, and over 40 minor scoria cone eruptions from the flanks of the volcano. No other volcano in southern Chile is known to have had as many large eruptions in the Holocene, indicating that Mocho-Choshuenco is potentially one of the most hazardous volcanoes in southern Chile.The eruption history of the volcanoes in southern Chile is largely based on field observations. However, tephra deposits are not well preserved in this region, making field mapping difficult and therefore a detailed record of the frequency and magnitude of the Mocho-Choshuenco eruptions is lacking. This work used detailed geochemistry of units within numerous outcrops (ca. 400) both proximally and distally around the volcano to correlate the units and assemble a detailed stratigraphy for the volcano. Since many of the deposits were weathered, and many others were microlite-rich, we could not rely on glass chemistry alone to correlate sequences and hence also used Fe-Ti oxide compositions.\nThis research has generated a large geochemical dataset of the compositions of tephra from the region (>2500 glass and >2800 Fe-Ti oxide analyses), which can now be used to correlate Mocho-Choshuenco tephra layers in the region. Chronological constraints of these units mean that these tephra layers can be used to constrain the eruptive history at other volcanoes in the region. Tephrochronology is also being used to improve the age models of lake cores, which are being used to explore earthquake frequency and the relationship between eruption frequency and climate.",

The deceivingly simple geometry of a surface-mounted obstacle in a boundary layer induces a complex and unsteady flow field that affect the surface drag partitioning and transport of scalars form surrounding evaporating surfaces. The readily observable spatio-temporal distribution of localized evaporation rates from infrared measured thermal signatures provide the impetus for a simple zonation scheme that enables estimates of evaporative fluxes around an obstacle. Results from evaporation experiments from sand surfaces with isolated cylindrical elements (bluff bodies) subjected to constant turbulent airflows were in good agreement with model predictions for localized exchange rates. The results show consistent enhancement of evaporating fluxes relative to a smooth surface to formation of vortices that induce thinner boundary layers. We also considered effects of obstacles on (solar) short wave radiation and energy partitioning over surfaces and successfully represented zonation of surface exchange due to momentum (drag partitioning) and variable surface energy balance on localized evaporation. A scheme for upscaling the results to evaporation from surfaces with multiple obstacles will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Continuum damage mechanics is gaining increasing acceptance as a framework for modeling flow enhancement caused by fractures in glaciers and ice shelves. To date, the temporal evolution of viscous damage has been handled using a transport equation with some kind of source term for damage. A number of empirical formulations for such a source term have been adopted, though no clear physical foundation exists for treating damage using flux terms. Furthermore, it remains to be demonstrated that the parameters of such a source term can be determined from observations. Here, we introduce a new framework for damage evolution that does not require specifying a damage source term and that results in a more intuitive physical interpretation of the coupled evolution of stress and damage. By postulating an explicit rate-weakening flow law above a threshold stress, damage can be calculated analytically from the results of a stress balance computation. A transport equation is still applied to advect damage, but the evolution of damage is explicitly linked to the evolving stress balance. This new damage formulation requires only two new parameters, both of which have clear physical interpretations and can be inferred from observations. Using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), we determine values for both parameters by inverting for damage for the remnant Larsen B ice shelf using a time series of InSAR velocity data covering the years 2000-2010. The inferred patterns of damage and strain rate, in both space and time, are used to quantify the rate-weakening constitutive parameters using nonlinear regression. The resulting damage evolution framework is then applied in perturbation experiments to determine the conditions and timescales under which the remnant Larsen B ice shelf may collapse. We conclude by discussing advantages of this approach to damage evolution and applications to problems in iceberg calving, ice shelf stability, and buttressing at the grounding line.",

            "abstract": "Even under uniform loading conditions, a critical configuration of a deformed body can exist, where homogeneous deformation breaks down into deformation bands. Shear bands, dilation bands, compaction bands, as observed in nature and in laboratory experiments, are examples of such strain localization phenomena.\nIt is commonly observed that strain localization is favored by strain softening and most of the existing theoretical studies focus on pure mechanical reasons for deformation band formation (mechanical softening due to grain and matrix damage and/or pore collapse). The role of chemical reactions (e.g. dissolution, mineral dehydration) has been explored showing that such couplings may play an important role in shear band instabilities and strain localization. Coupling between progressive mechanical damage and dissolution rate of minerals has been considered for chemically induced compaction bands formation. In case of mineral dehydration, the chemical reaction rate depends upon the pore pressure and the temperature. Competing effects of fluid released by the chemical reaction and volume change by dehydration affect the pore pressure and can potentially lead to pore fluid run away.\nMultiphysics couplings play a major role in earthquake nucleation and seismic slip. Earthquake nucleation is commonly modelled as a slip instability along a pre-existing fault or a plate interface. The effect of shear heating and thermal pressurization may be of prime importance in the control of the stability of shear deformation inside the slipping zone. Other mechanisms in relation with thermal decomposition of minerals affect the pore pressure and the temperature evolution of the system, and can play a significant role in the extreme strain localization observed in field. The actual width of the localized zone is a key parameter for understanding fault weakening mechanisms. Thickness and periodicity of localized structures is discussed considering the heterogeneous microstructure of the representative elementary volume and the wave length selection of the instability mode.",

            "abstract": "As permafrost thaws, previously frozen soils may become unstable and subside, in some cases forming thermo-erosional features such as gully thermokarst (GTKs). The formation of these features can result in sediment and nutrient inputs to local streams and lakes. The initial evolution of GTKs is rapid (months to several years) and appears to follow a progression in which the loss of ground ice in the soil creates a subsurface cavity that allows for the transport of water downslope, followed by the collapse of the overlying soil into the cavity, with a subsequent period of sediment and nutrient export. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the length of time these features remain unstable and actively transport sediments and nutrients. We followed the evolution of one moderately-sized (~5,000 m2) GTK located in the headwaters of the Toolik River (N68.692733° W149.205433°) on the North Slope of Alaska (USA). This feature formed in July 2003 and we monitored it for several years thereafter. In 2007 we began to monitor the shape and contours of this feature and quantified the level of ecologically important solutes it exports to the local stream. As expected, large quantities of sediment and nutrients were exported from this feature when it first formed. However, within a year or two the sediment export decreased to episodic events and the nutrient export, while elevated above reference levels, was not remarkably high. Between 2007 and the present (2014), the shape and topography of the feature have changed very little (Figure) except for some headwall retrogression, suggesting that long-term sediment transport has decreased dramatically. Thus, the overall sediment loading to the river was smaller and has decreased more rapidly than we expected. The rapid reduction in sediment and nutrient delivery is consistent with the more recent geomorphic evolution and stabilization of this feature. We conclude – contrary to our initial hypotheses – that these features form and stabilize rather quickly (~10 years) and that their influences on local streams and lakes might be ephemeral. Thus, the greater importance of these features may be as indicators of general permafrost degradation in the area and the attendant losses of carbon and other nutrients that this degradation implies.",

A broad spectrum of the geoscience education community, ~200 educators from research universities/four and two year colleges, focused on preparation of undergraduates for graduate school and future geoscience careers, pedagogy, use of technology, broadening participation/retention of underrepresented groups, and preparation of K-12 science teachers.\nParticipants agreed that key concepts, competencies and skills learned throughout the curriculum were more important than specific courses. Concepts included understanding Earth as complex, dynamic system, deep time, evolution of life, natural resources, energy, hazards, hydrogeology, surface processes, Earth materials and structure, and climate change. Skills/competencies included ability to think spatially and temporally, reason inductively and deductively, make and use indirect observations, engage in complex open, coupled systems thinking, and work with uncertainty, non-uniqueness, and incompleteness, as well as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and ability to think like a scientist and continue to learn. Successful ways of developing these include collaborative, integrative projects involving teams, interdisciplinary projects, fieldwork and research experiences, as well as flipped classrooms and integration and interactive use of technology, including visualization, simulation, modeling and analysis of real data. Wider adoption of proven, effective best practices is our communities’ main pedagogical challenge, and we focused on identifying implementation barriers. Preparation of future teachers in introductory and general geoscience courses by incorporating Next Generation Science Standards and using other sciences/math to solve real world geoscience problems should help increase diversity and number of future geoscientists and geoscience literacy. We also identified key elements of successful programs that attract and retain underrepresented groups, including providing financial support, reaching out to students in their communities, involving community members, incorporating role models, and mentoring.",

            "abstract": "Reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) not only slows climate change, but can also have co-benefits for improved air quality. In this study, we examine the co-benefits of global and regional GHG mitigation on US air quality at fine resolution through dynamical downscaling, using the latest Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We will investigate the co-benefits on US air quality due to domestic GHG mitigation alone, and due to mitigation outside of the US. We also quantity the co-benefits resulting from reductions in co-emitted air pollutants versus slowing climate change and its effects on air quality. Projected climate in the 2050s from the IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios is dynamically downscaled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Anthropogenic emissions projections from the RCP4.5 scenario and its reference (REF), are directly processed in SMOKE to provide temporally- and spatially-resolved CMAQ emission input files. Chemical boundary conditions (BCs) are obtained from West et al. (2013), who studied the co-benefits of global GHG reductions on global air quality and human health.\nOur preliminary results show that the global GHG reduction (RCP4.5 relative to REF) reduces the 1hr daily maximum ozone by 3.3 ppbv annually over entire US, as high as 6 ppbv in September. The west coast of California and the Northeast US are the regions that benefit most. By comparing different scenarios, we find that foreign countries’ GHGs mitigation has a larger influence on the US ozone decreases (accounting for 77% of the total decrease), compared with 23% from domestic GHG mitigation only, highlighting the importance of methane reductions and the intercontinental transport of air pollutants. The reduction of global co-emitted air pollutants has a more pronounced effect on ozone decreasing, relative to the effect from slowing climate and its effects on air quality. We also plan to report co-benefits for PM2.5 in the US.",

            "abstract": "Primary frequency standards that realize the definition of the second based on the Caesium (Cs) atom are used to steer International Atomic Time. According to the theory of relativity, their frequency should be adjusted to that at which these would operate, if located on the geoid. Current best standards for the current definition of the second are approaching uncertainties of one part in 1016. Optical frequency standards however are now reaching uncertainties of few parts in 1018 and are expected to lead to a new definition of the second. Their performance requires centimetre-level geoid accuracy, in order to calculate accurately the redshift frequency offset necessary for their inter-comparison.\nWe re-evaluated the relativistic redshift of the frequency standards at NIST in Boulder, Colorado, USA, based on a recent precise GPS survey of several benchmarks on the roof of the building where these are housed, and on global and local geoid models supported by data from the GRACE and GOCE missions, including EGM2008, USGG2009, and USGG2012. We also evaluated the redshift offset based on the published NAVD88 geopotential number of the levelling benchmark Q407, after estimating the bias of the NAVD88 datum at our specific location. We present and discuss the results that we obtained using different methods, and provide our current estimate of the redshift offset and of its accuracy, considering the main error sources contributing to the total error budget. We compare our current estimates to those published by Pavlis and Weiss in 2003, using the data and models that were available at that time. We also discuss the prospects of using inter-connected ultra-precise frequency standards for the direct determination of geoid height differences, which may provide in the not-too-distant future an alternative approach for the establishment of vertical datums and the independent verification of the accuracy of global and local geoid models.",

            "abstract": "Time-series records of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal fluid properties and flow rates have the potential to help constrain the hydrogeology, subsurface circulation patterns, heat, mass, and chemical fluxes, and habitat conditions within young oceanic crust. This potential has motivated a concerted international effort to acquire such records from a variety of geologically distinct vent fields at numerous locations along the mid-ocean ridge system. However up until now, the global database has not been systematically explored. These records have only been analyzed in a piecemeal fashion, which is problematic because hydrothermal time-series records from individual sites typically exhibit enigmatic modes of episodic and periodic variability that are difficult to interpret in isolation. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the extant set of hydrothermal time-series records from several mid-ocean ridge sites where observatory-style experiments have been conducted (including, LSHF, TAG, EPR 9°50’N and MEF).\nWe show that most temperature records, regardless of location or geological setting, display systematic tide-related variability, with the strongest signal at the principal semidiurnal tidal periods (M2, S2, N2 and K2). Cross-spectral multi-taper methods applied to the temperature and bottom pressure records reveal robust phase relationships, particularly for the high-temperature, black-smoker records, as predicted by poroelastic theory. These results suggest that tidal pressures diffusely propagate through the formation, perturbing fluid velocities and temperatures, resulting in phase lags between the seafloor loading and the exit-fluid temperatures. Here, we use multi-layer analytical and numerical models to constrain the subseafloor permeability, skin depth, and Darcy velocities required to explain the phase lag observations.",

This indicates a gradient in nitrogen metabolisms from quantitative nitrification, partial denitrification, and assimilation of the residual NO3- onshore (with most δ15N values greater than 2‰), to nitrogen fixation offshore (δ15N values less than 2‰). Here we present nitrogen isotope data from the roughly contemporaneous Bangemall Group in northwestern Australia and the Roper Group in northern Australia, both showing an average ~1‰ enrichment from deep to shallow facies. A maximum range from 0.9‰ (deep) to 5.8‰ (shallow) and 1.4‰ (deep) to 4.8‰ (shallow) is observed in the Bangemall and Roper Groups respectively. Viewed together with the maximum 7‰ basinal trend of the Belt Supergroup, these results suggest (a) that bioavailable nitrate limitation offshore may have been widespread in the Mesoproterozoic, and (b) that there was significant variability between basins in the degree of onshore-offshore nitrogen speciation. Prolonged nitrate limitation in offshore environments may have globally prevented the radiation of eukaryotes into deeper waters. Differences between the isotope profiles of the Belt Supergroup and the Bangemall Group may be attributed to varying degrees of restriction of each basin to the ocean.",

We present new high-resolution 87Sr/86Sr data from the upper Wilkins Peak Member, to investigate linkages between astronomical forcing, water sources, and lake level in a classic rhythmic succession. Fifty-one 87Sr/86Sr ratios from White Mountain core #1 were acquired with a sampling interval of ~30 cm starting from the top of alluvial “I” bed to the lower Laney Member. The 87Sr/86Sr data show a strong and significant negative correlation with oil-yield, a traditional proxy for paleolake level and organic productivity. Application of a radioisotopic time scale, using previously dated ash beds, reveals that both 87Sr/86Sr and oil yield have a strong 20 kyr rhythm. The 87Sr/86Sr data more clearly express a longer period 100 kyr signal, similar to the Laskar 10D eccentricity solution. Using our nominal radioisotopic time scale, the Laskar 10D solution and 87Sr/86Sr data suggest that highest lake levels and greatest organic enrichment are attained during greatest precession and eccentricity.\nRegional geologic studies and modern river water analyses have shown that less radiogenic waters mostly originate west of the basin, where drainage is strongly influenced by thick Paleozoic and Mesozoic marine carbonate units. Decreased in 87Sr/86Sr therefore imply greater relative water contributions from the Sevier orogenic highlands, relative to lower relief, more radiogenic ranges lying to the east. We therefore propose that highstands of Lake Gosiute record increased penetration of Pacific moisture, related either to increased El Niño frequency or southward displacement of major storm tracks. We hypothesize that the occurrence of wetter winters caused expansion of Lake Gosiute, deposition of organic carbon rich facies, and decreased lake water 87Sr/86Sr.",

            "abstract": "Specular meteor radars (SMR) are a wide spread and established method to investigate mesospheric/ lower thermospheric (MLT) dynamics. Since 2002 the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) conducts observations of meteor echoes in a fixed, stable configuration. Here we present measurements of the meteor peak flux altitude (MPFA) spanning one solar cycle at an altitude of 91 km. The MPFA is converted into neutral air density variations using a single body meteor ablation model and a NRLMSIS background atmosphere. We were able to separate the long term trend from the solar cycle effect assuming a linear trend and a sinusoidal solar cycle effect. The neutral air density shows a solar cycle signature of 2.4 +/-0.7% for solar cycle 23/24. The long term trend indicates a decreasing neutral air density of 5.8+/-1.1% per decade, which is in reasonable agreement to the model results of Akmaev et al., 2006. They predicted a decrease of neutral air density for the MLT in the order of 5-6% per decade due to greenhouse gas cooling.",

            "abstract": "Globally reservoir operations provide fundamental services to water supply, energy generation, recreation, and ecosystems. The pressures of expanding populations, climate change, and increased energy demands are motivating a significant investment in re-operationalizing existing reservoirs or defining operations for new reservoirs. Recent work has highlighted the potential benefits of exploiting recent advances in many-objective optimization and direct policy search (DPS) to aid in addressing these systems’ multi-sector demand tradeoffs. This study contributes to a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEAs) efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and controllability when supporting DPS for the Conowingo dam in the Lower Susquehanna River Basin. The Lower Susquehanna River is an interstate water body that has been subject to intensive water management efforts due to the system’s competing demands from urban water supply, atomic power plant cooling, hydropower production, and federally regulated environmental flows. Seven benchmark and state-of–the-art MOEAs are tested on deterministic and stochastic instances of the Susquehanna test case. In the deterministic formulation, the operating objectives are evaluated over the historical realization of the hydroclimatic variables (i.e., inflows and evaporation rates). In the stochastic formulation, the same objectives are instead evaluated over an ensemble of stochastic inflows and evaporation rates realizations. The algorithms are evaluated in their ability to support DPS in discovering reservoir operations that compose the tradeoffs for six multi-sector performance objectives with thirty-two decision variables. Our diagnostic results highlight that many-objective DPS is very challenging for modern MOEAs and that epsilon dominance is critical for attaining high levels of performance. Epsilon dominance algorithms epsilon-MOEA, epsilon-NSGAII and the auto adaptive Borg MOEA, are statistically superior for the six-objective Susquehanna instance of this important class of problems. Additionally, shifting from deterministic history-based DPS to stochastic DPS significantly increases the difficulty of the problem.",

            "abstract": "The complex pattern of deformation of internal layers often observed in radar profiles of ice streams results from the convolution of several processes. Layers can be deformed locally by abrupt changes in basal conditions or high strain rates, or folds may be created elsewhere and advected from long distances up-flow. For example, folds may be formed as ice transits a shear-margin or a tributary where rapid changes in basal shear stress and strain rates are likely. These may relax over time once the ice has entered streaming flow. Conversely, under sufficiently high strain rates, shear zones or recumbent folds may develop that can permanently disrupt or distort internal layer geometry. Interpretations of internal layer folding often draw upon these end-member processes, but the actual strain pattern recorded in the ice is the result of a complex deformation history, which, if properly decoded, offers a wealth of information about past ice-flow and basal conditions.\nHere we use folds recorded in radar data collected on Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica and InSAR-derived ice-surface velocity to diagnose the causes of internal layer disruption seen in the vicinity of Subglacial Lake Whillans. We distinguish three distinct patterns of deformation of the internal stratigraphy in the radar profiles from this location: (1) smooth, continuous, and nearly flat layers; (2) layers with disrupted stratigraphy and large amplitude folds; and (3) disturbed internal stratigraphy with no coherent internal reflecting horizons. From the ice-surface velocity data, we trace flowlines from these three zones to different source areas of the ice stream (figure), indicating ice passage through three different deformation histories. We further calculate the total accumulated strain along these flowlines and compare it to the radar-depicted folding. Our results highlight the need to consider the entire flow history of the ice when inferring past ice-flow or basal conditions from internal layers. Furthermore, they indicate that inclusion of internal layer tracing and deformation algorithms into full-stress ice-sheet models should be prioritized, as internal layers offer perhaps the most detailed and spatially ubiquitous validation dataset for understanding the past state of ice sheets and their reaction to climate forcings.",

            "abstract": "The sensitivity of smectite to temperature changes in shallow fault systems can provide information about the heating history of a fault during seismogenic slip or creep. Pelagic-sourced smectite is the most abundant clay mineral that is incorporated into the slip zone drilled during JFAST (Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project) Expedition 343 in the Japan Trench, located at ~820 mbsf. Chemical compositions analyzed by ICP-OES show a significant amount of Fe, and lesser Mg and K in these smectite minerals that are pelagic in origin. In order to investigate the significance of smectite during recently proposed high frictional heat associated with the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011, mineral transformations in JFAST drill core samples are examined during fast (5 minutes) and slow (5 hours) heating sequences. For both series, eight measurement-sets were analyzed, taken at 25° C pre-heating, increasing maximum temperatures in the range 50-220° C, and 25° C post-heating, using a real-time heating stage that is connected to an x-ray diffractometer. We observe that (i) both slow and fast heating causes reduction of water interlayers in smectite between 50-200°C, with a delay of water-release during quick heating at temperatures up to 150° C, (ii) smectite recovers more quickly to the original hydration state after fast heating than slow heating between 50-150°C, and (iii) non-recoverable collapse of all smectite occurs at ~200°C, for fast and slow heating, respectively. Based on these results, we conclude that distributed frictional heating of the Tohoku fault zone cannot have exceed a temperature of ~200° C, because smectitic clays are widely present in these fault rocks. Their occurrence indicates that shear heating at the sampled site of the Tohoku earthquake was relatively low, or restricted to an extremely narrow zone.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost degradation is associated with an aggradation of the active layer thus exposing previously frozen soil carbon (C) to microbial activity. This may increase the generation of greenhouse gases and potentially increase rates of climate change. However, the rate of C release remains highly uncertain, not least because few in situ studies have measured the rate at which previously frozen C is released from the soil surface, post thaw. We quantified the contribution of this “old” C being released as CO2 from permafrost degraded soils in sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada. Firstly, we studied the effect of fire on black spruce forests as the removal of vegetation, especially mosses, may play a key role on thaw depth. Secondly, we investigated the collapse of peatland plateau after permafrost thaw which resulted in the formation of wetlands. We combined radiocarbon measurements of respired CO2 with a novel collar-design that either included or excluded CO2 released from deeper soil horizons. Our results show that, while excluding deeper layers did reduce the average age of the C being released from the soil surface, more than 90% of the CO2 came from contemporary sources, even after burnt and permafrost plateau collapse. Furthermore, soil cores dated using 210Pb show that the rapid accumulation of sedge peat after plateau collapse may more than compensate for any C losses from depth. Our results from the Canadian boreal contrast strongly with findings from other geographical areas emphasising the complexities of predicting the impact of permafrost thaw on the carbon balance of northern ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Stromatolites are layered structures that form subaqueously, thereby recording chemical information about their formation environment. As such, these accretionary structures are useful tools for fine-timescale environmental reconstructions. High-resolution geochemical analyses of stromatolites that formed in paleolake Gosiute (Eocene Green River Formation) provided novel information about terrestrial environmental variability during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), the period with the highest temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels in the Cenozoic. Stromatolites from the ~51 Ma Rife Bed of the Tipton Shale Member of the Green River Formation record dramatic changes in lake volume (and correspondingly, water depth and shoreline) indicating the environment during the peak of the EECO was more variable than previously appreciated. A second set of stromatolites from the ~49 Ma Lower Laclede Bed of the Laney Member of the Green River Formation record transient periods of basin closure during a time when the basin is generally considered to have been balanced-filled. In addition, the results reveal that basin filling after desiccation was not continuous, but fluctuated before becoming an open system, further indicating local climate variability during the EECO. In both cases, major environmental changes are reflected not only in the recorded chemistry, but also in changes in stromatolite microfabric. In addition, clumped isotope paleothermometry provided estimates of water temperature from the evolving lake, which for most of its existence was so massive that it would have influenced regional climate. These and other studies demonstrate that stromatolite laminae can be used to understand fine-scale environmental variability in ancient lacustrine systems.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane Manuel affected the Pacific coast of Mexico on September 15 and 16, 2013 causing heavy rainfall of about 240 mm in a 24 hour period in the area of the Volcanic Complex (VC). Heavy rainfall led to the beginning of a significant flow of mud and rocks draining from the Atenquique Creek, located on the eastern slope of the VC in a west east direction. The result of this flow was the heavy damage sustained by the local paper plant located next to the town of Atenquique in the distal part of the basin where the stream is gathered by the Tuxpan River. Damages totaling over 15 million dollars affected a large part in their recycled fibers factory, resulting in an 18-month full stoppage of the factory. This in turn caused a heavy setback of the economy located within a large region of the southern state of Jalisco.\nOnce again on November 25, debris flow occurred only at a lower volume than the September rains, without causing any damage. Both flows contained a viscous and solid liquid flow that left deposits of silt-sandy clasts and other abundant materials of reverse gradation. The first flow reached a thickness of 4.5 m in the Tuxpan riverbed over a length of about 15 km, while the November flow left behind 1.3 m of fine materials and few clasts.\nThe Atenquique ravine historically has had debris flow caused by heavy rainfall from hurricanes. On October 1955 debris flow claimed many deaths and heavy damage to the town and local paper mill. These flows are generated in the summer and they are associated to several factors such as weather, steep slopes, unstable volcanic strata, these elements add an important environmental history in the area, as is the use of continuous deforestation. The current land use has resulted in a positive change from forest to intensive agriculture; but having constant wildfires on the high slopes of the VC and the combination of many other factors such as changes on the soil of the slopes and movement of geological material “scarps and talweg” are highly vulnerable to fluid overloads causing removal and soil movement.\nOngoing Civil Protection Unit helicopter flights from the state government of Jalisco help us observe the activity of the Colima volcano. We have monitored the presence of abundant unconsolidated material in the slopes of the basin, this creates a continuous hazard of debris flow similar to those of 1955 and 2013.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of the heat and volume flux of diffuse venting at mid-ocean ridge-hosted hydrothermal fields suggest that integrated diffuse fluxes can be up to 10 times the total flux due to focused, high-temperature venting. However, calculated fluxes often have uncertainties on the order of the values themselves. Previous methods to measure heat flux has generally involved either direct point measurements at the site of venting using invasive flow collectors, or indirect methods that measure fluid properties (e.g. temperature) in the effluent plume. To improve our ability to accurately measure time-series of diffuse flow, we developed a new, deep-sea camera and temperature measurement system, the Diffuse Effluent Measurement System (DEMS). The DEMS captures co-registered images and temperatures of diffuse effluent rising between a high-resolution camera and an illuminated, random dot pattern designed for calculating velocities using Diffuse Fluid Velocimetry (DFV; Mittelstaedt et al., 2010). DFV is a cross correlation technique that tracks moving index of refraction anomalies (hot parcels of fluid) through time. During the 2014 AT26-17 cruise, the DEMS was deployed with Alvin above a fracture network at the Phoenix Vent within the ASHES vent field (Axial Seamount, 1543 mbsl). The system was designed to collect 24 seconds of imagery at 20 Hz and temperatures at 1 Hz each hour over the period between July 22 and August 2nd. To assess both diffuse and focused flow at the Phoenix Vent Site, the DEMS was deployed in conjunction with a second camera system, the VentCam, which measures the volume flux of focused vents and collected imagery at overlapping time intervals. Here, we present a basic technical description of the DEMS and the preliminary observations of diffuse heat and volume flux observed at the Phoenix Vent.",

            "abstract": "The brevity of the instrumental record and lack of detailed historical accounts is a limiting factor in our understanding of the relationship between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme storm events. This study applied paleotempestologic and hydrographic methods to identify the mechanisms of storm-induced coarse grain deposition and reconstruct a late Holocene storm record within Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. Three sediment cores (6.0 m, 8.4 m, and 8.2 m) were collected in 3 m of water using a vibracore system. Grain sizes were measured along core to identify coarse grain anomalies that serve as a proxy for past storm events. An historical age model (1620-2011 AD) was developed based on Pb pollution chronomarkers derived from X-Ray Florescence bulk Pb data, equating to a sedimentation rate of 8-8.3 mm/yr (R2 = 0.99). A long-term (4000 to 275 years before present) sedimentation rate of 1.1-1.4 mm/yr (R2 = 0.89) was calculated based on twenty-four continuous flow atomic mass spectrometry 14C ages of marine bivalves. To determine hydrographic conditions within the embayment during storm events current meters and tide gauges were deployed during Hurricane Irene (2011) which measured a storm surge of 88 cm above mean sea level. The buildup of storm water against the landward shoreline resulted in a measured 10 cm/s seaward moving bottom current capable of transporting coarse sand eroded from the adjacent shoreface into the coring site. Modeled surges for eleven modern and historic storm events ranged in height from 0.37 m (2011) to 3.72 m (1635) above mean high water. The WAQ1, WAQ2, and WAQ3 cores recorded a total of 89, 139, and 137 positive anomalies that exceeded the lower threshold and 15, 34, and 12 that exceeded the upper threshold respectively. Events recorded during the historic period coincide with documented storm events. The mean frequency within the three cores applying the lower threshold was 2.6 events per century, while applying the upper threshold was 0.44 events per century. The study has identified a previously understudied transport mechanism for the formation of storm-induced coarse grain horizons and highlighted some of the challenges to utilizing shallow water embayments as sites for storm reconstructions.",

The strong interplanetary magnetic fields at 0.3 to 0.5 AU result in low Alfven Mach numbers, weak bow shocks and low plasma β magnetosheaths at Mercury. These conditions support the development of strong plasma depletion layers adjacent to the magnetopause and intense magnetopause reconnection. MESSENGER observations indicate that reconnection occurs for all non-zero shear angles across the magnetopause with magnetosheat β being the primary factor controlling its rate. Flux transfer events (FTEs) with ~ 1-2 s durations and flux rope topology are observed during nearlly all magnetopause crossings. In contrast with the Earth where FTEs are typically observed every ~ 8 min, FTE ecounters at Mercury are separated on average by only ~ 10 s. At lower altitudes near the cusp MESSENGER observes ~1-2-s-long strong decreases in mgnetic field intensity that are termed cusp plasma filaments. These filaments are beleived to be formed by the inflow of magnetosheath plasma associated with flux transfer events. Mercury's magnetotail exhibits magnetic flux loading/unloading events similar to those observed at Earth during substorms. The Dungey cycle durations and lobe flux loading amplitudes are ~ 2 – 3 min and ~ 30 to 50% at Mercury as compared to ~ 1 - 2 hr and ~ 10 to 25% at Earth. However, FTEs at Earth account for only a few per cent of the magnetic flux carried by the Dungey cycle, while the contribution of FTEs at Mercury is estimated to be ~ 30 to 50%. Mercury also differs from Earth in that it lacks an ionosphere, but possesses a large, highly conducting iron core. The strong IMF and lack of an ionosphere results in a relatively large dawn-to-dusk cross-magnetosphere potential drop of ~ 30 kV at Mercury. Inductive coupling between Mercury's magnetosphere and its large iron core stiffens the dayside magnetosphere against compression by the strong solar wind pressure increases that accompay coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams. The effect of this inductive coupling on FTEs and other aspects of magnetospheric dynamics remains to be determined.",

            "abstract": "The Dhofar mountain range in southern Oman divides the semi-arid coastal plain to the South from the arid desert region to the North of the mountain range. The demand for fresh water in the region is almost exclusively covered by groundwater. Possible sources for groundwater recharge in Dhofar are the monsoon season – which is unique for the Arabian Peninsula - and rare storm events reoccuring infrequently every 3 to 7 years. The present study focuses on the recharge potential of the monsoon and the role of the Dhofar cloud forest. The monsoon with its orographic rainfall distribution is the most reliable source of precipitation for the Dhofar area, but is limited to the south side of the mountains. Every year between June and September light rain and fog is brought to the area, yielding mean rainfall values of 104 mm per year in the plain and 299 mm per year at high elevations. This results in higher spring discharge at the foot of the mountains and subsurface recharge into the coastal plain. Results from previous ecohydrological studies on the Dhofar cloud forest hydrology suggest that the recharge potential in forested regions is substantially higher than from other land cover in the region. Reasons for this lie in the ability of forested regions to capture cloud water or fog and the interception processes, specifically stemflow, that channel substantial amounts of water directly into deeper soil layers. In short, the cloud forest land cover receives fog water in addition to rainfall and the interception processes result in preferential pathways below the forest. The different recharge potential of cloud forest areas versus a classic distributed infiltration pattern caused by regular rainfall as well as the spatial distribution of the cloud forest has been used to formulate different recharge scenarios. A groundwater flow model was developed reproducing the north-to south gradient and the observed heads and outflows at the foot of the mountain. Different recharge scenarios were used to run the flow model with the aim to assess the effect of major land cover changes in the recharge zone of the Salalah coastal plain. Currently the cloud forests are under pressure from deforestation by livestock. To what extent de- or even re-forestation will affect groundwater resources in the Salalah coastal plain will be assessed through the study.",

            "abstract": "A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) tends to have stronger cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the eastern Indian Ocean with greater impacts than warm SSTAs that occur during its negative phase. These impacts from positive IODs range from drought over Australia and Indonesia, to flooding over East Africa and India. Two feedbacks have been suggested as the cause of positive IOD skewness, a positive Bjerknes feedback and a negative SST-cloud-radiation (SCR) feedback, but their relative importance is debated. Using models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and inter-model statistics, we show that the most important process for IOD skewness is an asymmetry in the thermocline feedback, whereby SSTAs respond to thermocline depth anomalies more strongly during the positive phase than negative phase. This asymmetric thermocline feedback drives IOD skewness despite positive IODs receiving greater damping from the SCR feedback. In response to global warming, although the thermocline feedback strengthens, its asymmetry between positive and negative IODs weakens. This behaviour change explains the reduction in IOD skewness that many models display under global warming.",

FORWARD may be used both to synthesize a broad range of coronal observables, and to access and compare to existing data. FORWARD works with numerical model datacubes, interfaces with the web-served Predictive Science Inc MAS simulation datacubes and the Solar Soft IDL Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) package, and also includes several analytic models (more can be added). It connects to the Virtual Solar Observatory and other web-served observations to download data in a format directly comparable to model predictions. It utilizes the CHIANTI database in modeling UV/EUV lines, and links to the CLE polarimetry synthesis code for forbidden coronal lines. FORWARD enables \"forward-fitting\" of specific observations, and helps to build intuition into how the physical properties of coronal magnetic structures translate to observable properties.",

            "abstract": "Paleoecological reconstructions and land-surface ecosystem models assume that as atmospheric CO2 changes, photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination and the ratio of leaf internal to ambient CO2 concentration (ci/ca) remains unchanged, but this assumption has rarely been tested. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to rise to at least 600ppm by the end of the 21st century, with global temperatures and precipitation regimes concurrently changing and interacting to influence plant photosynthetic gas exchange. In the PHACE (Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment) experiment, we examined the influence of elevated CO2, warming, and summer irrigation on carbon isotope discrimination among C3 and C4 graminoid and dicot species to understand species and ecosystem responses to over 7 years of experimental climate change. Carbon isotope discrimination increased for all species when exposed to elevated CO2, but this effect did not emerge until the third year of the experiment. In addition, though species inherently differed in their carbon isotope discrimination, their ranking remained stable under elevated CO2. Quantifying the relative importance of factors that influence plant carbon isotope discrimination can guide our understanding of how individual plant species, plant communities, and ecosystems may react to global change. Evidence that plant carbon isotope discrimination shifts with changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature has important implications for interpretation of the paleo record from archival organic materials and for modeling carbon cycling processes in future environments.",
